1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,090
- [Woman] This is quite the project.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,300
- I was wrong!

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,900
- I'm just sitting here smiling.

4
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:07,840
- A ice cream cone.

5
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:12,330
- Woo!

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,410
- One more visitor coming
to stay with us tonight.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,060
- What's waiting for us in the house.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,840
- Good morning.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,700
The best news of my morning today

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,430
is that I miss the sunrise.

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,370
Our kids have been waking
up so early this whole trip.

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,540
And Laura came in this
morning and she's like,

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,560
the sun's already up.

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,030
And Jeremy and I are like, yes! Thank you.

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,060
When I was at Trader Joe's I saw these.

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,320
They're called scallion pancakes.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,470
You're supposed to flip
these halfway through.

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,560
They smell so good.

19
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,520
And then they said to squeeze them.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,973
He caught me.

21
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,110
I'm taste testing the cinnamon toast.

22
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:00,056
- [Man] Yummy.

23
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:01,058
- So good.

24
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:02,058
- It's good.

25
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,279
- (babbling)

26
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:05,645
- Nanae's a fan.

27
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:06,760
- [Man] What do you think Caleb?

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,763
- Not my favorite.

29
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:08,763
- [Man] Not your favorite?

30
00:01:08,763 --> 00:01:09,760
- Yummy.

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
- Yummy.

32
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
- [Man] You like it?

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
- I like it.

34
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,370
- [Man] You're hanging out
while they're doing yoga?

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,370
- Let's try balancing lower. Like this.

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,400
- Well it looks beautiful out here.

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,870
The neighbor's are doing their roof,

38
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,071
so it's been a little bit
loud with construction.

39
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:50,562
- Yay you like out tree?

40
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:51,395
Waahh.

41
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,122
(upbeat music)

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,990
- [Man] Elise, what you doing?

43
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,966
- I'm writing a note to
one of my best friends.

44
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,690
- [Man] So the other day the
kids picked out postcards

45
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,381
and they are writing
letters to their friends.

46
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,302
Oh, who's this one to?

47
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:22,763
- Lydia.

48
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:23,904
- [Man] You gonna tell
her how much you love her

49
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:24,905
and miss her?

50
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:25,903
- Yeah.

51
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:26,904
- [Man] Is that to Luke?

52
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:27,737
- Mhm.

53
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,372
- I'm gonna do another one.

54
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:33,365
- [Woman] Who do you
wanna write to this time?

55
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:34,198
- Um, Michael.

56
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:37,470
- Now I need to know that
we're at Coronado island

57
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,554
so I wanna give him this one.

58
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:40,804
- [Woman] Okay.

59
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:45,332
(upbeat music)

60
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,710
- Dad would you like a ice cream cone?

61
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,150
- [Man] Why thank you.

62
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,150
- On a hot day?

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,151
- [Man] What flavor is it?

64
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,176
- Chocolate.

65
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,987
- [Man] Yummy.

66
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:00,090
- I'm gonna go ask mom.

67
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,508
- [Woman] So check out
these seashells I found.

68
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:04,210
- They almost look like a butterfly.

69
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,818
- Yeah they do. They're still
connected to each other.

70
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,060
Look, I love how shiny they are inside.

71
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,110
- I actually found a broken one of those.

72
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,750
- Yeah, it's hard to find them together.

73
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,280
- I love hunting for seashells.

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,570
It's probably my favorite
thing to do at the beach.

75
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,720
Jeremy's joining in the fun.

76
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,320
That's when you know
it's gonna get serious.

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,298
- I'll get you some water after I'm done

78
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:24,215
building my sandcastle.

79
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,240
- [Woman] She's trying.

80
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,630
Yeah you're doing a great job.

81
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,220
Didn't work?

82
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,240
We'll teach you how to do it.

83
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,730
Watch dad. You gotta pack it in real good.

84
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:40,290
- Yes! My first sandcastle.

85
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,250
- [Woman] It is awesome!

86
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,940
You got it, dude.

87
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,160
Oh, that looks yummy.

88
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,350
- Yay!

89
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,020
- [Woman] You did it.

90
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,146
Oh, are you making a mote around it?

91
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:57,313
You did it, nice work dude.

92
00:03:57,313 --> 00:04:00,759
- Okay I'm gonna find a seashell.

93
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,344
- I'm getting dirt over
here but I'm also gonna make

94
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:04,538
shark indentation.

95
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:05,371
- [Woman] Shark.

96
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:08,330
- Gotta show the kids that you
can do art out of digging too

97
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,835
- [Woman] Ah.

98
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,990
Janae is so content at the beach.

99
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,530
She just its here and touches the sand

100
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,120
and tries to shovel.

101
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,790
Oh that was good!

102
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,280
She gets the idea.

103
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,660
Nanae's on the move.

104
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,534
What did you find?

105
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,869
- Seashell!

106
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,119
- [Woman] Found a seashell.

107
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,910
You're pushing real hard, I can tell.

108
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:37,076
(gasps)

109
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,879
(screeches)

110
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,800
Is this your secret?

111
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
- You gotta add water appropriately.

112
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,163
- Yay!

113
00:04:44,163 --> 00:04:44,996
Oh.

114
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:46,440
- [Woman] You just need more.

115
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,343
You just need more,
guys, run run, get more.

116
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,176
- Woo!

117
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:53,435
- You did it!

118
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:55,587
- That was amazing. I
didn't think it would work.

119
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,672
- [Woman] Feeling pretty triumphant?

120
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,886
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

121
00:04:57,886 --> 00:05:00,487
- Apparently Janae is
known as the destroyer.

122
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,880
Yay!

123
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,280
Janae's getting more and more brave,

124
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,240
adventuring further and further.

125
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,110
Jeremy's recruited all of the children.

126
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,140
They're all helping.

127
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,970
We're not professionals.

128
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,730
Apparently there's an actually
sandcastle building contest

129
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,900
here in San Diego.

130
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:17,589
- Oh that was terrible.

131
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:18,560
- [Woman] And we're not part of it.

132
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,393
- Yeah.

133
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,740
- [Woman] They're getting water.

134
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,450
So we're in La Hoya today,
which is the same place

135
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,990
where we saw the seals in
the sea lions recently.

136
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,560
So if you haven't seen that vlog,

137
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,360
it happened just over here.

138
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,670
See where the land goes
out that direction?

139
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,920
That's the little seal rock.

140
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,080
And we're up on La Hoya shores.

141
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,920
I'm really enjoying being
in a place long enough

142
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,600
to kind of get to know the general area.

143
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,240
Like the names of all the different cities

144
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,030
and the beaches and
kind of the coast line.

145
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,030
It's just fun to me.

146
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:01,751
- Hi dad.

147
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:02,584
- Caleb.

148
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:03,850
- [Woman] He's got some
serious sand going on.

149
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,237
- Everyone's gonna bury me.

150
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:09,180
- Her head is gonna stay like that.

151
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,660
And we're gonna bury in the rest of her,

152
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,380
so come get her feet buried in.

153
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,420
- [Woman] Teamwork,
they are burying Elise.

154
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,370
- Push it in.

155
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,703
- [Woman] Elise!

156
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:22,843
- Don't step on her.

157
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:24,159
- Look at her!

158
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,708
(laughing)

159
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,708
- I'm gonna get Elise buried completely.

160
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:32,290
- [Man] I think she's a little nervous.

161
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,390
- [Woman] She does not know what to think.

162
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,080
What is this?

163
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:42,490
You ready to get out of there?

164
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,704
- No.

165
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:44,704
- [Woman] Is it comfy?

166
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,537
- Yeah.

167
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:46,740
- [Man] All right Elise
is ready to emerge.

168
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,279
- She emerged from the dead!

169
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,446
- She's alive.

170
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,138
- [Man] Maybe go clean off in the ocean.

171
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:56,971
- Yeah.

172
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,590
- This little girl loves the water.

173
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:03,135
- [Man] Put me down.

174
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:03,968
- Woo!

175
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,920
So I didn't put her in
her swimsuit this time,

176
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,610
cause I didn't think she'd get wet.

177
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,443
Mom fail.

178
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:17,654
You see that happy face?

179
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:20,336
Woo!

180
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Jeremy and the big kids are
headed out to the water.

181
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,340
The water is so cold.

182
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,690
That seagull is on our
blanket looking for goodies.

183
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,660
This is quite the beautiful hole.

184
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,590
I like how you can see
all the different layers

185
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,670
of the sand.

186
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,530
- I'm gonna make it as tall as you.

187
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,860
Maybe deeper.

188
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,846
- [Woman] You think you can do that?

189
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,587
- I thought I was gonna hit cone.

190
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,450
- [Woman] Nope, we are at the beach.

191
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,000
You can just keep digging.

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,070
- Forever?

193
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,810
- [Woman] Well let's
see how far you can go.

194
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:00,630
Oh that's a pretty rock.

195
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,630
So these kids have been
working on a big project.

196
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,280
They're building a tunnel.

197
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,580
So it goes down,

198
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,536
and it actually goes through.

199
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:11,369
- Hi!

200
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,720
- [Woman] This is quite the project.

201
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,272
So are you guys just making it deeper now?

202
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:19,740
We wanna try and get it where
a person could go through it.

203
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,560
We might run out of sunshine.

204
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,720
- While we're here, Isaac and Elise and I

205
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,880
are going for a run.

206
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,910
The big kids and I ran
down to the pier and back.

207
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,760
That was a good run.

208
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,280
Unfortunately, the day
is coming to an end soon.

209
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,489
Okay, there we go.

210
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,205
All right, they wanna show
you how the tunnel goes

211
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:39,692
all the way through. Hi Caleb.

212
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:43,530
That's quite the tunnel. Good work.

213
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,720
I think I'm gonna go rinse off.

214
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,610
You are covered in sand.

215
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,800
- Yeah, it's like in my fingernails.

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,005
- [Woman] It's in your beard.

217
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:52,014
- Yeah.

218
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:53,480
- [Woman] Well we are getting
a little bit tired out.

219
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,170
I know. Too much beach.
You ready to go home?

220
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,480
Well we are covered in sand,

221
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,010
and headed home to take showers.

222
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,180
And we have one more visitor
coming to stay with us tonight.

223
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,065
- Move out. Hut two three four.

224
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:08,270
Hut two three four.

225
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,670
- Using baby powder to clean
off the sand totally works.

226
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,830
I just used it on Janae,

227
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,160
and I put her into her car
seat all like silky smooth

228
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,460
and I just used it on my feet.

229
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,020
- I've been mocking Kendra, so.

230
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,300
- [Woman] He has, he's been mocking me.

231
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,133
- I'll give it a try. Let's see.

232
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,590
- [Woman] Oh wow.

233
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,620
You're gonna be really smooth.

234
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,570
You don't need quite that much.

235
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,403
Okay good job.

236
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,970
How's that feel?

237
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,390
- Oh, some of it's coming off.

238
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,290
- [Woman] Smooth?

239
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,500
- Its better.

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,020
- [Woman] Thank you for the tip.

241
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,200
- Well I have to admit,
my feet feel way better

242
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,630
the the baby powder. So I was wrong.

243
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,316
You were right, Kendra.

244
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,149
- Thank you.

245
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,660
- I was wrong.

246
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,260
- I'm just sitting here smiling.

247
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,500
- So we're taking the scenic drive home.

248
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,740
Partially because it's rush hour,

249
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,770
and the freeway would be busy,

250
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,720
but also because Jeremy and I both love

251
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,250
finding new ways to get places.

252
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,387
- Like look at that house.

253
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,220
- Look at that view.

254
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,840
We love exploring, and
luckily, GPS navigation

255
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,720
has made that a lot easier.

256
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,970
Okay, this one's called
La Hoya scenic drive.

257
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:19,760
Look at that.

258
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,890
Well Elise just offered
to donate all of her money

259
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,320
to help us buy a house here in San Diego.

260
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,740
Apparently she really likes it here.

261
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,080
We just got word that our
visitor already arrived.

262
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,890
He's waiting for us at the house.

263
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,576
You guys, who's coming?

264
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:40,271
- Poppy Rod!

265
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,735
- [Woman] Who's Poppy Rod?

266
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:43,740
- My dad.

267
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,130
- [Woman] He's here.

268
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,433
- [Man] We're wet, and
we're covered in sand.

269
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,410
There he is.

270
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:53,725
- Hey!

271
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:54,725
- There they are.

272
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,558
- Whoa!

273
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:56,910
Let's get rid of that sand.

274
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,649
Get rid of some of that sand.

275
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,650
Get rid of that.

276
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,630
Football manager of the year.

277
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,790
Look at you.

278
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,900
And I see chap.

279
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,180
Come on out. Oh.

280
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,080
- [Man] Nanae's super excited to see you.

281
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,790
- So for dinner tonight, we're
having carne asada burritos.

282
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,382
They look amazing.

283
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,582
- This for her birthday
that I missed. Mwah.

284
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,800
- She just had her birthday here.

285
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,257
- [Man] Just barely.

286
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,923
- [Woman] And what's coming up tomorrow?

287
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:34,259
- My birthday!

288
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,931
- Your birthday.

289
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,530
Warning.

290
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,079
- Warning. This birthday surprise.

291
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,660
I love you Elise.

292
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,493
Happy birthday.

293
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:45,234
- That says tickle me.

294
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:47,817
(card meowing)

295
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:49,973
- What?

296
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:50,806
- Thank you.

297
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:51,992
- Oh you're welcome.

298
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:52,940
- I like it.

299
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,330
- [Man] Nanae loves animals.

300
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,040
This card is her favorite
thing in the world.

301
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,707
- Yeah it's a kitty.

302
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,530
Well we know what to get
her for her birthday.

303
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,974
A card. That looks like an animal.

304
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:06,974
- Thank you.

305
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:08,648
- Oh you're so welcome.

306
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,790
- [Man] For your last day
of being a three year old,

307
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,819
you wanna give us a J House out?

308
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,320
- Goodnight J House out.

309
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
- So these shirts are dyed in chocolate.

310
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:19,564
- Donuts.

311
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,141
- [Man] Should we go get some donuts too?

312
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,126
- Yeah.

313
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:25,470
(upbeat music)

314
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,490
- Pop-Tart donuts.

315
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,327
This is half of it.

316
00:12:29,327 --> 00:00:00,000
- Y O!
