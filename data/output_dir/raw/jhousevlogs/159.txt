1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,820
- Bye Dad.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,237
(rock music)

3
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:12,060
- We have to have a lot of time with Jenae

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,359
because Jenae's leaving too.

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,566
- [Jeremy] Yep, we're leaving today.

6
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:17,447
Mom and I are heading to DC.

7
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:18,280
- Yeah!

8
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:22,661
- [Jeremy] Caleb's all let's celebrate.

9
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:24,234
Who's coming today?

10
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:27,625
- Granny Jo, Granny Jo, Granny Jo.

11
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,251
- She's coming tomorrow?

12
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,573
- [Jeremy] She flies
in at midnight tonight

13
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,523
so you'll see her tomorrow.

14
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:35,940
(rock music)

15
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,763
- My first baby is named Jenae nae

16
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:45,992
and my other baby is named Ally.

17
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:47,687
- [Kendra] Those are
some great baby names.

18
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,313
- And my Honey died.

19
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:51,194
- [Kendra] Your honey died?

20
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:54,259
- I'm four years old
- You're four years old?

21
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:58,009
- And I'm gonna be three
on my four birthday.

22
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:02,200
- [Kendra] You're gonna be
three on your four birthday?

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,221
- Yeah.

24
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:06,031
My other baby is almost
coming out of my tummy.

25
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:08,448
I have to go to the hospital.

26
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,674
- [Kendra] Well good
luck getting your baby

27
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:13,717
outta your tummy, you're such a great mom.

28
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:15,467
- Even I can do this.

29
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:19,081
- [Kendra] In high heels no less.

30
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,147
- I don't take care of myself.

31
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,866
I need parents.

32
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,143
- [Kendra] Yeah, you do need parents.

33
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,420
I help take care of you.

34
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,952
- And you have a parent too.

35
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:29,035
- [Kendra] I do, Grandma.

36
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,033
Are you gonna miss Jenae?

37
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:35,332
- Yeah, but I'm still
excited because I get to

38
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:38,082
spend the whole day with friends.

39
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:40,974
- [Kendra] You get to spend
the whole day with friends

40
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:42,669
and then who's gonna come watch you?

41
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,669
- Granny Jo.

42
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:46,968
- [Kendra] Life is good.

43
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:50,463
(piano music)

44
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:02,450
Nice.

45
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,307
Piano Guys Isaac.

46
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:08,807
(piano music)

47
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,418
You're doing it.

48
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:24,881
How are you liking piano so far?

49
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:25,903
- I like it.

50
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:27,273
- [Kendra] Is it hard or easy?

51
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:30,431
- Pretty easy once you know how actually.

52
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:32,931
(piano music)

53
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:36,654
- [Kendra] That's a cool song.

54
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:38,117
You are doing awesome.

55
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,034
- Then I have one more.

56
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:42,552
- [Kendra] Nice.

57
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:45,617
(piano music)

58
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:47,753
- Jenae come here.

59
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,703
- [Kendra] You go get him.

60
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,073
Are you gonna go get him?

61
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,792
Isaac did you know that
you wore that sleeper

62
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:53,813
when you were a baby?

63
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:54,835
- No.

64
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:56,085
- [Kendra] Yep.

65
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,709
She wants to.

66
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,376
Oh, I saw that leg move forward.

67
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:12,488
She wants to go forwards, but
she keeps going backwards.

68
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:14,405
- I'm gonna miss Jenae.

69
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:22,993
- [Kendra] She wants it, she wants it.

70
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:29,230
- I'm kind of excited and kind of sad.

71
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,414
- [Kendra] Yeah that we're leaving.

72
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:32,457
- Yeah because I won't see Jenae nae

73
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:35,708
and I won't get that many snuggles.

74
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,892
- [Kendra] With Mom and Dad.

75
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:37,937
- Uh huh.

76
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:39,214
- [Kendra] But what's the good part?

77
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:41,350
- I'll get to see Granny Jo.

78
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,697
- So the kids are staying
at a friend's house

79
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:44,508
during the day before Granny Jo gets here.

80
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:45,948
So they're getting picked up right now.

81
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:46,781
- Bye Dad.

82
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:50,081
- I'll miss you guys.

83
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,335
- Bye Dad.

84
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,775
- Bye you guys.

85
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:53,608
Come here.

86
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,700
I'm gonna miss you.

87
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,363
- Okay, you guys be kind.

88
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:04,946
Goodbye Miss Laura.

89
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,075
One more big squeeze.

90
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:09,998
I love you.

91
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:11,203
- [Jeremy] Have fun at
your friend's house.

92
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:12,519
- You have so much fun okay?

93
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,889
Well the big kids are off.

94
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,421
They're gonna have a
great time with friends

95
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,720
and with Granny Jo, but
now we only have one hour

96
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,276
until we need to leave for the airport

97
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:20,878
and we're not packed at all.

98
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:23,200
Luckily it's a lot easier to
pack for just the three of us

99
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,732
than for the whole family.

100
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,102
But I've still gotta get moving.

101
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:28,685
(techno music)

102
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:38,618
- This is so much easier than
having all five of the kids.

103
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:39,616
- It's a relief when you're running late

104
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,358
to see that the line is
short if we're gonna make it.

105
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:43,941
(techno music)

106
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,657
- [Jeremy] There she is.

107
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:01,582
- So we're headed to
Washington DC to Playlist Live.

108
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:04,299
I have not been to DC since I was a kid.

109
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:05,599
I mean it's been a long time.

110
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:06,849
So I'm excited.

111
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:13,301
(banjo music)

112
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,036
This is what Jeremy does on planes.

113
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:26,703
This is what I do on planes, hi.

114
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:44,707
(upbeat music)

115
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:48,148
What's going on?

116
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,620
- [Jeremy] She's being very still.

117
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,203
(upbeat music)

118
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:16,399
I've never had to do that before.

119
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,982
(upbeat music)

120
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,762
- [Train] Doors are about to close.

121
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:43,695
Please hold on, this train is departing.

122
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,814
- We're all loaded up.

123
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:50,347
- Alright, now we're heading to the hotel.

124
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:52,764
(rock music)

125
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:02,049
- Well we made it.

126
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:03,977
We arrived at Playlist in Washington DC

127
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:06,229
and we're going out exploring.

128
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:07,761
We'll have to show you
guys our room later.

129
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,805
Right now we're gonna try
to find the White House.

130
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:13,056
(Star Spangled Banner)

131
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,588
I don't know why I have to take a picture.

132
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:15,863
There's a million pictures,

133
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:17,295
I could just look at the picture,

134
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:19,913
but it's cool to be able to
take the picture yourself.

135
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:23,163
(Star Spangled Banner)

136
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:26,902
So I think what I'm loving
about being in DC right now

137
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:29,387
is I'm like, hey look,
there's the capital building,

138
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,012
hey look there's the Washington Monument.

139
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,567
The stuff that you read
about and you see online

140
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,355
is right here in your face.

141
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,605
♫ The rockets red glare

142
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:42,530
♫ The bombs bursting in air

143
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,872
♫ Gave proof through the night

144
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:51,492
♫ That our flag was still there

145
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:52,932
- That's that Supreme Court.

146
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,231
It's the building I'm
most excited to see here.

147
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:56,647
- So a Kansas City friend of mine used

148
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,064
to live in Washington DC

149
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,434
and she said that while we were here

150
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:01,036
we had to come to Good Stuff Eatery,

151
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:03,427
so we're trying their
burgers, fries and shakes.

152
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:06,010
(upbeat music)

153
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,602
So they have a mango fry sauce.

154
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:11,624
- [Jeremy] It's good.

155
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,901
- It's actually really good.

156
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,527
- [Jeremy] And it's sweet.

157
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,110
(upbeat music)

158
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:22,050
- So Jenae's been fussing in the car

159
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,767
and I put on a video of
Laura and she stopped crying

160
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,647
and started smiling and laughing.

161
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:29,550
She totally recognized
her and was all excited.

162
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,408
It was so cute.

163
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:34,241
You miss your big sister don't ya?

164
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,761
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

165
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:44,480
- There is someone in
our community that is

166
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,013
working very closely with Houston

167
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:48,497
and is going to be taking
some supplies down there.

168
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:50,703
They were asking for donations of diapers.

169
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,236
- Excellent job.

170
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:53,954
- It was fantastic.

171
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:55,487
- [Kendra] You ready for this?
- Yeah.

172
00:08:55,487 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
