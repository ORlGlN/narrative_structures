00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,063
- Hey!

2
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:02,563
I'm vlogging here!

3
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:08,525
Phwoo, woo.

4
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:10,062
What's more Disney than that?

5
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:12,141
Alright, my two favorite
YouTubers, Lindsey Stirling

6
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:14,815
and Shay Carl are gonna be
together in Walt Disney World

7
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,091
for Disney's first Creators
Conference in January.

8
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:22,258
When I think of my Disney
side, I think of dancing.

9
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,842
I think of breaking out into song,

10
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,383
and just having a lot of fun!

11
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:34,466
I think of frolicking in
the woods with a violin.

12
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:41,178
And I have four little kids in my family,

13
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:42,748
see those cute little faces?

14
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:44,719
And they have not gone
to Disney World yet,

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,716
and we wanna take 'em there!

16
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:00,000
What would you guys think
about going to Disney World?
