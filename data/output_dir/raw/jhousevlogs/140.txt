1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,126
(techno music)

2
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:26,142
- So today, for ballet, it's
bring a friend to ballet.

3
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:30,172
I guess you already know
who I'm gonna bring.

4
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:31,005
Zeda.
- Hi.

5
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:34,096
- I'm really excited
to have a friend there

6
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:36,557
because normally I don't
really have a friend.

7
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:39,140
(ballet music)

8
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:52,669
Hi, hi.

9
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:01,472
- [Jeremy] Are you a fairy?

10
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:02,935
- Princess.

11
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:04,977
- [Jeremy] Let's see that hair.

12
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:07,625
- Three buns.
- Three buns.

13
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,576
- One, two, three.

14
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:11,039
- [Jeremy] I love it.

15
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,456
(rock music)

16
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,632
So how are you feeling this morning?

17
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:20,257
- Much better.

18
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:21,279
- [Jeremy] Good, you look great.

19
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,862
- Much, much better, thank you.

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,246
(giggles)

21
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:28,454
Human bridge.

22
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:31,263
- [Jeremy] This might not end well.

23
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:35,443
- [Elise] If 100 monkeys
go across one big-

24
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,026
- That was awesome.

25
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:42,525
- [Jeremy] Okay, Dad's turn
to be the human bridge.

26
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:43,692
Let's do this.

27
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:49,514
- [Kendra] One at a time.

28
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:52,597
That was Laura, that's the easy part.

29
00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:01,032
You don't have to step on his head.

30
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,916
- That's a good workout.

31
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:08,937
- [Kendra] Is that a good workout?

32
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:10,655
You're basically planking.

33
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:14,394
- It's like intense core
yoga, focused workout.

34
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:16,020
- Maybe I should be a bridge.

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,667
I think Jenae wants a turn on a bridge.

36
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,917
(laughter)

37
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:25,429
(upbeat music)

38
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:28,207
- Hi.

39
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,833
- This is such an intense stomach workout.

40
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:36,000
- [Kendra] Well if you let
go, your children fall.

41
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:42,085
Jenae's trying to come.

42
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,348
- Come on Jenae, come play with us.

43
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:47,765
- [Kendra] Jenae wants to join the crazy.

44
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,594
- [Jeremy] I want in on this.

45
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:53,241
- [Kendra] Jeremy, is this like
a full body workout machine?

46
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,703
- Yeah I'm doing crunches
down here with my legs.

47
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:58,698
(giggles)

48
00:02:58,698 --> 00:03:00,198
I'm doing stomach-

49
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:03,992
- [Kendra] Alright, all done.

50
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:06,325
Mom declares give Dad peace.

51
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:10,053
So I'm starting my morning
off with some herbal tea

52
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:11,492
and reading the scriptures.

53
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,046
I've been just needing to
get back into that pattern

54
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,020
of doing that first thing first so I can

55
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,063
kind of fuel myself up for the day.

56
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,293
This herbal tea, I wanted
to tell you guys about it,

57
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:21,639
'cause this is my favorite herbal tea

58
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,728
I've ever tried before,
cinnamon apple spice.

59
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,028
So good.

60
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,885
- I'm the playground mom.

61
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:29,511
- [Kendra] You're playground mom?

62
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,554
Of course, you wear a cape.

63
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:34,364
- We actually have a baby named Sarah.

64
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,152
- [Kendra] That's a great name.

65
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:38,288
Alright, shall we go see your playground.

66
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:40,076
You coming to Leese?

67
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:43,234
- [Caleb] You should come to
Caleb and Laura's playground.

68
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:46,067
- [Kendra] Sounds pretty official.

69
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:54,751
It's a cool idea to have a
playground in your basement.

70
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:57,398
They kept a house in the blue
misty mountains, up high.

71
00:03:57,398 --> 00:03:59,534
Here and there and wherever,
the prettiest quilts

72
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,322
anyone had ever seen.

73
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:03,551
The whites from the northern most snows.

74
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,709
Some said there was magic in her fingers.

75
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,335
Very hot, so you're just gonna hold

76
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,960
onto the handle with Mommy.

77
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,584
This is the quilt we're
gonna help make today.

78
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:15,068
- What happens if you press on this?

79
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,716
- That one does some steam.

80
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,689
- I can't believe I'm doing it.

81
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,640
Normally I can't.

82
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,172
- [Kendra] So if you
go too fast, it doesn't

83
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:24,798
get the wrinkles out.

84
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,678
If you go too slow, it burns it.

85
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:28,118
So you have to go at just the right speed.

86
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:29,906
Sometimes you have to kind
of press a little bit.

87
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:31,624
Do you feel how we're pressing into it?

88
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:34,109
So to sew this blanket, the
first step we need to do

89
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:37,011
is even it up and pin it
together so we can sew it.

90
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,983
So we're gonna even it up by cutting it

91
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,213
and little disclaimer here,

92
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:44,093
I'm not a quilting expert
and I haven't quilted

93
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:45,510
in like a decade.

94
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:49,875
No claims to doing this correctly.

95
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,360
Why do you guys think this
is called a rotary cutter?

96
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,773
- Because it is like on a
wheel, it's like a wheel.

97
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:57,213
- It rotates.

98
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,931
This is a rotary mat.

99
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,514
(upbeat music)

100
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,066
Alright well we got
the blanket all cut out

101
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,202
and pinned before Jenae woke up.

102
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,152
So I was able to put all
the sharp things away

103
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,382
and the iron away so it can be

104
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:31,752
safe for her while she's awake.

105
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:34,306
Then when she's sleeping next,
we'll probably try to sew.

106
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:35,420
- Chicken salad sandwich.

107
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,557
- [Kendra] Dishing out
leftovers for lunch.

108
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:38,390
- Soup.

109
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,225
- Let's start with Laura.

110
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:42,247
- Soup.

111
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,524
- Laura wants some soup.

112
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:44,708
- By about the middle of the week,

113
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,427
leftovers start loading up in the fridge.

114
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:48,470
So we have a few leftover lunches.

115
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,840
We take turns with different kids

116
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,767
getting to pick what they want first.

117
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,253
Everybody usually ends up happy

118
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,948
'cause all the food's good.

119
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:57,177
- Caleb, what would you like?

120
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:59,383
Okay, you're gonna eat it
with this and the veggies.

121
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:00,591
Elise, what do you want?

122
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,961
Alright, Isaac.

123
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:02,982
- Lasagna.

124
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,004
- Lasagna.

125
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,281
- Alright, Jenae's down for her next nap

126
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,510
so I'm going to attempt
to sew with my children.

127
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,368
Do I have enough patience
to sew with my kids?

128
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,063
That might be the ultimate test.

129
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:14,151
You can use just the hand piece

130
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,543
so that you can get it in
there where you want it.

131
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,934
Guys, see I'm following the edge of the

132
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:21,267
presser foot with my fabric.

133
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:30,475
- Poll question, have you ever
used a sewing machine before?

134
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,170
Let us know in the poll.

135
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,253
- Look at that thing, it's just like-

136
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:40,831
This is how they make tiny stitches.

137
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:43,998
- [Jeremy] Caleb's pushing the button.

138
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:47,100
So Elise is pushing the pedal

139
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,492
and doing the feeding with the hands.

140
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,555
- Oh my goodness, I just sewed.

141
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:55,131
- You did, can you put the
presser foot back down.

142
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,664
Okay, good job, now you keep going.

143
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:59,473
- That was awesome, now I
can just sew whenever I want.

144
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:03,490
I can sew a pillow sheet,
I can sew whatever I want.

145
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,657
- He's doing the foot pedal right now.

146
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:09,618
Alright,

147
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:13,823
we sewed all the way around

148
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,240
so now we're going to turn it inside out.

149
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,878
You guys ready for this?

150
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,758
- For somebody else right Mom?

151
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,802
- [Kendra] Yep, we're gonna give it away.

152
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:29,172
Alright, well here's the finished product.

153
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,588
We made a blanket.

154
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:32,841
It's the easiest kind of blanket to make

155
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,424
but I wanted to teach the kids.

156
00:07:43,018 --> 00:07:45,435
(rock music)

157
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,546
- I want somebody to play with me.

158
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:50,448
- [Jeremy] Can I play with you?

159
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:51,281
- Yeah.

160
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,116
Whoa.

161
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,327
(giggles)

162
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,780
- Whoa, maybe we could
shoot Isaac from here.

163
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,697
Watch this.

164
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:10,623
(rock music)

165
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,992
- It's so hard having a little sister.

166
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,128
She wants to do everything you do.

167
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,520
It's just so exhausting.

168
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,393
- [Kendra] You're trying so
hard to play nicely with her,

169
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,436
but she has a hard time
taking turns and playing.

170
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:22,131
Hey Laura, how is it
being a three year old?

171
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,153
- Good.

172
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,105
- [Kendra] Good?

173
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,893
Who do you like to be just like?

174
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:27,867
- I want to be just like Leesy.

175
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,839
- [Kendra] You wanna be
just like your big sister.

176
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,672
Okay.

177
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,695
So they settled on me joining the play

178
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,577
and I'll carry my baby with me.

179
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:44,458
She's just trying to
keep up with her eyes.

180
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,198
She's like, where are they
going, what's going on?

181
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:50,115
Gotta keep up with the big sisters.

182
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,460
- The kids have some friends over tonight

183
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,644
so we ordered pizza.

184
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:02,964
And we're trying this new
Philly Cheese steak Pizza

185
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:04,845
from Papa Johns.

186
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,819
Looks good, not sponsored.

187
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,955
Kendra just loves Philly Cheese steak.

188
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:10,487
- I love anything Philly Cheese steak.

189
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,391
The sandwiches, the pizzas, the calzones.

190
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:14,319
If it's Philly Cheese
steak, I usually love it.

191
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:15,433
So I had to try it.

192
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,016
(upbeat music)

193
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,091
- [Jeremy] Have fun Isaac.

194
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:33,173
So we heard in the comments that you guys

195
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,636
want us to do more challenges.

196
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,262
We like doing challenges, they're fun

197
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:38,119
and so we're coming to the store

198
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,000
to pick up a couple
surprise for challenges

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,533
we're gonna be doing coming up soon.

200
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:44,116
(upbeat music)

201
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:54,164
- The guy broke the head.

202
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:57,485
- [Jeremy] They didn't break
the heads, those are manikins.

203
00:09:57,485 --> 00:10:00,225
- Oh but some of them broke their heads.

204
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,198
- [Jeremy] Yeah, they're
missing their heads.

205
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:04,335
- Those aren't real people Laura.

206
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:07,307
They're just trying to show you clothes

207
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,302
that you can find for boys clothes.

208
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:12,601
- Thought number one, it
is pitch black outside

209
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,226
and Jeremy is mowing the lawn.

210
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:16,339
It is cracking me up just
walking around the house

211
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:17,802
hearing the lawn mower outside.

212
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:21,401
It's pitch black, how does he
even know where he's going?

213
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,282
We have a really busy next few days

214
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:24,884
and he really wanted the lawn mowed.

215
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:27,880
So he started when it was
like the sun was setting.

216
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,901
I was like Babe?

217
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:30,016
He's like I gotta get it done.

218
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,386
We have all the lights in the house on

219
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:32,570
and all the blinds open so hopefully

220
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,428
that's helping him see somehow.

221
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:35,845
Do you hear that?

222
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:38,793
There he his.

223
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:40,418
Out there mowing.

224
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:42,462
(laughter)

225
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:44,343
You can't even see but he's waving.

226
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,805
He's waving.

227
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:47,942
I'm proud of him, that's
determination right there.

228
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:49,381
Alright, well our busy day had

229
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,100
a bit of an unfortunate ending.

230
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,632
We had to run a few last errands

231
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:55,952
and a couple of our kids really struggled

232
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:58,437
and really misbehaved while
we were out running errands.

233
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:00,736
So we had to cut it short, come home.

234
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:03,987
They both got chores
and put straight to bed.

235
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:06,285
You know, it's just hard.

236
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:09,188
There were tears, there was frustration.

237
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:12,253
Parenting and life and kids,

238
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,389
it's just hard you know.

239
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:16,340
One of the kids was in tears
at the end of the night

240
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,151
just crying.

241
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:19,869
They were sad that they disobeyed.

242
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:21,820
I hope that they learn those lessons.

243
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,118
They also cried and said
they were just tired.

244
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:26,765
That's something that they
need to learn how to deal with,

245
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:28,460
still behaving when they're tired.

246
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,456
We need to learn how to better know

247
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:34,776
what kind of situations
we're putting them into.

248
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,109
J House is tired

249
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:39,049
and now they're sleeping in their beds

250
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:40,767
and hopefully we'll have
a better day tomorrow.

251
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,087
I love that about life, that
there's always a tomorrow.

252
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,620
And we'll begin again tomorrow.

253
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,804
I'm gonna go put this one too bed.

254
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:47,826
Goodnight, J House out.

255
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:50,310
You know those sick days
when holding your head

256
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,235
up off the pillow is like
absolutely exhausting?

257
00:11:54,235 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
