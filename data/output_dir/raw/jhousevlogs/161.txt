1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,757
(bright music)

2
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:05,424
- [Jeremy] Caleb found his seat.

3
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:13,382
- I am a scary monster.

4
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,361
- [Jeremy] Are these the scary monsters?

5
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,123
You're gonna eat me?

6
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:23,873
No, don't eat me, scary monsters!

7
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:26,980
- Do you know who these people are?

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,083
- [Jeremy] What, I thought
you guys were scary monsters.

9
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,815
You tricked me.

10
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:34,535
- We were just pretending.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,800
- You just wrap up like this.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,442
- Boom, scary monster.

13
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,802
The echo is really creepy in there too,

14
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:41,838
do your scary monster voice.

15
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:42,831
- Waaa.

16
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:43,765
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

17
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:47,191
- And mine is (hisses).

18
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:48,024
- [Jeremy] Maybe for Halloween,

19
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:49,618
you guys can be scary monsters.

20
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:50,451
- Oh yeah.

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,090
We need these to be our scary monsters.

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,037
- [Jeremy] Is that your costumes?

23
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:57,316
- Want to see something cool?

24
00:00:57,316 --> 00:01:00,649
I can make it so nobody thinks I'm here.

25
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:05,507
- [Jeremy] It's just a
blanket with a basket on top.

26
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:08,758
And then out of nowhere, it's a person.

27
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:11,351
- So Laura and I are just sitting here

28
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,640
talking about Christmas,

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,416
which she's been very
interested in lately,

30
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,512
because she keeps wanting to talk

31
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:16,345
about her birthday.

32
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:17,576
And I'm like, babe,
that's a long ways away,

33
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,621
that's after Christmas,
and so now we're talking

34
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,804
about Christmas.

35
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:24,454
So Miss Laura, do you remember Christmas?

36
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:27,851
Do you remember Christmas trees?

37
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:31,902
- Are Christmas trees
are gonna be outside?

38
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:32,962
- [Kendra] There are
Christmas trees outside,

39
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,665
but we're gonna put one inside our house

40
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:36,067
and put lights on it.

41
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,361
(gasps)

42
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:40,680
Okay, what else do we do for Christmas?

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,805
- Get candy!

44
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:42,861
- It's really interesting to me

45
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,622
to see how little she remembers.

46
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:46,189
I guess she was two last Christmas,

47
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,556
but I'm like, that was only
like what, eight months ago?

48
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,315
How can you forget Christmas?

49
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:52,556
What happened on Christmas?

50
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:54,889
- Well, one time I threw up.

51
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:58,140
- [Kendra] You did
throw up last Christmas.

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,973
How do you remember that,

53
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,619
but you don't remember
what Christmas is about?

54
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,732
So Miss Laura, what happens on Christmas?

55
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:07,203
- We eat yummy stuff.

56
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:08,292
- [Kendra] So we eat yummy stuff.

57
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:11,020
What else do we do on Christmas?

58
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,835
So what do we do when we
wake up on Christmas morning,

59
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,002
what do we do?

60
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:17,325
- We get ready and do chores.

61
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:20,023
- [Kendra] Is that what
we do on Christmas?

62
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:21,455
- Yeah.

63
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,831
- [Kendra] Don't you remember
anything about Christmas?

64
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,204
- No.

65
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:27,037
- [Kendra] Who's so special
that was born on Christmas

66
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,787
that we celebrate it?

67
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:31,165
Not you, it's not your birthday.

68
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:32,356
- Janae nae!

69
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:33,554
- [Kendra] Not Janae.

70
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,257
Who was born on Christmas?

71
00:02:35,257 --> 00:02:36,658
- I don't know.

72
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:38,587
- [Kendra] Jesus.

73
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,484
- Jesus, Jesus!

74
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:42,151
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

75
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,005
- [Kendra] Did you know that Christmas

76
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:47,922
is Jesus' birthday, that's
why we celebrate it.

77
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,682
- So we put out a lot of stuff?

78
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,988
- [Kendra] Yeah, we do a Christmas tree.

79
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:57,608
- Mom.

80
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,997
- [Kendra] Did you just say Mom?

81
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:01,218
(Kendra laughs)

82
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:02,051
Mama.

83
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,075
You want to crawl so badly.

84
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:08,564
(Janae cooing)

85
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,397
Good job.

86
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,547
I swear you look older
today, just in one day.

87
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,828
Did you grow up last night?

88
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,495
Are you talking now?

89
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:20,046
Can you say Dada?

90
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,115
Look at that drool.

91
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,460
So Janae started over there

92
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,460
and now she's over here.

93
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:28,555
Yeah.

94
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:30,447
(Janae vocalizing)

95
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:33,383
So this morning, Laura is
at her little preschool.

96
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:34,876
And so the kids and I have been getting

97
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:35,845
some schoolwork done.

98
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,388
We tracked more hurricanes

99
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:40,141
and we did some cursive
handwriting practice,

100
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:42,367
and now we're reading another
chapter of Harry Potter.

101
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,021
You want to read two chapters?

102
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,332
- Yes please.

103
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:47,372
- [Kendra] And Janae's just
hanging out in baby toy land.

104
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:49,630
Okay, let's keep reading Harry Potter.

105
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,130
(dance music)

106
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:55,486
- [Jeremy] Hey.

107
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,319
Yeah.

108
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:00,818
He's dancing.

109
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:03,985
(uptempo dance music)

110
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,508
(Jeremy laughs)

111
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:09,341
Whoa.

112
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:12,494
Whoa.

113
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:19,741
♫ I'm not throwing away my shot

114
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:20,769
♫ I'm just like I'm country,

115
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,199
♫ I'm young strapping and hungry,

116
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,600
♫ And I'm not throwing away my shot

117
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,850
(laughing)

118
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,789
We just had lunch, listening to Hamilton

119
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,872
and dancing like maniacs.

120
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:39,860
It was fun.

121
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,357
- I think Laura fell asleep.

122
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:43,317
- [Jeremy] Laura, how was
your pre-school today?

123
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,286
(murmuring)

124
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,786
Do you want lunch?

125
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,426
- Laura, are you sleeping?

126
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,563
Yeah.

127
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:58,476
- [Jeremy] Laura, do you want
to do a dance party with us?

128
00:04:58,476 --> 00:04:59,908
No dance party.

129
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,699
- I feel like this girl.

130
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,149
Let's go to sleep.

131
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,094
- [Jeremy] Alright good night big girl.

132
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:04,927
- Nap time.

133
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,366
- [Jeremy] Have a good nap.

134
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:08,808
(trilling)

135
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,154
(sweet music)

136
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:12,317
(laughing)

137
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:14,567
(trilling)

138
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:21,163
Boom chickaboom chickaboom chickaboom.

139
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:27,079
(snorting)

140
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:30,026
- Mamamamamamama.

141
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:32,150
(laughing)

142
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,357
We gotta stop playing with you.

143
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:36,025
We gotta get your clothes on.

144
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:38,608
(lively music)

145
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,201
- The kids go to a
homeschool enrichment program

146
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,490
one day a week,

147
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,170
and so they're just coming
to meet their teachers.

148
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,858
Caleb found his seat.

149
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:54,775
(enchanting music)

150
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:04,841
- So since Jeremy has the big kids

151
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,101
at back to school night,

152
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:07,557
Laura and Janae and I are going

153
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:09,861
on a relaxing walk, right before bedtime.

154
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:11,204
I'm trying to calm them down,

155
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,464
so bedtime will be easier.

156
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,543
And the weather is amazing out here.

157
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:15,583
Sometimes it's hard for me

158
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,016
that I can't go to some
of the other things

159
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:20,348
or we choose to have the
big kids go one place

160
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:22,004
and the little kids stay with me,

161
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:23,371
but I also really enjoy it.

162
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:26,491
It's kind of a nice one on two time

163
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:27,941
to just be with the little kids

164
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:28,932
and to do some things I used to do

165
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,996
when I just had Isaac and Elise as kids.

166
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:32,948
It's kind of special.

167
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:34,100
- What?

168
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,992
Look at this.

169
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,825
- [Elise] That's a praying mantis.

170
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,084
- Are these real?

171
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:48,923
(jazzy music)

172
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:58,134
- [Jeremy] Alright, go down to Spanish.

173
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,467
Spin the tail on the donkey.

174
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,891
(laughing)

175
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:08,952
So Elise, how are you feeling
about starting school?

176
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:09,785
- Good.

177
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:10,953
- [Jeremy] How about you Isaac?

178
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:12,120
- I'm excited.

179
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:15,539
- [Kendra] So Laura, what is that?

180
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,722
- I don't know.

181
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:18,108
- [Kendra] What do you think it might do?

182
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:18,941
- Spray.

183
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:19,774
- [Kendra] Spray what?

184
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:20,636
- Water?

185
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:21,993
- [Kendra] Why would it spray water?

186
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,880
- Those things spray water.

187
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,903
- [Kendra] It's called a fire hydrant.

188
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,296
(gasps)

189
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:30,392
- Then it better get out of there.

190
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:31,652
- [Kendra] It's called a fire hydrant,

191
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,516
because if a fire happens,

192
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:34,700
then the fire truck can come up

193
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,158
and hook a hose onto it,

194
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:39,029
and then it sprays water
to put the fire out.

195
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,500
So firefighters use them.

196
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,901
- Does dragons put out fire?

197
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:45,005
- [Kendra] Dragons make
fires with their mouths,

198
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,517
but they don't put out
fires, I don't think.

199
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:48,741
- Yes they do.

200
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:49,621
- [Kendra] Oh they do?

201
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:52,166
- Yeah, even firefighters.

202
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,778
- [Kendra] Firefighters and dragons.

203
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:56,165
- Yeah, same difference.

204
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:56,998
- [Kendra] Same difference?

205
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,452
(Kendra laughs)

206
00:07:58,452 --> 00:07:59,285
So Miss Laura,

207
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:00,118
- What?

208
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:01,127
- [Kendra] what are we doing tonight?

209
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,130
- Going on a walk,

210
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,297
only until the Sun's down.

211
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,902
- [Kendra] Yep, we're
going on a long walk.

212
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:09,824
- Yep.

213
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,688
- [Kendra] These two
are my little buddies.

214
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:14,021
- And Janae nae is our baby.

215
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:18,597
- [Caleb] Good night.

216
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:19,778
J House out.

217
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:22,404
(uptempo music)

218
00:08:22,404 --> 00:00:00,000
(yelling)
