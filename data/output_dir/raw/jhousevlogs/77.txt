1
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:08,071
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:13,271
- [Woman] Thank you.

3
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:15,854
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:24,409
- Well, I started the day by
waking up and throwing up.

5
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,231
I apparently am sick today.

6
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:28,041
Hopefully I can get better quickly,

7
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,320
and hopefully it's not the flu

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,240
because we don't want the
same thing to happen this year

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,299
that happened last year where
we were all sick on Christmas.

10
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,632
Quick flashback.

11
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:39,408
Merry Christmas.

12
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:42,078
- Well, Laura just threw up
all over the living room,

13
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:45,205
and I think that about
does us in for the day.

14
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,638
We are officially postponing Christmas.

15
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:50,200
The kids are bummed to not
be opening their presents,

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,258
but honestly they're all
just laying here listlessly.

17
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:56,502
So we were going to do Christmas tomorrow.

18
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:58,029
- Well, it's 24 hours later.

19
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:00,506
I was sick all day yesterday,

20
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:01,709
in bed the whole time.

21
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,317
I'm feeling a lot better today.

22
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,462
Kendra and I were sick yesterday.

23
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:06,496
It was miserable.

24
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:09,168
And what was sad was he
lost out on a lot of really

25
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:10,235
fun things we were going to do.

26
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:12,147
We were going to go and ring bells

27
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:13,339
and sing like we do every year.

28
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,006
(bells ringing)

29
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,537
And we missed out spending a whole day

30
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:22,649
playing with some friends.

31
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,807
We just had a lot of stuff planned,

32
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,214
and we've missed out on it.

33
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:26,491
So we're trying to salvage the day.

34
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,621
And again, hoping and
praying that our kids aren't

35
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,592
all sick on Christmas again.

36
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,042
So Isaac, how was it
yesterday with mom and dad

37
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:33,952
being sick?

38
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,984
- It wasn't that good.

39
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:36,507
We had to cancel a few things.

40
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:40,902
- [Jeremy] I heard that you
made dinner all by yourself.

41
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:41,813
- Yep.

42
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:43,842
- [Jeremy] And mom came in and
you guys had the food set up.

43
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,780
You had NaeNae all set up.

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,613
You guys were praying.

45
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:47,989
Caleb helped.

46
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:48,822
- Ready.

47
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:49,655
- On your mark.

48
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:50,488
- Set.

49
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:51,321
- Go.

50
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,154
(upbeat music)

51
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:52,987
- Three in a row.

52
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:53,820
Go.

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,320
(upbeat music)

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,153
- Yes!

55
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:57,986
- Yeah.

56
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:58,819
- Oh.

57
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,113
- So this was a Christmas present we got

58
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:02,147
last year or two years ago.

59
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:03,135
- Two years.

60
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:03,968
- Glad we busted it out.

61
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:04,996
This is so fun.

62
00:02:04,996 --> 00:02:07,163
On your mark, get set, go.

63
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:14,040
- Are you allowed to take pieces off?

64
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,034
- There we go.

65
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,617
(upbeat music)

66
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,210
- [Woman] Thank you very much.

67
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,377
God bless you.

68
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:31,856
- I think it's a little
too small actually.

69
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,370
- [Jeremy] Free sample day!

70
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,203
- Here you go, sweetie.

71
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:36,036
Hang on to it.

72
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:36,869
Both hands.

73
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:37,702
- Going to try.

74
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:39,356
- I love eggnog.

75
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:40,189
- [Jeremy] We'll see.

76
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:41,022
Yeah.

77
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,040
- Okay.

78
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,727
- So with Kendra still
not feeling really well,

79
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:46,202
and with a potential of
our kids getting sick,

80
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:48,504
we're grabbing some things
that we really want.

81
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:51,364
Rolls, crackers, soup, Gatorade.

82
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,347
So let us know in the comments
what do you grab to eat

83
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:54,880
when you are feeling sick.

84
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,463
(upbeat music)

85
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:11,800
(baby talking)

86
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,855
(upbeat music)

87
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:18,805
- Oh.

88
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:19,638
- [Jeremy] Good try.

89
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:20,471
Nice.

90
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,491
- Well, Janae and I came
to check in on the family,

91
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:35,099
and it looks like the gingerbread
houses are going well.

92
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:35,932
- Okay, Laura.

93
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:36,832
Let's get it up again.

94
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,986
- Third try.

95
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:40,736
- We didn't have enough frosting.

96
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,267
- I think Laura's going to have the most.

97
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:45,122
- [Woman] You're super dad
doing this with these kiddos.

98
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:45,955
- Super bad?

99
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:46,788
(laughing)

100
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:47,621
- [Woman] No, I said super dad.

101
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,831
- Super bad.

102
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,498
- I meant super dad.

103
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:53,551
I meant super dad.

104
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,890
I meant it as a hero.

105
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,599
- All right.

106
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,849
I think that might stay up.

107
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,983
- It might.

108
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:04,297
- Might have got some frosting all over.

109
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:05,161
Okay.

110
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,115
Do you guys want to try it yourself?

111
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:06,948
- Yeah.

112
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:07,781
- Yes.

113
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,739
(upbeat music)

114
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,022
- [Kendra] Is that part
almost falling off?

115
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:11,855
- Yeah.

116
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,438
(upbeat music)

117
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,869
- Have you guys ever gone
and seen like an amazing

118
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:20,233
gingerbread structure?

119
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,437
We've seen one down at
like Union Station before.

120
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:24,888
And every time we try to build
our little houses at home,

121
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,972
I'm like more impressed
by the amazing gingerbread

122
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:29,083
creations that you see out there.

123
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,988
That's like some real talent.

124
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,571
(upbeat music)

125
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:43,437
- Caleb's was a little
bit broken in the box.

126
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,862
- Empty the packages good.

127
00:04:45,862 --> 00:04:48,083
- We're just waiting for it to dry.

128
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:48,916
- [Kendra] Awesome.

129
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,749
- Mine is standing up.

130
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:52,259
I'm just waiting for it to dry.

131
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,161
- It might fall, but --

132
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,358
- [Woman] It's kind of leaning.

133
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,006
It looks like the leaning.

134
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,040
- It's the Leaning Tower of Ginger.

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,873
- Yeah.

136
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:02,704
It always ends up, that one gets broken.

137
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:04,767
- [Kendra] Next year NaeNae will need one.

138
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:05,600
Are you saying hi?

139
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,433
- [Caleb] Hi.

140
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,266
- [Jeremy] Hello.

141
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,889
- So Jeremy and I have
decided that next year we want

142
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:10,906
to do the graham cracker version of these.

143
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:11,739
Oh my goodness.

144
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,251
You're going to try to
jump out of my hands.

145
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:14,084
(laughing)

146
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:14,917
- [Jeremy] Okay.

147
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:15,750
Put some candy up on it.

148
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,000
- There you go.

149
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,092
- [Jeremy] Is the roof starting to fall?

150
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:24,805
- My gingerbread house
one is starting to fall.

151
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,388
(upbeat music)

152
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,741
- [Jeremy] You guys done?

153
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,723
- This is my back door,

154
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:44,243
and this is my front door.

155
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,268
- [Jeremy] You guys did great.

156
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:47,851
(upbeat music)

157
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:57,159
So while I was sick, I
watched a three or four-hour

158
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,142
documentary on Walt Disney.

159
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,255
I'm nerdy like that.

160
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:02,865
And it was so fascinating.

161
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,637
What blew my mind the
most was that I think

162
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:08,108
his failures and the way
he responded to those

163
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:10,455
define him even more than the successes

164
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:11,816
that we normally think of.

165
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,506
He continued to get up, continued to fight

166
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,740
even when things went bad.

167
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,427
And a lot of things went wrong.

168
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:17,871
Like they -- he went
bankrupt more than once

169
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:20,270
and he had mental breakdowns

170
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,661
and he had to fight back
and keep reinventing

171
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:26,656
and refighting and coming
back with new things.

172
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:27,861
And so that's just been helpful for me

173
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,391
among my struggles or
my situations to realize

174
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,829
that my failures are going to come

175
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,550
and it should be expected

176
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,048
and that what I do with those

177
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,945
and how I respond to
those is what determines

178
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:41,577
what I have the opportunity
to be and to become.

179
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,674
Hi, dad, hi, dad.

180
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:44,634
- Do you see the Christmas tree?

181
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:45,785
Christmas tree.

182
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:47,600
- [Jeremy] Yeah!

183
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
(soft, light music)

184
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,463
- So Elise has her last
ballet class before Christmas.

185
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,463
