1
00:00:00,322 --> 00:00:02,911
- Laura, can you say hi?
(babbling)

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,744
Say Hi!
- Hiiii

3
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:06,790
(laughing)

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,876
- Good morning friends, guess what?

5
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:12,457
Laura is crawling!
- [Elise] On her knees!

6
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:14,242
- Yep, she's been scooting forever but she

7
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:16,959
I've seen her, yesterday and today, crawl.

8
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:17,792
Hey come on I got out the camera

9
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,183
hey you, come here you! Go get 'em!

10
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:23,715
Look! Look!
(cooing)

11
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:27,882
(♫ Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy ♫)

12
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,721
(rattle shaking)
- [Mom] Come on, Laura.

13
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:36,807
Come on!
(joyful cheers)

14
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:39,557
Put these toys right here. Come get 'em!

15
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:42,890
Come get em. Ahh look at it, I saw that!

16
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:47,210
So she's been doing tons
of this up on her toes

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,710
like downward dog yoga pose, it's awesome.

18
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,341
(laughs) Hi, Laura!

19
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:56,674
(drum solo)

20
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:04,303
This may be a really bad idea,

21
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:05,866
but for some reason I really wanna try it.

22
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,706
We are gonna try sewing
Christmas ornaments.

23
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:11,051
I know, with my kids right?

24
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:12,751
They're all little, but
I really wanna try it

25
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,063
so we'll see how it goes.

26
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:16,493
- [Isaac] Mom, look what happened.

27
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,462
It fell off.
- That's okay.

28
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:21,379
And then you go down...

29
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,726
- I'm getting a lot faster.

30
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:26,842
- I really appreciate the
kids being able to learn

31
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:28,623
and do something that's
kinda challenging for 'em.

32
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:30,686
- I'm done!
- You finished it!

33
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:34,253
- Yeah!
- Oh, that's just beautiful!

34
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:36,420
Yes! He did it! Very nice.

35
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:41,046
And Elise is ready to start another one

36
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:44,046
and Caleb and I are in negotiations.

37
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,757
He wants to make a gun.

38
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:51,317
I would actually call
that activity a success.

39
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:53,674
I was really actually
kind of nervous about it,

40
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:56,159
but here's the ornaments the kids made.

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,096
There's one from Elise, I guess
those are both from Elise.

42
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:03,056
That's Caleb's, there's
Isaac's is the diamond,

43
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,600
I made the Christmas tree and
Isaac also made the stocking.

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,121
And I'm going to hot glue on this ribbon

45
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,870
like at the top so that
they'll hang on the tree.

46
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,968
- Caleb made a manger, he's very creative.

47
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,357
For little baby Jesus.

48
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:19,532
- [Kendra] He told me it was
a present, he wrapped it up.

49
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:20,748
- Present (Laughs) Perfect.

50
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:22,577
- Caleb is asleep--
- Hi

51
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:25,961
- Hi, and so we are getting
some schoolwork done.

52
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:28,431
Isaac set a goal at the
beginning of the school year

53
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:31,737
that when he reads 100 chapter books,

54
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:33,825
he wants to go to Texas
Roadhouse with Mom and Dad.

55
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:35,903
And I said, "Sure!" So he's keeping track

56
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:37,826
of how many chapter books he's reading

57
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,810
and so far, how many have you read?

58
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,977
- 75 and I have to get to
100, only 25 more books.

59
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,447
- I was drawing me and I was the princess

60
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,618
and I got scared from the dark.

61
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:51,915
- [Kendra] Oh let's see it, this is Elise

62
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:53,805
as a princess getting scared of the dark.

63
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:56,974
I have to show you guys
Elise's copy work today.

64
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,202
She was learning to write Merry Christmas.

65
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:01,063
After Isaac is done with
his calendar notebook,

66
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:03,398
we are going to start working on a book

67
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,203
that we're going to be
working on all of December.

68
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,382
It's called 'Christmas Around the World'

69
00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:10,119
and today we're going to
be learning about Australia

70
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,380
and what Christmas is like in Australia.

71
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,850
I'm headed in to pick up
Elise from ballet class

72
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,298
and I'm hoping to catch
some of it on video.

73
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:19,715
(cheery classical music)

74
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:34,421
Hi, Elise! How was it?
- Good!

75
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,460
- Good. Hi, Charlotte!

76
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,015
Let's get on your jackets, huh?

77
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:39,824
So I just picked up the girls from ballet

78
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:43,846
and we're headed into the
grocery store because I

79
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:46,678
because we ran out of
diapers, can you believe that?

80
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:48,608
That's kind of a lie, we have six left

81
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,082
but anybody who knows babies knows

82
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,421
that six diapers is
completely insufficient.

83
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,833
We also ran out of wipes,
so I've been a parent

84
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,716
for six and a half years and I've never

85
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:57,868
ran out of diapers and wipes.

86
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:00,021
So this grocery store
gives out free cookies

87
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:03,269
and I think Elise has
some ideas in her head.

88
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,455
What are you wanting?
- [Both Girls] Cookies

89
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,395
- Uh oh, alright we'll see how nice

90
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,833
of a mom I feel like being right now.

91
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,918
- Because I have a friend!
- Is this your friend?

92
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:19,385
- Yeah!
- Cookies (silly talk)

93
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,968
(bubbly orchestral music)

94
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,279
- This is the type.

95
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,250
- So Miss Laura has been
kissing me a bunch today

96
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,102
Come on, show me kisses!
(smooches)

97
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:39,226
- Camera shy. Wanna kiss daddy?

98
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:40,826
(family cheering)

99
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:44,460
- I'll hold you, I'll
hold you, I'll hold you!

100
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,348
- I wanna do it again.
- You wanna do it again?

101
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:49,279
- Yeah.
- This could go all day long.

102
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,854
- Oh man, I could not
do this all day long.

103
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:52,634
- He could.
- Ready?

104
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,978
I'll hold you, I'll
hold you, I'll hold you!

105
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,376
- Kendra won.
- I crushed Jeremy.

106
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,466
- Okay so--
- I crushed him

107
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,925
in our Disney Side Contest awesome-sauce.

108
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:08,032
- She did, you guys love her
which is great I love her too.

109
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:12,199
So my video of the Disney
Side Contest got 36 likes.

110
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:18,767
And two thumbs down, and
then Kendra got 54 likes

111
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,728
and definitely the comments,
more people liked her.

112
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,309
- And no thumbs down.

113
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:24,761
- There is some consolation though,

114
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:27,590
because I did participate,
I was the fairy godmother

115
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,735
in your video, so--
- It is true, starring role

116
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:33,226
And true disclaimer, not only did he edit

117
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:36,043
my entire video, but he
also came up with the idea.

118
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,418
- It's her video
- But it was really important

119
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,680
like, he came up with the idea.

120
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,604
I'm not a creative genius,
he's a creative something.

121
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,903
- Clearly! You guys saw my video right?

122
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:48,146
- Well the time has come
for us to say goodnight.

123
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,408
You can always tell when it's time

124
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:51,338
because my arm gets tired
of holding the camera.

125
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:53,466
Ah, relief!
- Goodnight!--

126
00:05:53,466 --> 00:00:00,000
- Anyway, J-house out.
