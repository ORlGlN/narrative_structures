I know the people in Puerto Rico

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,208
I just saw in the news that like

16
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,170
70% of them still don't have power.

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,575
And everything we're trying to do

18
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,306

23
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:08,058
I gotta stop, Isaac, I gotta stop.

Trying to mess up Isaac on the race.

27
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:17,382
So normally when we're here there's a ton

00:01:17,382 --> 00:01:18,799
of people, it's nice to have the

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,102
place pretty much to ourselves.

30
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:24,269
For now, school's about to
get out so it'll get busier.

31
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:26,455
'Kay, go potty.

00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:54,564
- This thing is heavy.

57
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:56,647

59
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:11,870
Not gonna happen.

60
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,185
Are you a fairy?

61
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,319

00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:38,412
There's some in your ear.

76
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,791

house, you sure you wanna stay?

88
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:03,242

93
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:22,223
- [Dad] Look, do you see the turkeys.

94
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:24,899
- [Isaac] They're on the run.

95
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,787
- [Dad] You gotta pump it.

96
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,370
(upbeat music)

97
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:35,171
Then pet it.

98
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,027
You guys see that little piggy?

99
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:48,593
What does it smell like Laura?

100
00:06:48,593 --> 00:06:49,426
- Poop.

101
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:52,009
- [Dad] Poop, poop, piggy poop.

102
00:06:57,324 --> 00:07:00,157
- [Caleb] Good night, J House out.

103
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,144
- I got a text from my
sister this afternoon.

104
00:07:04,144 --> 00:07:05,909
That my dad was in the
ambulance on the way

105
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:09,184
to the hospital and that he
was having a heart attack.

106
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:12,768
And that is a text that
you never want to get.

107
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:15,185
Anyway, I cried, and I called

108
00:07:16,103 --> 00:00:00,000
my sister for more updates and
I prayed and I called Jeremy.
