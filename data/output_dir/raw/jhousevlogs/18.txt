- [Jeremy] Yay!

42
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,410
- This is the first time
we've had a child walking

43
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,465
on their first birthday.

44
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,310

- [Kendra] Whoop!

49
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,910
Sometimes, on first birthdays,

50
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,000
it can be hard to go at the pace,

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,833
of the child.

52
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,330
Because they're just discovering
and exploring so much,

53
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,610
and you want to show 'em,
look at this, look at this!

54
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,060
But she's enjoying each
little moment of this.

55
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,660
- And that's how the
whole day is scheduled,

56
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,580
is for little moments that we knew

57
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,830
she would enjoy the most.

58
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:11,670

59
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,337

61
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:21,540
- [Jeremy] You gonna
show her how it's done?

62
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,840
- Janae, you have a chair!

63
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:26,130
- [Kendra] Huh, there we go!

64
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,190
(Kendra laughs)

65
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,872
- [Jeremy] Let's see if she can get down.

66
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:33,511
How do I get out of this thing?

67
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:36,514
- [Kendra] I'll help you get up, ready?

68
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:38,089
You did it!

69
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,200
(family claps)

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,890
- [Jeremy] Oh wait a sec, I
can just sit on this thing?

71
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,890
I'm gonna step into it, with
my feet, like it's a step.

72
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,041
I'm gonna lay in it.

73
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,208
- [Kendra] Aw.

74
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,811
- [Jeremy] You can like turn around,

75
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,418
and just scooch up there.

76

(Janae cheers)

77
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:03,210
- [Jeremy] She's dancing,
she's dancing in her chair.

78
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,500
- [Kendra] It's so cute how this like,

79
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,221
little amount of being up can
be so nervous making to 'em.

80
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,234
(Janae slurs)

81
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:10,484
- [Jeremy] Yay!

82
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,690
- [Kendra] Dancing, dancing,
dancing in your chair!

83
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,148
Dancing, dancing like you just don't care!

(baby squeaks)

99
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,950
I love how adventurous Janae is,

100
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,080
she's just kind of fearless and willing

101
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
to go an explore and to try things,

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,860
and just keep up with the big kids

103
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,400
and it's fun to watch and be a part of.

104
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,060
- So for Janae's birthday
breakfast this morning,

105
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,900
I tried to think of things
that she really loves,

106
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,329
and so we're having German
pancakes and strawberries.

107
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,429
What I love about Janae is everything

108
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,829
like she's been such a joy to our family,

109
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,160
but I think, mostly,

110
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,650
I've enjoyed her cheerful, happy nature.

111
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,760
She just is full of joy
and she spreads that joy,

112
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,220
to everyone in our home
and everyone she meets

113
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,750
when we're out and about like just seeing

114
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,380
how happy she is and how she
shares that happiness with

115
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,660
others makes me really happy.

00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:22,400
She so clearly loves this toy.

(Janae squeaks)

134
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,918
- [Jeremy] Yay!

135
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:30,040
Nae Nae, what is it?

136
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,880
- [Girl Child] Shoes!

137
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,639
- [Jeremy] Like how do I get these.

138
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,200

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,122
- [Jeremy] Get out of the box.

142
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,383
- [Kendra] Shoes!

143
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,833
- [Jeremy] There you go. Huh!

144
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,391
- Peek-a-boo!

145
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,460
- Here they come.

146
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,650
The main event!

147
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,079
(Janae squeals)

148
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,904
- [Jeremy] Shoes! Shoes.

149
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:59,395
- [Girl Child] And some glasses!

150
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,070
- [Kendra] Want to put
those glasses on you?

151
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,012
Oh yeah.

152
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:06,267
(family laughs)

153
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,250
Give a hug and say thank you.

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,070
There they are!

155
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,860
She's trying it, there she goes!

156
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,660
Janae loves shoes, but
she doesn't feel confident

157
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,180
walking in them, so she
sees them and she loves them

158
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,710
and she loves them and she
wants them on her feet,

159
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,760
but when they get on her feet,

160
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,130
she kind of freaks out
'cause she's like I'm stuck!

161
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,963
Mama and Papa.

162
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:31,945
What is it?

163
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:32,850
- [Jeremy] Doggie?

164
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,230
- [Kendra] Hi doggie, hi doggie.

165
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,580
So this is a walk-a-long puppy,

166
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,330
- [Jeremy] Oh I think she's
really gonna like this one.

167
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,300
Oh!

168
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:47,843
And walk, wait, I wanna
walk towards the dog.

169
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:48,970
(Kendra laughs)

170
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,620
- We'll keep working on this one.

171
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:54,220
It's a book!

172
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,330
One dog, woof, two dogs,
woof, yip, yip, yip.

173
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,480
- [Jeremy] Alright,
this is from the girls.

174
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:04,021

175
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,270
- [Girl Child] Touch it.

176
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,230
- [Kendra] It's a book about doggies.

177
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,543
Nae Nae, there's one
more thing in the bag.

178
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,302
What's in there?

179
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:13,456
Huh, what is it?

180
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:14,289
- Binkies.

181
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:17,932
(Janae squeals)

182
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:20,332
- [Jeremy] I want it.

183
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:21,697
- Kay, there you go.

184
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:23,266
Take a binky, or two.

185
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:27,304
- [Jeremy] Can I put two in at one time?

186
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:28,604
- She's trying to get it.

187
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:30,271
Huh, you've got it!

188
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:37,990
(baby mumbles)

189
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,460
- So Janae loves stuffed animals.

190
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,950
And so for her birthday we
decided to get her puppets.

191
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,830
Hi Janae, hello, how are you?

192
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:48,789
- [Jeremy] It's like a
living stuffed animal.

193
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:49,622
Kisses!

194
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:53,558
(monkey screeches)

195
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:56,220
(elephant roars)

196
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,053
My nose!

197
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,720
(Janae giggles)

198
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:02,910
- So Janae's favorite
thing in the world is dogs.

199
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,230
We're not in a place to
really consider getting a dog,

200
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,190
for her birthday, although
that would've been adorable,

201
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,930
so instead, we did the next best thing.

202
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,160
We invited a dog over, for a play date.

203
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,860
- [Jeremy] It's Henna.

204
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:16,240
(Janae mumbles)

205
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,073
(Jeremy laughs)

206
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:17,906
Hello!

207
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:19,002
Do you see the doggie?

208
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:19,835
- Henna!

209
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:23,444
Hi Henna, hi!

210
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:26,790
(Janae razzes)

211
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,207
- [Jeremy] Henna!

212
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,388
Henna!

213
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:31,221
- Henna

214
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,054
- [Jeremy] Henna!

215
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:32,900
- Did she just say Henna?

216
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,000
- [Jeremy] I think so.

217
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,313
- [Henna's Owner] Hi.

218
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:39,117
- [Jeremy] That tongue.

219
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:39,951
- Henna!

220
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:42,322
- [Jeremy] Henna, she
is definitely saying it.

221
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,620
- [Kendra] I know.

222
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,037
- [Jeremy] Henna!

223
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,840
- I'm excited, I think I'm
as excited as the kids.

224
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,673
- [Jeremy] We have a dog.

225
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:52,580
- [Kendra] For, a day.

226
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,060
We're just borrowing
their dog for just a day.

227
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,388
- [Jeremy] Henna's never
had so much attention.

228
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:59,820
(upbeat music)

229
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,410
- So this is our friend's dog, Henna

230
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,310
and whenever we go over to their house,

231
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,240
Janae loves playing with Henna

232
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,040
and Henna is the most gentle
dog in the world, with kids.

233
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,660
And so we asked if she
could come play for the day.

234
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,470
- [Jeremy] I love that when
Kendra is planning birthdays

235
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,760
for the kids, she's really deliberate

236
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,630
about thinking about what they would love.

237
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,880
And having Henna over
was something we knew,

238
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,334
Janae, would love.

239
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,167
Woo! Wuh.

240
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,611
(Janae squeals)

241
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:25,444
Hah, woo! Wah!

242
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,444
(Jeremy murmurs)

243
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:33,210
(Janae laughs)

244
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,930
- So our kids have never
actually taken a dog

245
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,730
for a walk before, and so we had to go out

246
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,152
and have a little adventure.

247
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:39,977
(banjo music)

248
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,110
- [Jeremy] It's a little chilly.

249
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,065
- [Kendra] But she does
not want this hat on.

250
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:44,232
- [Jeremy] Oh!

251
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:47,826
(banjo music)

252
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,800
- [Jeremy] Good walking, Henna.

253
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:02,080
- [Kendra] Is she drinking her water?

254
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,960
- [Jeremy] This is one thing we would love

255
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,510
about having a dog.

256
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,520
Help cleaning up, when Nae Nae's eating.

257
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,770
- [Kendra] Janae just woke up from her nap

258
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,130
and she was so excited to
see Henna was still here.

259
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,136
- Hello, hello

260
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:14,969
- [Kendra] Hi.

261
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:16,340
So when we talked about Janae's birthday,

262
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,300
we were trying to think
of some place super fun

263
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,500
where we could all go together

264
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,720
and then, Jeremy and I were
talking what Janae really likes

265
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,660
and Janae likes, getting her naps

266
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,550
and she also just likes
playing with all of us

267
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,860
and so we decided to keep it simple

268
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,370
and stay home and we are going to play

269
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,840
some family games together.

270
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,760
Games like, peek-a-boo,
chase, hide and seek,

271
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,443
and ring around the rosy, and
roll the ball, classic games.

272
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:40,682
♪ Ring around the rosies ♪

273
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,754

(Janae laughs)

276
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:53,602
- [Kendra] She's like what was that?

277
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:56,584
♪ Ring around the rosies ♪

278
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,501
♪ We all fall down ♪

279
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:01,930
(family claps)

280
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,160
- [Jeremy] So side note, Kendra found

281
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,215
this adorable shirt for
Nae Nae for her birthday.

282
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:07,670
♪ Birthday girl ♪

283
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,801
- Did she just pose?

284
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,634
- [Jeremy] She's posing.

285
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:10,801
- Whoop, whoop!

286
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:11,634
- Alright.

287
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:12,467
- [Kendra] Is Janae
gonna be on dad's team?

288
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:13,710
- Yep, throw it.

289
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:17,168
(Jeremy laughs)

290
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:18,001
- [Kendra] You got it!

291
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,024
- [Jeremy] Lauren got it.

292
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:23,191
(light playful music)

293
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:28,282
(children laugh)

294
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:31,130
- [Kendra] She used, the backwards throw.

295
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,845
(family cheers)

296
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,420
Here you go.

297
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,745
That's a ball, can everybody sign ball?

298
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:41,078
- [Family] Ball.

299
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:45,164
- [Kendra] Ball, can you sign ball?

300
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,577
- [Jeremy] I can do a headstand.

301
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:49,436
- [Kendra] Downward dog.

302
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:51,876
When you don't know what
to do, do a downward dog.

303
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,826
- [Jeremy] Henna's having a ton of fun.

304
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:55,890
(Kendra laughs)

305
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,200
- The next game is build with blocks

306
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,719
and let Janae knock them down.

307
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,386
(playful music)

308
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,800
- [Jeremy] I just want
that one and that one.

309
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,429
(family cheers)

310
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:18,549
(Janae murmurs)

311
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,960
- So we're going to play chase with Janae,

312
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,850
that's one of her favorite games.

313
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,577
So, two of us at a time,
are gonna try to get Janae.

314
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:33,410
- [Jeremy] Come on Nae Nae, this way.

315
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:35,367
- Oh no!

316
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:41,534

317
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:46,217

319
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,170
- [Lauren] Cha, cha, cha,

320
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,720
- [Jeremy] Can you blow it out?

321
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,233
Blow it out, go.

322
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:58,066
(Jeremy blows)

323
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:58,990
- [Kendra] I just wanna eat it,

324
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,240
I'll blow it out for you.

325
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,899
(children cheer)

326
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,270
Janae, do you like this cupcake?

327
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,310
(Janae mumbles)

328
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,970
It's yours for the eating!

329
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,870
- [Jeremy] First, I'll squeeze it all.

330
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:17,605
(family laughs)

331
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:21,460
- [Lauren] She's like
gonna eat small pieces.

332
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,960
- [Jeremy] Well, this is good.

333
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,756
How am I gonna get this stuff off?

334
00:13:25,756 --> 00:13:27,880
(Jeremy grunts)

335
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,713
- [Kendra] Thank you Henna.

336
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:30,158
- [Jeremy] You know we didn't realize,

337
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:31,610
what a good idea it
was to have a dog here.

338
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,190
- [Kendra] No, no, nope!

339
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:42,964
Hey, Janae, can you say
goodnight? J House Out?

340
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:45,156
(baby murmurs)

341
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:47,348
(upbeat music)

342
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,278
- [Kendra] Peek-a-boo!

343
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,290
(Janae squeals)

344
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,220
- [Jeremy] Do you guys wanna go exploring

345
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,804
in the fort in the ice?

346
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:54,971
- [Kids] Yeah!

347
00:13:55,882 --> 00:00:00,000
(family cheers)
