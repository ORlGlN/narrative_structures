1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,679
- It's too fun up here,
everybody had to join.

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:05,262
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:12,410
- [Jeremy] So that was all
found inside of a bird.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,614
That's so cool.

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,197
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:25,180
So we're coming up this
morning for a service project

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,830
of cleaning up the beach.

8
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:30,810
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,142
- What do you think we got this from?

10
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:55,975
- At the beach?

11
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,100
- [Woman] At the beach,
that's a great guess.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,620
You know what, this was actually

13
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:00,598
found inside of a baby bird.

14
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:01,560
- [Jeremy] Oh no.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,840
- [Woman] Inside of a
bird called the albatross.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,000
Unfortunately, they sometimes
think that trash is food.

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,240
It ends up being pretty small.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,208
- [Jeremy] That was all
found inside of a bird.

19
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,625
(rock music)

20
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,100
- Oh look, it's a green Kiss wrapper.

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,563
- [Jeremy] Good find.

22
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:24,890
- Dad look.

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,890
What is that?

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,580
- [Jeremy] That is trash.

25
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,693
It was someone's inside of their shoe.

26
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:32,276
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:44,930
- Today we're coming out to Broadway Pier

28
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,550
and we're gonna take the
ferry over to Coronado Island.

29
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,830
We're running a little bit late

30
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,280
and so Jeremy dropped us off

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,370
and he's gonna find parking

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,160
and then just run to catch up with us.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,770
So I'm trying to manage the five kids

34
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,090
and find tickets for the ferry.

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,990
Luckily the big kids are super helpful.

36
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,490
Elise is holding Laura's hand,

37
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,100
Isaac's pushing the stroller,

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,140
Caleb's keeping up and I
think we wanna go on the pier.

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,009
So this is the boat
that we're looking for.

40
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,250
We're trying to take the noon one.

41
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,350
We found the place and
we bought the tickets,

42
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,730
now we just have to hope that Jeremy

43
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,490
and Poppy Rod make it here on time.

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,173
- Thank you.

45
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:19,871
Please watch your step down there.

46
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:22,454
(upbeat music)

47
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,117
- [Jeremy] She's all eager.

48
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:27,719
- This is gonna be fun.

49
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,302
(upbeat music)

50
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,950
- Wow, that was short.

51
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,510
- No, we haven't left the pier yet.

52
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,510
We're not there yet.

53
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:42,364
- They're just turning around.

54
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:43,409
- She's like, was that Coronado Island?

55
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:44,242
Not yet.

56
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:47,896
(upbeat music)

57
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:05,491
- I can see that we turned like that.

58
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:06,324
- Is this the beach?

59
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:07,450
- [Kendra] Well there is some beach.

60
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,646
This is Coronado Island.

61
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:12,229
(upbeat music)

62
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:26,202
- I took a picture.

63
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:27,785
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

64
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,279
- There's a seal

65
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:32,216
or a sea lion.

66
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:33,100
- So we found a place where we could

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,680
actually rent bikes for all of our family.

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,330
It was not an easy thing to find.

69
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,330
That's the coolest helmet I've ever seen.

70
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,720
- Perfect.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,520
- [Kendra] You all set?

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,610
Oh my goodness, you look so cute.

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,250
- [Man] That one won't fit will it?

74
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,880
- No, I have a big head like Daddy.

75
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,430
- That's where all the brains are.

76
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,170
- [Kendra] That might be a little too big.

77
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,550
You are set.

78
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,330
He's hooking up a bike carrier.

79
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,810
Is that where you're gonna ride?

80
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,080
Who are you gonna ride with?

81
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,913
- Nae-nae.

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,330
- [Kendra] Caleb, you watching?

83
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,650
That is it.

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,210
- Alright, Raoul's got you going there,

85
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,346
Brian's got you going there.

86
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:12,929
(upbeat music)

87
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:35,912
- Good job Cub.

88
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:36,934
- Yeah.

89
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,710
- [Kendra] I can't get over
this cute crew in front of me.

90
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,290
Tandem bikes, there's so
many people biking here.

91
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,805
Janae fell asleep.

92
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,011
Oh, maybe she's not asleep.

93
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,594
(upbeat music)

94
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,225
- So Kendra's loving looking at all

95
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:01,779
these houses as we drive
through Coronado Island.

96
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:04,362
(upbeat music)

97
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,070
Well I'm so happy that
riding the bikes worked.

98
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,190
Kendra and I had talked about it

99
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,320
and I honestly didn't
know if it would work.

100
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,930
But it did and that was
a really cool experience.

101
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,130
- That might be one of the favorite things

102
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,963
that we've done so far.

103
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,200
I enjoyed it so much.

104
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:39,564
I really want one of those pina coladas.

105
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,860
We found a pizza place and we are hungry.

106
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,810
Check this out.

107
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,933
Yum!

108
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:47,697
(upbeat music)

109
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,400
How it it?

110
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,962
- Yummy.

111
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:55,370
- [Kendra] She's a dipper,
she likes to dip it.

112
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,770
- [Jeremy] She's eating too.

113
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,410
- Well the sun is starting to set

114
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,990
and the wind is coming up
and it is getting chilly.

115
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,685
We saw this and Jeremy wants it.

116
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:08,110
- Let's pick a caramel apple to cut up.

117
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,010
- [Kendra] I've never seen
a Reese's apple before.

118
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,072
That makes a lot of sense.

119
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,604
- That has to be good because
peanut butter apple is good.

120
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:14,882
- [Kendra] That makes a lot of sense.

121
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:17,382
(jazzy music)

122
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:25,606
- Oh this is good.

123
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:27,090
- [Kendra] So the kids are sampling

124
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,900
the virgin pina coladas.

125
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,760
- That's delicious.

126
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,930
- [Kendra] What about me?

127
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:37,800
- [Caleb] You have a sharp knife.

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,450
- [Jeremy] We decided to
try the Reese's apple.

129
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,902
(jazzy music)

130
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,107
Wow!

131
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,970
That's so cool.

132
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:57,763
(jazzy music)

133
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,373
- [Kendra] Pineapple.

134
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,600
You like the pineapple?

135
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,030
Kinda messy.

136
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,070
How is it.

137
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,100
- Sometimes I splurge.

138
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,896
This is a splurge item,
but it was worth it.

139
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,850
I'm very, very happy about this.

140
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,060
- [Kendra] How often do you get to drink

141
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,510
a pina colada out of a pineapple.

142
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,520
- It's very good.

143
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,370
- In other news, Reese's
caramel apple was amazing.

144
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,060
I don't know why they
don't make more of those.

145
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,853
It was really delicious.

146
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,436
(upbeat music)

147
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:34,519
Getting on the ferry.

148
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,102
(upbeat music)

149
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,294
So what do you think of Coronado Island?

150
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:47,197
- I would love to spend time on the beach.

151
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:48,380
It looked really nice.

152
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,213
- [Kendra] It was a beautiful beach.

153
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:51,180
So with the wind, it's
kinda chilly right now.

154
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,390
So most everybody wants to be below deck.

155
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,480
But Elise and Caleb want to go up top,

156
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,460
so I'm taking them.

157
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,310
We should have brought our jackets.

158
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,210
You're coming too?

159
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:06,857
I love my little adventurers.

160
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:08,090
So the kids just discovered that

161
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,590
we can go up around the front.

162
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:13,711
What?

163
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:14,590
Don't loose your shoes.

164
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:18,456
(slow guitar music)

165
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,999
Oh look at the kites.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,415
People are flying fun kites right there.

167
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:48,110
- I'm as tall as you.

168
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,177
(giggles)

169
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,476
(slow guitar music)

170
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:54,930
- [Caleb] I'm touching
the very edge of the boat.

171
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,750
- [Kendra] Caleb's on the
very edge of the boat,

172
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,970
you holding on tight?

173
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,320
I love how excited Caleb is

174
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,368
and I'm not taking my arms off of him.

175
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:03,760
- We're in the very front.

176
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,199
- It's too fun up here,
everybody had to join.

177
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,199
(slow guitar music)

178
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,690
- Well that was a lot
of fun and I'm tired.

179
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,430
Say goodnight, J House out.

180
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,478
- Goodnight, J House out.

181
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:34,451
- Goodnight, J House out.

182
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:37,451
