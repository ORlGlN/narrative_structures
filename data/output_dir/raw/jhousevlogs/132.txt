1
00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:02,522
- [Jeremy] No! (laughing)

2
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:03,898
- [Kendra] Is your room really messy?

3
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:04,923
- [Jeremy] You gonna
give it to little kids

4
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:06,095
who need blankets?

5
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:08,552
(all laughing)

6
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:11,135
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,088
- Can you come see my messy room?

8
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,485
- [Kendra] Is your room really messy?

9
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,318
What?

10
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:29,920
Did you clean your room this morning?

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,753
- Yep.

12
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:31,586
- [Kendra] You are awesome.

13
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:32,880
High five.
- I deep cleaneded it.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,265
- [Kendra] You deep cleaned it.

15
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:35,823
- Look, there's nothing over here.

16
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:36,656
- [Kendra] What?

17
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,240
- And then there's nothing
on the side of that.

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,175
And I made it so that it's.

19
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,959
The thing's not like on the ground.

20
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,918
- [Kendra] Oh like you

21
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,154
made it nicely?
- So then you wouldn't trip.

22
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:46,969
- [Kendra] Oh it looks so nice.

23
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:48,376
Lise, way to go.

24
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:50,959
(upbeat music)

25
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,424
- And I don't have a body.

26
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:03,507
I only have a chair body.

27
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:14,703
- [Jeremy] Alright.

28
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:15,620
Isaac's up.

29
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:28,062
♫ I'm taking my time on my ride

30
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,797
- [Jeremy] One 10 is larger, right?

31
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:34,825
- Elise's new math book came in the mail.

32
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:35,663
How are you liking it?

33
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:36,545
- Really good.

34
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:37,378
- [Kendra] Yeah?

35
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,711
It's starting off with some
review, which is always nice.

36
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:42,221
We're doing some place value work today.

37
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:43,971
Alright, what number did
you build for me today?

38
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:44,804
- 336!

39
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,229
- [Kendra] Got it.

40
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,366
Elise and I are pretty excited.

41
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:50,356
We figured out how to
pull her hair back today

42
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:51,859
into like a ponytail.

43
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:52,859
- Not going.

44
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:58,321
(bright music)

45
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:08,917
- [Kendra] Football math?

46
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:09,750
- Yep.

47
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,889
- [Kendra] Question, is football math

48
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,241
better than regular math?

49
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,256
- 10 times better.

50
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,724
- [Kendra] 10 times better?

51
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:18,307
(upbeat music)

52
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:21,697
- [Jeremy] Is this the
material that Laura chose?

53
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:23,218
- [Kendra] Yeah, is this your blanket?

54
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:24,251
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

55
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:25,084
- [Jeremy] How fun.

56
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:27,751
- Okay, keep pressing the pedal.

57
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:32,873
- [Jeremy] Good job Laura. (laughing)

58
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:35,118
- Okay, we gotta take out the pin.

59
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:36,285
Can you do it?

60
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,375
Pull it inside out.

61
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,973
Grab the edge and pull.

62
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,530
- [Jeremy] I can't remember
what her material is.

63
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,186
I'm excited to see what you chose.

64
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:45,605
- Read, grab it and pull it out.

65
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:46,717
- A pillow case!

66
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,033
- Yeah, it's a big blanket.

67
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,828
We have to turn it inside out first, huh?

68
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:51,731
They're ladybugs.

69
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:53,635
- [Jeremy] Ladybugs.

70
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:56,087
- Hey, here's your blanket.

71
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,306
- Can you hold it out?

72
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:59,736
- Yeah, we gotta finish
pulling it inside out.

73
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,670
- Can I hold it out, all by myself?

74
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,331
- Laura wants to do every
step all by herself.

75
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,302
- [Jeremy] You gonna
give it to little kids

76
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,319
who need blankets?

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,484
- AT the hospital at...

78
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,959
That people are sick.

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,792
- [Jeremy] Yeah?

80
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,375
- I just love them.

81
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,419
And I wish it could be mine.

82
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:18,431
- [Jeremy] Sometimes it's
hard to give stuff away, huh?

83
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,021
We're proud of you for
being will to share.

84
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:22,737
Is it a cape?

85
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:24,683
- No, I'm just messing with it.

86
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,402
- [Kendra And Jeremy]
You're just snuggling in it?

87
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:30,319
- It could be my blanket every day.

88
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,917
- Hey, we gotta iron it
so we can sew it again.

89
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:34,922
- [Jeremy] So what are you working on?

90
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:37,589
- I just finished my dream home.

91
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,866
- [Jeremy] You designed your dream home?

92
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,444
- Yeah, and I wanna try
to make it sometime.

93
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:44,610
- [Jeremy] Alright, well tell me about it.

94
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,681
What's it like?

95
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:48,694
- There's a front room just
like a normal front room.

96
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:49,753
But just bigger.

97
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:52,116
It's like when you come in,

98
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:55,539
when you're checking
into a hotel, the lobby.

99
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:59,072
And then, there's a mother's
area and nursing area,

100
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,252
just for like the moms.

101
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:04,220
Then there's a water
park right next to that.

102
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,323
- [Jeremy] Kinda like Great Wolf Lodge?

103
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:06,241
- Yeah.

104
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,419
There's a lotta bedrooms.

105
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,720
- [Jeremy] These are
the bedrooms over here?

106
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,299
- Yep.

107
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,760
There has to be bathrooms.

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,072
There's a big theme park and a playground.

109
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:20,290
And a football stadium.

110
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,547
♫ If I could turn back time

111
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:25,348
♫ To the good old days

112
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,014
♫ When my mama sang us to sleep

113
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:30,503
♫ And now we're stressed out

114
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,648
Cubby you're gonna need the hammer

115
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,657
for what we're doing next.

116
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:34,490
- [Caleb] Two hammers?

117
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,684
- [Jeremy] Yeah, why don't
you give one to Elise?

118
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:37,926
Laura, you can help us too,

119
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:39,010
you're gonna hammer too.

120
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,835
- I don't really get what we're doing.

121
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:44,254
- I know, I've seen that thing
in the garage for a while.

122
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:47,681
- So Kendra and I recently
picked up croquet.

123
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,687
And I know the kids have tried it,

124
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:52,648
but we've never really
played it as a family.

125
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:53,487
- What is it?

126
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:54,346
- [Jeremy] Do you wanna try it?

127
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,442
Okay, check this out.

128
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,025
(bright music)

129
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,532
- [Elise] So excited.

130
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:15,480
- [Jeremy] Are you excited?

131
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,563
- Yes.

132
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:18,146
It's like a little.

133
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,421
- [Jeremy] It's a fun game.

134
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:23,147
Okay, so we first hammer in a stake.

135
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:24,064
- I got it.

136
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,269
- [Jeremy] Ooo, good spot.

137
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,718
Alright, do you guys wanna play?

138
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:30,646
- Yeah.
- Yes yes.

139
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:31,589
- [Jeremy] Pick a color.

140
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:32,689
Elise is blue.

141
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,173
- Because I'm wearing blue.

142
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:35,068
- Yeah, that makes sense.

143
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,387
Alright we're starting
our first game of croquet.

144
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,086
(happy music)

145
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:39,919
Good job!

146
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:42,569
(laughing)

147
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:43,736
- That counts!

148
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,834
- [Jeremy] Oh, good try.

149
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:57,851
Oh, almost.

150
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:00,886
Alright Cub.

151
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:03,692
(laughing)

152
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,072
Try to hit that stake.

153
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,761
No! (laughing)

154
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:10,254
You got it!

155
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:11,202
Okay, go ahead Caleb.

156
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:12,864
Now you're trying to hit her,

157
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:16,168
but Caleb, if you go
through one of those gates,

158
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,575
then you're out.

159
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,492
He's trying to get you.

160
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:29,119
Oh he just barely missed.

161
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,589
She has to, yeah there you go.

162
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,782
If he goes through the gate he's out.

163
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:33,865
Oh he got it!

164
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,436
Caleb wins this game.

165
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:37,908
Good job Caleb.

166
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:39,669
(playful music)

167
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:42,424
He makes it through!
(all cheering)

168
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,257
Whoa!

169
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:46,970
- Oh, too far.

170
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,326
Oh!

171
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,993
- [Jeremy] Mom wins!

172
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:55,318
- Alright, can you jump us?

173
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,523
Whoo!

174
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:01,923
(laughing)

175
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,578
She's like, what's up?

176
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:06,298
- [Jeremy] She's loving it.

177
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:09,631
- I'm on my tummy, so then I won't jump.

178
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:18,709
- [Kendra] Double trouble right there.

179
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:23,080
- [Jeremy] We doing a
simple dinner tonight?

180
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,913
- Uh huh.

181
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:24,909
- [Jeremy] Macaroni and cheese.

182
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,278
- Yep, it's my favorite.

183
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:29,326
Cub doesn't like macaroni and cheese.

184
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,955
Can I stir it?

185
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:31,985
- [Jeremy] Sure.

186
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,237
- So there's a funny
story behind the shirt

187
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,261
that I'm wearing today.

188
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:35,923
I bought this shirt months ago,

189
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,511
like back in July, which is like what,

190
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:38,781
three months ago at this point?

191
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,196
Anyway, I bought it, I brought it home,

192
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:41,834
I tried it on and I was like

193
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,088
I don't know if I really like it,

194
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,266
so I put it back in the bag
and decided to return it.

195
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,558
But I never got around
to actually returning it.

196
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:49,212
So I was cleaning out
my closet the other day

197
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:50,242
and I found it and I was like

198
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:51,299
oh, it's been too long to return it now,

199
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,519
I guess I'm gonna have to keep it.

200
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,392
So I walk out of the bathroom

201
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:55,506
and Jeremy's like, "I love your shirt.

202
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:56,610
"Where did you get that?

203
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,443
"When did you get it?

204
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,312
"How long have you had it?"

205
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,199
And I'm like oh.

206
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,998
So it's just funny because it's a shirt

207
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:01,946
that I didn't intend to keep

208
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:04,866
that now I actually
kinda like and he likes.

209
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,810
So it's like a happy accident
that I have this shirt.

210
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,279
And I, yeah, that was
kind of a long story.

211
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,682
I got dressed today, yay!

212
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:14,537
- [Jeremy] Alright we just had
a break through with Janeanea

213
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,799
that we wanted to share.

214
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,715
- We actually wanna test it
and see if it was just a fluke.

215
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:18,689
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

216
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:21,104
- Hey Janae, gimme five.

217
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:22,603
Gimme five.

218
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,757
She totally gave you five.

219
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,015
- [Jeremy] Yeah, she did it.

220
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:28,848
Let's see, maybe she
wants to give Dad a five.

221
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,751
(all laughing)

222
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,354
That was the most adorable.

223
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:35,330
- Let's try.

224
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,497
Everybody give me five and
then maybe she'll gimme five.

225
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:46,067
- [Jeremy] Yeah!

226
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,650
(all laughing)

227
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,638
- [Laura] Goodnight, Jhouse out.

228
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:55,358
(upbeat music)

229
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:56,191
- What?

230
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:57,024
Was that awesome?

231
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:57,916
That is so much candy.

232
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,345
And then I hear Jeremy say "I
feel asleep on the toilet."

233
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:03,549
Who wants some more baby
peas, raise your hand.

234
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,791
- Look at these dresses.

235
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,351
- [Jeremy] First hot
chocolate of the season.

236
00:09:07,351 --> 00:00:00,000
- Yep, it's a real pumpkin.
