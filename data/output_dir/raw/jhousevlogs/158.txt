1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,819
- [Kendra] Janae's learning a new game.

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:03,902
- Peek-a-boo!

3
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:08,930
(perplexed music)

4
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:17,407
So this morning we have a panel

5
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:18,506
that we need to go to,

6
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:21,164
and we wanted to eat some
breakfast before we go.

7
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:23,535
And we did room service this morning.

8
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:25,278
- And it's so cute, look at it!

9
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:26,828
- Look here's our cute little jams

10
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,821
and jellies come in these.

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,405
- [Kendra] Look how cute it is!

12
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:33,318
- [Jeremy] Why does that make me so happy?

13
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:36,442
It's a little Tabasco serving size.

14
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:39,244
- Granny Jo just got here.

15
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:41,271
- Well, we got here at one
o'clock in the morning.

16
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:42,104
- [Boy] Yeah.

17
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:43,704
- [Granny Jo] And so this is
what we're gonna use, okay,

18
00:00:43,704 --> 00:00:45,207
to make our waffles today.

19
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,698
- My cousins are gonna be coming over.

20
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:48,645
Eeeek.

21
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:51,672
- [Child] Dumping in batter!

22
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:53,929
(laughing)

23
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,012
Laura burped!

24
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,691
- [Granny Jo] Laura burped?

25
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,632
- And there's the grin!

26
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:01,690
We're headed into our first panel now.

27
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,090
She's the star of the show.

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,038
- Yeah, you can't go wrong on
a panel when you have this.

29
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:07,699
Nugget of joy!

30
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:10,337
- [Granny Jo] So Laura,
what are we gonna do today?

31
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,018
- So, we're gonna go
on a trampoline place.

32
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,974
- We're gonna go to Skyzone

33
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,323
and then go to a fun pizza place.

34
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:22,490
- When I was a little,
Grandma, I didn't like Skyzone.

35
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:26,223
But now I do.

36
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:28,039
- [Granny Jo] What are
you doing with your paper?

37
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,372
- I'm cutting the top of it.

38
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:33,955
- [Kendra] Janae's learning a new game!

39
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:36,288
- [Jeremy] Peek-a-boo, yeah!

40
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,289
Ha!

41
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:41,365
Ha!

42
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:43,466
Hey!

43
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:44,826
(giggling)

44
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:45,704
Hey!

45
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:46,537
(laughing)

46
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:48,303
We've tried to play this
with her so many times

47
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:51,943
and she's never done it and
now she's doing it on her own.

48
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:52,836
- [Kendra] Janae you
learned to play peekaboo

49
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:55,698
in Washington D.C., let the record show.

50
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,799
Where's Janae?

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,716
- Peekaboo!

52
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,720
- We are at SkyZone.

53
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:05,501
(fun upbeat music)

54
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:25,197
- So something about me
that Jeremy obviously knows

55
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:27,245
is that I love trying new things.

56
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:29,144
Like, whenever we go to
a new state I wanna try

57
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:32,278
food that they are known for
and what's special about them.

58
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:35,870
And so we came over here to,
we're on M Street somewhere.

59
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,703
It's like the--

60
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:37,536
- It's really nice.

61
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,171
- It's like the shopping
district but there's a pizzeria

62
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,912
that we heard we had
to try, so we did that.

63
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,686
And now, a cupcakery.

64
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:46,011
Apparently they were on TV
guys, so we're gonna try that.

65
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:48,344
But there's actually a line.

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
(soft upbeat music)

67
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:58,529
- [Cashier] 13, 14

68
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:01,765
- [Kendra] It's so hard
to decide which one.

69
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,733
This is it, so we ordered their
Chocolate Ganache cupcake.

70
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,282
Which, they said, is one
of their best sellers.

71
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:08,857
And then we also ordered a
Salted-Caramel chocolate chip one

72
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:11,107
which we're excited to try.

73
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,475
- Tastes like a cupcake!

74
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:17,223
- I think it's a really,
really good cupcake!

75
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:19,056
- [Jeremy] It is good!

76
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:24,813
- [Granny Jo] Woo!

77
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:27,146
(fun music)

78
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:35,891
Woo!

79
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,331
- So we're doing a meet-up in the lobby.

80
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,442
And we're meeting up with people here.

81
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,180
And Katie's birthday is today.

82
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,486
She came out from Virginia.

83
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,482
- Happy birthday!

84
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:59,568
Signing a Jay house on
a ukulele that's cool!

85
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:00,780
- One of our favorite
things is getting to meet

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,570
with people on the other
side of the camera.

87
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,630
Ya know we stand around and we
talk to this little machine.

88
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,104
But connecting and seeing
the people and hugging them

89
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:12,246
and talking to you, that's what
makes it real and valuable.

90
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:13,798
So we love getting to meet with you.

91
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:18,402
- We are with our family
and we're eating pizza!

92
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:19,868
(instrumental music)

93
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,017
- [Granny Jo] So you
like to dip that in there

94
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:22,685
and then you eat it?

95
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:26,641
Woo hoo!

96
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,268
- One time, I was a big girl
and I knew how to tie this.

97
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:32,436
- [Granny Jo] Okay, well
who made this crown?

98
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:35,224
- Ali, I'm queen and I'm a little bit,

99
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:39,391
and I'm pretending to marry
to Michael, pretending.

100
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:42,637
- [Granny Jo] Oh, you're just pretending?

101
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:45,361
So is this kind of like a wedding crown?

102
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:47,251
- We're trying an ice cream roll place,

103
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,342
which we've never done before,
so I'm excited about this.

104
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:51,601
Because, basically, I like ice
cream, so it has to be good.

105
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,590
And we're with Sam and
Nia, there they are!

106
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,257
(bright instrumental music)

107
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:14,804
So this one is mine, I
got an Oreo cookie one.

108
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:29,618
Oh my goodness.

109
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:31,035
How cool is that?

110
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:36,412
- [Nia] It's like it does taste
like regular ice cream, but.

111
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:39,019
- So they actually used a blow-torch

112
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,300
to get the texture on
the top of my cream here.

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,820
How cool is that?

114
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,855
It's a meringue.

115
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:46,763
- [Kendra[ Jenae really likes Sam.

116
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,430
- You love my beard?

117
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:52,881
- So we found a book
festival and I'm so excited.

118
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,095
I'm like giddy.

119
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:55,762
- She's super excited about.

120
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:59,384
- Kate DiCamillo is here
and Chris Van Dusen is here?

121
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,654
Oh my goodness, hey, we
gotta go find the elevator!

122
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:04,146
- We're such nerds, really
Kendra's more of the nerd

123
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,841
in this category than I am though.

124
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,424
- So, how do I get to
the children's table.

125
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,392
National Book Festival.

126
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,102
- So Jack pulled up next to
John head and sat soundly

127
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:21,435
under the stars.

128
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:28,533
- See there's a book signing?

129
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,681
You can, like, buy books and
have the author sign them

130
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,066
and you can meet the authors.

131
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,886
That would be so cool.

132
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:34,886
Yeah, mama?

133
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:38,806
Mama.

134
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:40,391
- It's funny how many
different things are going on

135
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:42,628
right at the same time that
attract different crowds.

136
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:45,265
You have the playlist YouTuber people.

137
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:48,694
The National Book Fest
for people like Kendra.

138
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:49,953
- And people that fit in everywhere.

139
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,507
We all fit in everywhere.

140
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,732
- And then there's a college
football game going on.

141
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:55,753
West Virginia is playing a
game, like, within a mile

142
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:56,810
of where we're at right now.

143
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,502
So there's all these different people

144
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,099
going their different places.

145
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,182
(instrumental music)

146
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:07,064
- Do you guys wanna hear a
sad story, I know Jeremy does.

147
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:08,064
- Woe is us!

148
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,578
- So, maybe this is an embarrassing,

149
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,195
we're not super smart smart, story.

150
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:17,020
Anyway, what happened was,
we got to the Supreme Court

151
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,340
and the Capitol Building two
minutes after they closed.

152
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,081
And we're so bummed about it.

153
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:23,082
So we're not going to get to see

154
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,590
the inside of these buildings at all.

155
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,692
I'm feeling kind of silly
because we prioritized eating,

156
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:28,642
but I really was starving.

157
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,986
And then Janae was hungry,
and it just took a long while.

158
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:32,684
But you know that feeling
when you're so excited

159
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,436
to see something and then
you arrive two minutes

160
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:35,649
after it closes?

161
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,065
Yeah, it kind of stinks!

162
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:38,532
- Isn't it ironic?

163
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:39,577
- [Both] don't you think?

164
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:42,244
(trumpet music)

165
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,041
- So this is the spot I've
been wanting to come to.

166
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,879
Look, behind me is the Capital
Building and in front of me

167
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,164
is the Washington Monument.

168
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:02,349
I was excited to stand right here.

169
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,574
So, here I am.

170
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:05,741
You having fun with Daddy?

171
00:08:08,223 --> 00:08:10,291
- You have food all over
you, don't get her dirty.

172
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,913
Just like a far-away hug, aw!

173
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:13,879
- [Jeremy] we had so much fun hanging out

174
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,829
with Paul and Katie.

175
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,183
We were on a panel together,

176
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:19,658
and it was just fun to be with them.

177
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:22,058
♫ That I'm not

178
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:26,863
♫ And I just wanna be
a little more something

179
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:31,030
♫ I love you like I've never been afraid

180
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:33,946
- [Jeremy] So, they have a really cool

181
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,845
green room here at Playlist.

182
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:37,491
My favorite thing,
though, is that they have

183
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,408
ping-pong and foosball.

184
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,193
Me and Jacob from the Ballinger
family are going at it.

185
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,377
- So these guys have been
going on the foosball table

186
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:47,228
for a long time, they just keep at it.

187
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:48,512
They are so excited.

188
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:50,845
(fun music)

189
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:56,206
(cheering and clapping)

190
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:58,198
So everywhere we have
gone and every person that

191
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:01,506
we have seen on this trip
has just loved on Janae.

192
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,746
She brings so much joy.

193
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:05,842
It's just amazing to
me to see how much joy

194
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:08,170
one little human can bring to the world.

195
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,832
She does it.

196
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:10,831
- [Jeremy] Everyone loves her.

197
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:13,242
- Stick out that tongue.

198
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:15,989
It's funny though, whenever
we get anywhere near kids,

199
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,571
she like starts freaking out.

200
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:20,654
Like, she's getting all excited
and she starts screeching.

201
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:23,423
She definitely misses her
big brothers and sisters.

202
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:24,531
- For sure.

203
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,390
- Who are you, what's your name?

204
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,520
- [Jeremy] Say, I'm Janae.

205
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,101
- And she's so cute, you're
coming on my channel.

206
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,264
Is that okay?

207
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,469
Yeah, you part of the Zam-fam?

208
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,251
- This is Rebecca Zamolo.
She's been doing a prank

209
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:38,626
all over Playlist about
dropping a fake baby.

210
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:40,671
And so we're showing that
she really does like babies.

211
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:42,947
- Yeah, I really don't drop
babies on a normal basis.

212
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,162
- Not real babies.

213
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:47,245
(instrumental music)

214
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:56,785
Strollers at the Lincoln
Memorial, it's awesome.

215
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:59,089
- There's how many steps, not a problem.

216
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,520
Look you can see the Washington Monument.

217
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,020
(piano music)

218
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:38,343
Well, Playlist was an awesome experience.

219
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:39,907
We loved all the people that we met.

220
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:40,986
There were other creators.

221
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,539
And the viewers that we were able to meet.

222
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:43,939
That was probably my favorite part.

223
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,575
And then being on panels and workshops.

224
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:47,664
That was a fun experience,
we hadn't done that before.

225
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,455
At least I hadn't done that before

226
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:51,239
and it was fun to be able
to hear people stories,

227
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,170
and answer their questions
and share our thoughts.

228
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,885
So now, we're excited to fly
home and see our little kids.

229
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:59,847
I am so excited to see Janae
see the big kids again.

230
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:01,577
Like, I think here eyes
are just gonna light up.

231
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,502
She has missed them, and so have we.

232
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:06,085
(bright music)

233
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,184
We have the whole train to ourselves.

234
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,214
- That's what happens when
you're flying in the middle

235
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:20,047
of the night with a sleeping baby.

236
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,721
- That's the good part of flying
in the middle of the night.

237
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:27,496
Here I am, I bet it echos
pretty nice in here.

238
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:30,350
What should we sing for you today?

239
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,671
- [Jeremy] The Sound of Music.

240
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:34,892
♫ The hills are alive

241
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,071
You woke up the baby.

242
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:36,904
- No!

243
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,942
With the sound of music, la, la, la.

244
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,280
I'm gonna hold on tight!

245
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,780
(piano music)

246
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:01,578
- [Child] Goodnight J House out.

247
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:02,411
- J.

248
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,244
- J.

249
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,077
- [Both] J.

250
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:04,910
- House.
- House.

251
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,181
- [All] Out.

252
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:07,847
- [All] Out.

253
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,113
- J.
- House.

254
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:09,946
- J.
- House.

255
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:10,779
- J.
- J.

256
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:11,763
- House.
- House.

257
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:12,596
- [Both] House.

258
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:13,493
- [Both] House.

259
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:14,326
- Out.
- Out.

260
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:15,776
- Out.

261
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,609
- Bye Dad!

262
00:12:18,338 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughing)
