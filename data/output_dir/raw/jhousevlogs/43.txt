1
00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:04,030
(laughing hysterically)

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,798
- She's gonna dive out of
my arms, she's so excited.

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,940
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,720
Apparently we can't get the kite to go up.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,160
This is really funny.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,811
So Mr. Caleb, you had a
bit of an accident tonight.

7
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:20,144
(bright whistling tune)

8
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:22,840
Are you saying hi?

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,470
Can you say good morning?

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,930
We have had a busy morning, actually,

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,360
but I haven't filmed anything yet.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,590
Jeremy's been working a lot,

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,580
and we were doing homeschool.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,230
So I just barely got myself put together,

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,140
and I think we're ready
to bust out some lunch

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,190
and then head out to have some fun today.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,270
Hello, little girl.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,640
So, we're just kind of hanging out,

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
but it's so nice having the windows open,

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,940
and the breeze going through.

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,440
The kids have been out on the tree.

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,420
Laura's been playing with all
of her new birthday presents,

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,200
so that's been nice because
she's been kept busy.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,140
Who's in the tent?

25
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,790
- Us!
- Who's us?

26
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,630
That's where you all were?

27
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,930
- We're princesses.

28
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,920
- And princes.
- Nice.

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,709
Do you guys wanna take a
break and do lunch soon?

30
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,543
- Sure.

31
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:07,500
- Now that's called a Rubik's Cube.

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,340
Good job.

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,908
Can you wave, can you say hi?

34
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:10,741
(baby mumbling)

35
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:12,380
Shall we go get some lunch ready?

36
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,170
She's like, how does this work?

37
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,230
In other news, little Janae
is so close to walking,

38
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,900
it is gonna happen any day now.

39
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,070
Like there's been moments when I think

40
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,172
she's gonna take her first
step, and then she doesn't.

41
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,050
(baby laughs)

42
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,180
You just playing jokes on me?

43
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,860
Oh, she got down.

44
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,360
Isaac started a new book.

45
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,304
- Yeah, Percy Jackson

46
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,137
- [Kendra] Nice.

47
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:32,800
I've heard good things
about it, are you liking it?

48
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,633
- Yes.

49
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,400
- [Kendra] What else have you
been doing with Poppy Rod?

50
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,287
- Playing chess.
- A lot of chess.

51
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:39,600
- A lot.
- Are you loosing your voice?

52
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,660
- Yes, my voice feels
lost all of yesterday.

53
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,192
(baby giggles)

54
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,812
(laughs)

55
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:48,140
(bright music)

56
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,683
- So today we decided to
do just the most typical,

57
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:53,383
like, touristy thing
that we could think of.

58
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:54,539
Which is getting shots.

59
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,426
(record needle scratching)

60
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:56,910
- That's normally what I do on vacation.

61
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,150
Isn't that what you guys do?

62
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,287
Go get shots?

63
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,610
So, there's just a lot
of news about how bad

64
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,490
the flu is this season.

65
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,120
So Kendra looked up a spot,
and we made an appointment,

66
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,910
and we're going to get our flu shots.

67
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,487
- [Kendra] Who's excited for flu shots?

68
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:10,487
- [Kids] Me!

69
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,100
- So I'm kind of embarrassed about this.

70
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,330
Honestly, I intended
to get us our flu shots

71
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,710
a lot earlier in the season,
and time just went by so fast,

72
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,370
and I just honestly forgot about it,

73
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,900
And then I started seeing in the news,

74
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,340
all these things about
it, and I'm like, oh no!

75
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,060
We didn't get flu shots this year.

76
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,490
And luckily, the only one of
us that did get flu shots,

77
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,480
is Janae and that's a huge blessing,

78
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
because the clinic that
we're going to doesn't

79
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,270
service infants, and so
she's at home with Poppy Rod,

80
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,791
and we're gonna get our shots.

81
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,291
(happy music)

82
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,610
So the kids each get to
pick out their own sticker.

83
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,410
Which one do you want?

84
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,610
Do you like this one?
- Yes.

85
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,050
- Okay we'll find that guy in there.

86
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,180
There he is, you're in
charge of holding him.

87
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,020
- I want the karate guy.

88
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,080
- Yeah!

89
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,540
- Or else I'll do...

90
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,390
- [Kendra] Yeah I found that guy

91
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,790
- One of the minions.
- You want the long one?

92
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,083
- [Jeremy] Good choice.
- What is that?

93
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:58,966
- It's happening.

94
00:02:58,966 --> 00:02:59,799
- [Kendra] You're looking at
someone, then you have to like,

95
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:00,910
switch it around.
- I'm okay!

96
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,020
- [Doctor] He did it!
- [Kendra] Did Dad do it?

97
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,070
- Mm hmm!
- [Doctor] I need my assistant

98
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,903
with a band-aid!

99
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:07,710
- [Jeremy] Isaac is being our
brave big-brother example,

100
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,558
and going first for the kids.

101
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:10,391
Isaac!

102
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,540
Good job buddy.

103
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,373
Elise!

104
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:14,206
I'm so proud of you!

105
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,770
Laura, did you get one?

106
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,690
- Mm hmm!
- Did you cry?

107
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,523
- No.

108
00:03:17,523 --> 00:03:19,362
- You are so brave.
- My turn, my turn!

109
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:20,286
- [Dad] Very strong.

110
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:21,170
- Oh yeah I got it.

111
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,120
- [Dad] So how are you feeling
about getting the flu shot?

112
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,890
- I didn't feel it.

113
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,120
- I'm really proud of you buddy.

114
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,218
So to celebrate flu shots,
we're getting Jamba Juice.

115
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:32,801
(upbeat music)

116
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,980
- Look, guys, look!
- Mango!

117
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,760
Okay, give it a try!

118
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,991
How is it?

119
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,510
- Mmm!
- Better than I thought

120
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,065
it would be!

121
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,368
- [Dad] So good!

122
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,138
- Can we come here for every drink?

123
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,860
- [Mom] Do you really like Jamba Juice?

124
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,772
- In the polls.

125
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,833
Thumbs up, thumbs down.

126
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,240
- [Mom] Oh! (laughs)

127
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,300
- In the poll, do you like Jamba Juice?

128
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,571
Thumbs up or thumbs down?

129
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:11,270
- We just had a devastating
accident, we lost a smoothie!

130
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,310
(sad trombone music)
But it's gone now!

131
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,269
It's a bummer, huh.

132
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,479
- So we just showed up
at Kate Session's park.

133
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,820
And Kendra wanted to know
who Kate Session was,

134
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,450
like she wondered and was
curious so she looked it up.

135
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,690
- Luckily, Google knows.

136
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,240
So, Wikipedia, who is Kate Sessions?

137
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,400
She was an American
botanist, horticulturalist,

138
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,430
and landscape architect closely
associated with San Diego,

139
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,100
California and known as
the Mother of Balboa Park.

140
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,300
- [Dad] So we're looking at
pictures and learning about it.

141
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,490
Classic Kendra.

142
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,570
Learning as we go.

143
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,640
Let's go fly a kite.

144
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,561
♪ Let's go fly a kite ♪

145
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:46,708
♪ And send it soaring ♪

146
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,456
♪ Up through the atmosphere ♪

147
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,512
♪ Up where the air is clear ♪

148
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:56,838
♪ Oh, let's go fly a kite ♪

149
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,438
(upbeat music)

150
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:02,070
- I'm so grateful for modern
technology where you can

151
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,390
drive past something
and go, huh, I wonder!

152
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,820
And then you can look it
up and learn everything

153
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
you want to about it.

154
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,420
So it just takes a little assembly.

155
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,770
- Where's the instructions?

156
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:19,017
- [Kendra] Did you just break something?

157
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,492
- (laughing) No.

158
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,740
(baby mumbling)

159
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,130
- We found instructions!

160
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,360
- [Poppy Rod] So the strings are probably

161
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,740
gotta be on the outside of it.

162
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,073
- Let's go fly a kite!

163
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:31,110
- Let's go fly a kite!

164
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,773
- [Kendra] Are you not excited?

165
00:05:33,773 --> 00:05:35,220
- Hah, I'm excited.

166
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,380
- They figured it out!

167
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,230
(baby mumbling)

168
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,220
Janae's excited because she sees bubbles!

169
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,830
Well I think it's happened,
I think we've gotten

170
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,910
a little bit acclimated to the
beautiful San Diego weather,

171
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,370
because today's chilly
for San Diego here today,

172
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,760
I think the high is like
63, and it's overcast,

173
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,950
and the breeze is here and
it feels a little chilly,

174
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,990
all my kids have their sweatshirts on!

175
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,900
It's just funny, I think
when we get back to the cold

176
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,376
of Kansas city, it might
be a little bit rough.

177
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:02,959
(upbeat music)

178
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:14,540
Well we came to the park to fly the kite,

179
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
but unfortunately the park
takes a little more assembly

180
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,580
than we realized so I'm checking
in on Jeremy and his Dad.

181
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,990
- This is a trick kite.

182
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,390
It does tricks.

183
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,770
So it's a little more intense.

184
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,950
- [Kendra] Is it really a trick Kite?

185
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,367
- Yeah like it does tricks.
- It's supposed to do

186
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,820
all kinds of acrobatics.

187
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,000
- We're ready to try to launch
this thing into the sky,

188
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,380
but the wind is dying down!

189
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,030
- [Kendra] Looks like you'll
just have to run faster!

190
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,050
Or you, are you gonna run?
- Yes!

191
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,611
♪ Oh, let's go fly ♪

192
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:45,194
(crashing)
(laughing)

193
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,520
- Apparently we can't
get the kite to go up,

194
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,227
this is really funny!

195
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,600
(energetic music)

196
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,890
Watch out Jeremy! (laughs)

197
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,300
- Let's go to the beach,
it'll be windier there,

198
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,543
it'll just go up.

199
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,793
(laughing)

200
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,720
- [Kendra] What are you gonna do with

201
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,520
all the rest of the string behind you?

202
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,860
- We're gonna figure it out.

203
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,300
One, two, three!

204
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:23,750
- Yes! (laughs)

205
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,583
- Do a trick!

206
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:28,530
Alright, it did a loop and
landed nose-first in the ground!

207
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,480
- So the problem may be
that the wind died down.

208
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,313
A lot.

209
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:35,050
- So it says, "Unwind all the string,

210
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,490
"stretch the line out so that
both lines have equal length,

211
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,060
"with a good breeze to your
back, signal your friend

212
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,310
"to launch the kite
nose-up towards the sky."

213
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,480
- What do you see?

214
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,840
(baby mumbling)

215
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,618
This is the sound she
makes when she sees dogs.

216
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:50,989
Do you see 'em?

217
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:51,949
(baby mumbling)

218
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:52,866
Woof, woof!

219
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,492
Hi, dog!

220
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:00,159
(relaxed music)

221
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,280
She's gonna dive out of
my arms, she's so excited.

222
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,910
You know I think today's a
good example of just real life.

223
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,570
There were lots of happy moments today,

224
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,170
but there were also just lots
of really regular moments!

225
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,600
Our life was full of chores,

226
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,140
Jeremy working longer and
running into problems with

227
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,480
some of the work he
was trying to get done,

228
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,022
we went to get shots and while
our kids had good attitudes,

229
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,920
there were moments when
they were nervous about it.

230
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,950
We dropped a smoothie,
the kite didn't work.

231
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,950
- So we gave up on the kite for now,

232
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,960
I think if we have a little more wind,

233
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,210
we'll be able to do it.

234
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,761
And now we're playing some football.

235
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:45,276
(intense music)

236
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,526
- Oh, so close!

237
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,850
So it's interesting cooking
in somebody else's kitchen

238
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,620
for a month because you
find things that you love

239
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,453
that you're like, oh, man!

240
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,286
I wanna get one of those!

241
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,230
And you also find the things that

242
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,350
you really miss from your own house.

243
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,370
- I really want one of these.

244
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,910
It was so good for scrambled eggs, like.

245
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,910
- They are awesome, I love it!

246
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,087
I actually looked at the brand,

247
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:09,337
trying to figure it out
so we could buy some.

248
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,738
- I miss our Missouri home.

249
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:14,242
- [Kendra] What do you miss about it?

250
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:15,500
- Everything.

251
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,839
- [Kendra] What kind of everything?

252
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:17,780
- Beds.

253
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,680
- [Kendra] You miss your bed?

254
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,160
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,010
- [Kendra] So how about you,
are you homesick at all?

256
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,510
- No I'm not at all.

257
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,650
- [Kendra] Do you miss anything?

258
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,650
- Well I miss my friends, and
a few of my toys, and Netflix.

259
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,480
- We have Netflix here buddy.

260
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,730
- The reason why I'm not
so homesick is because,

261
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm doing so much fun
things, which makes all that

262
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,300
home stuff pop outta my head.

263
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,100
- [Kendra] It's a really good description!

264
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,600
So Mr. Caleb, you had a
bit of an accident tonight.

265
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,433
- Mm hmm.

266
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,830
- [Kendra] Point to your bump.

267
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,510
There it is.

268
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,040
What happened?
- I ran into a table.

269
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,810
- [Kendra] A table?

270
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,690
- Mm-hmm.
- [Kendra] With your head?

271
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,620
Bummer.

272
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,287
(relaxed music)

273
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,230
- [Kendra] We're having pork chops

274
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,930
with Swiss cheese and mushrooms,
potatoes, and veggies.

275
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,175
- Thumbs up!

276
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:15,008
Thumbs up!

277
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:16,489
Thumbs down!

278
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:17,580
- Well I'm really bummed,

279
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,890
our plans for tomorrow
were to go kayaking.

280
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,610
There's this really cool
kayak tour that I've been

281
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,910
wanting to do and I'm last
minute trying to book it

282
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,380
and I realized the super
important detail and that is

283
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,500
that the place is closed from
November through February.

284
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,430
Like they don't do the
tours in the winter,

285
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,360
so I'm kind of bummed because
I absolutely love kayaking

286
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,180
but we're gonna find
something else really cool

287
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,970
to do tomorrow, I have a few ideas.

288
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,803
Here's your hint.

289
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:41,150
Jeremy is non-stop singing

290
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,840
the specific song from the movie Oklahoma,

291
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,762
which is the Surrey
with the Fringe on Top.

292
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:49,890
(whistling)

293
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,310
J House out, goodnight.

294
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,920
This is not a good place for me to come

295
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,370
and learn about what's
lying in the oceans!

296
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,408
- [Jeremy] Right where we were at.

297
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:58,991
(upbeat music)

298
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,330
- [Kendra] This is a shark egg.

299
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,640
This thing right here.
