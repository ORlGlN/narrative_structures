1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,633
- It's just raining a little.

2
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:03,991
- He must be getting soaked.

3
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:04,996
Poor guy!

4
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:05,997
- So weird!

5
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:06,997
You can see the ribs.

6
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:08,655
- [Tiffany] This is Kendra
on a walk in Seattle.

7
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:10,005
Hi!

8
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,113
Oh, this is so cute!

9
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:14,488
- [Jeremy] Michael got
his Rambo knife out.

10
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:15,672
(giggling)

11
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:16,821
- Wow, pretty cool, huh?

12
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:19,404
(upbeat music)

13
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:25,106
(upbeat cheerful music)

14
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:34,323
- It's just raining a little.

15
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:37,088
Not too much to not go
kayaking in the morning.

16
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:38,723
It's funny too because of the time change,

17
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:39,745
it's a lot earlier here.

18
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:43,078
(upbeat cheerful music)

19
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:54,155
We were nervous that, with
it being rainy all the time,

20
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,707
we weren't going to be
able to get out here much,

21
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,928
but even with the rain,
this is still beautiful

22
00:00:57,928 --> 00:00:59,019
'cuz there's no lightning,

23
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,619
so I don't think I'm going
to get struck by lightning

24
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:03,290
or electrocuted, but it's
just really peaceful out here.

25
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,604
Listen to the noises.

26
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:07,271
(water lapping)

27
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:15,680
(rain sprinkling)

28
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:22,441
- So, Jeremy went out on
the kayak this morning.

29
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,587
He was taking the first turn
and then I was going next

30
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:26,538
and I'm in my bedroom getting ready

31
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:27,539
and I hear that sound.

32
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:28,537
I'm like, what's that sound?

33
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:29,721
Oh, that's rain.

34
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:32,333
It is coming down out there.

35
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,832
He must be getting soaked.

36
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:34,830
Poor guy!

37
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,829
I can't even see him.

38
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,920
He is going to be drenched.

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,918
There he is.

40
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:39,818
I just spotted him
coming around the corner.

41
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:41,401
- 6th avenue, so we're pretty excited.

42
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,538
- [Jeremy] You guys watching the parade?

43
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:43,538
- Yeah.

44
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:47,217
- Poll question, on Thanksgiving
do you watch the parade?

45
00:01:47,217 --> 00:01:50,217
(light sweet music)

46
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:54,288
- We'll make a model of the
Pilgrim village at Plymouth,

47
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,529
Massachusets, celebrating
the first Thanksgiving.

48
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:57,528
She sounded excited.

49
00:01:57,528 --> 00:02:00,082
We'll make the houses and
the church here in school.

50
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:02,180
Good morning and happy Thanksgiving.

51
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,129
Today, I'm going to be
really honest with you guys,

52
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,530
has not gone the way I had hoped.

53
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,705
I had this picture in
my mind of how I wanted

54
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,272
the morning of Thanksgiving to go.

55
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:14,485
This is my favorite holiday,
so I was really looking forward

56
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:16,853
to some stuff and, basically,
nothing went the way

57
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,737
that I wanted it to and,
instead of rolling with it

58
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,153
and having a great attitude
and choosing gratitude

59
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:24,913
and flexibility instead of
anxiety and frustration,

60
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:25,969
yeah, I didn't.

61
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,040
I got frustrated.

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,445
We headed over to my brother's house

63
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,615
and on the drive, I
apologized to the kids.

64
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,728
We read a really sweet book about

65
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:34,188
the meaning behind Thanksgiving.

66
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,650
So, I'm ready to restart
and have a great day.

67
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,136
So, I failed to bring a rain coat,

68
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:42,598
so I'm just going into hibernation mode.

69
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,697
- [Tiffany] This is Kendra
on a walk in Seattle.

70
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,183
- When we left, it wasn't raining,

71
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,551
but we're in Seattle,
so now it is raining.

72
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:52,078
So, we're on a walk an they're all smart.

73
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:54,040
It's just me, I'm silly.

74
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,614
- [Grandma] So, grandmom
and granddad are having

75
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:58,306
their 60th anniversary on December.

76
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:02,724
- The kids are making
cards for my mom's parents.

77
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,257
Lily, this is some beautiful artwork.

78
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:07,323
You're doing great.

79
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:08,728
These are fun.

80
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:12,561
(upbeat Christmas jazz music)

81
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:18,678
That looks beautiful.

82
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,011
Good job, Jemma.

83
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,504
So, it's lunchtime and we're all eating

84
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:23,785
all sorts of stuff.

85
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:26,503
I am making a grilled chicken quesadilla,

86
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:28,198
but it got me thinking, poll question,

87
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:30,613
what time do you eat Thanksgiving
dinner with your family?

88
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:31,890
We do it as a dinnertime thing.

89
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,095
I know some people do their

90
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,583
Thanksgiving feast at lunchtime.

91
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,250
We're more of a dinnertime crew.

92
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:39,905
- This is fun.

93
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,895
- All right, don't beat up the bag.

94
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,118
- So, my mom and dad are
teaching us how to make a turkey,

95
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:45,987
'cuz, honestly, I have no idea.

96
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:47,621
- [Grandpa] The sink is super clean.

97
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,375
- [Grandma] Push downward
on the center of the clam.

98
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,622
♪ Swimming down the stream. ♪

99
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:56,825
♪ Someone's ready ♪

100
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,856
♪ Feelings of dreams ♪

101
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:01,196
- Laura was singing very, very loud inside

102
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:02,676
and so, we told her that the front porch

103
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:06,073
was a stage and she could
sing all she wanted down here.

104
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,877
- [Grandma] We've been
thawing it for three days.

105
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:10,877
(upbeat jazz music)

106
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,263
- [Jeremy] We can only get
so much of putting vegetables

107
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:19,503
into the but.

108
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:22,503
(upbeat jazz music)

109
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,421
- So weird.

110
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:27,139
You can see the ribs.

111
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,365
It's like I'm inside of a body.

112
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:31,620
- [Jeremy] You are.

113
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,362
So, what did you think
of preparing the turkey?

114
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:34,361
- Kinda gross.

115
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,597
- [Jeremy] Yeah, but
it's going to be yummy.

116
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:39,430
- I signed up for mashed potatoes.

117
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,522
- [Jeremy] You wanted to help uncle Mike.

118
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:44,410
- You are going to get the
potatoes out of the bag

119
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,222
and then, you're going to get this rag wet

120
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:49,174
and scrub the dirt off
because, like papa was saying,

121
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:50,658
they grow potatoes in the dirt,

122
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,242
so they're covered in dirt.

123
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:54,146
So, first, we need to
clean all the potatoes.

124
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:57,229
(upbeat sweet music)

125
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:00,242
- [Jeremy] It looks like
you're scrubbing pretty good.

126
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,998
- [Mike] No, we don't want
any of that dirt on there.

127
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,851
- [Jeremy] With the perfect form.

128
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:07,599
- [Mike] Don't know about that.

129
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,492
So, the trick to peeling a potato

130
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:11,301
is to keep your hands and fingers,

131
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:12,532
see, all of your fingers,

132
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,719
below where this is going.

133
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,724
There you go.
- Good job, Caleb.

134
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:20,329
I cut my finger last
year with doing potatoes.

135
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,329
- Yeah.

136
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,124
I nicked my this morning.

137
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,901
- One time I scraped a potato

138
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:26,630
and I didn't get bleeded.

139
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,632
- Way to go.

140
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:28,934
You didn't get bleeded.

141
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:29,836
Can I get a high five for that?

142
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:30,855
Nice.

143
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:34,022
(sweet guitar melody)

144
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,674
He's doing pretty well at it.
- He is doing

145
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:39,353
pretty well at it.

146
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:42,520
(sweet guitar melody)

147
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,180
- So, up to my room,
my cousins, they flew.

148
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,644
The played with my toys
and computer games too.

149
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:52,709
All were assembled except or uncle Norm.

150
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,325
That's how much my father says it's worth

151
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:55,450
to give to the--

152
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,746
- Laura and I are going to do stuffing.

153
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:58,747
We're in charge.

154
00:05:58,747 --> 00:05:59,815
Ready? We need four of them.

155
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:00,834
Ready?

156
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,381
- One.

157
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:03,214
Two.

158
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:06,939
Three.

159
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,147
I can't-- four!

160
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:10,980
- [Kendra] You can.

161
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,746
Okay, let's go that way.
- You've got 'em.

162
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:13,868
- Let's go.

163
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:15,996
It's like, the yummiest.

164
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,329
We do Stove Top.

165
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:21,090
- That's it?

166
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,208
- [Jeremy] That's it.

167
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,378
- [Kendra] The turkeys are roasting,

168
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:24,946
the house is smelling good.

169
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,770
Grandma's blanching the asparagus.

170
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,603
Woo!

171
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:31,153
- So, what happens is,
when you push this knob,

172
00:06:31,153 --> 00:06:33,458
to this number up, it starts mixing.

173
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,082
The farther you go up, the faster it goes.

174
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:39,749
Put it in there and mix
it around like that.

175
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,818
(giggling)

176
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:47,419
Wow, pretty cool, huh?

177
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:48,954
- The house is nice and quiet right now

178
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:50,763
because a bunch of kids are
outside playing Frisbee,

179
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:53,658
but Grandma and a bunch
of the girls are making--

180
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:55,035
What is this?

181
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,081
- Turkey vegetable plate.
- Veggie tray.

182
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:57,914
- [Kendra] A turkey veggie tray?

183
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:59,001
- Uh huh.
- How do you make

184
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,642
a turkey veggie tray?

185
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:01,953
This is like art with food.

186
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,454
- I know.

187
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:06,022
It's my dream come true.

188
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:08,089
- [Grandma] I thought he was
sticking up his head like that.

189
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,353
- [Elise] It could work either way.

190
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,678
- [Kendra] Turkey head.

191
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:12,152
Oh, this is so cute!

192
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:13,819
Look at that turkey.

193
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:17,354
Whoa!

194
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,604
- Guys, I'm it!

195
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:23,557
And, I'm it.
- Who's the thrower this time?

196
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:27,048
(upbeat banjo music)

197
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,200
- It's not raining now,
so the boys are out

198
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,896
playing Frisbee with uncle Mike.

199
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:31,766
You would think that you
could go on a walk right now,

200
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,224
maybe without a rain jacket.

201
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:36,047
You'd probably be wrong.

202
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,512
Woo!

203
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,545
Did you catch that with your head?

204
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:40,661
- Right in the head.

205
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,063
- So, this is my brother's back yard.

206
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,565
How cool is that?

207
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,919
The hustle and bustle in
the kitchen is increasing.

208
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,617
- It's getting really stressful in here,

209
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:49,859
so I'm gonna just

210
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,461
continue sitting here.

211
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,701
- [Kendra] You're just
gonna continue sitting?

212
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,638
You're watching the baby.

213
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,366
- I am watching a baby right now.

214
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:59,077
- [Kendra] There you go,
that counts for points.

215
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:00,076
Five points for you.

216
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,478
- Don't eat the cars, baby.

217
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:02,614
- [Kendra] Hi.

218
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:05,684
(sweet playful piano melody)

219
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:06,748
It's like she smiles on demand.

220
00:08:06,748 --> 00:08:07,618
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

221
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:08,618
- Hi.

222
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:11,285
(baby babbling)

223
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:16,102
We all took our places,
the food smelled so great.

224
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:16,935
Hey, Nay!

225
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:21,899
And dancing and art.

226
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:23,972
Nay's coming through.

227
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:24,805
Hi.

228
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:25,638
Hi.

229
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,372
Do you wanna come see the pretty book?

230
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:31,037

red shoes, and big hats.

We're down to the last
minute of preparations.

242
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:56,614
There's a crew in the
kitchen, a crew setting up

243
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:58,699
the seating area, and my sister and I

244
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:00,106
are in charge of the kids,

245
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,386
keeping them out of the
way and entertained.

246
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:02,939
Folding chairs.

247
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,358
Lots of folding chairs.

248
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:05,191
Very nice.

249
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,044
Seriously?

250
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:11,659
The double table?

251
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:12,659
That's impressive.

252
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,051
So, my sister, Tiffany, just
flew in last night from Africa.

253
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,874
She's been there for, like,
two weeks or something

254
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:18,441
and so, she's showing the
kids some of the pictures

255
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,531
and video from her trip.

256
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:21,994
- These tigers are five months old.

257
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,884
- [Kendra] That's Tiffany petting a tiger.

258
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:24,885
- [Boy] A white tiger.

259
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:25,963
- [Kendra] That's crazy.

260
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,611
- And before, she petted a cheetah.

261
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:29,699
- [Kendra] Really?

262
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,436
- Now, do you see what happens next?

263
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,487
What does my face look
like in this picture?

264
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:34,943
I'm, like, super surprised.

265
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:35,776
Look.

266
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:38,762
One of the tigers jumped
on my friend's back.

267
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:39,767
It was playing.

268
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,212
It was a nice tiger.

269
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,431
- That's creepy.
- It was totally

270
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:43,499
right on top of her.

271
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,637
I was like, oh, my gosh.

272
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:47,235
Having fun with my friend.

273
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,487
- [Jeremy] Michael got
his Rambo knife out.

274
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:50,686
- One of my camping knives.

275
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:51,684
- [Jeremy] I love it.

276
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:55,434
(triumphant cinematic music)

277
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:17,794
- This is delicious.

278
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:18,865
- [Jeremy] Oh, it is good.

279
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,835
- [Kendra] Like, showstopping good.

280
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,929
- [Jeremy] Cranberry salsa.

281
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:24,463
- It rips your taste buds.

282
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:27,571
- [Jeremy] Melanie added
corn to the dinner for me

283
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:29,199
because I love corn.

284
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,593
- I also love corn.

285
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:32,021
- Good. It's so good.

286
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:35,769
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
for me without corn.

287
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,602
- Hi.

288
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:40,798
- I am Thankful for what's in this room.

289
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:42,330
I'm also thankful for the food,

290
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,861
but mostly for you all.

291
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:47,264
You are everything in my life.

292
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:51,431
(Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by J.S. Bach)

293
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,411
- [Jeremy] Who made these
mashed potatoes, Caleb?

294
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:09,866
- Aren't they so much mashed?

295
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:10,888
- Caleb mashed them.

296
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:12,119
- They're mashed so good.

297
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:14,313
It's Jenae's first Thanksgiving.

298
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,398
She's having little yogurt bites.

299
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:18,065
She's not impressed.

300
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,066
- Dish duty.

301
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:23,075
It's a thing.

302
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:27,144
Thanksgiving dinner is done,
which means it's officially

303
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,377
the Christmas season around here.

304
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:30,523
The kids are snuggled up,
watching a Christmas movie

305
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,697
and I'm warming up the pies
and we're gonna eat dessert,

306
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:35,274
which is, let's be honest,
the best part of Thanksgiving.

307
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:36,342
- The pie almost--

308
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:37,341
What is this?

309
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:39,477
- [Kendra] That's a hot mitt for the oven.

310
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:41,125
- It's too big for me.

311
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,774
- [Kendra] It is too big for you.

312
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:45,033
How many pies are we getting?

313
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,396
- We're getting three.

314
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:48,813
- [Kendra] Three.

315
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,985
I will manage the oven and you
can help eat the pies, okay?

316
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:54,645
- [Jeremy] What kind was this one?

317
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:56,502
- This one's chocolate pecan

318
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:59,322
and that little piece
fell off in my mouth.

319
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:00,155
Oopsy.

320
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,319
- [Jeremy] Are you serious?

321
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,363
- Oopsy.

322
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,931
It was already cracking.

323
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,033
Come on.

324
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,702
- [Jeremy] Is this an apple berry?

325
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,935
- [Kendra] This is apple Marion berry.

326
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,421
- [Jeremy] Which is
like a Washington thing.

327
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,868
- It's a specialty.

328
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:16,035
(exciting orchestral Christmas music)

329
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,776
I'm trying a bunch of things.

330
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,989
Chocolate cream, chocolate pecan,

331
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,120
apple Marion berry.

332
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,953
- I'm holding the baby.

333
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:28,786
Good night.

334
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:29,664
J-House, out.

335
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,066
(screaming)

336
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,633
- [Kendra] Caleb's helping me paddle.

337
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,570
(giggling)

338
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,418
I'm a little bit nervous.

339
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:37,927
The graceful dismount.

340
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:38,926
(laughing)

341
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,226
- I got all dough-y.

342
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,136
- [Mike] Whoa, that's a pretty big one.

343
00:12:42,136 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
