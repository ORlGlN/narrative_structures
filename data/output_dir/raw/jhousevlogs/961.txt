1
00:00:00,402 --> 00:00:03,319
("Deck the Halls")

2
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:20,086
- Okay, we're gonna try out
this magnetic blocks toy.

3
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,183
- [Kendra] Ooh.

4
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:22,350
- [Child] Wow.

5
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:28,224
- [Jeremy] Good job.

6
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:30,878
You could put it on top of Mom's blocks.

7
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:33,621
You would have a house.

8
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:35,621
Look, you built a house!

9
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:44,735
- [Kendra] Somebody's discovering magnets.

10
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:46,498
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

11
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:47,490
You could lay it right up there,

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,687
and then do another one on the other...

13
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:53,437
- I know, you're super impressed.

14
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:06,692
- Good thing I can make another one.

15
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,558
- [Kendra] Good thing.

16
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:08,937
Good attitude there, sissy.

17
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:11,687
Cubby, this is such a cool house!

18
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,852
- Can you hold this one for us?

19
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:21,664
- [Kendra] So, they're working
together to build a fort.

20
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,632
- Here, Dad.

21
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:23,733
- Perfect!

22
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:27,593
That'll be the blanket we
put on top of it, okay?

23
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:28,804
Um, we want that connected.

24
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:29,637
Yeah, that would be great,

25
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:30,838
that would give it some stability.

26
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:32,244
- [Kendra] So, this is the
toy they're playing with.

27
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:35,661
It is a Build and Play Construction Fort.

28
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,334
- Hey, are you guys ready
to put the sheet on top?

29
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:40,613
- [Kendra] It's like a
doggy door in the back.

30
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:42,780
- Yep, it's the back door.

31
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:50,674
- [Isaac] All of it covered
up except for the big ones.

32
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:53,864
- [Jeremy] Okay, we'll open up the door.

33
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,813
Did we build a fort?

34
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,394
- Yeah!

35
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:58,873
- Isaac, what are you doing?

36
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:01,474
You bringing your pillows in?

37
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:03,779
So, doing a nice Christmas
dinner is an important

38
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:07,042
part of Kendra's Christmas tradition.

39
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:08,086
- It is.

40
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,494
And we're doing it!

41
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:12,906
We're sitting down to a nice dinner.

42
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:15,437
And we're all gonna behave super nicely.

43
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:16,270
- [Jeremy] And we're not gonna spill

44
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,795
any of the yummy drink everywhere.

45
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:21,137
- Alright?
- We'll see how it goes.

46
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,387
- Wish us luck.

47
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:28,412
Alright, in my family
we always did cheers.

48
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:29,245
Are you ready?

49
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:31,056
- I don't see this going well.

50
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:31,993
- So, how you do cheers

51
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,155
is you touch your cups gently together.

52
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,214
Let me show you, watch.

53
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:36,964
Oh, so gently, watch.

54
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,157
Okay?

55
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:42,036
- His bottom fell off.

56
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,695
- Well, not his bottom.

57
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:45,945
(giggling)

58
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,917
Okay, ready?

59
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:52,899
- [Jeremy] Elise, do you wanna
touch yours against mine,

60
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:53,732
really gently?

61
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,702
- To family and Christmas.

62
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:56,952
- [Jeremy] Cheers!

63
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:57,785
- Cheers!

64
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,952
Cheers!

65
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:02,682
(giggling)

66
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,932
You have to be so soft
when you do it, Caleb.

67
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:05,765
- Why?

68
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:07,352
- So that your thing doesn't spill.

69
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:09,336
- [Isaac] Dad, cheers.

70
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,336
- [Jeremy] So soft, bud.

71
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:13,738
Cheers!

72
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:16,469
- Cheers!

73
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,709
- Caleb, cheers!

74
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:20,827
- [Jeremy] Cheers.

75
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:22,947
- [Kendra] Cheers.

76
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:27,094
- This will be a lot easier in 10 years.

77
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:28,418
- Jeremy?
- Yeah?

78
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:32,315
- Every meal I ever sat
down to with my grandparents

79
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:33,510
they would do the toast,

80
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,045
and then my grandpa, he
always sat at the end,

81
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,635
he would walk all the way around the table

82
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,566
to where my grandma was
and cheers her glass

83
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:40,863
and kiss her.

84
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:41,696
- [Jeremy] Aw, how sweet.

85
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,779
- Every meal.

86
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,323
- Don't open 'em yet.

87
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:49,630
This one is to Daddy.

88
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,547
- [Jeremy] Thanks, man!

89
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,356
- Lisey.

90
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:00,890
- Mommy.

91
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,533
- It's a ball!

92
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:08,114
- [Jeremy] No no no, you don't
wanna tell her the present.

93
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,614
- It's okay, look!

94
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:12,297
Oh, it's a ball!

95
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:15,829
Laura, can you say thank you?

96
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:16,829
- Thank you!

97
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:20,188
- (babbles)

98
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:22,658
- [Jeremy] (laughs) That
almost sounded like thank you!

99
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:24,840
Thank you, Caleb!

100
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,338
- Laura, give Caleb hugs!

101
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:29,091
Say thank you.

102
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:31,341
- Okay Ike, it's your turn.

103
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:38,801
- Wow!

104
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,310
I love this!

105
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:50,152
- [Kendra] Caleb, did
you give that to him?

106
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:53,201
- What does this do with it?

107
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,115
- It has a motorcycle!

108
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:55,948
- I know!

109
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,014
- [Kendra] What do you say, Isaac?

110
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,014
- Thank you!

111
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,780
- It's salad tongs!

112
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,697
I love them, thank you!

113
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:12,595
Caleb, thank you.

114
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:13,928
Oh, they're red.

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,083
- That's my favorite color.

116
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,416
- That's so fun.

117
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,365
- Wow!

118
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,032
- [Jeremy] What is it?

119
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,182
- Cars.

120
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:32,126
- [Jeremy] Three race cars.

121
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,475
- [Kendra] Awesome!

122
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:34,523
- I got a purple one

123
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,073
so both of us could
play with them together.

124
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,907
- [Isaac] And the orange
one could be for me.

125
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:39,740
- Yeah!

126
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,642
- [Jeremy] Whoa!

127
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:43,032
- And the green one can be for me.

128
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:45,592
- Yeah, that's why I got three.

129
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:46,626
- [Kendra] That's awesome!

130
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:48,090
Caleb, can you say thank you to Lisey?

131
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,090
- Thank you.

132
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:51,241
- Squeeze!

133
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,435
- A football!

134
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:58,685
Oh, I love you.

135
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:00,751
Thank you.

136
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,263
- Two cars, again!

137
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:16,263
- You have so many cars!

138
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:20,233
You have a bunch of
different colored cars.

139
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:25,118
Look, now you have yellow
and red, your favorite color!

140
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,668
Say thank you, Isaac.

141
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:28,251
- Isaac, thank you.

142
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:31,489
- I got some cars.
- Show me!

143
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:34,634
- [Kendra] Did they
get you the same thing?

144
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:35,684
That is fun.

145
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:38,517
Alright, let's see it, Miss Magoo.

146
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:48,958
- Whoa!

147
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,814
- Wanna tell you what it is?

148
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:53,647
- What?

149
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,944
- It's a Sophia The First whistle.

150
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,014
- Whoa!

151
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,444
- [Kendra] That's so thoughtful.

152
00:06:58,444 --> 00:06:59,956
Lisey, what do you say?

153
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:00,956
- Thank you!

154
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:06,363
- [Kendra] I'm confused,
that's like such a weird shape.

155
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:07,196
- I know.

156
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:11,475
- It's not too heavy.

157
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:12,892
What could it be?

158
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,144
It's a dustpan!

159
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,001
- There's nothing that could go with it,

160
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,404
so that's all I could get.

161
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:23,571
- That's okay.

162
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:26,499
Who doesn't need a dustpan?

163
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,875
- [Jeremy] Who doesn't
need an extra dustpan?

164
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,625
- And a blue one, though,
I really like blue.

165
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,260
- Wait a second!

166
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:40,155
You got me the same thing, I love it!

167
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:44,015
Now we can play catch
where I throw it to you

168
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:44,848
and then you throw it.

169
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:45,826
- And we don't know whose is whose.

170
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:46,938
- No, we both throw it back and forth,

171
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:48,653
let's try it real quick.

172
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:50,046
- [Kendra] What?

173
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:51,879
- [Jeremy] Go! Go! Go!

174
00:07:57,304 --> 00:07:58,431
- Jeremy's so happy.

175
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:02,598
He's always wanted a permanent
football-playing buddy.

176
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:07,428
- Whoa!

177
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:10,009
- Wowzers!

178
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,365
This is cool!

179
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,684
- It's fruit snacks!

180
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:19,671
Wow!

181
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:20,921
- Fruit snacks?

182
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:25,429
- Elise, you got Elsa and Ana!

183
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:27,012
- Well, I got Dora!

184
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:30,729
- Elsa and Ana fruit snacks?

185
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,803
Oh gee, thanks Missus Laura!

186
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:36,629
- And I got Super Mario!

187
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:37,953
- [Jeremy] Coolio.

188
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,429
- [Kendra] Get your
thanks going on over here.

189
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,615
Oh, be soft, be soft!

190
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:41,448
- [Jeremy] Don't rip her head off

191
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:43,320
when you say thanks to her.

192
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:46,030
Isaac, do you wanna say
thanks to Miss Laura?

193
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,039
- Thank you!

194
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,528
- [Elise] Can we eat some today?

195
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,380
- So, initially, I thought

196
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,675
that the Let it Go microphone

197
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:56,559
that sang Let it Go over
and over again was annoying.

198
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,290
It's nothing compared to the whistle.

199
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,623
(whistling)

200
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,078
It's been 20 minutes,
non-stop, whistle-blowing.

201
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:14,138
- [Isaac] I got that for Elise.

202
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:18,555
She said it was her
favorite present from me.

203
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:22,293
- I'm just glad it makes
such a pretty noise.

204
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:24,710
What are you doing over here?

205
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:29,720
- I'm not snitchin' nothin'.

206
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,111
- [Jeremy] Mom doing, Lisey?

207
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:34,300
- Curling my hair with curlers.

208
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,499
- [Jeremy] Ooh, it's gonna
be so pretty tomorrow.

209
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:38,471
- Just like Granny Jo has.

210
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:39,951
- [Jeremy] Yep.

211
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:44,118
- [Family] ♫ Oh come all ye faithful

212
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:49,267
♫ Joyful and triumphant

213
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:52,600

♫ Come and behold Him

216
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:07,150
♫ Born the king of angels

217
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,733
♫ Oh come let us adore Him

218
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,213
♫ Oh come let us adore Him

219
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:19,934
♫ Oh come let us adore Him

220
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,579
♫ Christ the Lord

221
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:28,943
- Merry Christmas!

222
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:30,076
- Merry Christmas!

223
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,576
- Merry Christmas!

224
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:33,576
- Wowzers!

225
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:35,364
- Wow!

226
00:10:37,515 --> 00:00:00,000
- I love it!
