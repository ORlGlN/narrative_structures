1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:01,678
- You know those sick days

2
00:00:01,678 --> 00:00:04,155
when holding your head up off the pillow

3
00:00:04,155 --> 00:00:06,238
is absolutely exhausting.

4
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,635
- Good morning.

5
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:25,562
So little Jennay and Kendra

6
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:28,624
are feeling very sick this morning.

7
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:30,380
- A tired and sick mom laying on the floor

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,883
next to baby playing.

9
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:36,285
It's like a classic right
of passage of motherhood,

10
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,152
like every mother has been
here taking two second naps

11
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:41,911
on the floor next to their baby.

12
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:45,882
This little girl is playing
so contently right now.

13
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:48,215
How's the toy game going on?

14
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,501
I swear her hair looks longer today.

15
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,641
- So I made a family.

16
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,262
- [Dad] That's a family?

17
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:02,095
- Mm hm.

18
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,041
- [Dad] Tell me about them.

19
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,279
- So this is the teenager.

20
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:05,971
This the mom.

21
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,676
This is the dad.

22
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,426
And this is the baby.

23
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:12,274
She's about three months old.

24
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:14,832
And this one's about like my age.

25
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:15,665
So yeah.

26
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,067
- [Dad] So what's this?

27
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:19,396
- This is the campfire,

28
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:22,246
and they're roasting marshmallows.

29
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:23,579
- [Dad] How fun.

30
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:26,217
(inaudible)

31
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:27,496
- Oh.

32
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:29,023
- Ready.

33
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:29,856
- Whoa.

34
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,032
- [Dad] Buddy, you're
still in your pajamas.

35
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,467
- I know, I'm fine.

36
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,168
- Yeah me too.

37
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,535
- [Dad] But you haven't
done your chores yet.

38
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,111
- We know.

39
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,069
- [Dad] We can come and jump on the tramp

40
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,305
after our chores are done.

41
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,171
Come on inside.

42
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,173
Caleb, your chore today is the dishes.

43
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:49,286
- What's mine?

44
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:53,369
- [Dad] You need to help
clean up the front room.

45
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:07,947
So I'm back at the store because Kendra

46
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:09,537
had several things that
she wanted us to pick up

47
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:11,954
because she was feeling sick.

48
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,669
So I just got a text from Kendra

49
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:22,921
saying that she's feeling worse.

50
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,057
More of a fever, she's having chills.

51
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:29,708
So hopefully this soup
and stuff will help.

52
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,875
(banging)

53
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,694
- We're playing football.

54
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:45,611
- [Dad] It's in overtime right now?

55
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:51,729
(laughter)

56
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,062
Next score wins.

57
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,078
You've been touched, he got you.

58
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:05,004
(laughter)

59
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:23,819
So we're at the library
again for Elise's tutoring.

60
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,507
We're so proud of how
hard Elise is working

61
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,032
to try to master reading.

62
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:30,032
It's hard for her with the dyslexia.

63
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:39,807
- I'm very sad for Mom

64
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:43,140
and I hope Mom feels better pretty soon.

65
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,324
- [Dad] Hey.

66
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:49,333
- She's pretty excited to see you guys.

67
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,750
But I think I'm more excited.

68
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:53,595
- Hi.

69
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:58,188
- She says mom's been boring.

70
00:03:58,188 --> 00:03:59,587
Mom just sits here.

71
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:02,004
- [Dad] Are the boys outside?

72
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:12,778
Not quite. (laughing)

73
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:14,611
So it's step in front.

74
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,446
And then behind.

75
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:18,683
And then in front.

76
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:19,887
And then behind.

77
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:20,848
There you go.

78
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,145
What are you training for?

79
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,395
- I don't know.

80
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:25,999
Being in the NFL?

81
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,369
- [Dad] Yep, if you're going
to be in the NFL someday,

82
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,488
you're going to have to get
really good at these drills.

83
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:32,965
So Isaac talks a lot about how he dreams

84
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,290
of someday playing in the NFL.

85
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,811
And it's so hard, because
I know that I've given him

86
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,508
pretty lame genetics for that goal.

87
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:43,048
He's going to be small, short,

88
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,963
and probably not the fastest guy,

89
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:48,809
but I love that Isaac wants
to keep that dream alive,

90
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:52,029
and keep trying and
practicing and doing drills

91
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,783
and trying to get better and better.

92
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:56,313
As a father I want to encourage
him to chase his dreams,

93
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:58,417
but I do also try to help
him find those things that

94
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:02,334
suit what he has been
naturally given as gifts.

95
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:07,293
(soothing music)

96
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:21,412
The human body is amazing.

97
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:25,521
So when a mom is sick, her
body sends stuff into the milk,

98
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:26,599
that the baby's going to drink,

99
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:30,143
that helps the baby fight
against the sickness.

100
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,555
Just think of how amazing that is.

101
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:33,960
Like that's a crazy super power.

102
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,627
She's almost asleep.

103
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:45,501
- Isaac that's a big one.

104
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,879
Don't they smell good guys?

105
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,624
So Jeremy's on a business call.

106
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:51,283
And Jennay is sleeping

107
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:54,170
and so the kids are
having a snack outside.

108
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,933
Oranges, gotta boost up the Vitamin C,

109
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,597
so nobody else gets sick.

110
00:05:57,597 --> 00:06:00,074
(laughter)

111
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:01,388
- Look how big I got mine.

112
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:04,609
- [Mom] Yeah, thanks for
helping her out Isaac.

113
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:08,173
Hey question, is the orange
pretty sweet or is it sour?

114
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,297
- Sweet.
- It's sweet.

115
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:12,630
- That is a really good mix.

116
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,232
- [Mom] A little bit sour for you?

117
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:18,423
She's finishing up her math.

118
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:21,427
Elise is almost done with her math book.

119
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,604
I'm so proud of her, she's
been working really hard.

120
00:06:23,604 --> 00:06:26,374
We just ordered her next book,
it should be here any day.

121
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,968
She's only got two more lessons
and then she's ready for it.

122
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:31,905
How are you feeling about
subtraction and addition?

123
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:32,761
- Easy.

124
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:35,754
I think subtraction is actually easier.

125
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,946
- I think it's because
you nailed addition first.

126
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,614
You really understood it.

127
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:40,834
You know those sick days

128
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,026
when holding your head up off the pillow

129
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:48,845
is absolutely exhausting,
I'm like oh, I'm tired.

130
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,743
Like it's just, it's just funny.

131
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,319
Today makes me so grateful
for how healthy I usually am

132
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,425
and I'm just hydrating and trying to rest

133
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,737
and Jeremy's being amazing
and taking care of me.

134
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:01,945
He is working at the moment

135
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,356
while the little girls nap.

136
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,065
So we're doing some math.

137
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:07,288
I did some school work
with the boys earlier.

138
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:09,206
It's nice even from laying on the couch

139
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:10,474
we can get school done.

140
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:13,094
Home school's pretty flexible.

141
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:14,173
- [Dad] Where we going?

142
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:15,256
- Gymnastics.

143
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:19,153
(peppy music)

144
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,084
What was that?

145
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:31,292
- Dad there's a sunset.

146
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:32,523
- [Dad] Isn't it pretty?

147
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:33,672
- Yeah.

148
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:35,719
- [Dad] I love sunsets.

149
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,134
- So a sweet friend of
mine just stopped by

150
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:37,967
and brought us dinner.

151
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:38,965
She heard that I was sick.

152
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,238
I have no idea how she
heard that I was sick.

153
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:42,578
I got a text from her about 30 minutes ago

154
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:44,120
and she said I'm bringing dinner by

155
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,906
and I was completely surprised
and just so grateful.

156
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:49,656
It's a really great feeling
to eat home cooked food

157
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,833
when you're not feeling well.

158
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,526
So look what she brought.

159
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:55,663
This is a cheesy rice, chicken casserole.

160
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:58,387
I already dug in and ate
some and it's so good.

161
00:08:58,387 --> 00:08:59,928
And some salad.

162
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:00,761
Broccoli.

163
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,406
And chocolate cookies.

164
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:08,072
The kids, Jeremy and I all are
going to enjoy this so much.

165
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:09,035
I already did.

166
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:10,703
It's really humbling sometimes

167
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:12,496
to be on the receiving act of service.

168
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,823
I'm more comfortable
sometimes taking people dinner

169
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:17,475
than receiving it, but it was
really, really thoughtful,

170
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,006
and yummy and delicious.

171
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:20,283
Thank you.

172
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,638
- [Dad] Aren't we so lucky
that someone brought us dinner?

173
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:24,345
- It is delicious.

174
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:25,550
- [Dad] It is.

175
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,748
So, are you feeling any better?

176
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:30,745
- Um, I feel a little better
than I did this morning.

177
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:32,942
It's probably mostly because I'm in my bed

178
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:35,665
and I know I get to sleep
for the next few hours.

179
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:38,016
But I'm hopeful that I'll
feel better tomorrow.

180
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:40,259
- Have you told everyone
about your special blanket?

181
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,380
- This is my weighted blanket.

182
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,805
- It's like 40 pounds.

183
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:45,676
How heavy is it?

184
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:47,040
- It's not 40 pounds.

185
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,117
- It feels like it.

186
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:52,269
- It's 15 pounds and it's
supposed to help with anxiety.

187
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,143
And I love it.

188
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:56,062
It feels like a nice hug.

189
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,449
- Huge blanket.

190
00:09:57,449 --> 00:09:58,449
- I love it.

191
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,291
So I sleep with my weighted blanket on me.

192
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,660
- I hope you feel better.

193
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,675
- Me too.

194
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,828
And I hope all the kids
and you stay healthy.

195
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:09,208
Good night.

196
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,208
J-House Out.

197
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:14,506
(laughter)

198
00:10:22,324 --> 00:00:00,000
- Laura's instructions exactly.
