1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,170
- [Kendra] You guys want
to make giant Kisses?

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,102
- Yeah.

3
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:06,060
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,610
- [Jeremy] Alright, Caleb
has his treasure hunt

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,500
ready for us.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,510
Make sure the violin is in the
van before slamming the door.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,080
- [Mugga] Happy
Valentine's Day, everybody.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,640
- So today is Valentine's Day,

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,070
and nothing shows Kendra
love more than decluttering.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,442
We're donating some more stuff,

11
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:31,240
and we're dropping off a bunch of boxes

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,090
that have been sitting in our garage.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,904
Alright, lets unload the boxes.

14
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:39,487
(upbeat music)

15
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:49,413
Thanks for helping.

16
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,440
So Papa and Mugga are here
with us on Valentine's Day,

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,950
and they have a little
something-something for the kids.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,400
- [Elise] Close your eyes everybody.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,802
No peeking.

20
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:58,284
- [Laura] Lisey, don't peek.

21
00:00:58,284 --> 00:00:59,950
- Okay, you can open 'em.

22
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,864
Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.

23
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:03,164
(children gasp)

24
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:03,997
- What?

25
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,196
- [Isaac] Thank you.

26
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:07,779
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,389
- [Kendra] One for you, Jeremy.

28
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:14,786
- [Jeremy] Sweet.

29
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:15,784
- [Mugga] Is it coconut?

30
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,900
Oh, it is.

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,733
- [Papa] Wow.

32
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:18,693
- [Jeremy] The pink stuff is coconut.

33
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:19,526
- Mmm.

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
- This is Janae's first Valentine.

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,210
It says, "Janae, we love you.

36
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,864
"You have a great smile."

37
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:26,971
Oh, for me?

38
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,930
- You can open it later.

39
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,263
I went to a special class (mumbles)--

40
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:31,096
- Oh, that's so great.

41
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,610
- [Mugga] Where we
learned to make, we made--

42
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,443
- [Jeremy] You made that?

43
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:34,276
- [Mugga] Stamps.

44
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:35,140
- They gave us Valentine's

45
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,795
and wrote five things
that they love about us.

46
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:41,378
(upbeat music)

47
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,740
- So there's people that we know

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,060
that have been going through a hard time,

49
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,700
and we thought it'd be fun
to show them love today.

50
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,430
- So since today is Valentine's Day,

51
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,880
we are going to study the
human heart and how it works.

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,720
So what is the job of the heart?

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,060
- It pumps in and out blood.

54
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,070
- It makes owies bleed.

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,210
- It has to do with blood.

56
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,043
You're right.

57
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:22,500
Okay, so this is what the heart
looks like right here, okay?

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,780
- [Elise] It doesn't
really look like a heart.

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,690
- It looks different than
the shape that we draw

60
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,770
that's a heart, right?

61
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,420
Okay, everybody take your fist.

62
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,890
This is how big your heart is.

63
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,500
So put it right there.

64
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,220
That's where your heart is.

65
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,350
Every person's heart is about
the same size as their fist.

66
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,530
And then this is if you
cut the heart in half

67
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,670
so you could see the inside.

68
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,280
This is what the inside
of the heart looks like.

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,590
- I kinda see a heart right here.

70
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,510
- [Kendra] Like a heart shape,

71
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,120
like loop, loop.
- Yeah.

72
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,690
- So here's the heart, and it
pumps fresh oxygenated blood

73
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,966
through all your body so that it can keep

74
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,100
all the organs healthy and strong.

75
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,006
And it does that through arteries.

76
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,320
- [Elise] And you can breathe.

77
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,200
- You breathe, so you
get oxygenated blood.

78
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,916
- [Jeremy] It's unbelievable.

79
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,140
- It really is.

80
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,680
So here's the heart muscle.

81
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,040
And remember, these are the arteries

82
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,700
that feed the heart itself.

83
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,060
If the heart doesn't get
oxygen, it can't pump.

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,540
And if it can't pump, what
happens to your whole body?

85
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,570
- It just stops.

86
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,830
- Stops getting fed.

87
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,260
- And the problem is the
heart can die very quickly

88
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,610
if it doesn't get blood.

89
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,370
There's three main arteries
that come into the heart.

90
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,170
You can't see the side one here.

91
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,160
And mine got blocked
right there on this side.

92
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,090
- [Jeremy] And Papa's actually scheduling

93
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,300
open heart surgery to get that fixed.

94
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,200
- How does the heart keep pumping

95
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,800
while it's out in open heart surgery?

96
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,160
- [Jeremy] So they have
machines that artificially do

97
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,140
what the heart and lungs
do to keep you alive,

98
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,960
and then you hook it back up to the heart.

99
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,820
- And I have actually
seen open heart surgery.

100
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,780
So I've actually seen that
machine when I was a nurse.

101
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,807
- [Jeremy] Yes, she fainted.

102
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,290
Just kidding.
(group laughs)

103
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,530
- Okay, so we're gonna
color these pictures

104
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,610
and label the different
parts of the heart.

105
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,900
- Kendra does such a
good job with the kids

106
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,070
where she'll have them
all doing one activity

107
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,695
but all at different levels
of their grade level.

108
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:08,278
(upbeat music)

109
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,938
- [Kendra] So Laura finished up her heart.

110
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:21,420
But then I turn over the page
and discovered this drawing

111
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,600
which I have never seen
Laura draw like this before.

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,150
Did you draw that?

113
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,240
It was you?

114
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,520
No, Lisey drew it.

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,980
- No, I did!

116
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,813
- [Kendra] You did?

117
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:31,420
It looks amazing.

118
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,578
I love the eyelashes that
you put on those people.

119
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:35,670
- [Laura] Thanks.

120
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,770
- And now, she wants to work
on this picture of the heart.

121
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,603
She did it.

122
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,890
Lisey, that looks awesome.

123
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,930
So two or three months ago,
my dad had a heart attack

124
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,420
and he went into emergency surgery

125
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,220
and had several stents
placed, but further evaluation

126
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,870
has shown that he has more
blockages going on in his heart.

127
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,620
And so we've just found out
that in two or three months,

128
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,550
he's going to be having another surgery.

129
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,100
And this time, it's gonna be an open heart

130
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,260
triple bypass surgery.

131
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,020
So we're learning about the heart

132
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,460
and learning about what we can
do to take care of our heart.

133
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,060
And hopefully, this
helps the kids understand

134
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,320
what's going on with Papa
when that time comes.

135
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,056
- [Jeremy] Laura, what are we gonna do?

136
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,210
- We're gonna put up the bird feeder.

137
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,600
- [Jeremy] The bird feeder.

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,980
We're trying to decide where to put it,

139
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,870
so we're testing different spots outside

140
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,462
to see where we can see it from inside.

141
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:20,295
Hi!

142
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:21,250
- [Kendra] Nae-nae, there it is!

143
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,200
- [Jeremy] Hi, dad.

144
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:26,061
- [Papa] Okay.

145
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:27,601
- [Jeremy] Putting the birdseed in.

146
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,850
- [Kendra] This is like
treats for the birds, guys.

147
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,870
- This side is filled the most.

148
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,150
- [Jeremy] So what's neat
about this bird feeder

149
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,619
is that it's set up that
if squirrels come on,

150
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,210
they can't get the seed.

151
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,450
- It's weighted for four
ounces, believe it or not.

152
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,200
The birds are under and out.

153
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,930
- So my parents actually
got this bird feeder for us

154
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,516
for Christmas, so it's
fun to get it put up.

155
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,665
- [Jeremy] There it is.

156
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:50,498
- There it is.

157
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:51,421
- [Jeremy] Come, birds!

158
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:54,780
- Birds, we have food for you!

159
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,404
- We have a free restaurant.

160
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:57,630
Come and get it.

161
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,100
- Now we gotta probably
sit back and be quiet

162
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,270
so we don't scare 'em.

163
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,120
So while we've been dealing with snow,

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,220
we have a couple of days
this week that are above

165
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,630
60 degrees, so we're
taking advantage of that.

166
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,760
Papa, pumping up the tires.

167
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,751
We haven't used the bikes for
a while with all the snow.

168
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,334
(upbeat music)

169
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,980
- [Kendra] We are gearing
up to go on a walk,

170
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,530
and she won't keep her hat on.

171
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,030
You're gonna get cold, silly.

172
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,340
That was a big jump.

173
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,700
- One time, we went on a walk

174
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,370
and we came over here, and it was so fun.

175
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,187
- [Kendra] Yeah, you love the rocks.

176
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:41,186
- I memorized it.

177
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:42,150
- It's a good memory.

178
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,240
So we're going on a walk.

179
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,257
My mom's from Arizona, so she's all cold.

180
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:46,090
- So cold!

181
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,680
- And I'm like, "It's nice out today."

182
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,070
But I did bundle Janae

183
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,200
because nice in Kansas City
this time of year is cold.

184
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,140
But she won't keep her hat on.

185
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,220
You're a happy girl.

186
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,920
While we're walking,

187
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,620
Papa is taking the big
kids for a bike ride.

188
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,453
And I love it.

189
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,950
I think they look so
cute riding their bikes.

190
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,790
I don't know why bike
riding is so cute to me,

191
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,480
but it just makes me smile.

192
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,760
Okay, what did I give you guys?

193
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,593
- Kisses.

194
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:12,426
- [Children] Kisses.

195
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:13,320
- [Kendra] What kind of Kisses are these?

196
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,866
- [Children] Hershey's.

197
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,430
- [Kendra] Yup, they are chocolate Kisses.

198
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,500
Do you guys know that when I
was a little girl, one time,

199
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,500
my mom, Mugga, made giant Kisses
for us for Valentine's Day?

200
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,210
Giant.

201
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,350
Do you guys wanna make giant Kisses?

202
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,183
- Yeah.

203
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,016
- Yeah.

204
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:31,932
- [Kendra] Giant ones?

205
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:32,765
- How big?

206
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:33,770
- But they would be rice crispy treats?

207
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,603
- [Kendra] Yes!

208
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,140
We're gonna make it out of rice
crispies instead of Kisses,

209
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,970
but we're gonna make
it look just like this.

210
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,030
Do you think that's possible?

211
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,863
- Yeah!

212
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:41,850
You can shape 'em.

213
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,683
- This big?

214
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:43,516
- [Kendra] We'll see.

215
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:44,349
- Can we eat it?

216
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,120
- [Kendra] Once you have
both your rice crispy treats,

217
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,953
you can eat 'em.

218
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,070
Sound good?

219
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,903
Who wants to help me make it.

220
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:49,736
- Me.

221
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:50,569
- Me!

222
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:51,690
- [Kendra] I really
particularly like your outfit,

223
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,523
by the way.

224
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:55,568
Elsa with the Minnie apron
is just working for you.

225
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:56,487
And the socks.

226
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:57,780
- [Mugga] And the long stocking socks.

227
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,613
- [Kendra] And the socks.

228
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:00,481
So first step is make rice crispy treats.

229
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,064
(upbeat music)

230
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:19,494
Okay, this way, it won't
stick to your hands.

231
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:22,476
There you go.

232
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:23,309
Good job.

233
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,561
- [Mugga] Compact it so
that's tight and squishy.

234
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:26,793
- I might need a little more

235
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:29,610
because I'm pushing it out pretty good.

236
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,310
- [Isaac] Oh, you mean
pack it in that much.

237
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,230
- Yeah, pack it all in.

238
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,309
I forgot to butter my own hands.

239
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,142
Oops.

240
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:37,380
- [Jeremy] Laura eats 50% of the time

241
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,347
she's making something.

242
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,870
(Mugga laughs)

243
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,320
It's like, "Sure, I'll help make it."

244
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,770
- [Kendra] So now shape
that like a Hershey Kiss.

245
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,860
- While we're making these Kisses,

246
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,350
we have birds flying up
and using the bird feeder.

247
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,230
It's really fun.

248
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:57,459
- Now bring it up, and
now we bring this up.

249
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:00,399
So wrap it up to make it
look like this Kiss, okay?

250
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,890
- [Mugga] Wanna go get the
next message and I'll help him?

251
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,723
- [Kendra] Yeah, sure.

252
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,790
- [Mugga] There we go.

253
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,570
- [Jeremy] So Kendra wrote
little notes to each of the kids.

254
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,670
- [Kendra] And then you wrap it up.

255
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:19,090
Laura's Kiss keeps getting
littler and littler.

256
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,260
What keeps happening?

257
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,460
- [Jeremy] It's gonna end
up being a ball of tinfoil.

258
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,860
- [Kendra] She's like, "What?

259
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,070
"Wasn't this the idea?"

260
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,903
- [Mugga] Then hold it up here.

261
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,116
You gotta flip the thing up.

262
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,855
- [Kendra] Now you get to eat.

263
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,688
- Let the feast begin!

264
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,140
- That's good.

265
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,110
- [Kendra] It's like
the size of your head.

266
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,472
- [Jeremy] How'd you feel
about giving a Valentine?

267
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:53,305
- Good.

268
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:54,138
- [Jeremy] What'd you like about it?

269
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:56,970
- I liked that they were happy.

270
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,280
- Yeah, it's a fun thing to
show people we love them.

271
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,710
So I almost forgot that we
have gymnastics tonight.

272
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,140
And we're running out of time,
so we just decided to stop

273
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,840
at Chick-Fil-A and grab some
dinner before gymnastics.

274
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,130
You're it, Cubby.

275
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,590
- We have approximately 10
minutes before gymnastics.

276
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,290
So we're going to chow down
here and then go to gymnastics.

277
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,123
Actually, just kidding.

278
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:20,560
We can make this a totally
romantic five-minute date night.

279
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
The kids are gonna eat here,

280
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,820
and Jeremy and I are gonna eat over here.

281
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,220
Yes, that's how it's done.

282
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,740
- We were like changing in the car.

283
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,533
We were like five to 10 minutes late.

284
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:33,116
(upbeat music)

285
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:42,740
So since we've been home from gymnastics,

286
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,470
the kids are all making
treasure hunts for each other.

287
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,727
Is this yours, Laura?

288
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,920
(gasps) Is that the first note?

289
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,400
- Do you know how to read scribbles?

290
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,170
- [Jeremy] Yeah, of course.

291
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,350
- It says it's in here.

292
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,943
- [Jeremy] That's what it says?

293
00:10:57,943 --> 00:10:59,200
- [Laura] This.

294
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,033
- [Jeremy] (gasps) There is candy.

295
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,530
- [Laura] No, you don't get to eat it.

296
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,534
It's for Caleb.

297
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:03,610
Just to show you.

298
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,404
- [Jeremy] Oh, that was
a good treasure hunt.

299
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,824
- [Laura] I get to do
it for everybody else,

300
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:10,120
so I have to hide it.

301
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
- [Jeremy] Okay.

302
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,800
Alright, Caleb has his
treasure hunt ready for us.

303
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,860
What's the first clue?

304
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,810
- The first clue is on
the side of the table

305
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,730
where I did my, made my treasure hunt.

306
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,010
- [Jeremy] Go look for it.

307
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,802
- (gasps) Is it taped?

308
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:27,860
Whoa!

309
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,753
In the cupboard?

310
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:31,104
- Yeah.

311
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,987
Not in it, it's on it.

312
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:36,080
- (gasps) Right there!

313
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,330
Where I watch football.

314
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,740
- [Caleb] Watch football.

315
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,000
- [Kendra] Laura, say
where me and Isaac sleep.

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,150
- Where me and Isaac sleep.

317
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,130
- [Jeremy] Let's go!

318
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,665
- On the bookcase.

319
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,050
- [Kendra] Over here on the bookcase?

320
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,740
- [Caleb] No, not that bookcase.

321
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,670
- [Kendra] Oh, the other bookcase.

322
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,880
- I found it.

323
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,880
Where I snuggle with--

324
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,713
- [Kendra] Dad.

325
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:01,546
- Dad.

326
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,098
- Where Laura strolls her babies.

327
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,730
- [Kendra] In the basement!

328
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,787
It's a great treasure hunt, Caleb.

329
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:08,940
- Candy!

330
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,479
- There's a lot of pieces.

331
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,610
- Six pieces.

332
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,810
- Nae-Nae's excited.

333
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,840
- What's fun about these treasure hunts

334
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,650
is the kids worked on
them for like 45 minutes.

335
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,120
- I love that this was the kids' idea.

336
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
They worked really hard on it.

337
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,591
And treasure hunts are
actually hard to coordinate.

338
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:22,810
I'm impressed.

339
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,643
Good job, Caleb.

340
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,476
- [Jeremy] Good work.

341
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:25,909
Alright, go get your 'jamas on.

342
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,492
(upbeat music)

343
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,590
How was violin?

344
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,423
- Good.

345
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,460
- (laughs) Make sure
the violin is in the van

346
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,850
before slamming the door.

347
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,790
Open the door, and close the door.

348
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,181
Nailed it.

349
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,014
(Isaac chuckles)

350
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:49,180
Before going to bed, Elise made us

351
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,470
this adorable little Valentine.

352
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,303
And she was cute.

353
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:55,002
She wanted to see us kiss,

354
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:56,370
(chuckles) which was really funny.

355
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,190
It was reminding me too
of a couple of years ago,

356
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,520
I invited you to help me
share a Valentine with Kendra

357
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,590
of writing down things
you loved about her.

358
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,040
Then I posted it all over our room

359
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,410
because we got so many amazing
loving things from you.

360
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,210
I invited you to send emails with things

361
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,600
you love about Kendra, and
the response was overwhelming.

362
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,660
I got so many responses.

363
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,890
I thought it would be
really fun to help Kendra

364
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,327
see how much she's loved.

365
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:27,340
(Kendra gasps)

366
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Each paper is an individual
letter from a viewer

367
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,195
about what they love about you.

368
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:39,150
- Guys, this is so overwhelmingly amazing!

369
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,660
Valentine's Day is a fun day
to celebrate with the kids

370
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,580
and as a family, but Jeremy
and I also wanna make sure

371
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,530
that we take time to celebrate together.

372
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,210
So we're actually gonna
do that another day.

373
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,730
We have a babysitter lined
up and gifts for each other,

374
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,240
and we're going to do a
little Valentine's date night

375
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,590
that's special just for
us 'cause it's important

376
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,010
to celebrate the love of the whole family,

377
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,610
but it's also really important
to take care of our marriage.

378
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,330
Well, Jeremy and I actually
have a playlist, I think,

379
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,440
on our channel of our love story--

380
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,620
- That's true.
- Where you get to hear about

381
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,500
how we met, our first date.

382
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,970
There's some, you know, disagreement

383
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,930
on what our first date actually was.

384
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,850
And then our first kiss.
- Our first kiss.

385
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,600
- So if you're interested
in hearing more about that,

386
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,960
you can check out that playlist.

387
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,400
And for now, we're gonna go to bed.

388
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,233
- Good night.

389
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,066
- J House out.

390
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,238
- Thank you.

391
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:25,238
(upbeat rock music)

392
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,609
Yeah!

393
00:14:28,609 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's here!
