1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,449
- Well we are packed up

2
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:02,668
and getting ready to say goodbye.

3
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:04,290
- [Jeremy] What was one
of your favorite things

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,129
that happened here?

5
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:07,712
(bright music)

6
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:11,737
(out breath)

7
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:12,730
- Do you see that, that's my breath.

8
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,563
It is cold.

9
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,390
- [Jeremy] How does it
feel to be home, you guys?

10
00:00:25,378 --> 00:00:26,630
- Good morning.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,290
- [Jeremy] This is what we're
doing at 6:50 in the morning.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,850
- Why not?

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,590
- Snuggle time.

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,423
- Stretching.

15
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:35,290
- [Jeremy] You guys, come
check out the sunrise,

16
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,903
it's amazing today.

17
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:37,736
- Whoa.

18
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:40,910
Oh my.

19
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,304
That is awesome.

20
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:45,887
(uptempo electronic music)

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,530
It's like the sun is
like, makes a volcanoes

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,530
inside of mountains.

23
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:58,037
- I'm walking backwards.

24
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,760
- You can walk backwards?

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
Ooh that's fancy.

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,870
Well I am sneaking in
one last morning walk

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,870
before we leave this morning.

28
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm soaking up the last rays of sunshine.

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,490
And what's on my heart this morning

30
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,960
is I've been thinking
about how I've honestly

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,070
been super sad about leaving San Diego.

32
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,420
And yesterday, I realized
how much my attitude

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,280
was rubbing off on my kids.

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,800
And that is always a good reminder to me

35
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,420
that I need to change my attitude.

36
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,760
So I was thinking about it last night

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,640
and I want to focus on
gratitude and contentment.

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,480
Instead of being sad that we're leaving,

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,450
being grateful that we were able to come,

40
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,780
being content with the
experiences that we had.

41
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,650
And going home with gratitude

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,840
for our beautiful home
and our beautiful life

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,673
in Kansas City.

44
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:39,860
And all the wonderful
things that there are to do

45
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,140
in cold weather and with our
friends and family there,

46
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,040
and so that's my focus today,

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,710
is on gratitude and contentment

48
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,973
and hopefully, that can
rub off on my kids too.

49
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:51,140
(lively music)

50
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,630
Well we are packed up

51
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,460
and getting ready to say
goodbye to this beautiful house

52
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,870
that has been a house of so many memories

53
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,430
and so much joy and some stressful moments

54
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,430
and amazing views and sunsets

55
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,775
and good food and memories, so.

56
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:07,520
Goodbye beautiful little house.

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,353
- Bye.
- Ah.

58
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:10,580
= [Kendra] This is where you
had your fourth birthday.

59
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,940
- Yeah.

60
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,820
- [Kendra] And this is where you took

61
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,342
your first steps Janae.

62
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:16,175
(Janae vocalizing)

63
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,090
- And Lise's birthday.

64
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,870
- And Lise's birthday

65
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,930
and visits with grandparents.

66
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,720
So our last thing before
we load up the car

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,890
is to gather the family

68
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,620
and just pray in gratitude

69
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,360
for this amazing trip that we've had.

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,193
- So I want to just go over some of

71
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:30,520
our favorite memories
while we've been here.

72
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,340
What was one of your favorite
things that happened here?

73
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,500
- My birthday.

74
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,509
- [Jeremy] Your birthday?

75
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:36,230
- My birthday cake.

76
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,813
(bright music)

77
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,621
- [Jeremy] It's your birthday.

78
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,454
- Yay.

79
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,287
- [Jeremy] Our little mermaid.

80
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:47,294
- [Kendra] You could probably
disappear inside that thing.

81
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:48,374
(laughing)

82
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:49,535
- Thank you.

83
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:52,118
(bright music)

84
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,653
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,630
- Renting bikes and Legoland.

86
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,203
- It's a little teensy tiny.

87
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:14,293
(upbeat music)

88
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:15,804
(yelling)

89
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:18,054
(laughing)

90
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:22,905
(laughing)

91
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:25,992
(yelling)

92
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,940
- [Jeremy] Woo hoo!

93
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,890
- My birthday of course.

94
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,025
Getting ice cream cones.

95
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:35,608
(bright music)

96
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:39,018
(gasps)

97
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,180
A camera!

98
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,013
- [Jeremy] Yep.

99
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,140
- Clip on earrings?

100
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:44,871
Thank you.

101
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:47,865
- You can share 'em with me.

102
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,760
- [Jeremy] What flavor did you do?

103
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,493
- Lime creme.

104
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:52,340
- So I think one of my favorite things

105
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,190
was just the normal life
things we were able to do.

106
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,710
We were able to go to church here,

107
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,510
we were able to get flu shots,

108
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,330
we were able to play around,

109
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,500
climb the tree,

110
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,830
play in the backyard,

111
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,020
I loved those moments.

112
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,785
- Climbing the tree with Isaac and Elise.

113
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,657
(soaring music)

114
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,407
It's awesome up here.

115
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,587
- [Elise] Remember do the pose.

116
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,140
- Oh.
- V.

117
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,440
- [Jeremy] Good job buddy.

118
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,851
- I think my favorite
were the hikes we went on.

119
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,200
(lively rock music)

120
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,033
- [Jeremy] What do you think Caleb?

121
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,275
Are we gonna fit through?

122
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,860
(in high voice) I liked the ocean--

123
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,870
- [Kendra] And the dogs.

124
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,730
- [Jeremy] And playing on the beach.

125
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,239
- [Elise] And walking.

126
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,541
(waves rolling)

127
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,374
- Woo!

128
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:39,800
- [Jeremy] I think she's a little nervous.

129
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,593
- [Kendra] She does
not know what to think.

130
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:44,904
(Kendra laughing)

131
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:45,987
What is this?

132
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:50,800
(uptempo electronic music)

133
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:01,759
And so it begins.

134
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,646
♪ Tomorrow I love ya tomorrow ♪

135
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:09,063
♪ You're only a day away ♪

136
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,048
- I wish we could skip
the rest of the day.

137
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:16,631
(uptempo electronic music)

138
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,683
- [Kendra] Jeremy's making sure

139
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:27,820
we didn't leave anything behind.

140
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,060
- Ooh, a binky.

141
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,262
- [Kendra] Ooh we need that.

142
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:31,118
- Good find.

143
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,276
Minnie Mouse.

144
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:34,630
(Kendra laughs)

145
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,880
- [Kendra] And we're off.

146
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:40,221
(lively tropical music)

147
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:48,470
(Janae laughing)

148
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,500
- It's a longer wait than I expected,

149
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,333
but I think we'll still make our flight.

150
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,800
- So we are finally on the plane.

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
You're on a plane.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,140
- [Kendra] She likes sitting on the seat,

153
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,340
looking like a big girl.

154
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,762
- [Jeremy] Hey Laura,
where are we heading?

155
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,240
- Kansas City.

156
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,120
- [Jeremy] Did you hear what
the temperature is there?

157
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,020
- I think it was like 18 Fahrenheit.

158
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,054
- [Jeremy] From 70 degrees to 18 degrees.

159
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,216
- Is it warm?

160
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:16,049
- [Jeremy] That's cold.

161
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:16,882
- Oh.

162
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,492
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

163
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:20,840
(laughing)

164
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,691
- You laugh like me.

165
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:24,036
Yeah, oh my gosh.

166
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:24,869
- Ahhh.

167
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,490
She's tired.

168
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,323
Hopefully she naps.

169
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,430
She napped on the way out here real well.

170
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,670
Elise is reading the
safety information card.

171
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:36,550
I'm proud of her.
- Look at all those cars.

172
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,668
- It's gonna start.

173
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:41,251
(lively music)

174
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,683
- It's 20 degrees at home.

175
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,910
(Announcement on PA)

176
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,471
- [Jeremy] Why is it white?

177
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:00,807
- Snow.

178
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:01,857
- [Jeremy] It's snow.

179
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,364
There's snow down there.

180
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:07,947
(gentle music)

181
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,392
- That part was cold.

182
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:22,246
- I know.

183
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:23,079
(out breath)

184
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,912
- Do you see that, that's my breath.

185
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:24,745
It's cold.

186
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,140
Well that was honestly

187
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,170
probably one of Janae's hardest flights.

188
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,960
She's just getting big enough

189
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,140
that she doesn't want to sit still,

190
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,970
she wants to get down and she can't.

191
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,610
She was pretty fussy.

192
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,320
But we made it and we're here

193
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
and I'm excited to get
home and get unpacked

194
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,100
and settled in and see
our friends and family.

195
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,510
Nae Nae's on the look out.

196
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,020
Uncle Brent is coming to pick us up

197
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,127
from the airport.

198
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:45,960
- I got it all.

199
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,220
- [Kendra] We've got it all.

200
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,408
Here it is.

chin and grin and say ♪

202
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:58,693
♪ The sun will come out tomorrow ♪

203
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:01,480
Same song, different state,

204
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,030
different car, same kids.

205
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,460
(lively music)

206
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,130
- [Jeremy] Alright you
guys, unpack your backpacks.

207
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,380
And we gotta get ready,
you have school tomorrow.

208
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:12,155
- Yay.

209
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:14,431
My make-up!

210
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,383
- [Jeremy] Is your make-up here?

211
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,450
- [Laura] Uh-huh.

212
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,860
- [Jeremy] How does it
feel to be home, you guys?

213
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,693
- I like it.

214
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:22,230
- My room is just like a new place

215
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,340
I've never been before,

216
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,330
but I've been in it a thousand times.

217
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:27,259
- Chi Chi!

218
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:32,494
I'm glad you're here,
I'm glad you're safe.

219
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:36,914
Soon it will be safe and not lost.

220
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,294
- [Caleb] Goodnight, J House out.

221

223
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,140
- [Kendra] Thanks for helping Elise.

224
00:08:45,140 --> 00:00:00,000
How's it going dude?
