00:00:00,207 --> 00:00:01,386
(Janae cooing)

2
00:00:01,386 --> 00:00:02,219
- Hi guys.

3
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:03,676
- [Kendra] Hi guys.

4
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:04,645
(bright music)

5
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:05,990
(hammering)

6
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,301
- I wanted to weigh this.

7
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:10,606
- Tonight is bring your
parent to ballet night.

8
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:14,106
- What if our house was made out of candy?

9
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:19,774
- Hello.

10
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:22,578
- Yeah, he's right over the corner.

11
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:23,580
- Isaac and Elise,

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,326
what are you really doing?

13
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,826
- I'm playing with Janae.

14
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,576
- I'm keeping warm with my dress.

15
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:33,634
- [Isaac] Aw, I wish I could do that.

16
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:37,010
- [Jeremy] Did you guys hear that noise?

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,218
The chirping?
- The fire alarm.

18
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:40,813
- [Jeremy] We have a fire alarm

19
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:42,158
that's battery is chirping.

20
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:43,374
Luckily it didn't happen
in the middle of the night,

21
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:44,918
but we need to fix it this morning.

22
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:47,961
- In real life, in houses, do fire go on?

23
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:50,108
- [Jeremy] Sometimes
there are fires in houses.

24
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:52,572
- When do fire alarms don't go on

25
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:54,469
in these kinds of houses.

26
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:55,636
- [Jeremy] Well if we don't have a fire,

27
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:56,926
then a fire alarm doesn't go off.

28
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:59,624
So I'm trying to figure
out if it's the smoke alarm

29
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:00,477
in the boy's bedroom

30
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,098
or the one right here in our hallway.

31
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:05,007
Which one is it?

32
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:05,841
(battery beeping)

33
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:06,674
- That one.

34
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:08,194
- [Jeremy] You think it's this one?

35
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,519
(crying)

36
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,245
- I need a new battery.

37
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,651
- [Jeremy] Are you
feeling nervous about it?

38
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:13,484
- Yeah.

39
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:15,753
- [Jeremy] We're gonna
fix it right now, okay?

40
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,336
(lively music)

41
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:21,495
- So Laura, the fire alarms are just there

42
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:24,052
to help keep us safe.

43
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:27,012
- But when fire alarms go on

44
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:29,084
in these kinds of houses?

45
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:31,380
- Yeah, if there's a fire.

46
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,977
So the fire alarm just
watches all the time

47
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:35,652
to make sure we're safe.

48
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:37,569
- I want to move today.

49
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:40,465
- Yeah, you feeling nervous?

50
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:41,712
- Yeah.

51
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:44,584
- Since the bad storm when the trampoline

52
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,881
got thrown around, Laura's just been

53
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,153
a little bit more nervous.

54
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:51,078
She's been pretty
concerned about our house,

55
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,961
how strong it is.

56
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:54,794
But Laura, we're safe.

57
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:57,469
- What happens if there's fire in houses?

58
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,302
- If there's fire in houses,

59
00:01:58,302 --> 00:02:00,377
then the fire alarms go off

60
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:02,698
and they make a really loud sound,

61
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:05,120
so that you know, they hey,

62
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,559
there's a fire in your house somewhere,

63
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,431
get out, get out, so you stay safe.

64
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,967
So then we leave our house

65
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,592
and we call the fire department,

66
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:14,517
and the comes and takes care of the fire.

67
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,898
And then we say, thank
you fire department.

68
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:19,690
- But is there gonna be fire in our house?

69
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,962
- Nope, there's not gonna
be a fire in our house.

70
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:24,540
- When are we gonna move?

71
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,164
- We're gonna move someday.

72
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:28,027
- [Jeremy] Probably.

73
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:29,674
- Maybe today.

74
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,300
- Probably not today.

75
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,133
- [Jeremy] If we go to another house,

76
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,995
it's gonna have fire alarms, too.

77
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:35,436
- What kind of house do you want?

78
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,398
- I want a new one to build far away.

79
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:39,640
- Do you think it'd be fun to have

80
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,778
a house with pink inside of it?

81
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,018
- Sure.

82
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:47,321
- Oh, what if our house
was made out of candy

83
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:51,384
and you could eat our house?
(playful piano music)

84
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,840
- We could get candy

85
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,757
and just put it inside.

86
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,502
- Candy inside the house, great idea.

87
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:01,752
- But don't put fire on it.

88
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:04,744
- [Jeremy] No fire.

89
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:05,577
- [Kendra] We love you Laura.

90
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:07,399
We're keeping you safe, okay?

91
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,366
- [Jeremy] Alright, we're to the point

92
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,828
of the Pinewood Derby for painting.

93
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:13,995
(tropical beat music)

94
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:25,738
- Wow, the tape really worked.

95
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,501
- [Jeremy] Alright, so
now you can paint the top.

96
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,765
(lively music)

97
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,109
- That really looks good.

98
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,192
- Oh that does look good.

99
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:37,710
- [Jeremy] There you go.

100
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,543
- I think it looks pretty good.

101
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:39,410
- [Jeremy] You did a great job.

102
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,327
So Isaac is cleaning out the paint.

103
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:47,259
(drill humming)

104
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,092
- Hi.

105
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:50,255
- [Caleb] Hi.

106
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:53,819
(Janae vocalizing)

107
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,339
- So Isaac and Caleb and
I have been sitting here

108
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,826
across the room from Janae,

109
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:58,443
waving at her, saying hi,

110
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:00,163
and she's putting her
arm up next to her head

111
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:01,417
and going, hi.

112
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,889
It's so cute.

113
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,427
I'm gonna see if I can
try to get her to do it

114
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,411
in front of the camera.

115
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,411
- [Boys] Hi.

116
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:11,348
(Janae vocalizing)

117
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:13,310
- [Kendra] Can you say hi?

118
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,143
Hi.

119
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:19,695
She's on the phone (laughs).

120
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:20,528
- Hi.

121
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,889
- [Kendra] Oh I heard it.

122
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:22,806
- [All] Hi.

123
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:25,598
- Hi guys.

124
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,846
- Hi guys.

125
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,766
Well we've run into a few stresses

126
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:29,958
with the Pinewood Derby car.

127
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,138
And of course, today's the day it's due,

128
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,345
and so we're running out of time.

129
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:34,705
They're doing a really great job,

130
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:36,315
but there's been some frustrating moments,

131
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:39,073
which that just happens
in projects like this.

132
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:39,944
- This is just so small

133
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:41,136
that the wood actually broke

134
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:43,518
when I was putting in his wheel,

135
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,798
so we're gonna have to fix that.

136
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:47,117
And we're running out of time.

137
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:48,061
- [Kendra] Do you think we can do it?

138
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,975
- Yeah, we have like over four hours.

139
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:53,558
(lively music)

140
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,685
- I don't know if this is gonna be

141
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,173
a car that works at all.

142
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,308
There are several things
we made mistakes on,

143
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,181
but it was fun to work

144
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:03,654
with Isaac to make it.
- Yep.

145
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,050
- [Jeremy] So what are you guys doing?

146
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,259
- I'm gonna build this.

147
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,871
And Elise is gonna build one.

148
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:10,566
And I'm gonna have friends build one,

149
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:13,170
and then after that, I'm
gonna have my friends

150
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,195
help me build a track.

151
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:15,717
- [Jeremy] Build a Pinewood Derby track?

152
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:16,744
- Yep.

153
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:20,224
- We still have a lot more work to do.

154
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:23,127
(bright music)

155
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:26,628
I like how bananas in
smoothies make it creamy.

156
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:28,355
- [Jeremy] Yes, it's very good.

157
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:29,188
Do you guys want some?

158
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:30,213
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

159
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,463
(whirring)

160
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,982
(laughing)

161
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,191
- [Caleb] Zero.

162
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:43,452
I already got mine.

163
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:44,285
- [Jeremy] You already got a straw?

164
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:46,839
- Thank you Dad so much,
I really appreciate it.

165
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,672
- [Jeremy] No problem.

166
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,822
- [Kendra] Is it creamy?

167
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:56,374
- I like creamy things.

168
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:57,349
- 21, 22,

169
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,838
- [Kendra] Oh, everybody's joining in.

170
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:01,005
- 25, 26, 27,

171
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,794
- It hurts my tummy.

172
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,847
- That's the idea.
- It can.

173
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,846
- [Jeremy] Here we go.

174
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,421
- That hurts.

175
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,834
- [Kendra] Do a push
up Laura, you go down.

176
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:11,677
- It hurts so bad.

177
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:13,589
Let's see if I got stronger.

178
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:14,859
I think I did.

179
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:17,507
- What she makes us do, is you have to go

180
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,757
(laughing)

181
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:25,565
- They always make
exercising more effective.

182
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,212
Your arms need to come
to a right triangle.

183
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,886
There you go.

184
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:29,969
- 12, 14, 15.

185
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,104
- [Jeremy] Nailed it.

186
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:36,292
- Welcome to my shell store.

187
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,042
You can pick whatever

188
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,002
These ones are baby ones.

189
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,493
These shells will get an animal soon.

190
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:48,388
- Can I buy this one?

191
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:49,738
- Sure.

192
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:50,571
Thank you

193
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,654
- How much dollars is it?

194
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:54,609
- Two dollars.

195
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,274
- Here you go.

196
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,466
- So it's Janae's nap time right now,

197
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,419
so I'm in serious multi-task mode.

198
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,355
I'm cooking dinner, I'm
making dinner for a friend

199
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,963
that just had some surgery.

200
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:05,134
So I'm making a big double batch tonight.

201
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,188
And I'm also baking cookies

202
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:09,044
to take to the same family.

203
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:10,988
So hopefully in my attempt to multi-task,

204
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,292
I don't burn the cookies or the dinner.

205
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,269
(shattering dish)

206
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,456
(gentle music)

207
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:18,932
This is really sad.

208
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:20,324
It was in front of this,

209
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:23,898
and I was trying to pull this out and

210
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:26,673
So this bowl actually
was really special to me.

211
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:29,114
Jeremy and I made bowls on a date

212
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:30,489
sometime in our first year of marriage,

213
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:32,078
I don't remember the exact time,

214
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,710
and we went to a ceramic studio

215
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,878
and I'd never been to one before

216
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:35,974
and we painted them,

217
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:38,822
and I really have enjoyed it.

218
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,407
Jeremy and I usually,

219
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:41,491
in the evening after the kids are in bed,

220
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:43,763
get out these bowls and have
a scoop of ice cream together.

221
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,966
So, it's just kind of sentimental.

222
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,300
But it is just a bowl,

223
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,282
that's all it is, is a bowl.

224
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:50,830
And Elise had a great idea.

225
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,619
She said, Mom, let's go make new bowls.

226
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:53,452
And that would be really fun,

227
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:54,678
we've never done that with the kids.

228
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:56,005
What's the matter?

229
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:58,588
- Dad is 35 and that's too big?

230
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,502
- Dad's 35 and that's too big?

231
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:02,919
Too big for what?

232
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,645
- What's going on?

233
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:13,800
- [Kendra] You're too old Dad.

234
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,633
- I'm too old?

235
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:17,050
- [Kendra] You're 35 and that's too old.

236
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,695
- Aww, I know (laughs).

237
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:20,474
(Kendra laughs)

238
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:23,425
I'm sorry it's happening so fast.

239
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:25,153
Oh so pretty.

240
00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:27,010
(hammering)
(edgy rock music)

241
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,760
- I did it too tight.

242
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,358
(rolling)

243
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:32,691
- [Jeremy] Nice.

244
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:35,276
- [Laura] Daddy?

245
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,138
(rolling)

246
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:40,138
- I put a wheel on and a fourth wheel on

247
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:41,135
and put some weights on.

248
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,325
- [Kendra] Nice, did you use
Play-Doh for your weight?

249
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:44,159
- Mmm-mmm.

250
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,135
- [Kendra] That's smart.

251
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:47,982
This is a fantastic
Pinewood Derby car, Caleb.

252
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:49,118
It's so smooth.

253
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:50,429
I absolutely love this kid.

254
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,884
He's so determined, like he
puts his mind to something,

255
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:54,286
and he just does it.

256
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,611
He's creative and hard working,

257
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:57,444
boom.
(rolling)

258
00:08:57,444 --> 00:08:58,604
The girls are working together,

259
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,606
what are you guys making?

260
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,974
- Cornbread.

261
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:01,807
- [Kendra] Are you helping Laura?

262
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,206
- It's a special recipe
and it tastes like cake.

263
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:06,062
- [Kendra] It's amazing and it's a mix,

264
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:08,265
but we like things from mixes.

265
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:09,098
- [Elise] Woop!

266
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:10,341
- [Kendra] That's okay.

267
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,285
There's an old saying that says,

268
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,124
don't cry over spilt milk.

269
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:14,483
(groovy upbeat music)

270
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,983
- Just a little bit like that.

271
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,621
- [Kendra] You still
have one more ingredient,

272
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,454
Lise, which ingredient?

273
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:22,028
- Egg, one egg.

274
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,276
- [Kendra] What temperature do
I need to put the oven on to?

275
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,276
- 400 and F.

276
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:28,687
- [Kendra] 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

277
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:30,604
Elise, you did amazing.

278
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,113
The family we're taking this
to is gonna really like it.

279
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:37,074
Alright, so should we
put these in the oven?

280
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:38,320
Well the meal that we're
taking over tonight,

281
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,645
we call Frito Pie.

282
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,302
It's a recipe from Jeremy's mom,

283
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,995
and he loves it and all my kids love it

284
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:43,964
and I love it.

285
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:45,653
You top this with cheese

286
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,108
and then you also top it with lettuce

287
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,316
and tomatoes, and I got
some fresh cilantro,

288
00:09:49,316 --> 00:09:50,547
so we're doing that with cornbread

289
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:52,171
and what's that thing?

290
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,099
Chocolate chip cookies.

291
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:54,958
So this is super embarrassing.
(playful music)

292
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,209
I just was snacking on a cookie

293
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,141
and I was sitting here thinking,

294
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:58,512
wait, I've already snacked on a cookie,

295
00:09:58,512 --> 00:09:59,984
why am I snacking on another cookie?

296
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:00,817
Then I counted it up,

297
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,648
I've had five cookies.

298
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,004
Now mind you, those are little cookies,

299
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,100
but still five.

300
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,937
And I was like, why do
I keep eating cookies?

301
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:08,751
And I realized why.

302
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,032
It's because I forgot to eat breakfast

303
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:12,489
or lunch, like I've been go go go all day,

304
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:13,633
and I'm starving,

305
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,185
and so I kept nibbling
on what I was making.

306
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,707
Ah, I hate that feeling.

307
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:19,528
Like I hate how that makes my body feel.

308
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,488
I got out some salad,

309
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,763
and I'm gonna have some salad right now.

310
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:24,843
So when life gets really busy,

311
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:26,370
don't forget to take care of yourself.

312
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,699
Don't forget to feed your body.

313
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:31,033
Alright, these are all
ready to go in the oven.

314
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,824
And now they're out of the oven.

315
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,047
It's time to go deliver the food

316
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,519
and guess what, I'm on time.

317
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,350
(applause)

318
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,612
- [Jeremy] Thanks for doing that Kendra.

319
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:41,511
- This friend of mine,
the day she found out

320
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:43,207
I was pregnant with Janae,

321
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,336
without even asking,

322
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,035
she brought dinner to our family.

323
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:47,880
And I was really morning sick at the time,

324
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,074
and it was the first homemade
meal we'd had in awhile,

325
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:52,001
so I owe her one.

326
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:56,028
(upbeat electronic music)

327
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:57,204
- I'm going to ballet

328
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,957
and we can bring a parent.

329
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,701
- Tonight is bring your
parent to ballet night.

330
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,732
- And the parent gets to watch.

331
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,072
- [Jeremy] And we get to dance, too.

332
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:05,905
- Really?

333
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:06,944
- I hope so.

334
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:09,194
I brought my dancing shoes.

335
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:14,281
(upbeat electronic music)

336
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,272
(slap)

337
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:35,689
(lively classical music)

338
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:40,979
So what'd you think of that?

339
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:41,812
- I liked it.

340
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:45,020
I'm doing the skip turn
that I wanted you to do.

341
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,983
- Well that was so fun.

342
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:47,076
I love dancing with you.

343
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,076
Maybe I should stretch more.

344
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,995
That's the takeaway from that.

345
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:53,995
(lively rock music)

346
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:56,609
So Caleb, why'd you come tonight?

347
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,691
- Because I wanted to weigh this.

348
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,524
- [Jeremy] Seeing what it weighs?

349
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:00,443
- Mmm-mmm.

350
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:02,640
- [Jeremy] Let's see how much it is.

351
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,791
You gotta hang it upside down.

352
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,624
- Two.

353
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,622
- [Jeremy] Okay, so we
need some coins on there.

354
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:09,025
So how'd the weigh in go.

355
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,084
- Good!

356
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:12,608
- The most you can get is 5.0

357
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,671
and I got that.

358
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:15,107
- [Jeremy] Yep you did, well once we added

359
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:16,178
a bunch of change.

360
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:17,011
- Yeah.

361
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:18,264
- Goodnight, J House out.

362
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:21,800
- [Jeremy] You are editing a vlog.

363
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,081
Do you like it?

364
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:26,720
- [Kendra] So my awesome
Aunt Kay sent us this kit.

365
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,437
So Jeremy and I are trying to make

366
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:30,408
an important decision today.

367
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,370
I'm just, I still don't
know what we should do.

368
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,527
- All my kids are hiding.

369
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:34,760
- How did you know?

00:12:34,760 --> 00:00:00,000
