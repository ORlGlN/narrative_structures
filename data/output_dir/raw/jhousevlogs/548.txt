I got a whole bunch of
animal names in this bowl,

8
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:14,601
and the kids are gonna pull them out

9
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:16,688
and act them out and see if
each other can guess them.

10
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:18,531
And we'd love to have you guys play along,

11
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:20,467
so try to guess as we're acting out.
