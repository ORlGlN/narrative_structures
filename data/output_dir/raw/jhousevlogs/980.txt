1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:02,314
- One of the saddest, hardest things

2
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:03,714
when you have little
babies and little kids

3
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:06,727
is when they're feeling
sick and this little girl

4
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:10,403
will not sleep, we've tried
to put her down several times.

5
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:13,341
We've tried all the go-to's,
we nursed her again,

6
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:15,918
then we tried feeding her,
we changed her diaper,

7
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:19,502
we cuddled her and rocked
her for eons of time.

8
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:22,229
- We've come to the conclusion
that she's congested

9
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:24,748
and so we have to use the bulb syringe.

10
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,432
- This Evil Kievel.

11
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:30,349
See her little eyes,
doesn't she look so tired.

12
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:35,494
- But she's still so cute.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,636
(laughs)

14
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,617
Alright, so Laura was a
trooper for the face-sucking

15
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:42,264
treatment, we decided
that we're also gonna

16
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:44,949
fill up the humidifier and put that

17
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:48,572
in her room to help with the breathing.

18
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:50,524
We hope this helps.

19
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:53,774
By the way, Laura sleeps in our closet.

20
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,635
- Have we ever mentioned that?

21
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:58,978
So this is our walk-in closet.

22
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:03,145
And this Laura's shelves and
back here is Laura's bed.

23
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,213
There's a vent in here.

24
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:11,799
- Most people do the
whole baby room thing.

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,882
- Nursery decorate thing.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,863
- We thought it was more
convenient for her to be close

27
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:18,697
to us but still in her own room,

28
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:21,305
and not be too close to the
other kids to either be woken up

29
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:23,589
by Caleb or to wake up the other kids.

30
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:25,518
- We live in a three-bedroom
house which is awesome,

31
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,030
and we really like that
our kids share rooms,

32
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,649
but it's a little bit
hard when they're little

33
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,877
and they're taking lots
of naps to keep the kids

34
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:34,417
out of the rooms and so
it's actually really nice,

35
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:38,752
she's just off of our room
in her en suite nursery.

36
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:42,919
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)

37
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:47,614
So we had a long night last night.

38
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:50,211
Anyway, she actually ended up throwing up

39
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,740
and she had a fever and you
should see these boogers.

40
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,056
So I couldn't get her to go to sleep

41
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:58,127
and so I held her while
she slept until like 3:30

42
00:01:58,127 --> 00:01:59,917
and at 3:30, I was like, Jeremy.

43
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,057
- It's your turn.
- It's your turn

44
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,639
and he's like, "I'm gonna
try putting her to bed."

45
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,394
He lays her down, she
immediately goes to sleep

46
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:06,170
and then she slept for
the rest of the night.

47
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,232
- My shift was pretty rough.

48
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:09,134
(laughs)

49
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:13,035
- Anyway, so, what are
you clapping those hands?

50
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:15,202
- Say, "Yay, Dad!"
- Dada.

51
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:21,086
- We were all excited about this Monday,

52
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:22,475
you know you get all motivated.

53
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,735
- Let's start fresh!

54
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,778
We're gonna in some good routines.

55
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,123
- I'm gonna get off to work super early.

56
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:30,122
But then, when you're up through

57
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:32,955
most of the night, it's tough, so.

58
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,533
- One of the hard parts
is that then after being

59
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:38,800
totally sleep-deprived,
you still have to function

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,883
as a mother or a lawyer all day long.

61
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,203
- Yay.

62
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,233
Elise, can you put that way?

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,078
Is this the long stare-down?

64
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:53,711
Oh, she blinked.

65
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:55,405
- So I'm wishing that I
could blow-dry my hair,

66
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:57,579
and I'm trying to get
sick baby Laura to bed

67
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,246
and look what I come out to see.

68
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:04,690
What ya doing, Cub?

69
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,996
- Taking all of them off.
- What are you doing?

70
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:10,246
- I'm getting them all off.

71
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,293
- Caleb, we're supposed to leave them on.

72
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,948
No, buddy, stop, stop stop stop.

73
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:18,767
Update: thankfully Laura has been napping.

74
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,028
I'm so glad, she
definitely needed the rest.

75
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:25,480
We read some Christmas books
and Caleb un-decorated the tree

76
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,380
again and here is Isaac
re-decorating tree for me.

77
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,170
Alright, bud, what ya doing?

78
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,135
- I'm playing football outside.

79
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:34,685
- [Kendra] You're headed outside to play?

80
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:35,518
- Mhmm.

81
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:39,297
- [Kendra] So why'd you tuck
your pants into your socks?

82
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:42,880
- Well it's so my pants
won't like go crazy

83
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,692
so I'll have to pull them down.

84
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:50,440
- Oh, to keep 'em from going crazy.

85
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,107
That's a good idea.

86
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,133
Cool.

87
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,993
- And I tuck my shirt just
like football quarterbacks.

88
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:58,307
- [Kendra] Are you gonna go outside too?

89
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:01,390
- Uh-Huh, and today's my ballet class

90
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:06,924
and I'm not going to
ballet and it's canceled

91
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:10,216
because I'm going somewhere fun.

92
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,799
- Caleb comes back.

93
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,424
- [Jeremy] Alright bud,
you've sung to the trains,

94
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:18,819
you've told them a story,
you've put 'em in their beds.

95
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,527
It's time to go now, okay?

96
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,522
- No, the trains are gonna cry!

97
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:28,886
- [Jeremy] Sometimes trains
have to cry, but we have to go.

98
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,969
- No, they are gonna cry.

99
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:35,697
- A bunch of friends of our put together

100
00:04:35,697 --> 00:04:37,988
this live nativity that we're going to,

101
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,423
you guys excited to check it out?

102
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,256
- [Elise] Uh-huh.

103
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:42,246
- Alright we wanna go get a
good seat, so we gotta go.

104
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:43,079
- [Announcer] And she brought forth

105
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,240
her first-born son and wrapped him

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,073
in swaddling clothes and
laid him in a manger.

107
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:52,469
(vocalizing)

108
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:04,752
- [Jeremy] Alright, Isaac, what was your

109
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:07,252
favorite part of the nativity?

110
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:12,561
- I think it was when the Wise
Men came and the shepherds.

111
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:15,394
- My favorite part was baby Jesus.

112
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:17,954
- [Jeremy] You liked baby Jesus?

113
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:19,143
How about you, Elise, favorite part?

114
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:21,582
- Mary and Joseph, because Joseph

115
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:24,003
was the person that I know.

116
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:25,677
- [Jeremy] Does he babysit us?

117
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:27,159
Yeah.

118
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,272
So we were driving home and
on the radio was the song

119
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:32,272
Feliz Navidad, and.
- Elise Navidad.

120
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:34,845
- Last year for Christmas, Elise always

121
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:37,487
thought that it was a song about her.

122
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,972
♫ Elise Navidad

123
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,593
Anyways, she loved that.

124
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:43,218
♫ Elise Navidad.

125
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,615
- Well it's actually Feliz.

126
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:48,282
(festive music)

127
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:51,365
- There.
- Right there?

128
00:05:51,365 --> 00:00:00,000
That's a great spot for it.
