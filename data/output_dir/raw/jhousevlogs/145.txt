1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:01,095
- Have you been using this,

2
00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:03,092
and he was like, yeah, Caleb
and I use it as hair gel.

3
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:04,169
What?

4
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,227
- [Jeremy] Go go go go Isaac.

5
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:08,668
- The parade is almost starting Dad,

6
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:10,505
we've got to go quick.

7
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:12,755
(laughing)

8
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:17,876
(uptempo dance music)

9
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:20,789
- [Jeremy] Okay Isaac, go play hard.

10
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:21,622
- Yeah.

11
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,289
- [Jeremy] Have fun.

12
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:28,866
(cheering)

13
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:41,467
- [Man] Nice job, way to
push up Isaac, good job.

14
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:44,925
- Go Isaac.
- Come on Isaac, kick it.

15
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:47,342
- [Jeremy] Go go go go Isaac.

16
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:50,641
You watching Isaac?

17
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,308
- Perfect job Isaac.

18
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,073
- [Jeremy] You enjoying the game, Laura?

19
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:57,627
Are you super excited?

20
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:00,077
(mellow music)

21
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:02,660
- [Man] Spread out, spread out!

22
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:10,065
♫ Show how you feel

23
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:11,699
♫ It's adorable well it's nice to see

24
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,302
- [Jeremy] Where are we heading you guys?

25
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:14,242
- To the parade.

26
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:17,673
- [Jeremy] Yep, it's our fall fest parade.

27
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:19,006
- Fall festival.

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,464
- And there's gonna be candy falling down

29
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:26,740
and I'm gonna see who got the most.

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,233
- [Jeremy] Ooh who's
gonna get the most candy.

31
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,165
- Guys, let's begin.

32
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:34,248
(bright piano music)

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,369
- The parade is almost starting Dad,

34
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:38,896
we gotta go quick.

35
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:39,856
- Let's go.

36
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:43,569
We just made it for the very first thing.

37
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,657
(police siren)

38
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:47,258
This is the very beginning of the parade.

39
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:50,425
(marching band music)

40
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,162
(Jeremy laughing)

41
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,041
- They're making my tummy weird.

42
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,289
- [Jeremy] Are you excited?

43
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,845
- Look , it's the flag bearers.

44
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:07,174
- This is basically like Halloween

45
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:08,685
for the kids with the candy.

46
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:09,518
- Thank you.

47
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:10,518
- Thank you.

48
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:15,336
- [Caleb] So much candy.

49
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:20,543
- You're so welcome.
- She's so excited.

50
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,340
- I got a toothbrush Dada.

51
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,081
- [Jeremy] Yeah, do you see the dancers?

52
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,001
- So these places are getting smart.

53
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:29,538
They're handing out fans and toothbrushes.

54
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:30,983
- Genius.

55
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:33,171
(laughing)

56
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:37,163
(marching band music)

57
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:39,467
So my nephew Blake is in
one of the marching bands.

58
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,675
It was fun to say hi.

59
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,243
(clock ticking)

60
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:43,722
It's Blake!

61
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,210
I see him!

62
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,793
(lively music)

63
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:04,488
- Janae has no idea what's going on.

64
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:06,601
Hi you, hi.

65
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:09,268
(Jeremy laughs)

66
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:16,304
Do it again, moo!

67
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:17,451
(mooing honk)

68
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:18,728
- [Jeremy] It moos.

69
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:20,791
(laughing)

70
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,300
- [Kendra] There's a chicken.

71
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,957
(cheering)

72
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,638
- So one of these parades we were at,

73
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,950
I think Caleb had to go to
the bathroom really bad,

74
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,343
right in the middle of the parade,

75
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,453
so I actually went to one of the houses

76
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,083
on the parade route and asked them

77
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,099
if we could use their bathroom

78
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:36,932
and they were very nice,

79
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,035
they let us go in.

80
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:38,868
- This is about the time when I start

81
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:40,344
singing my favorite song.

82
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,674
♫ This is the parade that does not end

83
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,587
♫ That goes on and on my friends

84
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:46,420
It's fun.

85
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,961
(street sweeper motoring)

86
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,579
In conjunction with the parade,

87
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,539
they have a festival,
a fall festival up here

88
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,512
on the square, and so we're heading there

89
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,596
to check it out and see
what there is up there.

90
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:01,763
(upbeat guitar music)

91
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,589
We just got back from the parade

92
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,422
and the fall festival.

93
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,326
And it was fun, but it was so hot.

94
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,838
It is hot and humid out today.

95
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:23,743
I'm sweating and anyway,

96
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:24,814
I think we need to hydrate,

97
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:28,414
drink some water and rest in
the air conditioning for a bit.

98
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:31,581
Look at how much candy those kids got.

99
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:34,590
So I just walked into the bathroom

100
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,318
and I found Laura using this on her hair.

101
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:39,582
I was like, Laura, what are you doing,

102
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:40,878
that's not hair gel.

103
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:43,345
And then I realized, it's
down from the closet,

104
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:44,497
probably because somebody else

105
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:45,521
has been doing this.

106
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:48,082
So I come out and I show Isaac this bottle

107
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:49,169
and I'm like hey Isaac,

108
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,169
have you been using this?

109
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:51,002
And he's like yeah,

110
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:52,377
Caleb and I use it as hair gel.

111
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,210
What?

112
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,561
So Caleb, what is that?

113
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,457
- It's a gel.

114
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:57,862
- [Kendra] Have you been
using it on your hair?

115
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,773
How long have you been
using the aloe vera gel?

116
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:00,934
- About a week.

117
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:01,919
- I can understand the confusion though,

118
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,533
because I mean it looks like gel

119
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,229
and it says gel.

120
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,518
Guys, aloe vera is not hair gel.

121
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,054
So it is nap time

122
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:12,125
and what do we do before nap time?

123
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,825
- Um, we eat lunch.

124
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:14,841
- We did eat lunch.

125
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:16,966
And now what are we gonna do?

126
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,799
- Um, do a nap for me.

127
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,889
- Yes, but what do we do together

128
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,734
before you take your nap.

129
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:27,212
- Read, I'm gonna read three,

130
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:29,876
Mommy's gonna read three books to me.

131
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:30,709
- Three books?

132
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:31,542
- Yeah.

133
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,375
- We come in here, and she's like,

134
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,487
can I have three books today,

135
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:34,504
please please please?

136
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:36,027
And did you already pick 'em out?

137
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:36,923
- Yeah.

138
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:39,357
- So Laura wants me to read her this one

139
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:42,204
and this one and this one.

140
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:43,789
I want to read you this one too.

141
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:44,925
It is so fun.

142
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,277
Have you ever read it before?

143
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:47,110
- I don't want to read that.

144
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,553
I want to read this one
and this one and this one.

145
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:51,279
- [Kendra] You think you
can read three books?

146
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,112
- Yeah.

147
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:54,815
- [Kendra] And then you're
gonna take a nice long nap?

148
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,982
Pinky promise?

149
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:59,349
(Kendra laughs)

150
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:00,182
Deal.

151
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:02,674
- I'm gonna read three stories.

152
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:05,257
(bright music)

153
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,232
- [Kendra] The kids each
chose one piece of candy.

154
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:14,956
What did you chose Elise?

155
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:16,537
- Warhead.

156
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:18,254
- [Kendra] Isaac went with Skittles.

157
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:20,339
Caleb, what have you got?

158
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,922
- And Laura got the same thing.

159
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:27,232
- We both have the same thing.

160
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,189
- This is a very bad choice.

161
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,604
- [Kendra] So Elise this morning

162
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:34,444
is starting to work on
this paint by number.

163
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,514
- Well it's not really morning.

164
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:37,347
Afternoon.

165
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:39,040
- [Kendra] Oh that's true,
it's totally afternoon.

166
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,620
Laura, do you want to paint too?

167
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,453
- Yeah.

168
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:43,347
- [Kendra] We can get
out some paint for you.

169
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:46,824
That is a pretty intense paint by number.

170
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,264
- Yeah it is.
- Is this what it is?

171
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:50,296
- [Kendra] Laura are you ready to paint?

172
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:51,426
- Yeah.

173
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:54,843
(lively classical music)

174
00:06:58,158 --> 00:06:59,750
- [Kendra] Laura, what are you painting?

175
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,956
- A picture.

176
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:03,496
- [Kendra] That makes sense.

177
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:04,905
Elise is starting out with the white,

178
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:06,961
so it's a little bit hard to see.

179
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,457
But you're doing a great job,

180
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:09,449
that looks tough.

181
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,668
- When I do the blue, you'll see.

182
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:13,587
- [Kendra] She has moved on to some blue.

183
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:15,474
- I kind of got bored with the white.

184
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,956
So I decided to do blue.

185
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:20,442
- [Kendra] What's that?

186
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:21,742
- You'll see.

187
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,257
I need a little bit more of this

188
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:25,174
and a lot more of this,

189
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:29,265
I need a little bit more of this,

190
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,015
I need more for this.

191
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,616
- [Kendra] This is gonna be
a long project, big girl.

192
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:35,720
I thought maybe you could paint it,

193
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,470
while you were listening
to books on Audible.

194
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:43,908
- Yeah, but this cannot be on carpet.

195
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,219
- [Kendra] That's probably a good point.

196
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,490
- Because what if I
spill it on the carpet.

197
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,577
- But Alexa could come in here,

198
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:52,881
and read to you in here.

199
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:53,714
- Mmmm.

200
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:56,075
- Okay, but we're coming
up on the last chapter

201
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,603
of the first Harry Potter book.

202
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,199
The kids are really loving it.

203
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,789
They're sad that we're
not finishing it tonight,

204
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,865
but it's late, we gotta get to bed.

205
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:04,062
- I want to finish it,

206
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:06,134
even though it's over 20 pages.

207
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:06,967
- It will take way too long,

208
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,597
it's already past your
bed time, little stinks.

209
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:10,926
Aright, we'll finish this tomorrow.

210
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:12,410
Good night, J House out.

211
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,693
- [Kendra] Are you
trying to go cross-eyed?

212
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:15,526
- Elsa!

213
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:17,908
- [Jeremy] Whoa.
(mower starts)

214
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:18,908
(Jeremy laughs)

215
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:21,075
(yelling)

216
00:08:22,498 --> 00:00:00,000
♫ I am a sticker girl
