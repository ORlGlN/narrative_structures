1
00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:01,549
- [Kendra] She broke her leg.

2
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:02,382
- Mmm-mmm.

3
00:00:02,382 --> 00:00:03,281
(lively music)

4
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:04,861
- [Kendra] You have to go to surgery?

5
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:07,408
- Oh, we forgot to put you asleep.

6
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,975
- Good job.

7
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,151
- And I can't find it

8
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:11,818
and it makes me mad.

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,910
(enchanting music)

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,000
(Janae babbling)

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,168
- [Jeremy] So how did
you two sleep last night?

12
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:30,304
- Good.

13
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:31,952
- [Jeremy] Did you have
any good dreams Laura?

14
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:34,619
- I always have the best dreams.

15
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,567
- [Jeremy] Is this your
hairdo for this morning?

16
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,574
Can you turn around, so I can see it?

17
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:49,925
- Her friend Lucy had this hairdo

18
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,414
and she wanted it just like Lucy.

19
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:54,402
We're just resurrecting
Lucy's curls from last night.

20
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:55,396
- Yeah.

21
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:56,850
I like curls.

22
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,600
(playing "Away in a Manger")

23
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,430
- I love piano lessons this time of year,

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,734
because the kids are all
learning Christmas songs.

25
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:14,734
Good sharing.

26
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:15,567
(piano playing)

27
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:16,910
That looks pretty fun.

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,974
Are you happy with that little piece?

29
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:22,807
Does your Mr. Potato
Head have a lot of hands?

30
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,967
Whoa, that is an awesome design.

31
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,287
How many hands does he have?

32
00:01:28,287 --> 00:01:29,704
- Two three four.

33
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:32,233
- [Kendra] Four hands?

34
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:33,066
- One two.

35
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:37,895
- That's a cool Mr. Potato Man.

36
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:39,812
Can you make that face?

37
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:42,647
Okay Janae update,

38
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,147
she is now nine months old.

39
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,110
How is that even possible?

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,988
She is crawling all over,

41
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:49,575
pulling herself up to a stand,

42
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:53,372
she says hi Dada and she says mmmuh,

43
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:54,778
when she wants me.

44
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:55,903
She's adorable.

45
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:57,236
And we love her.

46
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:00,984
- Keep going.

♪ Peace ♪

48
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:03,775
Good job.

50
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:13,770
Good job.

(hand slap)

52
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:16,003
- [Kendra] She broke her leg?
(playful music)

53
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:16,836
- Mmm-hmm.

54
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:17,781
- For pretend.

55
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:19,245
- [Kendra] Oh, just for pretend?

56
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,078
- [Elise] Uh-huh.

57
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:21,615
- [Kendra] This is quite the cast.

58
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:23,298
How are you feelin'?

59
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:24,434
- A little bit sick.

60
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:26,132
- A little bit sick.
- We're just pretending.

61
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:27,474
- [Kendra] Oh good, I'm
glad it's just pretending

62
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:28,835
and you're really okay.

63
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:30,547
Who's your doctor?

64
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,380
- I am.

65
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,579
And I'm trying to find as much things

66
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,498
on the computer as we can.

67
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,243
Caleb's our helper.

68
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,667
- [Kendra] How are things on
the computer gonna help her

69
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,233
fix her broken foot?

70
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,298
- We bought hamburgers

71
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:44,774
and banana splits,
(Kendra laughs)

72
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:46,253
with no bananas of course,

73
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:48,441
and an elephant and it's gonna come here

74
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:49,935
in one minute.

75
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:52,162
- [Kendra] And how's that
gonna help her broken foot?

76
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,334
- Well the cast will.

77
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:55,422
Since she can't get up,

78
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,526
we're bringing her food.

79
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:57,359
- I'm checking her bones

80
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,056
and seeing if it's okay right now.

81
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:00,584
- [Kendra] Oh are you looking at an x-ray?

82
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:02,030
Well get well soon little girl.

83
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,458
- Okay, I have this to remember.

84
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,370
- [Kendra] Oh, Caleb made that, huh?

85
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,144
Are you signing her cast?

86
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:10,637
- I just do hearts.

87
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:11,726
- [Kendra] There we go.

88
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:13,158
Isaac, do you want to sign her cast?

89
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,575
Janae wants to sign her cast.

90
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,459
Did you find the problem?

91
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,916
- Yep.

92
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,316
- [Kendra] It's just she rolled her ankle

93
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:25,179
all the way to the other side of her foot,

94
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:26,460
so then it cracked.

95
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,943
- [Kendra] Whoa, can I see the crack?

96
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:29,776
Whoa.

97
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,273
Uh-oh.

98
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,256
Nae are you trying to get it.

99
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,675
(Janae shrieks)

100
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,159
She says I want to play.
(Janae laughing)

101
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,144
This is really nice, can I sign your cast?

102
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:42,146
- Sure.

103
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:42,979
- Mom.

104
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,417
- [Elise] That looks like a W.

105
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:49,305
- [Kendra] It does, because
you guys are upside down.

106
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:50,346
- [Laura] Hi.

107
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:51,179
- Write Janae.

108
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,220
- [Kendra] Hi, look at that little hand.

109
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,388
- [Caleb] Time for surgery.

110
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:57,893
- Whoa, you have to go to surgery?

111
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:00,393
Good luck, I hope you survive.

112
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:06,498
- Because we're considered
the best doctors ever.

113
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:08,426
- [Kendra] Oh, you guys
are the best doctors ever?

114
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:09,482
- Yep.

115
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,148
- [Kendra] Alright,
good luck with surgery.

116
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:14,272
(playful suspenseful music)

117
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:15,375
How's the surgery going?

118
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,286
- It's super bad.

119
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:18,964
Does this hurt?

120
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:21,836
- My job is to look at it

121
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:24,733
and see if she's good or not.

122
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,663
- [Kendra] So then who's the surgeon?

123
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:27,606
- I am.

124
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:28,439
I'm the nurse.

125
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,496
- [Kendra] The nurse?

126
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:30,392
Are you also the surgeon?

127
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:31,407
- Yeah.

128
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:33,138
- [Caleb] Does this hurt?

129
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:34,410
- Yeah.

130
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,285
- Okay, so I think it's like right there.

131
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:40,680
(Kendra laughs)

132
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,784
- Oh, we forgot to put you asleep.

133
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,937
We cut it open.

134
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:45,868
- [Kendra] You cut it open?

135
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,701
- Uh-huh.

136
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:47,534
(Kendra gasps)

137
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,012
- [Kendra] Eww.

138
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:50,508
Now you're taking
pictures like ultra sounds

139
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,405
and x-rays and things?

140
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:53,238
- Uh-huh.

141
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,071
- [Kendra] How are you doing?

142
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,517
- The bone is twisted.
- Are you holding up okay?

143
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:58,036
- The bone is twisted totally.

144
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,468
- [Kendra] You're doing really
well for your surgery, Laura.

145
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,598
Are you being so brave?

146
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:03,431
- Check her other foot.

147
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,523
I think her, hey does that hurt?

148
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,218
- Let me put you back together.

149
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:09,705
- Oh that, this one hurts she says.

150
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:11,409
Let me look at it.

151
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,274
- [Kendra] This one is also cracked?

152
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:14,107
Oh dear.

153
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:17,444
- This one says that it's broke.

154
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:19,509
- I love seeing the kids playing pretend.

155
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,285
- I think she might have brain problems.

156
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,582
- What?

157
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:24,976
Okay, let me check.

158
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,149
- [Kendra] You have brain problems?

159
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:30,959
- I think it's probably a bad headache.

160
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,791
- The confirmation is that you might have

161
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,958
to stay in the hospital for
about 10 weeks or a year.

162
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:41,904
Six years.

163
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:46,077
- [Kendra] Whoa, this is
getting worse by the moment.

164
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:47,831
- Now it's my turn.
- Until she's six.

165
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:48,679
- So they said there might be

166
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,759
something wrong with your brain.

167
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,592
- I know.

168
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,961
I'm just sick for pretend.

169
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:55,249
- For sure, for sure just pretend.

170
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:56,576
Really you're healthy, huh?

171
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:58,734
I'm so grateful you're really healthy.

172
00:05:58,734 --> 00:05:59,567
Yay!

173
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:05,271
- The brain problem was
actually not that bad,

174
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:09,374
because you know, only
when she's four years old,

175
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,479
it will stop.

176
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,312
- Oh good.

177
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,287
So we're finishing a family
read-a-loud during lunch time.

178
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,186
I love reading to my
kids during lunch time,

179
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:17,993
because they're quiet and
they're a captive audience.

180
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:20,435
So this is the book we're finishing up.

181
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:22,248
Tom Eversole picked up
his basket of groceries

182
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,266
and walked out.

183
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,709
Then Shan walked softly
inside and listened

184
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,137
to Mr. Conley count the
Emmanuel Greene had brought.

185
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:31,198
(lively music)

186
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:34,316
- How did the flour come out of the bag?

187
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,327
- [Kendra] Because there
was a hole in the bag.

188
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:37,863
- He didn't know that.

189
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:38,696
- Yeah.

190
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:39,688
(dramatic beats)

191
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:40,960
Well I'm really frustrated right now,

192
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,258
because I've told my kids
like a million times,

193
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:44,496
don't touch my computer,

194
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,111
and one of them went in there,

195
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:47,437
and they took the mouse

196
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:49,005
and now we can't find it.

197
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:50,277
And my computer isn't a computer

198
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,542
that can function without the mouse,

199
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,222
and so I'm just looking all over my house

200
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:55,637
for this mouse, and I can't find it,

201
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:56,607
and it makes me mad,

202
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:58,037
because when you need to find something

203
00:06:58,037 --> 00:06:58,870
and you can't find it,

204
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,840
doesn't it make you frustrated?

205
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,446
So deep breaths.

206
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:03,741
Well I've looked and looked for the mouse

207
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:06,569
and then I troubleshooted
with the mouse I did find,

208
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,680
and then I called in the
expert, the big guns.

209
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,689
He's going old school.

210
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,960
What is this thing?

211
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,538
- [Jeremy] There's a cord
that's connected to the mouse.

212
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,371
Hey.

213
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,879
- Does it work?
- There you go.

214
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,836
- [Kendra] That's why we
keep old stuff around.

215
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,337
Jeremy you're magic.

216
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:26,281
You make all my problems disappear.

217
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:28,160
- That's why you need to have a husband.

218
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,993
(Kendra laughs)

219
00:07:28,993 --> 00:07:29,826
(Janae babbling)

220
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:30,659
- [Kendra] Hi.

221
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,854
There we go, there's a car.

222
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,310
(Janae crying)

223
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,334
Do you still hate your car seat?

224
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,584
I know, I know.

225
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:40,081
- [Jeremy] Here's a binky.

226
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:40,914
Here's a blanket.

227
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:42,247
- Still hate it.

228
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:44,506
So the last couple days

229
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,231
have actually been
pretty hectic around here

230
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:48,080
and I keep forgetting
to go grocery shopping

231
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,887
and so it's dinnertime and
I've got absolutely nothing,

232
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,890
so we're gonna go to Chick-fil-a.

233
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,734
(enchanting music)

234
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:55,066
- [Jeremy] Do you see the
Christmas lights twinkling?

235
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:58,169
- I saw, I saw all of them there.

236
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,336
- [Jeremy] That'll happen.

237
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,913
- [Elise] Yeah it might hurt your--

238
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,127
- Woo!

239
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:13,710
- [Caleb] No, it's not,
it's not, it's not.

240
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:17,269
(Janae cooing)

241
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:19,748
(Laura singing)

242
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:20,799
- [Jeremy] Hey Laura could you sing

243
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,589
a little bit louder for us?

244
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,221
(Laura singing)

245
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,462
Laura, go get in the car, and you need

246
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,079
to get your shoes on and a jacket.

247
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,459
It's gymnastics time.

248
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,542
(upbeat dance music)

249
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,283
So how was violin?

250
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,171
- Good.

251
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:03,906
- [Jeremy] Okay, get your jammas on.

252
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:06,380
So we've started reading
with our kids in bed

253
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,792
to kinda calm down before we actually

254
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,392
have them go to sleep.

255
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:12,239
What are you reading, Laura?

256
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,337
- Christmas book.

257
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,929
- [Jeremy] Christmas books.

258
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,711
So what are you reading Cub?

259
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,461
- Boxcar Children.

260
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:20,544
And it's a 150 page book.

261
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:24,172
- [Jeremy] Is this your
longest book you've ever read?

262
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,672
- Yeah, but the second is 120.

263
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,027
- [Jeremy] Are you liking the book?

264
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,316
- Yeah.

265
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:31,149
- Well tonight I went out shopping

266
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,086
and I attempted to finish up

267
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:33,923
our Christmas shopping,
but it didn't work out.

268
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,351
Different stores were out of things

269
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:36,874
that I was hoping they would have,

270
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:38,307
some things looked different in person,

271
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:40,230
and so it didn't really work out.

272
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,349
It was a little discouraging.

273
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:42,908
I meant to vlog when I was out,

274
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:45,741
but I just honestly
wasn't feeling up to it.

275
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:48,439
I'm feeling really tired today,

276
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:49,272
but more than that,

277
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:52,312
I'm feeling emotionally depleted.

278
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:54,568
I'm feeling anxious,
(gentle music)

279
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:58,151
and I can feel even my anxiety in my neck

280
00:09:58,151 --> 00:09:59,343
and my shoulders.

281
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:03,335
Maybe tension or stress
is a better word for that.

282
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:05,257
But I can just kind of feel
that with the traveling

283
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:07,022
we just did, and some of the big decisions

284
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,443
that Jeremy and I have been making,

285
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:11,460
and just, you know, the hustle
and bustle of everything,

286
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,208
I can tell that I'm needing
to take some time for myself.

287
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,349
I need to get a good night sleep tonight.

288
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:20,749
I need to ignore whatever work stuff

289
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:22,348
I need to be getting done,

290
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:25,788
and instead, make a big
cup of hot chocolate

291
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:27,637
and sit and watch one of those cheesy,

292
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,669
predicable Christmas movies.

293
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:30,965
And that's what I need tonight,

294
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,685
so that's what I'm gonna do.

295
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,253
I hope you guys are having a good night.

296
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,288
Be sure to take care of
yourself this season.

297
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,121
- So Kendra just showed me

298
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:38,638
the coolest thing she just bought.

299
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,732
So they look like normal
everyday winter gloves.

300
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,003
- I just bought new gloves.

301
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,620
- [Jeremy] But,

302
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,236
- Check this out.

303
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:49,060
Swipety swipe, swipety swipe.

304
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,673
So they're actually advertised
as phone friendly gloves,

305
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:54,060
and the difference is on this finger

306
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,893
and this finger.

307
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,261
The other fingers, you
can't operate your phone

308
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:57,544
with those fingers.

309
00:10:57,544 --> 00:10:58,730
I can totally use my phone

310
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,672
with my gloves on.

311
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:01,505
- [Jeremy] It's amazing.

312
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:03,491
- Maybe this is old
news to everybody else,

313
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:04,686
but I'm feelin' pretty snazzy.

314
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:05,831
- Poll question, how much do you think

315
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,661
the gloves cost?

316
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,347
I'll put some options in the poll,

317
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:11,764
like zero to five, six to 10,

318
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:18,266
11 to 15, 16 to 20, and 21 to 25.

319
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:21,903
- And comment below, if you think I should

320
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:26,030
become a hand model,
because that's the thing.

321
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,624
- [Jeremy] You're already there.

322
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:28,457
Look at that.

323
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,874
And the answer is

324
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,921
- Four dollars and 88 cents.
(bell dings)

325
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:33,754
- [Jeremy] Nice.

326
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,441
- [Kendra] Say bye.

327
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:36,417
Bye.

328
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,506
There's the bye.

329
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:39,197
- Goodnight, J House out.

330
00:11:39,197 --> 00:00:00,000
- Alright, the big question,
will we be having another baby?
