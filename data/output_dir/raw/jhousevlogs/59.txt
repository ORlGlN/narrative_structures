1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:02,448
- Hi Ballengers!

2
00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:03,806
- I lost my tooth!

3
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:04,639
(giggles)

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,479
- What's a koala?

5
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:08,547
- [Jeremy] I just thought
I'd go for a roll.

6
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:09,380
(laughter)

7
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,213
- It's a panda!

8
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:11,308
(playful instrumental)

9
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:12,775
- [Kendra] What is going on?

10
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,066
(laughter)

11
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:17,233
(upbeat instrumental)

12
00:00:19,293 --> 00:00:21,305
- We're making scrambled eggs.

13
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:22,319
- [Jeremy] Are you my helper?

14
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:23,152
- Yep.

15
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,791
- [Jeremy] Wanna get a bowl?

16
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:26,958
(light tapping)

17
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,974
(playful upbeat instrumental)

18
00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:30,279
(gasps)

19
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,365
(crack)

20
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,526
- Dad remember we walked on eggs

21
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:37,276
and you cracked them?

22
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:40,113
- [Jeremy] I do remember walking on eggs,

23
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:40,954
that was crazy.

24
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:42,688
(chuckles)

25
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:43,521
- [Kendra] Oop!

26
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,801
Oh no!

27
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:46,426
(laughter)

28
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:50,163
(squeals and cheering)

29
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:51,194
- This is fun.

30
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:52,868
- [Jeremy] Cooking is super fun.

31
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:55,189
He didn't get any shells in there.

32
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,918
Try to keep it in the bowl, okay Laura?

33
00:00:57,918 --> 00:01:00,140
We're gonna add some peppers.

34
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,862
- I'm gonna soon be learning
how to bake this myself.

35
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,178
Looks pretty good right now.

36
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:06,418
- So we have big plans this morning,

37
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,249
we're headed to the San Diego Zoo,

38
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:10,144
and I wanna make sure the
kids have a hearty breakfast

39
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,564
so they're not hungry right away.

40
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:14,426
(upbeat instrumental)

41
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:15,871
Well I felt silly packing my blender,

42
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:16,845
but I've used it every day

43
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:18,366
and been so grateful to have it here.

44
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:20,203
Another day, another smoothie.

45
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,273
(upbeat instrumental)

46
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:24,283
- So we've been having this
sourdough bread for toast,

47
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:27,375
and poll question, do
you like sourdough bread?

48
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,818
Kendra and I love it,

49
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:30,920
how bout you guys, who likes the toast?

50
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,753
- It's okay.

51
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:32,586
- [Jeremy] Okay.

52
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:35,948
- I don't like it that
much, but, it's fine.

53
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:37,154
- [Jeremy] Thanks for eating it anyway.

54
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:37,987
- Yeah.

55
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:38,820
- I like it.

56
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,487
(light guitar instrumental)

57
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:48,710
- Now let's find more rocks!

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,050
Cause we have to find good white rocks.

59
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,045
(clanking)

60
00:01:57,045 --> 00:02:00,596
We're gonna wash them
so they're not dirty.

61
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:02,346
- Let's take em back.

62
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,099
It's really important for
us when we go somewhere

63
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,011
that the kids can still
have creative play.

64
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,694
- [Kendra] So Elise what are you doing?

65
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:13,632
- Um, I'm doing my piano practice.

66
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,827
- [Kendra] Um, on an iPad?

67
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:15,660
- Yeah.

68
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,667
- [Kendra] How does that work?

69
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,615
- There's songs that I can do.

70
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,835
I'm at level three,

71
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:23,058
and I'm trying to get it
to the very next thing.

72
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:24,999
- [Kendra] Ooo, kay,
show us how you do one.

73
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,749
(rhythmic piano)

74
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,255
Piano practice on
vacation without a piano.

75
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,651
The kids piano teacher
has this special app

76
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:38,008
and she gives them assignments through it,

77
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:41,008
and so the kids are able to do this.

78
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:45,251
So we're driving to
the San Diego Zoo today

79
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:49,070
and Isaac just noticed the
coolest thing about our car.

80
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,028
Check it out, it not only
shows us the directions

81
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,542
of where we're driving,

82
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,607
but it shows us the speed limit.

83
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:56,764
For a long time I've said that

84
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:58,885
that would be an obvious
thing to put on an app

85
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,520
that would be really helpful,

86
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,665
and they've done it, thank you Apple.

87
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,744
- Cause when you're in a new place,

88
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,373
you don't know what the
speed limit is all the time,

89
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:06,837
so here it is, right in front of us.

90
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:08,208
- [Isaac] It just changed.

91
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,180
- It did, it just changed,

92
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,222
so now the speed limits 45!

93
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:12,621
I love cool inventions like that,

94
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:14,369
they make life easier,
especially when you're traveling

95
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:15,366
and in new places.

96
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:18,533
(upbeat instrumental)

97
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:21,134
So we're looking for a parking spot

98
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:25,591
and we drove past this
car, and the trunk's open

99
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:26,870
so we were assuming people were around it,

100
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,204
we just kept driving
and then I looked back

101
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:30,489
and there's no people
anywhere around the car.

102
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,441
So it's one of those situations like,

103
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,581
I don't know what to do,
but it's kind of drizzling,

104
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,124
I think we're gonna shut the trunk.

105
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:36,957
- Yeah.

106
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:38,337
- Cause I would feel bad
if they left it open.

107
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:40,409
I mean it looks like it
was left open on accident.

108
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,093
- I would typically do that too,

109
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:44,285
the only nervousness is,

110
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:45,864
they were like, left it open on purpose,

111
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:47,482
they just went to go grab something,

112
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:49,058
and then we locked them in,

113
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:50,177
but the chances of that.

114
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:51,456
- Who leaves their trunk open on purpose?

115
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,353
- The chances of it, us
messing something us,

116
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:55,752
are much lower than us
helping them out, so.

117
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,054
- Okay, we're gonna do it.

118
00:03:57,054 --> 00:04:01,449
(rhythmic upbeat instrumental)

119
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,942
- So all my life I've heard
about the San Diego Zoo,

120
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:06,434
it's kind of a world famous place,

121
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:08,360
and you guys are gonna
come check it out with us.

122
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,384
I'm so curious what makes it so special.

123
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,217
- We'll see.

124
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,658
- I think there'll be animal there.

125
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:14,507
(chuckles)

126
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:17,340
(kids chattering)

127
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,553
(giggling)

128
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:24,303
(playful instrumental music)

129
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,963
- So I think this is
Janae's first time at a zoo.

130
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,130
- [Jeremy] Hi!

131
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,000
Animals!

132
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,902
(giggles)

133
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,569
Oop, little nervous.

134
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:40,261
Hi, hi orangutans,

135
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:45,274
you guys, look, this
one's just rolling along.

136
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,296
Look!

137
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:51,549
I just thought I'd go for a roll.

138
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:52,382
(giggling)

139
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:53,595
Some people go for a stroll,

140
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:54,819
he's going for a roll.

141
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,975
- I share a birthday with
one of the orangutans.

142
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:59,012
- [Jeremy] You and Karen
are birthday buddies.

143
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:02,124
- I'm a little older, look these two,

144
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:04,733
have been a couple since 1987,

145
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,862
they have seven kids together.

146
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:08,150
- [Jeremy] Aww, that's so cool!

147
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,900
(playful instrumental music)

148
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,323
So Karen is the orangutan
that shares a birthday

149
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:19,162
with Kendra.

150
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:20,783
Apparently she had open heart surgery

151
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:23,532
and is the first orangutan
to have ever had that.

152
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,365
- Two years ago.

153
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,224
- [Jeremy] She's the rolling around.

154
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,372
- Yeah, she's the on rolling around.

155
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:29,039
- [Jeremy] Hi Karen.

156
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,673
Isaac is an orangutan.

157
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:33,506
- Yeah.

158
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,120
- [Jeremy] Basically.

159
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,287
Little kisses, they're
sharing food, how adorable.

160
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:42,224
Oop, never mind.

161
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:45,080
- Daddy, dad, look at that bird!

162
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,630
(elegant classical instrumental)

163
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,463
So we're at a part of the zoo

164
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:51,213
where the birds just roam freely.

165
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:54,643
- Last time we were in a bird cage,

166
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:56,730
a bird landed on my head.

167
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,803
- [Jeremy] Yeah.
(chuckles)

168
00:05:57,803 --> 00:05:58,897
- And I was freaked out.

169
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:01,329
(birds squawking)

170
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,554
(Laura squeals)

171
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:07,637
(elegant classical instrumental)

172
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:11,662
- [Jeremy] That was the coolest thing.

173
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,437
Do you see the birds?
- Do you see the birds?

174
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:14,987
Tweet, tweet.

175
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:19,070
(elegant classical instrumental)

176
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:23,859
- [Jeremy] You guys, there's a hippo.

177
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:26,692
(kids chattering)

178
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,222
- They have the monkeys, the hippos,

179
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,270
and the ferrets in the same enclosure.

180
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,322
(giggling)

181
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:35,155
(kids chattering)

182
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:36,732
- [Kendra] What is going on?

183
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:39,189
(kids giggling and chattering)

184
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,826
- [Jeremy] They sense danger

185
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,510
from Duncan.

186
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,428
Huh, what?

187
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,391
(chuckles)

188
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,521
She loves the fish!

189
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,032
So I thought I was gonna love the zoo

190
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,461
seeing all the animals,
but watching Janae,

191
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:53,766
thus far, has been the most
magical part of the zoo.

192
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,457
(gasps)
- Do you see the fish?

193
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,155
(Jeremy chuckles)

194
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:58,497
- [Jeremy] Fishies!

195
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:01,326
(playful instrumental music)

196
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,972
(kids chattering and giggling)

197
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:07,889
(kids chattering and giggling)

198
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,113
- [Kendra] Laura!

199
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:16,191
(water splashing)

200
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:20,141
(playful instrumental)

201
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,067
Good job holding hands girls.

202
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,083
The elevator's broken.

203
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,673
- The bummer is we're gonna
have to go back out like that.

204
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:26,506
- [Kendra] Uh oh.

205
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:27,592
Where are we headed next girls?

206
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,047
- To a restaurant.

207
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,047
- [Kendra] To eat lunch.

208
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,404
What'd you find?

209
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,273
- Albert's Restaurant.

210
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:37,345
- [Kendra] Let's do it.

211
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:40,012
(kids shouting)

212
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,524
- So the zoo had a place for
us to come eat some lunch.

213
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:46,743
(playful instrumental music)

214
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,094
(laughter)

215
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,153
And a bouncy baby.

216
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:51,403
(laughter)

217
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:54,316
- There you go!

218
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:56,566
(laughter)

219
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,260
- Janae has been having
so much fun with Duncan.

220
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,798
- How close in age, I mean,
it's like a month or two?

221
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:04,677
- I think it's like?

222
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:05,759
- It's two months.

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,217
- [Jeremy] Two months.

224
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,697
(playful instrumental)

225
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,652
So what happened?

226
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:10,485
- I lost my tooth.

227
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:11,345
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

228
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:12,453
- Right here, look.

229
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,647
It was this one.
- [Jeremy] Give us that smile.

230
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:15,480
- This is awesome.

231
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,040
Pretty soon she's gonna
have nothing to eat with.

232
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,991
- [Jeremy] So that one that's left,

233
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:19,249
that's a baby tooth, right?

234
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,082
- Yeah.

235
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:20,915
- [Kendra] Is it wiggly?

236
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:21,748
- Kind of.

237
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,994
- [Jeremy] Soon you're gonna have nothing.

238
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:26,460
- It's wiggly, I have another lose tooth.

239
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,119
- [Jeremy] Kendra, there's an ant eater.

240
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,317
- [Kendra] It's got such a pointy nose.

241
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:34,190
(kids chattering)

242
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,774
- Are they endangered?

243
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,193
- [Jeremy] They're endangered means

244
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:39,371
that there's not many of them left.

245
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:40,204
- Aww.

246
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:41,038
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

247
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,797
- Does that mean some of them died?

248
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,538
- [Jeremy] Mhmm some of them died.

249
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:45,835
- So on the ride to the zoo this morning,

250
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,532
we looked at the zoo
map and we made a plan

251
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:49,712
and we said, we're gonna go to
the polar bears first thing,

252
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:51,016
we just arrived at the polar bears,

253
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:52,447
it's like three o'clock.

254
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:56,280
(playful guitar instrumental)

255
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,656
- Ooo, that duck is trying to dive.

256
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:04,025
(laughter)

257
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:05,388
- [Man] Two, three!

258
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:07,720
- [Jeremy] There they are!

259
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,553
- [Kendra] Hey Laura,

260
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:10,172
do you wanna know what
you're gonna see next?

261
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:11,134
- What?

262
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,399
- [Kendra] Reindeer!

263
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,095
(playful instrumental music)

264
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,187
(kids chattering)

265
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:20,937
(playful instrumental music)

266
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:33,874
- [Caleb] Hey, can he get us?

267
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,853
- [Kendra] He can't, see he's in a cage.

268
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,547
- [Jeremy] Say hi!

269
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:39,091
Aww.

270
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:41,191
(playful instrumental music)

271
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:44,973
(people chattering)

272
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:46,046
- [Jeremy] Isaac what is it?

273
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,361
- It's a panda!

274
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:49,456
(magical instrumental music)

275
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:53,206
(magical instrumental music)

276
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:12,060
- It's funny on this trip
because out of no where,

277
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,242
suddenly the conga line, happens again,

278
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:17,393
and it just keep happening
over and over again.

279
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:20,032
- Happening in height and age order?

280
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:22,041
- [Jeremy] Yeah, they're
perfectly lined up.

281
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,012
- They're very organized.

282
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:24,449
- [Jeremy] Uh oh, there's a break off.

283
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,299
- Falling apart!

284
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,235
We did not do anything!

285
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:27,068
- [Jeremy] No coaching.

286
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,636
- This was not like a
parent involved moment.

287
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:30,482
This was completely them.

288
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,092
- It just happens.

289
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:34,194
We're going on a potty run.

290
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:35,944
- Freeze tag, I'm it!

291
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,302
(yell)

292
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:41,357
- [Kendra] Run Caleb, run!

293
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:44,509
(kids giggling and screaming)

294
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,340
Poor Janae has not napped at all,

295
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,317
she's liking the animals

296
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:49,020
and she's being a good sport about it,

297
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,856
but, I can tell she's getting tired.

298
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:53,716
It's hard being the youngest baby, huh?

299
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:55,389
- [Jeremy] We went to the bathroom!

300
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,407
- [Kendra] Success!

301
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,380
- Had to be down the hill
and then up the hill.

302
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,252
- [Kendra] Good workout!

303
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,333
- Whoo!

304
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,976
(kids chattering)

305
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,321
- What's a koala?

306
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:05,477
- [Jeremy] A koala bear?

307
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:08,280
It's these fluffy bears that
climb in trees and sleep

308
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,437
and they're little.

309
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:13,484
(upbeat drum jazz music)

310
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:14,537
(kids chattering)

311
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:17,370
(kids chattering)

312
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,629
- [Jeremy] So what's been

313
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:26,138
your favorite part of the zoo so far?

314
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:29,002
- I don't know, I like all of it.

315
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,531
- [Jeremy] I thought losing
your tooth was pretty cool.

316
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:31,364
- Yeah.

317
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:33,188
- [Jeremy] Caleb did you
have a favorite animal

318
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:34,021
we've seen so far?

319
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:34,854
- Leopard.

320
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:35,687
- [Jeremy] The leopard?

321
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:38,446
- I liked when the koala was on the back

322
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:42,198
and I also liked the, um, the leopards.

323
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:43,667
- [Jeremy] Should we do the zip line?

324
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,500
- Yeah!

325
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,415
- [Jeremy] The sky safari?

326
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:49,248
(playful guitar instrumental)

327
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:54,277
- What is this crazy fast!

328
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,154
(chuckles)
- [Jeremy] We're going up!

329
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:58,876
Are we up in the air?

330
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:00,043
- [Isaac] Yes.

331
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:05,724
- [Jeremy] There they are,
up there, the Ballengers.

332
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,724
- [Caleb] Hi Ballengers!

333
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:11,785
- So we decided to do the Skyfari.

334
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:14,547
This is so cool, there's mom!

335
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:15,872
And the girls!

336
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:18,369
Look at that airplane you guys.

337
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,382
(inspiring upbeat instrumental)

338
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:24,382
(inspiring upbeat instrumental)

339
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,840
Laura you're so brave!

340
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:37,805
- We did it!

341
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:39,817
- [Jeremy] Good job big girl.

342
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:40,805
What did you think?

343
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:41,940
- I liked it.

344
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,579
- So we're trying to go
on the Skysafari again,

345
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,396
and Laura doesn't wanna go with Jeremy

346
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,375
and I was talking to her about it,

347
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,865
like why, and why don't
you wanna go with Daddy?

348
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,615
- Because I'm afraid.

349
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,505
- She's worried that
Jeremy's gonna break it.

350
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:55,636
- [Jeremy] Why!

351
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,589
- Because you're so heavy.

352
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:58,515
(chuckling)

353
00:12:58,515 --> 00:12:59,618
- Because I'm so heavy.

354
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:03,035
I'm so heavy I'm gonna break the skyfari.

355
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,259
- It's beautiful.

356
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,802
You can see all, from everything.

357
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:12,092
(pop upbeat instrumental)

358
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,010
- [Jeremy] It's Parker and Caleb!

359
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,510
(pop upbeat instrumental)

360
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:21,931
- The kids are fascinated,

361
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:24,510
they've never seen a
caricature being drawn before,

362
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,973
and they've been watching
the whole process

363
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,682
from the beginning, it's really cool.

364
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,734
- If he drew me, my
teeth would look crazy.

365
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,970
- [Kendra] You're right,
let's see that grin again.

366
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,512
- Well I think we're done at the zoo.

367
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:35,590
The kids had a fun time,

368
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,396
and, we're gonna head home.

369
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:40,317
- [Kendra] So Caleb and Parker

370
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:43,203
are putting on some sort of
a gymnastics routine here.

371
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:44,869
(cheering)

372
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:45,702
- [Kendra] Yay!

373
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:46,802
(cheering)

374
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:47,635
Good job!

375
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:51,134
Well I think we successfully
tired the kids out.

376
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,905
I know we successfully tired me out.

377
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:55,024
So it's home to dinner and bed time.

378
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:56,332
Good night, J House out.

379
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:57,715
Well we love our rental house

380
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,241
but we are having one issue with it.

381
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,651
- So we're at a museum
with the Ballengers.

382
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:02,966
(upbeat techno instrumental)

383
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,824
(crash)

384
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:05,849
(squeal)

385
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:06,997
- [Isaac] What the?

386
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:10,665
(upbeat techno instrumental)

387
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,213
(squeal)

388
00:14:12,213 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat techno instrumental)
