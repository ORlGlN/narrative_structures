1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,591
- [Laura] I got kids.

2
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:03,810
- [Jeremy] How many kids do you have?

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,423
- 16.

4
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,372
- Uh-oh.

5
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:07,778
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

6
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:10,538
(drilling)

7
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:12,610
♪ Annie ♪

8
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,789
- So I got a text I'm
really excited about.

9
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,370
Here it is.

10
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,518
Do you know who that is?

11
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,101
(bright music)

12
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:24,468
(cracking egg)

13
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:26,718
(sizzling)

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,660
Jeremy is the egg master at our house.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,080
And while Jeremy is making eggs,

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,980
I'm doing the complicated process

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,130
of toasting frozen waffles.

18
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,290
So we're gonna have waffles
and eggs for breakfast

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,160
and I am so excited.

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,870
Every day since we've
been home from our trip

21
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,110
has been so busy, a birthday, a baptism,

22
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,870
Valentine's Day or just
lots of stuff going on

23
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,540
and today, there is
nothing on the schedule.

24
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,720
I am so excited.

25
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,553
- Hi.

26
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:58,470
- [Jeremy] You're looking all dressed up.

27
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,180
- We are playing pretend

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,828
and I'm gonna soon go outside

29
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,949
and drill holes with my drill.

30
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,597
(drill buzzing)

31
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,920
(playful music)

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,753
- [Jeremy] And what are you doing?

33
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:14,850
- We're pretending that my house broke.

34
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,140
I got kids.

35
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,311
- [Jeremy] How many kids do you have?

36
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,144
- 16.

37
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,341
- [Jeremy] So you have 16 kids.

38
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:22,326
- Yep.

39
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:24,370
- How did you house breakdown?

40
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,280
- From a really bad storm.

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,020
- So where's your house?

42
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,603
- Out here, but it's under water though.

43
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:32,740
- Can we get out there and fix it?

44
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,220
- Sure.

45
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,053
- [Caleb] Let's go.

46
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,272
(drilling)

47
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:39,010
- Thanks for fixing my house.

48
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,459
- [Caleb] You're welcome.

49
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,292
- Bye.

50
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:42,634
- [Kendra] Jeremy's
headed up to the office.

51
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:45,050
Janae is just waving.
- Bye.

52
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,580
- [Kendra] Bye, there it is the wave.

53
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,413
- I have a meeting with Brent.

54
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:54,710
We're talking strategy and
growth and business stuff

55
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,090
with the law firm.

56
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,923
- [Kendra] Sounds fun.

57
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:57,958
- See ya.

58
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,020
- [Kendra] You are such a big girl.

59
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,865
- So Caleb has been making this

60
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:04,335
and I think I'll make it.

61
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:07,607
(playful music)

62
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:08,880
It's a flower code.

63
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:11,870
My sandwich.

64
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,330
- I busted out our math scale

65
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,810
and Laura is playing with it this morning.

66
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,851
Alright Laura, can you
show us how it works?

67
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,640
(pieces clinking)

68
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,100
Uh-oh, which side is heavier?

69
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,483
That side?

70
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:24,192
Can you make it equal somehow?

71
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:27,090
(pieces clinking)

72
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,330
So when the arrows line up,

73
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,460
that means it's equal?

74
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,293
- Yeah.

75
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:31,660
- [Kendra] Alright.

76
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,290
Uh-oh, which one's heavier now?

77
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,650
Can you make it even?

78
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:39,890
- What does even mean?

79
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,450
- [Kendra] Even means the same.

80
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,750
Which side's heavier?

81
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,733
Yeah.

82
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:48,940
(upbeat music)

83
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,670
- So it's a lot colder today.

84
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,670
I got earmuffs and gloves.

85
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,700
But Caleb has been super focused.

86
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,240
He is committed to
drilling holes right now.

87
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,065
So we're going out to do it.

88
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:01,840
(drilling)

89
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,673
There we go.

90
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:07,320
Uh-oh.

91
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,217
- It's okay.

92
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:11,140
- So Janae is finally
down for a nap and so,

93
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,150
Laura, what are we doing?

94
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,014
- Cards, we have to match 'em.

95
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:16,920
- [Kendra] We have to find a match?

96
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,520
Did you find a match on your turn?

97
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,360
- No.

98
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,060
- {Kendra] Okay look at
this card and this card,

99
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,906
there's gotta be some match.

100
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:24,600
(gasps)

101
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,120
You're right, it matches.

102
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,660
It's a yellow nine.

103
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,493
- Yep.

104
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,407
- [Kendra] Let's see, now it's my turn.

105
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:34,890
Oh I found it, look Laura.

106
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,870
What's that?

107
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,160
- One!

108
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,333
- [Kendra] That's the number one.

109
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,940
- Nae Nae's soon gonna be one.

110
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,502
- [Kendra] That's so true,
it's gonna happen so soon.

111
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:45,752
(drilling)

112
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:52,026
- [Jeremy] Are you gonna drill it out?

113
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:52,943
Pull it up.

114
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:56,925
(blowing)

115
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:58,260
- I got the drill out,

116
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,972
but not the drill bit.

117
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:03,059
- Yep, we're gonna have to fix that.

118
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,642
(bright music)

119
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:09,440
(drilling)

120
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,690
I think Caleb can do
this for a couple hours.

121
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,906
Someone woke up from her nap.

122
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:16,240
- Hi.
- A little too early.

123
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,910
- Thanks for getting her Isaac.

124
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,802
Good job, birds are an example of that.

125
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:20,802
Hi baby, hi.

126
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,320
- We are learning about mammals

127
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,250
and marsupials.

128
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,150
- [Jeremy] Cool, different
categories of animals?

129
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,983
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

130
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,220
- We started a new science
book and we're liking it.

131
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,350
It's the middle of the day

132
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,430
and I am in a quiet car all by myself.

133
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,970
My hair's done, my make-up's done,

134
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,260
I'm dressed, this is quite a moment for me

135
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,730
and I'm actually really excited about it.

136
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,460
I'm headed out to pick up a fun lunch

137
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,360
just for Jeremy and I.

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,220
I'm getting it to go

139
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,090
and then we're gonna home
and have a little lunch date.

140
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,350
Jeremy meantime is dealing with lunch

141
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,250
with all the kids

142
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,170
and so, this is like
a mini vacation for me

143
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,050
in the middle of the day.

144
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,650
And we're doing this for two reasons,

145
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,170
one is we haven't had as much time

146
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,110
to spend together as we
would like to recently.

147
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,020
We feel just with
everything that's going on

148
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,030
and so many extra people visiting

149
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,880
that haven't had as much time to connect

150
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,713
as we would like

151
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:08,940
and we're starting to feel that strain.

152
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,720
So, time to invest some
time into our marriage.

153
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,410
And bonus, we get to eat yummy food,

154
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,370
because I need to go
grocery shopping again,

155
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,000
so the fridge is almost empty.

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,540
Luckily there's stuff for the kids though

157
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,903
and I think they'll be pretty happy.

158
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,486
(bright music)

159
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,805
So this First Watch place
is my new favorite spot.

160
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:30,520
- We have a play.

161
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,840
You'll have to sit down.

162
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,446
- [Jeremy] Okay, I'll sit down.

163
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,820
♪ This is the happiest builder ♪

164
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,829
♪ Builder builder spin spin spin spin ♪

165
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:43,746
♪ Make us fast as you ca-a-can ♪

166
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:05,454
(sped up singing)

167
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:15,080
- [Kendra] I got a sweet honey pecan salad

168
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,470
and I already ate the
breadstick that comes with it,

169
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,200
because I'm so hungry.

170
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,860
And Jeremy got a Southern
California burrito

171
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,794
to make us homesick for San Diego.

172
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:23,627
Do you want some?

173
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:24,460
(Janae babbling)

174
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,680
- [Laura] I do.

175
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
- Of course you do.

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,390
The big kids all got all bundled up

177
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,450
and went outside to play in the cold.

178
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,430
They were wanting to,

179
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,530
so we were like go for it.

180
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,110
So the little kids are just in with us

181
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,210
on our date.

182
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:37,203
- [Laura] Yummy.

183
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:38,036
I want some.

184
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,270
- [Kendra] So Janae's been
our little date buddy.

185
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,890
- She's so adorable.

186
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:46,430
(Kendra laughs)

187
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,830
Is it a phone?

188
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,680
Hi, can I talk with Janae Nae?

189
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:51,560
She's right here.

190
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,330
She's starting to feel
a little bit better.

191
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,510
She's been sick and
more cranky than normal.

192
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,570
We're not used to her being as fussy,

193
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,335
but it's nice to see her
starting to get better.

194
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:04,040
- [Kendra] Uh-oh.

195
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,320
- [Jeremy] Uh-oh.

196
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,220
Uh-oh.

197
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,850
- [Kendra] Did she just
make that funny face?

198
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,560
Do you notice what she
does with her tongue?

199
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,882
Yeah.

200
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:12,961
- Uh-oh.

201
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:14,900
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

202
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,140
- So I got a text that
I'm really excited about

203
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,240
and I haven't told the kids yet,

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,100
so I'm gonna show it to them.

205
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,933
Here it is.

206
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:21,870
(sweet music)

207
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,790
Do you know who that is?

208
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,840
- Melanie's baby.

209
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,010
- Yes, it's Michael and
Melanie's new baby boy.

210
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,843
That's your new cousin.
What's his name?

211
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:28,335
- We don't know his name yet,

212
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:30,304
but isn't he cute?

213
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:31,910
(Janae babbling)

214
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,780
Oh she's reaching for him.

215
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,880
- That's your cousin.

216
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,390
- Yeah, you're gonna play with him.

217
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,180
Do you want to see the baby?
- He's your baby.

218
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,470
- So this is my brother Michael's new baby

219
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,060
and they're the family
that we went to go see

220
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,107
in Seattle for Thanksgiving.

221
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:45,950
I'm excited for them.
(laughing)

222
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,301
They have two kids.
- Who wants pizza?

223
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,020
- [All] Me!

224
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,215
- [Kendra] So we went with
pineapple and pepperoni.

225
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:53,370
- [Jeremy] And?

226
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,203
- [Kendra] This one's my favorite.

227
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:55,810
It's Philly cheese steak.
(enchanting music)

228
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,510
They have breadstick, garlic knot thingies

229
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,360
that are so good.

230
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:02,152
(dramatic orchestral music)

231
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:06,706
♪ No need to pick up any toys ♪

232
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:09,510
- Turned down like five in a row.

233
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,590
- So after listening to the music,

234
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,500
our kids are finally watching Annie

235
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,740
for the first time.

236
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,111
What did you guys think of the movie?

237
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:15,944
- I liked it.
- It was awesome.

238
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:19,500
- I know who I'm gonna
want to be in the movie,

239
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,645
I mean the play.

240
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,232
- [Jeremy] Yeah, who are
you gonna want to be?

241
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:23,065
- Daddy Warbucks.

242
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,231
- I want to be Punjab.

243
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,945
(laughing)

244
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:27,612
- I want to be Annie

245
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:29,860
when I grow up.

246
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,010
- So we were watching it tonight,

247
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,549
because the kids are signed up

248
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,549
to do a play this summer of Annie.

249
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,779
- Goodnight J House out.

250
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:39,028
(kiss)

251
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,100
- We don't know if that
means we're moving soon.

252
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,220
If we found the right place, we could.

253
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,270
(bright music)

254
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,700
What do you think is inside the box?

255
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,533
- Whoa whoa.

256
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,230
What did you find?

257
00:08:50,230 --> 00:00:00,000
I forgot the Jello salad.
