1
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:04,128
(upbeat techno music)

2
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:06,565
- That's good.

3
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:07,566
- [Kendra] What are we thinking about it?

4
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:08,486
Next up, hotdogs.

5
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:09,484
Chocolate,

6
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:10,506
crackers,

7
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:11,528
gum,

8
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:12,480
ranch, will it pumpkin spice,

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,897
- No, no.
- Yuck.

10
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,077
(upbeat techno music)

11
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:18,261
- In the spirit of the season,

12
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:20,142
we thought that we would do a
challenge that was focused on

13
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:21,860
pumpkin flavor.

14
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,555
It's kind of unbelievable how many things

15
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,274
you can make pumpkin.

16
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:27,224
Here's the secret sauce.

17
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:30,220
So they have a whole pumpkin
sectio here at the store.

18
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,100
There's pumpkin bread, pumpkin streusel,

19
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,351
pumpkin cake, pumpkin
donuts, pumpkin party mix,

20
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:36,535
pumpkin muffins.

21
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,997
- We're doing the pumpkin spice challenge.

22
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,899
(upbeat music)

23
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,455
- [Elise] Will it pumpkin spice?

24
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:46,683
- [Kendra] Everybody pick
up your thing and smell it.

25
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,401
- [Jeremy] Do you guys smell that?

26
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:53,254
- Our first food is cottage
cheese, will it pumpkin spice?

27
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:57,171
- [Jeremy] Alright, go
ahead and give it a try.

28
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,892
- It's not bad.

29
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:04,098
- Yeah, it's not bad.

30
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,467
- [Jeremy] What do you think Elise?

31
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:06,837
- [Kendra] Do you think there's a real

32
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:08,207
pumpkin spice cottage cheese out there?

33
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:09,229
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:10,669
- No.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:11,946
- [Jeremy] Alright so everyone says yes,

36
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,664
but Elise says no.

37
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:16,831
The answer is no, we couldn't find any

38
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,423
pumpkin spice cottage cheese.

39
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:22,186
- Yes.

40
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:23,300
- They need to make that.

41
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,296
- Next up we have salsa,
will it pumpkin spice.

42
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:31,056
- [Jeremy] Okay, give it a
try, will it pumpkin spice.

43
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,867
- I think this is real.

44
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:33,958
- No.

45
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,025
- [Jeremy] Laura's going with no way Jose.

46
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:37,697
- [Caleb] I think it's real.

47
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,530
- No.

48
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,271
- [Kendra] Elise is
really thinking about it.

49
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,802
- I think yes because it makes it really,

50
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:46,172
really, really spicy.

51
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,960
- [Jeremy] What do you
think Laura, yes or no?

52
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,982
- No.

53
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:50,003
- No way.

54
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:51,466
- Yes way.

55
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:54,880
- [Jeremy] The boys are for
yes and the girls are for no.

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,830
The answer is...

57
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,080
Yes, it does pumpkin spice.

58
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:02,821
They have pumpkin salsa.

59
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,571
- Here it is, real pumpkin salsa.

60
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,836
- [Jeremy] We got that at the store.

61
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,485
- Jeremy and I were so
surprised, we had no idea.

62
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:10,576
This really exists.

63
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,016
- [Jeremy] Pumpkin salsa.

64
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:13,316
- We totally did not think that existed.

65
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:15,174
- We were making a list
of funny pumpkiny things

66
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:16,892
and we're like-

67
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:18,076
- Oh you can put it in salsa.

68
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,632
It's real.

69
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:21,234
Next up, hot dogs.

70
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:22,442
Chocolate.

71
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,230
Ranch, will it pumpkin spice?

72
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,414
- No.
- Yuck.

73
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:26,528
- Frosted Mini Wheats.

74
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,736
Crackers.

75
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,083
Gum.

76
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,567
Will it pumpkin spice?

77
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,541
If you didn't know our
kids really love gum.

78
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,124
(upbeat music)

79
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,807
Alright so what do you guys think?

80
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:42,829
- No.
- No.

81
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,662
- No.
- No.

82
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,335
- [Kendra] You are correct.

83
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:48,727
What do you think, is there
a real pumpkin spice gum

84
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,422
at the store is the question.

85
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,465
- [Jeremy] So who thinks yes that this is

86
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,439
a pumpkin spice flavor at the store?

87
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,623
- Yes.

88
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:57,155
- [Jeremy] Who thinks no?

89
00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:00,592
The answer is no, we weren't able to find

90
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:02,705
any pumpkin spice at our store.

91
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:05,027
- Hmm, that's good.

92
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:06,629
- I think it's real.
- Yum.

93
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:07,674
- Real.

94
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:10,832
- [Jeremy] Alright, the answer is yes.

95
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:14,245
It is a real thing, there
is pumpkin chocolate.

96
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,337
- I'm so excited about this.

97
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:18,170
I love dark chocolate so
pumpkin dark chocolate.

98
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,003
- Maybe.

99
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,512
- What do you think, pumpkin
spice salad dressing?

100
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:23,882
- No.

101
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:25,670
- Yes.
- Yeah.

102
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,083
- [Jeremy] Dude, that's a lot
of pumpkin spice on there.

103
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,523
Ranch pumpkin spice.

104
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:31,567
- Yes.

105
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:32,400
- Yes.

106
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:37,187
- [Kendra] Do you think it's a real thing?

107
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,975
- Yes.
- Yes.

108
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:40,182
- I think it's a real thing.

109
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:42,829
- [Jeremy] At our grocery
store the answer was no.

110
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,128
(buzzer)

111
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:46,498
- There could be some out there.

112
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,448
- [Jeremy] Cereal, does it pumpkin spice?

113
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,281
- Yes.

114
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:53,116
- [Jeremy] You are correct.

115
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:54,091
- Yes.

116
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,786
- [Jeremy] Crackers,
will it pumpkin spice.

117
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:56,786
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:02,195
- [Jeremy] Yes, there are
pumpkin spice crackers.

119
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:03,472
- I wanna eat this last one.

120
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:06,792
- Next up is watermelon,
will it pumpkin spice.

121
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,184
- I love watermelon.

122
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:13,456
- [Jeremy] Go ahead and
add the pumpkin spice.

123
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:15,956
Does watermelon pumpkin spice?

124
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:19,075
- That's good.

125
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,397
That's super good.

126
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:22,582
- It for sure pumpkin spice.

127
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,114
- Yeah.
- Uh huh.

128
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:26,343
- [Jeremy] Everyone thinks yes?

129
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:27,760
The answer is no.

130
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:31,800
(buzzer)

131
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,774
- But it's super good.

132
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,980
- We need this, it was amazing.

133
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,789
Get the pumpkin spice
and get the watermelon.

134
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:41,436
- Next up is deviled eggs.

135
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:43,062
- [Jeremy] You don't think so Laura?

136
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,035
- First I thought these were cupcakes.

137
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,823
(laughter)

138
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,518
- Alright we wanna know
what you think on this one.

139
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:51,165
Let us know in the poll,
does it pumpkin spice?

140
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,280
- [Kendra] What do we think?

141
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,650
Will it pumpkin spice?

142
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,834
- No.

143
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:55,667
No.

144
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:59,362
- Well I don't like it but I think it is.

145
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:00,895
- Yes.
- Yes.

146
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,009
- No.

147
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,585
- [Jeremy] Alright, the answer is no.

148
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,303
We didn't find any deviled eggs

149
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,509
that were pumpkin spice at the store.

150
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,810
- That is odd.

151
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,923
- As normal, I didn't not like it at all.

152
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,223
- Me neither.

153
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:18,658
- I did not like it but
I thought it would be.

154
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:21,158
- Soda, will it pumpkin spice?

155
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:26,065
- [Jeremy] Give it a drink.

156
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:27,180
- [Kendra] What do you guys think?

157
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,779
Is there really pumpkin soda at the store.

158
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes?

159
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,147
- Yes.

160
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:34,958
- [Kendra] Alright and who says no.

161
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:35,791
- No, no.

162
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:39,486
- [Kendra] And the answer is
that at our grocery store,

163
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:42,040
no they do not have pumpkin soda.

164
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,735
- So we thought we found some
pumpkin soda at the store,

165
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,523
but we were wrong.

166
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:48,008
So they had to do an ID
for this pumpkin ale,

167
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:49,889
we thought it'd be
really fun for the kids.

168
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,234
Like ginger ale, but pumpkin flavor.

169
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,927
But it's alcoholic, so we won't take that.

170
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:55,760
- Butter.

171
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:01,754
- I don't like it, but I think there is.

172
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:03,356
- [Kendra] Is there really pumpkin butter?

173
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:05,237
- Yes.
- Yes.

174
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,977
- [Jeremy] Alright, the answer is yes,

175
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:09,977
there is pumpkin butter.

176
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,830
- Real pumpkin butter.

177
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,945
- Can we try it.

178
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,013
- We found pumpkin butter.

179
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:16,592
It seems more like a pumpkin jelly

180
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,217
than a pumpkin butter.

181
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:21,630
Popcorn, will it pumpkin spice.

182
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,047
- Handful for me.

183
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:26,470
This looks good.

184
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:32,045
- [Jeremy] Alright, put
on the pumpkin spice.

185
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:35,702
- It's good.
- Yum.

186
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:37,072
- [Jeremy] Alright,
what do you guys think?

187
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:38,604
- Yes.
- Yes.

188
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:39,626
- Yes.

189
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:42,273
- [Jeremy] The answer is no.

190
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:43,295
(buzzer)

191
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:44,525
We weren't able to find it at the store.

192
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,453
Now we do have to say you guys,

193
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:47,822
just because our store doesn't have it,

194
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:50,377
doesn't mean there isn't
pumpkin spice popcorn out there.

195
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,840
So we realize that is a real thing

196
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,976
but it wasn't at our store.

197
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:55,323
- When Jeremy and I were
at the grocery store,

198
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,785
we were completely surprised by some

199
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,829
of the pumpkin pie stuff
that we found there.

200
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,199
So let us know in the comments below

201
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,080
what's the craziest thing
that you've ever seen,

202
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,471
heard of, or eaten pumpkin spice.

203
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:07,281
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

204
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,835
- Isaac, I have a very
good piece of advice.

205
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,971
Don't listen to your dad.

206
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:14,388
(rock music)

207
00:07:19,820 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Kendra] That is the cutest thing ever.
