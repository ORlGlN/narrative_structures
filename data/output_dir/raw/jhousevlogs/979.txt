("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)

2
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:10,204
- Tonight we wanted to do
our Christmas favorites.

3
00:00:10,204 --> 00:00:12,500
Hashtag Christmas Favorites.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,834
We're picking four categories where

5
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:15,061
we're gonna share with you our favorites.

6
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:18,894
Our favorite Christmas
movie, song, treat, and

7
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:21,688
favorite Christmas tradition.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,754
Oh and in the comments if
you wanna share some of

9
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:26,837
your Christmas favorites, we'd
love to hear them as well.

10
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:27,670
- We would.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,258
- Alright, we're doing our
favorite Christmas movie.

12
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,343
I'm trying to write down
what I think Kendra's is

13
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:33,702
going to be and she's
gonna try to pick mine.

14
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:35,369
We'll see how we do.

15
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:39,974
So for Kendra's favorite movie I guessed,

16
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:43,161
White Christmas for the traditional

17
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:45,091
and Elf for modern.

18
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,573
How'd I do?

19
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:48,255
- So there are two categories for me

20
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:49,261
and he got one of 'em right.

21
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:52,432
White Christmas is
definitely, I mean definitely,

22
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:54,270
hands-down favorite movie.

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,617
We watch it every year as
a family, we sing along,

24
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:59,391
we dance, it's magical.
- Yeah.

25
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:01,684
- But my favorite modern one is not Elf.

26
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,840
I like Elf, don't get me wrong.

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,206
But it's not Elf.
- What is it?

28
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:07,289
- You have a second guess?

29
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:10,431
- Is it one of the ABC Family Originals?

30
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:12,324
'Cause I know you're a sucker for those.

31
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:14,921
- No, my entire family
can quote this movie.

32
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:16,311
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.

33
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:18,513
Oh for sure, I know this,
but I don't think of it

34
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:19,994
as a Christmas Movie.
- I'm Sorry.

35
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,632
- It's While You Were Sleeping.

36
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:23,267
- That is my other favorite.

37
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,435
Okay, I went with It's a Wonderful Life.

38
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:26,404
- She's right.

39
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:27,839
- Really.
- See how hard was that?

40
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:31,039
So yeah, It's a Wonderful
Life is my favorite movie.

41
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,625
When I watch a movie the
things that I look for or

42
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,427
I want in a good movie
is character development

43
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,426
and it inspires me and It's
a Wonderful Life does that

44
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:40,119
so I watch it every year.

45
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,837
- Alright, favorite Christmas song.

46
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,411
- I know yours.

47
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:47,551
- Good, 'cause I don't know mine yet.

48
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:48,658
Can I have a lifeline?

49
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,163
- A lifeline, she needs a lifeline.

50
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:52,297
- [Troy] Hello?

51
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:53,530
- Troy?

52
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,627
- [Troy] Jeremy?

53
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:55,460
- Hey hey.

54
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,293
- Hi Troy.

55
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:57,205
- [Troy] (mumbles)

56
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:59,253
- Hey you're on the vlog right now.

57
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,464
- [Troy] I watch the vlog every day.

58
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:05,982
- So Troy, we're doing
like a newly-weddish game,

59
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:07,811
asking questions about
each other and I'm using a

60
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,946
lifeline and I'm calling you
to help me answer a question.

61
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:12,934
- [Troy] Okay, let me put you on speaker,

62
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:14,914
we'll have Emily's help too.

63
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:15,747
- Hi Emily.

64
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:16,580
- Hi Emily.

65
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,466
- We love you guys.

66
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:21,049
(Troy and Emily bickering)

67
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:25,449
- Is that your final answer?

68
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,551
Wait, you're a lifeline.

69
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,557
(laughing)

70
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:31,764
- [Troy] The First Noel,
it's gotta be The First Noel.

71
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,330
- It's gotta be The First Noel?

72
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,841
I should have known that one.

73
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:35,674
But...

74
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:36,823
- [Troy] It's my final answer.

75
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,597
- It's true, it is, it's The First Noel.

76
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:41,504
Yes.

77
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:42,857
- Good job Troy, you did it.

78
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,044
- We love ya.

79
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:45,609
- [Troy] Love you, see ya. Bye.

80
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:46,779
- Bye.

81
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:47,838
- Alright, what's my
favorite Christmas song?

82
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:50,262
I'm excited to learn what it is.

83
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:53,070
- This is Kendra's
favorite Christmas song.

84
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,004
- Okay, it says O Come All Ye Faithful,

85
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:58,501
and that has been my
favorite Christmas song

86
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,334
for the bulk of my life.

87
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:00,167
- Until this year?

88
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,092
- No, up until a couple years
ago I would have for sure

89
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:03,765
said O Come All Ye Faithful.

90
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:04,598
- What happened?

91
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:05,651
- But I've just been...

92
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,484
- What?

93
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:08,146
- Starting to lean Joy to the World-ish.

94
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,086
- What?

95
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,742
- â™« Joy to the world.

96
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,332
- Oh when did that happen?

97
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,796
I think it's this one still.

98
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:15,323
She's wrong.

99
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:16,156
Okay.

100
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:16,989
- Alright what's our next topic?

101
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,239
- Favorite Christmas treat.

102
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:22,518
- I have a guess, but it's just a guess.

103
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,351
- Alright.

104
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,184
- Do you know your answer?

105
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:25,017
- Yeah.

106
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:27,858
Okay, Kendra's favorite
Christmas treat is her

107
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:32,657
brown sugar cookies with
pretty frosting on top.

108
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:34,347
- That's a really good answer.

109
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,205
It's not the one I had in
my brain, but I think your

110
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:38,224
answer might be more right than my answer.

111
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:39,497
- Just like O Come All Ye Faithful.

112
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:41,663
- No, that one you were just wrong on.

113
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:45,093
So, umm, I was gonna say pumpkin cake.

114
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:48,667
Okay my guess, but then
I went with pumpkin roll.

115
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,305
- You know, I just don't
associate pumpkin roll

116
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:51,310
with Christmas though.

117
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,984
- What is wrong with you?!?

118
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,227
- My favorite Christmas
treat or candy is divinity.

119
00:03:58,227 --> 00:03:59,060
- What?!?

120
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,884
- Okay, so my grandpa,
who recently passed away,

121
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:04,700
would make it every year
and we used to have a

122
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,010
Christmas Eve party with
that side of the family

123
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,260
and he would bring the
divinity and I just love it.

124
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,538
- Favorite Christmas tradition.

125
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:15,805
Ready to see yours?

126
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,106
- Yeah.

127
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:18,065
- 12 Days of Christmas.

128
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,407
- It's true and my...

129
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:20,817
- Hands-Down I got it! Whoo!

130
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:23,809
- Yeah in my family we
would pick a family that was

131
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:26,259
either a family we were
wanting to get to know better

132
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,906
or a family that was in need
and we would drop something

133
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:33,628
off at their door 12 nights
before Christmas every night.

134
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:36,261
And we would knock and run
and try not to get caught.

135
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:37,730
- Okay let me see what yours is.

136
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,225
- I just put going one at a
time to the Christmas tree.

137
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:43,602
In her family they would line
up in a line and they would

138
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:48,137
each kid by age order
would go and see Christmas.

139
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,075
- So it's funny, I don't even
think of that as a Christmas

140
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:52,214
tradition, because that's
just the way you do Christmas.

141
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:54,691
Anyway, okay, favorite Christmas
tradition, we go caroling

142
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:56,888
in the back of a pickup
truck around just like the

143
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:59,638
neighborhood and we're all
snuggled in blankets in

144
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:01,496
the back of the truck, I love that one.

145
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:05,171
So, I think there's a
clear winner, look I won.

146
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,004
- Good job.

147
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:06,837
- Ah, I won!

148
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,066
- Those are some of our
Christmas favorites,

149
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,197
Hashtag Christmas Favorites.

150
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,650
- We'd love to hear
your Christmas favorites

151
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,924
in the comments below.

152
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:13,757
- Yes.

153
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:14,590
- Goodnight.

154
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,590
- Goodnight.

155
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,940
- J-House (moos)

156
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,086
- What, what was that?

157
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:30,384
- Gotta keep it fresh.

158
00:05:30,384 --> 00:05:31,821
- Keep it fresh?

159
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,529
That was painful.

160
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:37,446
- I was thinking like
moooo, like J-house ohhh.

161
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:40,665
- Like a cow?

162
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:41,498
- Yeah.

163
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:42,331
- Okay.

164
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,316
- Your turn.

165
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:46,233
- J-House (snorts)

166
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,217
it was a pig.

167
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:49,844
- No it didn't, I got the pig.

168
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:52,511
J-House (crows)

169
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:58,869
- J-House (bleats)

170
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,249
- That was your best one yet.

171
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,398
J-House (roars)

172
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:03,466
- Was that a lion?

173
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,094
- Yeah.

174
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:09,261
- J-House (trumpets like elephant)

175
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,503
J-House ho-ho-hoed.

176
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:17,773
That was a Santa, that was a Santa joke.

177
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,693
- Oh I heard you, I heard you on that one.

178
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:23,709
- Maybe we shouldn't do J-House
at the end of our videos.

179
00:06:23,709 --> 00:00:00,000
- Goodnight.
