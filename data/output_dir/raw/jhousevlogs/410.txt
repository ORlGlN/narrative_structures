00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:06,818
(adventurous music)

2
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:13,803
(cheerful piano music)

3
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:32,001
- Good morning.

4
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:38,078
- [Jeremy] How was the bus ride?

5
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:38,996
- Great.

6
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:39,908
- Thank you.

7
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:41,908
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye!

8
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:45,694
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

9
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:53,128
- Alright, we find where the balloons are.

10
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:57,908
- [Jeremy] You guys snuggling up?

11
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:58,741
- Yeah.

12
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:02,181
A hot air balloon!

13
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:03,201
- [Jeremy] They starting to blow up?

14
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:04,368
- Yeah really.

15
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,342
Look it's a show.

16
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:11,141
- They're glowing!
(giggles with excitement)

17
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:14,297
- [Kendra] Look at them
guys, look at 'em glowing.

18
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:16,380
(cheers)

19
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:25,132
- Yeah, and the subway is
coming up to the first leader.

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,833
- We have some announcers here

21
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,075
at the hot air balloon festival.

22
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:29,908
- [Jeremy] (Chuckles)
- Look at that,

23
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:33,605
United States on go, it's
going up really fast.

24
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:38,514
And the lighthouse, it's
glowing and it's way up.

25
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,731
- [Caleb] Oh look guys,
look up at the top!

26
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,253
Look at that! Look at it!

27
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:45,170
(excited chatter)

28
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:49,338
- [Kendra] You guys
remember how hot air rises?

29
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:50,171
- [Isaac] Um, yeah.

30
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:52,682
- We stayed up the whole night?

31
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:53,766
- [Jeremy] Almost.
- Not the whole night,

32
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,563
but a lot of it.

33
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:57,189
That's the sun rising over there.

34
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,439
(relaxing horns music)

35
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,735
- Alright, now as the sun is coming up,

36
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,767
more balloons are going
up, and there's some

37
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,328
right in front of us
getting ready to set up.

38
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:18,345
- There's horses!
- [Kendra] There are horses.

39
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:21,439
So the police are here riding
around on beautiful horses.

40
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,689
(happy acoustic music)

41
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,528
- [Jeremy] So they're taking off in waves.

42
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,779
So the initial wave went
off when it was still dark,

43
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:33,579
and now there's a whole line going.

44
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,829
(happy acoustic music)

45
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,975
(happy light rock music)

46
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,205
- [Kendra] Caleb, what's your
favorite shape you've seen?

47
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,049
- Darth Vader.

48
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,454
- [Kendra] Oh, Darth
Vader, what was yours?

49
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,946
- Mine is the water drop.

50
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:13,167
- [Kendra] Ooh, over there?
- [Isaac] Uh huh.

51
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,740
- [Kendra] There's the water droplet.

52
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,585
- Mine is the frog without a head.

53
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,729
- [Kendra] (laughs)

54
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,761
You're right, it doesn't have a head.

55
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,148
- [Jeremy] Yeah, maybe it'll come up.

56
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:25,165
- [Kendra] Hey Laura,
what's your favorite shape?

57
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:25,998
- Uhhh...

58
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,210
... uhh ...

59
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,043
... the ...

60
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:35,126
(upbeat chill music)

61
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,308
- [Isaac] Hey, look at that bug!

62
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:44,274
- [Kendra] This really pretty one up here.

63
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,670
- It does have a head.

64
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,496
- [Kendra] You're right,
it was just backwards.

65
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:50,579
(upbeat chill music)

66
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:22,479
- [Jeremy] So cool that
we get to be right here

67
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,979
where they're setting them up.

68
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:28,998
Do you see it?

69
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:36,176
It's so cool.
- [Children] Yeah.

70
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,426
(happy acoustic music)

71
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:53,798
- [Jeremy] Is it loud?

72
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:56,876
You can see the balloon
hovering off the ground

73
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,793
as it gets ready to go.

74
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:15,091
- Ready to go.

75
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:28,178
(adventurous music)

76
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,666
(applause)

77
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:59,813
- I could just look
into the sky for hours.

78
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:01,455
- [Jeremy] Well, you're in good company.

79
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:05,288
- There are so many
people here, it's awesome.

80
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,136
- Look at that adorable butterfly!

81
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:15,580
Hey Laura, what do you see?

82
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,747
- A butterfly!

83
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,549
- [Jeremy] A butterfly.

84
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:23,132
(relaxing classical music)

85
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,217
- Well, this is magnificent,
I have seriously never seen

86
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,132
this many hot air balloons in my life.

87
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:38,715
(relaxing classical music)

88
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:02,135
(soft fast-paced piano music)

89
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,174
- So on both sides of the freeway,

90
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:41,257
you can see hot air balloons landing.

91
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:55,132
What a blessing it didn't
land in the freeway.

92
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:04,727
- [Bus Driver] You're welcome.

93
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,485
- [Jeremy] Who's ready for a nap?

94
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,973
- [Laura] Me!

95
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:10,711
- Alright, well, we have a
seven-and-a-half hour drive

96
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:13,025
to Oklahoma City, so
we'll see you guys there!

97
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,358
(music box)

98
00:08:17,322 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Elise] Good night, J House out.
