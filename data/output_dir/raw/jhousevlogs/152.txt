1
00:00:00,558 --> 00:00:01,391
- Good morning friends.

2
00:00:01,391 --> 00:00:05,136
Three years ago today,
September 18th, 2014,

3
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:09,387
was the first time we ever
posted a J House vlog.

4
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:10,747
So I'm gonna put in the description box

5
00:00:10,747 --> 00:00:12,721
some of our favorite vlogs over the years

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,153
and I'm gonna start today's video

7
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:16,329
with our original intro.

8
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,592
Enjoy.

9
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:20,175
(bright music)

10
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:45,192
(happy music)

11
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:52,871
- [Kendra] Good job.

12
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:54,627
Did you get all the laundry hampers?

13
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:55,460
- Yep.

14
00:00:56,526 --> 00:00:57,859
One, two, three.

15
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,092
- [Kendra] Three?

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,294
Not two, how many are there?

17
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:06,294
Three.
- One, two, three.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,233
Good job.

19
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,066
Thanks for helping with the laundry.

20
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:12,269
So this morning I am spontaneously
cleaning out my pantry.

21
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:14,271
There wasn't enough room to
put some of my stuff away

22
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:15,643
and so I was like what is going on here.

23
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,748
I just found three different open things

24
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:19,045
of goldfish crackers.

25
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,493
And I also found four different
open things of pretzels.

26
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:25,021
Clearly it's just a disorganized pantry.

27
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,369
It's not that I don't have enough space,

28
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,475
it's that it's not organized well.

29
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,050
So we're working on that this morning.

30
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,462
Yep, there's the mandarin oranges.

31
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:33,872
We found peanut butter.

32
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:35,561
Everybody was telling me
we're out of peanut butter.

33
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,921
And in the very back of
the pantry, there it was,

34
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:39,723
a whole thing of peanut butter.

35
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:40,556
- Whoo!

36
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,345
- [Kendra] Work out.

37
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:45,149
Working out with peanut butter.

38
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,107
- Whoa, it's actually kind of heavy.

39
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,897
- [Kendra] Yeah, don't drop it dude.

40
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:51,480
(upbeat music)

41
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:57,564
- [Jeremy] Perfect.

42
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:58,597
(Laura babbles)

43
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:00,533
Thanks for helping.

44
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,374
- Janae has been really fussy today

45
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:05,431
and I found something that she likes.

46
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:09,598
- [Kendra] She likes going
around in the laundry hamper.

47
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:13,316
I like that you're going
slow enough to keep her safe.

48
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:15,276
- I also put some toys in there.

49
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,014
She (mutters).

50
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:19,707
And I also made a little track.

51
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,651
- [Kendra] He's loving it.

52
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:21,734
Thanks buddy.

53
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:25,264
Hey Janae.

54
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:29,431
(gasps) Are you playing with Caleb?

55
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:32,885
- All aboard!

56
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:38,806
The Caleb Happy Baker is on his way.

57
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,401
- [Kendra] Are you helping too Laura?

58
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,881
- Yep.
- Yep.

59
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,010
(Janae babbles)

60
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,128
- [Kendra] Yeah.

61
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,659
And she's got more toys.

62
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,227
- Yeah, I actually gave some to her.

63
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:50,191
- Good job team.

64
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,908
Janae's actually been super fussy today.

65
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:52,834
I don't know if she's teething

66
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:54,947
or getting an ear infection
or something, but,

67
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:56,526
since Caleb and Laura have
been playing with her,

68
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:58,758
I haven't heard a peep.

69
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:02,841
- Max is inviting friends
to watch a movie today.

70
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:08,840
- Alright, so we've got
out sand play dough.

71
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,695
And what we're gonna do today

72
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,674
is we're gonna build our own Oregon trail.

73
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,707
So you wanna build some
plains and some mountains.

74
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:18,324
And then I want you to
make your own wagon tracks.

75
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:22,370
(kids talking all at once)

76
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,535
Is that your Rocky Mountains?

77
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:24,510
- Uh huh.

78
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,620
- Okay, so while you guys are doing that

79
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,047
I'm gonna read you guys
real journal entries

80
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:31,277
from real people that
went on the Oregon trail.

81
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,711
So back then they didn't
have vlogs or cameras.

82
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,307
And so they wrote in their journals.

83
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:37,173
Which you can still write in journals now.

84
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:40,855
This is a little girl named
Katherine Sager Pringle.

85
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:43,751
And she crossed the plains in 1844.

86
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,679
"The motion of the wagon made us all sick

87
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,521
"and it was weeks before we got
used to the seasick motion."

88
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,795
But this time the wagon wheel
ran over the little girl.

89
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:53,997
- (gasps) Did she die?

90
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:56,351
- No, it looks like she broke her leg.

91
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,103
- How did the dad die?

92
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:00,580
- The daddy died 'cause he got sick.

93
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,009
- Oh.

94
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,499
- It was sad, huh?

95
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:05,167
- It's so sad.

96
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,194
Did their family cry.

97
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:08,720
- I'm sure their family cried.

98
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,469
Now we're reading about how sad they are.

99
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,063
The mommy is so sad, she is sick too.

100
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:15,313
- Aw, because of her daddy?

101
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,255
- Yeah.

102
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,947
"One night the captain
heard a child crying

103
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:21,268
"and found my little sister
had got out of the wagon

104
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,162
"and was perishing in the freezing air,

105
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,850
"for the nights were very cold."

106
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,371
They were orphans 'cause their
mommy and daddy were dead.

107
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,806
They died.
- But why?

108
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:29,639
- [Kendra] Because they got so sick

109
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,421
on the Oregon trail a long time ago.

110
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,851
- Aw, that was so sad.

111
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:36,289
- [Kendra] It was so sad.

112
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,206
- Are we gonna get to
meet those, those people?

113
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:44,342
- [Kendra] No, this happened
a long, long time ago.

114
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:45,175
- Oh.

115
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:51,176
(happy music)

116
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:52,997
- [Jeremy] You created the
man of horn roller coaster,

117
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:54,080
Oregon trail.

118
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:56,526
- This is the start.

119
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:59,966
You go here, go over a
hill, go over a mountain,

120
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,530
then you're here.

121
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,282
- [Laura] This is my Oregon trail.

122
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:05,608
- Your trail actually looks
a lot like Independence Rock

123
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:06,717
where the pioneers would go up

124
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:08,805
and write their name in the rock.

125
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:10,583
- So our library does the coolest thing.

126
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,331
It's called like Food for Fines.

127
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:13,491
So when you have library fines,

128
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:14,759
like overdue fines on your book,

129
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,483
which happens to us quite frequently,

130
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,586
instead of just paying them money

131
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,696
you can bring in donations of canned goods

132
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,678
and then they give that
to the local food bank.

133
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:24,132
And I just think that's awesome.

134
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:26,721
It makes me feel better about
accumulating library fines,

135
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:27,949
which happens.

136
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,449
(jazzy music)

137
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,417
Since I've just got the boys with me,

138
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,846
we decided to bring some school work

139
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:40,134
and so some school work
here at the library

140
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:43,910
while Elise gets her tutoring session in.

141
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,553
She's so cute in there working hard

142
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,384
and she's really enjoying
her tutoring sessions.

143
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:49,217
- Hey.

144
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,293
Hey.

145
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:54,948
Who is there?

146
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,749
Janae can see her image
in the view finder.

147
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,118
She's so curious.

148
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,526
Who is that beautiful person?

149
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:12,895
I just love her.

150
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:14,425
And I want to eat you.

151
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,861
- [Kendra] Do you like
doing school at the library?

152
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,788
- Yeah, I like it.

153
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:18,142
It's a lot more quiet.

154
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:18,975
- [Kendra] I think it's mostly quiet,

155
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:21,341
'cause Laura and Janae aren't here.

156
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:23,431
These two are checking out
the books for me today.

157
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:25,238
Even though we now come to
the library twice a week,

158
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:26,829
we still always get a lot of books.

159
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:30,472
We're kind of addicted to the library.

160
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,066
- When we were at CVX
Live, we had the chance

161
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,615
to meet Evie Clair.

162
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:36,820
She's the 13 year old that's
on America's Got Talent.

163
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,881
And it's been so sad

164
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,880
because her father's been battling cancer

165
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,224
and he just recently passed away.

166
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:44,107
I just was reading his obituary.

167
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:48,056
And thinking about what
an amazing life he led,

168
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:50,140
it's amazing how hearing about that story

169
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,755
of Evie's father passing away,

170
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:54,858
does so much to soften my heart

171
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:57,357
to think about the way
I'm talking to my kids,

172
00:06:57,357 --> 00:07:01,015
the way that I'm living my life
and how I need to focus more

173
00:07:01,015 --> 00:07:04,020
on loving and caring, the
things that matter most.

174
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,548
And so I'm just grateful
for that perspective.

175
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:09,452
And the great example that
Evie and her family have been,

176
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:13,619
right now, when they're
under so much of a spotlight.

177
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:15,904
Good catch.

178
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:18,161
- Why my head is still hurting.

179
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,797
- [Jeremy] Oh good try.

180
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,056
- Dad, my head's still hurting.

181
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:21,956
- [Jeremy] Is your head still hurting?

182
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:23,953
- Yeah when I bonk.

183
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:25,414
- [Jeremy] Bonk, did you bonk your head?

184
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:27,558
- She's hit her head twice.

185
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,444
- [Jeremy] What are these called again?

186
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:31,132
- [Kendra] Hawaiian sliders?

187
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:32,126
- Yummy.

188
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,294
So we're in a rush for dinner tonight

189
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:35,053
because we have soccer for this guy,

190
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,251
gymnastics for these guys,

191
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:38,799
and then we have your first
violin lesson tonight.

192
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:39,693
Are you excited about that?

193
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,061
- [Caleb] At seven!

194
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,387
- All during dinner our
kids have been training

195
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:46,554
to wink with each eye and
it's pretty entertaining.

196
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,468
There's one eye.

197
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:53,579
Okay, wink with the other.

198
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,957
Oh, that's just closing your eyes.

199
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:56,790
Okay, now

200
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,623
the other eye.

201
00:07:57,623 --> 00:07:58,456
- I can't.

202
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,821
(laughing)

203
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:02,819
- Pretty good.

204
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,152
There's one eye.

205
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,606
Janae can you do it?

206
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,603
- [Laura] She did it!

207
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:16,439
- [Jeremy] There it is.

208
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,189
(dramatic music)

209
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:34,116
- We are going to gymnastics.

210
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:36,113
I just love gymnastics.

211
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:38,932
And I'm really glad that
mom signed me up for it.

212
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:39,948
- Knock knock.

213
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:40,979
- [Kendra] Who's there?

214
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,674
- Interrupting cow.

215
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:44,307
- Interrupting cow--
- Moo!

216
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,736
(Kendra laughs)

217
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:46,970
- [Kendra] Classic.

218
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,887
- Today we are on time.

219
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:51,214
So weird.

220
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,682
(Kendra laughs)

221
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:55,784
(laughing)

222
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:57,269
- [Jeremy] Look at that sunset.

223
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:00,602
- I'm going to violin lessons, my first.

224
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:04,399
- [Jeremy] I'm excited for ya.

225
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,566
- Try to learn a new instrument
other than the piano.

226
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,646
- This is called the bridge.

227
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,265
(playful plucking)

228
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,098
- The pad, the scroll.

229
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,700
- [Teacher] Let's pluck the bottom string.

230
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:25,283
That's G.

231
00:09:25,283 --> 00:09:27,803
- [Laura] Goodnight, J House out.

232
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:30,386
