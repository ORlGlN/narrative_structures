00:00:00,622 --> 00:00:02,248
- [Kendra] Today's a
big day for this girl.

2
00:00:02,248 --> 00:00:04,078
Who wants to help feed Janae?

3
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:04,912
- Me.

4
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:05,750
- [Kendra] Do you know what's happening?

5
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,391
She likes it.

6
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:08,272
- [Jeremy] Elise is gonna try

7
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:10,376
some of what Janae's been eating.

8
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:11,910
- Everybody get in the wagon.

9
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,199
(yelling)

10
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,114
- Wagon ho!

11
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,942
- [Kendra] I got you a surprise.

12
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:17,942
(gasps)

13
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:22,215
(bright music)

14
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:30,669
So Caleb is moving this string,

15
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:34,086
by having it wrapped around the banister.

16
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:36,932
- Almost done.

17
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:41,384
- [Kendra] What are you
doing with the string?

18
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:45,375
Oh, so she linked her
door handles together.

19
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,365
Way to go.

20
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:47,198
You did it the same as Caleb,

21
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:48,524
you were inspired by him?

22
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:49,992
- Yeah.

23
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:52,179
- [Kendra] This string is going up here,

24
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,994
around this banister,
around that banister,

25
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:57,244
back up and over this knob.

26
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,504
- This is mini-me,

27
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:05,150
but her name is Emily,

28
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,938
but soon I'll have long hair

29
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:07,771
- [Kendra] Yeah.

30
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:08,638
- and do a big bun.

31
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:10,686
- [Kendra] Do you miss your long hair?

32
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:11,519
Yeah.

33
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,793
I love your short hair,

34
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:14,641
but I know you've been
missing your long hair lately.

35
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,474
- Mmm-mmm.

36
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:16,546
- [Kendra] And luckily hairs grows.

37
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:18,442
Before you know it, you're
hair's gonna be long again.

38
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:21,298
Today's a big day for this girl.

39
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,345
Janae, you ready to eat food?

40
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:24,426
- We know that she's ready.

41
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:26,330
For the last two or three weeks

42
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,562
she's been just looking at
our food and wanting it,

43
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:29,719
grabbing at it.

44
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,662
- [Kendra] Who wants to help feed Janae?

45
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:32,539
- Me.
- Me!

46
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,626
- [Kendra] Who wants
to taste her baby food?

47
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:35,459
- [Jeremy] Ooh.

48
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,292
- Me!

49
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,932
(Kendra laughing)

50
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,212
- [Kendra] There's a few takers,

51
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,300
and a few not takers.

52
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,168
- [Jeremy] Isaac, do you
want to try some peas?

53
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,760
- [Elise] I love baby food.

54
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,091
- [Kendra] You love baby food?

55
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:46,924
I don't know if you're
gonna like this one.

56
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:50,530
This one's rice cereal.
(Janae sneezes)

57
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,338
(Kendra laughing)

58
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:54,694
Hey you.

59
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:55,757
So for her first food,

60
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:57,471
I mixed together some rice cereal

61
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:01,877
and some water, and just a
touch of baby sweet potatoes.

62
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:03,941
And I wanted to make it really runny.

63
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,300
Do you know what's happening here?

64
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,924
We're gonna feed you food.

65
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:11,547
(baby cooing)

66
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,783
Who thinks she's gonna like it?

67
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:14,821
Okay, there's some votes for like it.

68
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:17,842
Who thinks she's not gonna like it?

69
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:18,960
(baby cooing)

70
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,105
Okay here it goes.

71
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:21,272
Here it comes.

72
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,873
What was that?
- Like a pro.

73
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:34,522
- [Kendra] What was that?

74
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,812
- [Jeremy] She swallowed it.

75
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:38,145
- You want some?

76
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:44,203
(laughing)

77
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,343
- [Jeremy] She's full on eating it.

78
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:48,366
- She's so into it.

79
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:50,116
Hi baby, we're ready.

80
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,040
Did you like it?

81
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,873
Do you want some more?

82
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,453
This is the best response to a first food

83
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,261
we've ever had in our family.

84
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,684
Alright, are you ready for another bite?

85
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,849
Here it comes, oh you're
already helping eat.

86
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:12,016
- [Jeremy] She's like Mom, I
can just hold the spoon myself.

87
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,259
(laughing)

88
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:17,484
- Give me more.

89
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:21,558
Somebody likes eating.

90
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:23,780
- [Laura] Can I?

91
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,362
- [Kendra] You want to try feeding her?

92
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,825
Okay.

93
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:27,658
(Janae yelling)

94
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,971
- [Jeremy] Give me more!

95
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:31,221
(laughing)

96
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:37,013
- Yep, you can try feeding
her all by yourself.

97
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:40,587
It's coming, it's coming.

98
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,192
She likes it.

99
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,536
(laughing)

100
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:49,168
- [Jeremy] So Isaac was our
first little baby to do this,

101
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:51,210
and he had a bad reaction to food.

102
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,368
You would gag and you didn't
like the texture in your mouth.

103
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:57,744
- [Isaac] I was too young
when you guys did it.

104
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:01,749
- [Kendra] We did not
know what we were doing.

105
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:03,999
She wants to do it herself.

106
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,515
- Come on, come on.

107
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,035
(laughing)

108
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:11,658
- I'll open my mouth so wide

109
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:12,991
if I was a baby.

110
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,036
- [Kendra] When you were a baby?

111
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,048
That's a good plan, not
when you're a grandma?

112
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,215
- Now she's sucking on it.

113
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:24,455
(lively music)

114
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:25,404
- [Kendra] What do you think Isaac?

115
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,599
How does the food look?

116
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,432
- Grotty.

117
00:04:28,432 --> 00:04:29,338
- [Kendra] I just
remembered how we did this.

118
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:32,290
Here Janae, here, you hold this one.

119
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,202
Okay, now you feed her with that one.

120
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:36,242
(laughing)

121
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,259
- [Jeremy] She's too smart for that.

122
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,918
She's like wait a minute, this red spoon

123
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:40,631
doesn't have anything.

124
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,612
- So when some of our kids did this,

125
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:44,237
we would just give them
another spoon to play with,

126
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:47,570
but she's just putting it in her mouth.

127
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:51,715
(baby cooing)

128
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:52,887
You want more?

129
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:54,161
- [Jeremy] She ate the whole thing.

130
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,039
- So now we're gonna
give her one of these.

131
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:57,872
Okay.

132
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:04,987
What do you think?

133
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:07,255
- [Jeremy] Dissolvable cardboard.

134
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,172
- Yeah, basically.

135
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:11,396
Sp this is an organic teething wafer.

136
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:12,917
It's sweet potato and banana flavored.

137
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:14,643
Who wants to try this?

138
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:15,770
- Me!
- Me!

139
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,603
- Alright.

140
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:21,442
- [Jeremy] Give it a try.

141
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,779
(crunching)

142
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:24,612
- It's good.

143
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:25,445
- [Caleb] My turn.

144
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:26,278
- [Jeremy] It's good.

145
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:27,111
- This may backfire, letting them test

146
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:30,278
the baby food, if now they
want to eat Janae's baby food.

147
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,365
(crunching)

148
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,464
- Whoa, this is actually good.

149
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:35,514
(loud baby cooing)

150
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:37,143
- [Jeremy] The incredible hulk.

151
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:39,393
(laughing)

152
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:43,430
(crunching)

153
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,823
- I like it.

154
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:45,862
- [Jeremy] Cheer for Nae Nae.

155
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,342
(clapping)

156
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:49,815
- [Elise] You did it!

157
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:50,648
- You did it.

158
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:53,814
I'll give you this spoon as a reward.

159
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,147
I'll try eating this end.

160
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,323
- [Jeremy] Alright, Elise is gonna try

161
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,073
some of what Janae's been eating.

162
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,060
- Okay.

163
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:09,077
Hey, it's actually pretty good.

164
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,208
- I'm just gonna watch.

165
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:15,249
- [Jeremy] It's not very good?

166
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,082
- It's good.

167
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:18,165
- Just a little bit good.

168
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,598
- Would you want to eat that for you

169
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:24,094
- Breakfast?
- Breakfast?

170
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:27,137
- [Jeremy] No (laughs).

171
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,408
- I want one more taste.

172
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:30,137
- [Jeremy] Yeah, you can
have as much as you want.

173
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:30,970
- Okay.

174
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,470
- You can eat the whole thing.

175
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:38,474
- It's more liquidy.

176
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:41,420
Caleb I really want you to try some.

177
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,253
That much.

178
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,601
- I don't like it.

179
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,065
It's weird.

180
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:53,473
- I guess I'm just a
person who likes baby food.

181
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,951
- [Jeremy] I guess so.

182
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,663
(mock gagging)

183
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:00,191
(laughing)

184
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:02,012
- [Kendra] So here's
our library book stash,

185
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:05,292
the books that we've been
reading about the Oregon Trail.

186
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,642
Alright, a true book, the Oregon Trail.

187
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:11,665
(twangy uptempo music)

188
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,777
Isaac is playing Oregon Trail.

189
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:16,886
- Our family is not doing that well.

190
00:07:16,886 --> 00:07:18,573
- [Kendra] What happened to your family?

191
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,383
- I have the weasels.
- Caleb has the measles.

192
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:21,476
- [Kendra] The what?

193
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:22,635
- Measles.

194
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:24,718
- Oh no!
- Caleb has died.

195
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,858
- [Kendra] Caleb you died.

196
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:31,626
Okay, so the weather is hot,
your health is very poor.

197
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:33,889
Do you think you're
gonna make it to Oregon?

198
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,146
- No.

199
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:38,264
- Can we restart the
game, so I'm still alive?

200
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:40,054
- Poor Isaac, he's made
it halfway to Oregon

201
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,312
on the Oregon Trail game,

202
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:43,640
and everybody in his family has died.

203
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,981
They got measles, they had fevers,

204
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,581
they lost all their food,

205
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:49,524
when the wagon tipped over on a river.

206
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:51,610
It's been a sad game.

207
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,166
- [Isaac] Me sad.

208
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,607
- [Kendra] Isaac you did a great job.

209
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,990
I know everybody died and
you didn't make it to Oregon,

210
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,599
but you can try again.

211
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,654
- All the people in your party have died.

212
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:04,285
(lively music)

213
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,783
- [Jeremy] What in the
world are you guys doing?

214
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:07,616
- Go that way.

215
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:08,838
- Making a wagon.

216
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,380
- [Jeremy] You're making a wagon?

217
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,213
- Yeah.

218
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:12,546
- [Jeremy] Cool.

219
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:17,407
- [Kendra] Laura, you
help push it down, okay?

220
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,649
Alright, so how long is
this side of the wagon?

221
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,090
- 10 feet.

222
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,549
- [Kendra] And how wide is it?

223
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:24,382
- Four.

224
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:25,946
- Alright everybody get in the wagon.

225
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:27,802
(yelling and laughing)

226
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:29,378
so what if we had to fit everything

227
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:32,042
we wanted to take on
our trip in this wagon?

228
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:32,875
- Food, a lot of food.

229
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,749
- I'm actually gonna
take a whole pack of food

230
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,101
in my lunchbox, and yours
and yours and yours.

231
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:43,903
- I would take a gun and
bullets to have protection

232
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,191
and to hunt, if you run out of food.

233
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,886
- I would pack a gun,

234
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:49,727
the same thing as Isaac,

235
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:53,425
but then I would also pack a computer.

236
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:56,088
- A computer, nowadays that
would be a great choice.

237
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:57,912
So this book is a comparison of a family

238
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,860
that moved from Independence, Missouri

239
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,402
to Oregon City in 1846 on the Oregon Trail

240
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:03,587
and a family that did it now.

241
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:04,420
And so it's interesting to see

242
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,940
the side by side comparison.

243
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,472
1846, we take a raft across the river.

244
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,145
It's exciting, but my
brother Ned is worried

245
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:11,649
we might tip over.

246
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:12,537
Look, that's the Kansas River, guys,

247
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:13,370
that's right by us.

248
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,313
Monday, we drive over a bridge to Kansas.

249
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:18,233
So it was scary for them.

250
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,795
They would come to a
river and then be like,

251
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:20,801
oh my goodness, we have to cross it.

252
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,163
But we just get to drive over it.

253
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:24,550
- [Jeremy] Are you guys trying
to make a covered wagon?

254
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,800
- [Caleb] I'm getting some.

255
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:32,526
(laughing)

256
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:35,742
- I've come with the oxen.

257
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,833
Let's get packed up guys.

258
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,060
- I brought flour for our journey.

259
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,374
We can use it for a pillow.

260
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,028
- And you guys remember,
we're gonna clean up

261
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:44,907
after this, right?

262
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,378
- Yeah, we're fine.

263
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,211
- [Jeremy] Yeah?

264
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,465
Are you sick Laura?

265
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:49,874
- I'm just pretending.

266
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:51,197
- [Jeremy] Okay, you're just pretending?

267
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:53,165
- So I never surprise Jeremy.

268
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,934
I cannot successfully surprise him,

269
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,367
because I am a can't
keep a secret from him,

270
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,267
because I am just a chatterbox,

271
00:09:58,267 --> 00:09:59,702
and I get so excited about surprises

272
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:00,806
that I tell him right away.

273
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:03,289
So inside this box is
a surprise for Jeremy.

274
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:04,369
It's something small,

275
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,082
but it's fun to be able to have

276
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:07,761
a little small thing to surprise him with.

277
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:10,129
I'm gonna let him open
it up in just a second.

278
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:10,962
What did you make Lise?

279
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:12,354
- My bonnet.

280
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:13,675
- [Kendra] Did you make
that all on your own?

281
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:14,508
- Uh-huh.

282
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:15,861
- [Kendra] You totally did,
I'm so impressed with it.

283
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:17,653
That's really cute.

284
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,626
So they are playing
Oregon Trail together now.

285
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,906
- I used to play this as a little kid

286
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:24,894
during computer time in
first, second and third grade.

287
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:25,727
- I think April

288
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:26,721
- This is like nostalgic.

289
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:29,665
It's almost like playing
original Nintendo.

290
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:30,802
Wild fruit.

291
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:31,826
Woo!

292
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:32,818
- And we can hunt,

293
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:34,554
we have a lot of ammunition.

294
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:35,893
- We have a lot of ammunition,

295
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:36,924
I bought a lot of bullets.

296
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:39,044
- It's amazing how exciting
these old school games are

297
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:39,877
for all of us.

298
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,610
- We've looked around at every fort,

299
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,593
(digital music)

300
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:44,461
at the awesome graphics.

301
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,531
- [Kendra] Are you guys almost there?

302
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:46,364
- Yeah.

303
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:47,197
- [Kendra] I don't think I've ever seen

304
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:48,490
the ending of this game.

305
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,777
- This part of it's intense.

306
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:51,293
- [Kendra] Look at that.

307
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,258
Oh no, here comes the rocks.

308
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:55,111
Get us there safely babe, you can do it.

309
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,528
- Good job Daddy.

310
00:10:58,778 --> 00:10:59,611
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

311
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:01,908
- [Kendra] There it is, Willamette Valley.

312
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,251
- We only lost one of the people.

313
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:07,220
Congratulations, you
have made it to Oregon.

314
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,346
Very nice.

315
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:10,049
How did you make that?

316
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,867
- I used paper and string, tape and a

317
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,156
- [Jeremy] Is that a paper plate?

318
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:15,989
- Y eah.

319
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:16,822
- [Jeremy] Genius.

320
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:19,568
- [Kendra] Janae has joined
the fun in the wagon.

321
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:21,401
You driving the wagon?

322
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:23,294
- Wagon ho!

323
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:25,281
- [Kendra] You pulling
it up the mountains?

324
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:26,537
- Where's the gun?

325
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:28,391
- [Kendra] You gonna go hunt?

326
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:30,260
How's the wagon?

327
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,760
(baby cooing)

328
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:36,100
I have a little something
I wanted to show you.

329
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,403
I got you a surprise.

330
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:38,236
- You did?

331
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:40,053
- [Kendra] Yeah and I actually
successfully surprised you.

332
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:41,379
You do not know
- You haven't told me yet?

333
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,090
- [Kendra] what I have for you.

334
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,128
- What could it be?

335
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:44,961
- [Kendra] You want to see?

336
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:45,794
- Yeah.

337
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:46,995
And you wrapped it for me?

338
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,463
- Yes I very carefully wrapped it for you

339
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:49,296
in an Amazon box.

340
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:50,360
- Do you guys know what it is?

341
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,426
- No.

342
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:52,426
- Let's see.

343
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:58,131
(gasps)

344
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,424
A whole stack of these
little cookie goodies?

345
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:01,959
- [Kendra] Yep.

346
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,066
- Oh my goodness.

347
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,793
So I thought of them today.

348
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,808
I was gonna look 'em up and get some.

349
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,607
I seriously was.

350
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:10,562
On our flight, they had
these little cookies

351
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:12,025
that they were giving that
had caramel in the middle,

352
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,296
they're waffle cookies.

353
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:15,352
- And they are amazing.

354
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:16,185
And Jeremy fell in love with them.

355
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,018
Before we left the plane,

356
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:18,248
he actually asked for,

357
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:20,772
he's like can I have one or
two of these to take home?

358
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:22,314
I got on Amazon and found them.

359
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:23,685
- They're filled with caramel.

360
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:26,053
- So the ones on the airplane
were individually wrapped,

361
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:30,205
so we may have to go through
these a little bit quicker.

362
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:31,190
- [Caleb] Can I try?

363
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,165
- These are like warm and softer.

364
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:34,332
Here, try one.

365
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,016
- I want to try it.

366
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:42,055
- [Caleb] These are a lot
softer than the other ones.

367
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,926
- [Jeremy] They are super soft.

368
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:45,847
- [Kendra] You went in for a big bite.

369
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:46,680
Good job.

370
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,805
- I'll let you guys have
whatever I don't finish

371
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,388
in this next bite.

372
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:55,741
- [Kendra] He's gonna eat the whole thing.

373
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,330
I know where this is going.

374
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,472
We ended the evening with a movie

375
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:01,661
and some snuggling that turned
into a lot of silliness,

376
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,029
so now we're gonna try and go to bed.

377
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,137
- (whispering) [All] Goodnight.

378
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:05,970
J House out.

379
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,000
- It's like a dream come true.

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,583
(bright music)

381
00:13:13,832 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Kendra] Here we go
