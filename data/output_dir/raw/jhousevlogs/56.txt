1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:02,076
- [Kendra] Where are we at?

2
00:00:02,076 --> 00:00:03,076
- The beach!

3
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:06,348
- [Kendra] Were you keeping watch for us?

4
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:08,902
(laughter)

5
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:10,152
This is so fun.

6
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:15,056
- Donuts with cookies and
cream ice cream and sprinkles.

7
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,639
(guitar music)

8
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:25,017
What are you guys doing?

9
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:26,039
- Doing pedals.

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,826
- [Jeremy] Doing the rose pedals?

11
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:29,707
You found those on the ground right?

12
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:31,240
You didn't pull off the tree?

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,816
What should we do with
all these rose pedals?

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,393
- We should plant 'em in the back yard

15
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:39,436
so then they can grow again.

16
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:40,969
- [Jeremy] Laura look, there's more pedals

17
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,153
down the ground over here.

18
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:44,653
See these beautiful pink ones?

19
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,166
Hand Laura one and you guys
can put them in the bowl.

20
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,083
(easy piano music)

21
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,177
- Nae-nae's standing.

22
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:58,593
- She's doing it!

23
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,520
She's doing it!

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,308
- I just had to give her my Fitbit

25
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:04,096
because she wanted the pencil.

26
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,395
Then she put both hands on it

27
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:09,042
and she just like held it.

28
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:12,966
- [Jeremy] Let's see
if she'll do it again.

29
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,216
She's doing it.

30
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:16,983
So I think today is the clearest day

31
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,864
that we've had here in San Diego.

32
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:21,581
So we're busting out something
fun for the kids to do.

33
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,810
We're just gonna do it
one at a time with them.

34
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,249
Do you know what's inside here buddy?

35
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:26,712
- Binoculars.

36
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,734
- [Jeremy] Do you wanna look out

37
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,636
and see if you can find
a boat on the ocean?

38
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:32,517
Have you ever used binoculars like this?

39
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:33,609
- No.

40
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:36,192
(upbeat music)

41
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:48,051
- Surfers, there's the surfers.

42
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:51,051
- [Jeremy] It's warm enough to surf.

43
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:55,389
Janae's doing this thing
lately where she starts

44
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:57,688
slipping down into the splits.

45
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:01,105
Sometimes she gets stuck on her way down.

46
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,142
(easy music)

47
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:16,854
Pretty cool huh?

48
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:19,700
What have you seen out there?

49
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,092
- I've seen a boat.

50
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:24,414
I see an _ over there.

51
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:25,997
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

52
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:31,148
- I told Grandma to take me
way out in the deep water,

53
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:33,539
but not too far out.

54
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,039
- You can come here for lunch.

55
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,089
Yeah, bye.

56
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:40,784
- [Jeremy] Who's coming over for lunch?

57
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:41,617
Moana.

58
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,894
- Well it is bright and
sunny and warm out today

59
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:47,169
and we decided to go out for a walk.

60
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:50,676
Oh that biker, that's a hard thing too.

61
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:53,578
(piano music)

62
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:54,786
It's fun to walk through the neighborhood

63
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,365
and just see all the different houses

64
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,688
and the gorgeous view.

65
00:02:57,688 --> 00:02:59,476
Anyway it's actually a
very hilly neighborhood

66
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:00,916
which of course we need so that we

67
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,541
can have the view that
we have up on the hill.

68
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,818
But it's giving me a very good workout,

69
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,536
especially pushing the stroller.

70
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:07,835
Are you getting a good workout?

71
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:11,086
Caleb, are you up in the tree?

72
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:13,640
Were you keeping watch for us?

73
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,755
What do you have?

74
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:15,916
- Flower pedals.

75
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,820
- [Kendra] Flower pedals, let me see them.

76
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,027
- Me and Caleb did it.

77
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:20,467
- [Kendra] That's beautiful,
what a great idea.

78
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,050
(upbeat music)

79
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:27,456
- [Jeremy] So we added some tap water into

80
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:29,592
one of these that we had already used

81
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:33,609
to drink water out of to
just let Laura play out here.

82
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,094
You can add rose pedals into there too.

83
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,677
(upbeat music)

84
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:51,889
- [Kendra] Hi.

85
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:54,252
What are you making big girl?

86
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:56,133
- Flower pedals.

87
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,596
- [Kendra] You're making flower pedals?

88
00:03:57,596 --> 00:04:01,427
- Yeah, they're gonna be clean and soft.

89
00:04:01,427 --> 00:04:03,075
- [Kendra] Oh, that'll be so nice.

90
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,992
Janae, are you helping?

91
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,955
- She's helping splash the water.

92
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:09,897
- [Kendra] Yeah she is.

93
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,774
Laura, what are you having for a snack?

94
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:12,607
- L A

95
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:13,440
U R A.

96
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:16,706
- [Kendra] You spell your name?

97
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:18,146
You guys looking for your letters?

98
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:21,229
- [Caleb] Oh here's an A, that's a V.

99
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,492
- [Elise] E J.

100
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:25,994
- Caleb.

101
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:27,016
- [Kendra] Nailed it.

102
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,918
I bet you're wishing
your name was super long.

103
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,821
Then you could eat a really long one.

104
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:35,630
Is this eight because you're
turning eight next week?

105
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,907
- Eight, E J.

106
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:40,158
- [Kendra] Eight, Elise Johnston.

107
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:42,741
(upbeat music)

108
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:52,952
Before we hit the beach,
we're getting a treat

109
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:54,926
from a place called the Baked Bear.

110
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:56,203
Apparently they make really good

111
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:58,850
custom ice cream sandwiches
and ice cream sandwiches.

112
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,683
- Hopefully it's good.

113
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,307
- [Kendra] Ice cream's
almost always good right?

114
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:07,976
- Well, it doesn't mean if
it looks good it tastes good.

115
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:09,183
- [Kendra] That's a good point.

116
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,716
- So they actually take a donut

117
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:13,618
and do an ice cream
sandwich out of a donut.

118
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:16,201
(techno music)

119
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:21,211
I'm just gonna sample everything first.

120
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,794
(techno music)

121
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,685
- That looks yummy.

122
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:32,217
- [Jeremy] Did you see how they made it?

123
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:34,353
Oh, the snicker doodle one looks so good.

124
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:38,440
- Thank you for more than anyone on Earth.

125
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,483
It looks so good.

126
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,620
- [Child] Thank you.

127
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,106
- [Jeremy] Go ahead.

128
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:45,453
What flavor is the blue one?

129
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:46,985
- Cotton Candy.
- It's so good.

130
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,007
- [Jeremy] What is it?

131
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:52,174
- I don't know what it's-
- It's like cotton candy.

132
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,321
- [Jeremy] It's good?

133
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,968
Oh you put a brownie on bottom.

134
00:05:57,968 --> 00:05:59,501
- This is the way that
I like to eat ice cream,

135
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:03,334
with cookies and brownies,
so this is awesome.

136
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:10,182
She was just reaching for it so cutely.

137
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:12,932
That's her first bite of a sweet.

138
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:16,498
- Donut with cookies and
cream ice cream and sprinkles.

139
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:19,818
- I don't know if you guys know this

140
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:22,372
but cookies are absolutely
my favorite treat.

141
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:24,601
They're pretty much my
love language practically.

142
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,482
I really adore a delicious cookie

143
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:28,015
and those cookies were good.

144
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,454
I like the ice cream sandwiches,

145
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:32,194
but really I just wanna go
back and eat all the cookies.

146
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:33,309
Where are we at?

147
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,586
- The beach!

148
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:37,169
(guitar music)

149
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,554
- We made it to the beach
and we couldn't find parking

150
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:42,341
so Jeremy dropped the kids and I off

151
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,408
and all of our gear, so
we're gonna go get set up

152
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:46,010
and then he'll join us.

153
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,495
- I wanna go down there by the water.

154
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:50,190
- I'm feeling a little
bit like Super Woman now,

155
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,908
I've got five kids alone at
the beach and we're alive.

156
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:54,114
I told the kids not to get in the water

157
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,088
until Jeremy gets here to join us.

158
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:58,317
We've got a little beach camp all set up.

159
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,594
What'd you find?

160
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:00,616
- Sea shell.

161
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:03,681
- [Kendra] That's not a
sea shell, that's sea weed.

162
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,654
- I found it in here.

163
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:07,187
- [Kendra] Well good job.

164
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:09,068
What did you make?

165
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:10,763
A Spanish hat?

166
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,596
Very nice.

167
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,506
Boys are playing football.

168
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:21,258
(cheers)

169
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:22,837
Nice one.

170
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:24,764
What do you think?

171
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:27,411
She's sitting on the blanket,
but she's reaching over

172
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:31,080
to try to see what in the world this is.

173
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,163
What is that?

174
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:34,911
So Janae, all on her own,

175
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,911
reached over and shoveled some sand.

176
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:42,528
Oh, this water's cold.

177
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,111
(upbeat music)

178
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,935
- I'm collecting sea shells.

179
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:51,185
- [Jeremy] Fun.

180
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:56,968
- Sea shells and cold legs.

181
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,367
(screams)

182
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:03,301
- I'm flying!

183
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:07,164
(upbeat music)

184
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:08,789
- So it was hot today
like over 80 degrees,

185
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,956
but that water is still freezing cold.

186
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,552
(upbeat music)

187
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:18,472
- Look at these sea shells.

188
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:20,144
- [Jeremy] Let me see them.

189
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:21,769
Good ones.

190
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,519
Janae, you playing with the sand?

191
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:26,596
Digging.

192
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,661
Oh that's a cool shell.

193
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,703
Oh, eat the sand.

194
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:34,786
Eat the sand.

195
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:36,595
You're wet.

196
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:39,927
What happened?

197
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:41,111
- I fell.

198
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:43,194
- But he's going back in.

199
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,574
(upbeat music)

200
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,644
(screams)

201
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:18,249
(upbeat music)

202
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:19,703
- Poll question, what
is your favorite thing

203
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:20,701
to do at the beach?

204
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,368
Let us know up here.

205
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:27,017
- Making sandcastles.

206
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,805
- Janae is into it too.

207
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:30,779
- [Kendra] She is, she is.

208
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,915
- [Grandma] She is all in,
she came scooching down

209
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:34,448
more and more.

210
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,887
My parents both grew up near the beach

211
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,513
and they took us kids to the beach

212
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:39,045
every chance they had growing up.

213
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,740
So it's really special to
have them here with us today

214
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,389
because I know how much
they love the beach.

215
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:43,828
So to be able to see them sharing that

216
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,036
with my kids is special.

217
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:46,824
Time to Boogie Board.

218
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:48,907
(cheers)

219
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,488
(upbeat music)

220
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:56,155
- [Grandpa] Hey Elise, good job.

221
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,945
You rode it all the way in.

222
00:09:58,945 --> 00:09:59,966
- [Kendra] You did it.

223
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,336
- Such a good workout and
it's really nostalgic for me

224
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:03,983
to be out in the ocean.

225
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,075
There's just nothing quite like it.

226
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:06,538
The waves are so powerful.

227
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,604
- [Kendra] What were you doing?

228
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:10,810
- Just like body surfing out there.

229
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,727
Really fun.

230
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,506
(upbeat music)

231
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:18,983
What do you think of Boogie Boarding?

232
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,539
- I like it.

233
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,789
- [Jeremy] It's a good one.

234
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:26,158
(cheers)

235
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,575
- [Grandpa] Ride it, ride it.

236
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,612
Touchdown.

237
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,933
- We're gonna put Janae's
feet in the water.

238
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,697
- [Jeremy] She's anxious.

239
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:39,780
She wants in.

240
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:46,731
That's sand.

241
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:47,981
Isn't that fun?

242
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,515
- Let's stand up.

243
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:52,792
Stand up.

244
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,875
- [Jeremy] She's walking on the sand.

245
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,291
Oh my goodness.

246
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,629
(laughter)

247
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,582
(upbeat music)

248
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:20,364
Looks like down at the pier,
there's clams all on the poles.

249
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:25,114
Laura, what do you think of the pier?

250
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:27,697
(upbeat music)

251
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:36,724
(laughter)

252
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:38,187
- This is so fun.

253
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:40,770
(upbeat music)

254
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:00,617
So Muga made us her
amazing spaghetti sauce

255
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:04,784
and we have spaghetti squash
and it's already to go.

256
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:07,955
- [Jeremy] And we're doing
grateful raspberries.

257
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,232
- I don't have a raspberry at the moment,

258
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:10,695
but I'm grateful for the really

259
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,227
warm weather that we had today.

260
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:13,760
We got to really enjoy the beach.

261
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,662
- I'm grateful for showers
'cause if we didn't shower,

262
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:19,565
then we would be all sandy and yucky.

263
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:21,982
(easy music)

264
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:26,043
- [Kendra] Bumped against the boat stairs

265
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:28,690
and Jack was the first out.

266
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,082
- Goodnight, J House out.

267
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:33,822
- It's a little teeny tiny.

268
00:12:33,822 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
