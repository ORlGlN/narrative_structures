00:00:00,226 --> 00:00:03,726
(upbeat orchestral music)

2
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,366
- We are recording

3
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:22,637
on the camera.
- We're live.

4
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:23,802
- For the first time.
- We are.

5
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:26,182
- We have a video on J House Vlogs.

6
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:29,331
It's 3:00 a.m. and I
just finished editing.

7
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:32,831
Kendra was wearing these super sexy pants.

8
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:34,857
Am I allowed to say that?

9
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:36,357
- No!
- This is PG.

10
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:38,390
She was.

11
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:44,846
- Don't film much right now near me.

12
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:45,679
- [Jeremy] What you?

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,504
(laughing)

14
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,042
Just as funny.

15
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:51,096
- Hello.

16
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,975
We have a fan!

17
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:55,142
Sam and Nia replied to us!

18
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:57,924
Want me to be real some more?

19
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,360
Here's my bathroom.

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,193
Oh!

21
00:01:02,801 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat orchestral music)
