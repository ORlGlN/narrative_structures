1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:02,264
- This is just wrong.

2
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:03,992
Oh my goodness.

3
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:06,575
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:09,536
Guys, what we're gonna make today

5
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:11,604
is a fruit Christmas tree.

6
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:15,604
(kids exclaiming in excitement)

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,920
(Janae babbles)

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,093
- [Jeremy] What are you doing?

9
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:22,178
Look at how well she's standing.

10
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:24,388
So this is a toy we've
had down in the garage.

11
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:26,807
We just pulled up for her.

12
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:29,018
- [Kendra] We realized she's
at just the right stage for it.

13
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:30,439
- Yeah.

14
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:31,439
Take a step.

15
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:33,472
Take a step.

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,000
There it is!

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,626
Good job.

18
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:40,543
(fun guitar music)

19
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:53,853
Somehow our garage always
gets unorganized and messy.

20
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:55,728
Again.

21
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:57,428
And one of the presents
we're getting for our kids

22
00:00:57,428 --> 00:01:00,223
is gonna require a clean garage.

23
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:01,826
So I'm doing that today.

24
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:02,879
And I'd love to hear in the comments,

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,220
your guesses of what present
we're getting the kids

26
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,238
that needs a clean garage.

27
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:10,415
- Why we do have all the winter stuff out?

28
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:13,103
- We are gonna go through
it today and see what fits,

29
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:14,695
so we're ready for a snowstorm.

30
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:16,199
So we gotta see which size you are.

31
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:17,211
You wanna try those ones on?

32
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,044
- Yeah.

33
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,004
It kinda of fit.

34
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:20,233
- [Jeremy] It totally fits.

35
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:21,436
- [Kendra] That looks awesome.

36
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:22,466
Okay, run around in it.

37
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:23,369
- [Jeremy] See if it works.

38
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:24,202
- [Isaac] It's overalls.

39
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:25,304
- So I decided that today was a good day

40
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:26,600
to get out all of the winter gear

41
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,930
and see what fits the kids.

42
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,325
That way we can hopefully be ready

43
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:30,827
when the first snowstorm comes.

44
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:33,590
Hey, this one might fit you great.

45
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,769
- [Jeremy] Where did we get that?

46
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,475
- I don't know, I have no
recollection of this one.

47
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:39,223
- [Jeremy] Thank you to
whoever gave that one to us.

48
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:40,056
- Right?

49
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,442
It's probably a hand
me down from somebody.

50
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:42,315
Does that one work?

51
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:43,148
- Yeah.

52
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,487
I like pink!

53
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:50,070
(bright music)

54
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:52,811
- Gloves.

55
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:53,663
When you have a lotta kids,

56
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,536
you acquire a lot of winter stuff.

57
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:57,600
And I just wanna go through
and see what we need

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,553
and what we don't need

59
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:00,293
so we can donate whatever
we're not using anymore

60
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:03,263
and buy whatever it is that the kids need.

61
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:05,832
We have four full tubs of winter stuff.

62
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,632
Winter stuff is big and bulky.

63
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:08,820
Try that one on.

64
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,652
- Me?

65
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:11,772
- Hey, try that one on.

66
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:12,944
- [Jeremy] My big coat.

67
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,887
(bright country music)

68
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,027
- [Kendra] I'm not going outside.

69
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,511
I'm gonna stay in where it's warm.

70
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:20,450
- And that has hot chocolate.

71
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,221
I mean make hot chocolate.
- That's my job.

72
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:25,193
That's my job, take care of
Janae and make hot chocolate.

73
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:26,707
- And love us.

74
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:28,009
- Yes.

75
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,509
Laura, this one's your jacket.

76
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:38,051
This one says 12 months so
this one's for little Janae.

77
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:40,056
So the zipper's broken on this one.

78
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:42,509
It's obviously a very old coat.

79
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,282
I think we're gonna get a
new coat for you this year.

80
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,351
So I'm feeling kinda disgusted.

81
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:51,912
This super cute snowsuit
is like this on the inside

82
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:54,284
and then look it, there's
another spot down here.

83
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:57,067
- [Jeremy] We're wondering
if maybe a mouse got to it.

84
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,234
- Kinda feeling grossed out about that.

85
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:00,685
- [Jeremy] Snow pants!

86
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:02,664
Alright, who has snow pants?

87
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:03,664
- [Kids] Me!

88
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:08,020
- [Jeremy] Snow coats.

89
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,135
Who has snow boots?

90
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:10,968
- [Kids] Me.

91
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:12,614
- I don't.

92
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:14,985
- [Jeremy] Alright, who has snow gloves.

93
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,068
- [Laura] Me.

94
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:20,332
- [Jeremy] Alright, who has a snow hat?

95
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,122
- So it looks like what we need

96
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,763
is new boots, a jacket
and gloves for Elise

97
00:03:29,763 --> 00:03:31,368
and new snow gloves for Isaac.

98
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:32,765
Do you have everything you need?

99
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:33,598
- No.

100
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,137
- Oh this is a lot of things for winter.

101
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:37,922
- [Kendra] It is a lot
of things for winter.

102
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:40,094
So it looks like you and
I need to go shopping.

103
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,641
- Yeah!

104
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:45,161
- Well now I know it's
warming up for winter.

105
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,040
- [Kendra] Were you warm
with all that stuff on?

106
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,078
- Yeah, too warm.

107
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,542
- [Kendra] Too hot inside?

108
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:53,292
(dramatic music)

109
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,941
- Mission clean up garage

110
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:01,418
while listening to some of
my favorite music of course.

111
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:04,281
So we found that with managing
seven people in our family,

112
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,064
we have to donate a lot of stuff

113
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:07,426
and cycle through a lot of stuff.

114
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:10,619
Otherwise you can hoard
and just keep tons of stuff

115
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,952
that you don't end up using.

116
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,253
So the garage isn't
perfect, but, it'll do.

117
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:41,292
I'll be back to clean it
again in three months.

118
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,792
(happy music)

119
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,359
So Caleb's my helper.

120
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,192
We're dropping off some donations.

121
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,098
- [Kendra] Caleb and Janae are building.

122
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,501
Caleb, what's Janae's job?

123
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:08,731
- She's the crane.

124
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:10,179
She knocks stuff over.

125
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:12,805
- [Kendra] She knocks it over at the end?

126
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,611
Janae are you a crane?

127
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:17,734
This is a nice build, Caleb.

128
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,598
- Put that one there and one there.

129
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:22,138
- [Kendra] Balance.

130
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,232
Is your design done?

131
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:24,065
- Yep.

132
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:25,677
- 'Kay, how do you get Janae to do it?

133
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:28,755
(playful music)

134
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:29,588
Hey Janae.

135
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,910
More interested in that block, huh?

136
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,141
(laughing)

137
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:37,974
This is hilarious.

138
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:39,102
This is like one of the first times

139
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:40,661
my kids have just built stuff

140
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,343
for their younger sibling to destroy

141
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,539
and now she has no
interest in destroying it.

142
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:46,042
Now if he'd built something
that he really loved

143
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,823
and didn't want her to
touch, you better betcha

144
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:49,521
she'd be all over it, right?

145
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:51,438
- [Caleb] Please don't knock it over.

146
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,425
I actually kinda like this thing.

147
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:54,799
This is pretty cool.

148
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,216
- [Kendra] This is hilarious.

149
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,108
Whoa!

150
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:01,025
She got it.

151
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,846
- [Isaac] Hey Nae Nae.

152
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:08,513
(Janae babbles)

153
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,905
- [Kendra] Isaac are you vlogging?

154
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,587
- Yeah.
- You vlogged.

155
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:13,595
- Yeah.
- You're a vlogger.

156
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:14,428
- Yeah.

157
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:16,667
(laughs)

158
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,528
- So we're trying something new today.

159
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,408
We are making fruit Christmas trees.

160
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:21,972
And I really love seasonal, festive foods.

161
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:25,199
But I don't like when we eat
too much candy and treats,

162
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,877
I just don't feel good with my body.

163
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,782
And so when I saw this online

164
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,162
I thought it was a great idea.

165
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:31,849
So we're gonna make fruit Christmas trees.

166
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,432
(bright music)

167
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,620
- Grapes.
- 'Cause then you'll.

168
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,453
- I won't.

169
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,678
- [Kendra] Very cool raspberries.

170
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,292
- So Kendra picked up a buncha fruit

171
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:46,308
and she bought this at the store.

172
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:50,141
And I don't think I've
ever eaten it or cut it

173
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:51,889
or know how.

174
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:52,722
Do you guys know what fruit this is?

175
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:53,692
- A star.

176
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:56,109
- [Jeremy] It's the star fruit.

177
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:57,250
Have you guys ever eaten that?

178
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,348
- Yeah.
- No!

179
00:06:58,348 --> 00:06:59,794
- You have?
- Remember last year.

180
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:04,000
- So I actually have no idea
if this is ripe or over ripe.

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,140
But this is why I bought it.

182
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,215
- It's a star.

183
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:08,541
- [Kendra] What do you see?

184
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,958
- [Laura] A star!

185
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:14,884
- So guys, what we're gonna make today

186
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,266
is a fruit Christmas tree.

187
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,678
(kids exclaiming excitedly)

188
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:21,582
So you're gonna decorate
using these fruits,

189
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,521
a fun Christmas tree.

190
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:24,572
So everybody's gonna get a cone

191
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,429
and then I got a buncha toothpicks.

192
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:27,365
And then you choose,

193
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,712
you can do whatever kind
of a pattern you like.

194
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:32,765
I think it's gonna be easier
to put the toothpick in first

195
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,291
and then hang the fruit on it.

196
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,041
- Okay, I'll do that.

197
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,963
- These smell good.

198
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:40,796
- Yummy.

199
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,273
Our kitchen actually
smells amazing right now

200
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:43,621
with all this fresh fruit.

201
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:45,155
- What's cool is I don't mind snacking

202
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:46,882
while we're doing it either.

203
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,410
- [Jeremy] You can do
a grateful raspberry.

204
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,642
- I got the star on top!

205
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:53,114
I'm grateful for music.

206
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:54,301
- [Jeremy] Good one.

207
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:57,237
- I'm grateful for pineapple.

208
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:59,279
Then we do this and then I'm gonna...

209
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,189
- [Kendra] I think Caleb's
eating more than he's decorating.

210
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,523
- No.

211
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,810
I only ate two so far.

212
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,694
- [Kendra] This is awesome.

213
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:09,861
- This cookie.

214
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,317
- [Kendra] I saw that.

215
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,984
- [Isaac] I like it.

216
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:18,265
(all laughing)

217
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,837
- I decorated this much in 830.

218
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:21,867
- [Kendra] How's it coming Caleb?

219
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:22,700
- Good.

220
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,876
- I'm making legs.

221
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:25,990
- [Kendra] To help it stand up?

222
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,823
- Um hmm.

223
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:28,562
- [Kendra] So Laura, what
kinda fruit's your favorite?

224
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:29,584
- Raspberry.

225
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:30,831
- [Kendra] Raspberries are your favorite?

226
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:32,796
- [Isaac] It looks like you like grapes.

227
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:34,258
- It does look like you like grapes.

228
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:35,616
Maybe she's eating all the raspberries

229
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,063
and putting all the grapes on.

230
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:38,646
Caleb and Laura have finished theirs up.

231
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:39,876
I'll show ya how they turned out.

232
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,972
Caleb's got two stars at the top.

233
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:43,327
- [Isaac] Mine's about to fall over.

234
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,538
- [Kendra] You guys are doing awesome.

235
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,711
- I'm not that quite done.

236
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:49,675
- [Kendra] Yeah, you are
packing a ton of fruit in there.

237
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:50,508
- I love fruit.

238
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:53,737
- [Kendra] Isaac's trying a star fruit.

239
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:54,570
- Crunchy.

240
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:58,598
It's really, really, it's different.

241
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,070
- [Kendra] It's different?

242
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,107
- I love it.

243
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:03,940
- [Kendra] You love it?

244
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,640
- Uh huh.
- So what's it similar to?

245
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,617
- Nothing.
- It's similar to nothing?

246
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:10,261
Is it closer to an apple
or a banana or an orange?

247
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:12,873
- It's mostly like pineapples and mangos

248
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:14,940
but it's not much like anything.

249
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,773
- [Kendra] Lise are you gonna be able

250
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:17,820
to eat your Christmas tree?
- Yeah.

251
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,206
Just a little bit of Dad's help.

252
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:22,189
- [Kendra] Oh I bet Dad will be helpful.

253
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:25,439
So here's our finished Christmas trees.

254
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:27,929
- You guys did great.

255
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:29,317
- [Elise] Guess which one's mine Dad.

256
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:30,706
- [Isaac] So you can have one of mine.

257
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:31,743
- [Jeremy] Oh there's
two stars on this one.

258
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:33,676
Do you eat the outside?

259
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:34,765
- [Kendra] Isaac did.

260
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:36,108
- It tastes kinda like candy.

261
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,589
- [Kendra] What fruit
would you compare it to?

262
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:38,936
- Sweet tarts.

263
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,359
That's what it tastes like to me.

264
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,419
(child babbles)

265
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,836
- Hey Laura, you can grab it.

266
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,819
It's a bag!

267
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:48,760
Yes!

268
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,073
So we're pretty excited about these bags.

269
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,478
They are not Christmas presents.

270
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:52,541
Jeremy and I have decided

271
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,627
to learn how to online shop for clothes,

272
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,497
because we never have the clothes we need

273
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:57,692
and we never have the time to go shopping.

274
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:59,546
So these bags are full of clothes

275
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:01,200
that Jeremy and I get to try on.

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,154
- [Jeremy] We'll see if it worked.

277
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:06,695
- [Kendra] So we bought
loads of things for Jeremy.

278
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:07,777
This is gonna be fun.

279
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,189
(bright music)

280
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:10,199
I'm trying a new dinner tonight.

281
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:11,956
It's called pork chili verde.

282
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,186
And I'm serving it over rice.

283
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:14,412
And yeah, we'll see how it turns out.

284
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:15,662
It smells good.

285
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,018
Okay here's the pork chili verde

286
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:26,435
and we're going to eat it on top of rice.

287
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:30,649
(upbeat music)

288
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,627
(record scratching)
(Kendra laughs)

289
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:42,023
- Kendra's saying that a
higher line on the pants

290
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:43,657
is coming in.

291
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,194
I just don't know if I like this style.

292
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:46,174
- Don't blame this on me.

293
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:47,718
This is definitely not his style.

294
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:48,800
So we're trying on the pants

295
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,877
and the length of them all feels long.

296
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:52,193
And I'm like Jeremy
maybe you're supposed to

297
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,885
wear them up higher.

298
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:55,474
And so now the length feels right

299
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:58,217
but look how high Jeremy
had to hike up that waist.

300
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:01,529
(Jeremy mutters)

301
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,515
This is just wrong.

302
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:04,765
Oh my goodness.

303
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,448
- So we're testing out the
different kinds of cuts.

304
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:09,813
So there's athletic and
slim and straight leg

305
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,268
and some really aren't working.

306
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:12,377
But I like these.

307
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:14,294
These are the slim cut.

308
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:18,346
- [Kendra] Snuggling?

309
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:20,557
- Goodnight.

310
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:21,390
J House out.

311
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,631
(upbeat music)

312
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:24,580
- [Jeremy] This is gonna end bad.

313
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,797
- Laura made me a necklace.

314
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:28,014
(Janae babbles)

315
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,953
- [Jeremy] Lise's cartwheel.

316
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:30,794
(Kendra cheers)

317
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:32,562
- I forgot my um, shoes.

318
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:33,725
- Shoes, 'kay?

319
00:11:33,725 --> 00:00:00,000
No shoes.
