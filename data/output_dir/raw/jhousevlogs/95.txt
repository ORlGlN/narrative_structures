1
00:00:00,891 --> 00:00:03,641
(drilling noise)

2
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:08,032
- Santa Clauses are going in.

3
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:11,608
- [Caleb] This is for J House vlogs.

4
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:13,108
- This is awesome.

5
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:17,024
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,061
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,203
- The lake is perfectly still
this morning, like glass.

8
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:34,573
But we're saying goodbye.

9
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:36,268
So we've been doing
all those final packing

10
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:38,241
and getting everything ready to go.

11
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,936
We're heading to Kendra's brother's house

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,910
and then off to the airport.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,493
(techno music)

14
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:54,542
- Something I love about
staying in rental places

15
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,585
is that you get to
experience what it would

16
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:58,118
be like to live somewhere else.

17
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,371
It's different than a hotel.

18
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,553
You get to be out in the
towns and in the area.

19
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:04,178
What would it be like to live up here?

20
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:05,711
And I think it would be amazing.

21
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:09,379
I'm gonna miss this drive, it is gorgeous.

22
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,656
Any last words?

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,771
- Goodbye Oregon.

24
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,907
(laughter)

25
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,347
- [Kendra] Where do you think we've been?

26
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,097
- Goodbye Washington.

27
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:21,152
- [Kendra] How's your breakfast Laura?

28
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,777
Well we packed up and
left the rental house.

29
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:24,658
So now we're joining my
family for breakfast.

30
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:26,701
The kids are still in their Christmas PJs.

31
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:29,000
Did you have a smoothie?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,903
I see that, we found a straw for her

33
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:32,712
but first she was digging
in without a straw.

34
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:35,452
You can see how that worked out.

35
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:38,169
- She told me, it's
okay, it's a healthy one.

36
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:39,794
I'm really glad it's not a dying smoothie.

37
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:40,955
- [Kendra] A dying smoothie?

38
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:41,788
- Like _.

39
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:43,904
- [Jeremy] What are you doing?

40
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,785
- Making cookies.

41
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:47,387
- [Jeremy] Christmas cookies.

42
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:50,220
(Christmas music)

43
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,144
Flour.

44
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,374
(Christmas music)

45
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:03,235
- I'm next.

46
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:07,101
- [Woman] Okay, let's flip it.

47
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:08,101
There we go.

48
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:11,884
- [Jeremy] Nice job Cubby.

49
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:15,437
- [Caleb] This is for J House vlogs.

50
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:17,687
- [Jeremy] Is that a house?

51
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,265
Good job Jenna.

52
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:23,332
- Okay, can you put it on there.

53
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:25,445
Push on it, push it.

54
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,418
- [Kendra] These are looking good.

55
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:29,668
Santa Clauses are going in.

56
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:33,247
- Caleb has had the chance
to work with Michael

57
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,476
on fixing a cabinet
that they're putting in.

58
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:38,007
Thus far it's been his
favorite part of the trip.

59
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,957
So they're finishing it up right now.

60
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:41,931
- Stick a screw driver
in there and lift up.

61
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,626
Can you do that around the edge?

62
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:44,973
Yeah, a little bit further

63
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:47,898
and it should come off here just a second.

64
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:48,967
- [Jeremy] Nailed it.

65
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,660
- [Michael] Yep, all
over the carpet, good.

66
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,611
So what you did is we're
just gonna rub it on

67
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,840
'cause we want it to look more like wood.

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,628
So this isn't the exactly right stain,

69
00:02:57,628 --> 00:02:59,416
but it's good enough for what we need.

70
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,573
So what we're gonna do is
these little blocks right here,

71
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,987
they're gonna fit right
here to hold this up.

72
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,008
See how it's all wobbly.

73
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:08,471
Can you tell me when it's level.

74
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,054
- [Caleb] It's off.

75
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:12,210
There.

76
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,162
- [Michael] That's level?

77
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:14,787
Can you make a circle right here

78
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:19,640
like the size for a target
for where I should drill?

79
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,390
(drilling noise)

80
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:30,995
Does that fit good or
do I need a bigger one?

81
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,266
- It fits good.

82
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,287
- Cool.

83
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:35,704
Does it wobble anymore buddy?

84
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,233
- [Jeremy] He fixed it.

85
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,208
How are the cookies?

86
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,041
- Good.

87
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,804
- [Jeremy] Say goodbye Cub.

88
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,528
- [Kendra] Hugs,

89
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:52,661
hugs,

90
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:54,797
hugs.

91
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,609
Hey I'm staying with you.

92
00:03:57,609 --> 00:03:59,003
- I'll see you next year Mom.

93
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:01,905
- [Kendra] No, I'm staying with you.

94
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:05,063
- I'll see you in the summertime.

95
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:06,758
- The kids are pretty sad about leaving.

96
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:10,925
We've had more than one
request to stay here forever.

97
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,412
- [Kendra] Goodbye Jenae.

98
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:17,320
Cousins.

99
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,472
- She's not letting go.

100
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:27,912
- [Kendra] She's not letting go.

101
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:29,676
- We're going on a plane ticket for two.

102
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:32,370
She sits on my lap or I sit
on your lap, which way is it?

103
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,037
- I sit on your lap.

104
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:36,967
- [Kendra] There we go, then she'd fit.

105
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:39,011
- Bye everybody.

106
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,799
- Bye.
- [Kendra] There they are.

107
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,549
Our sending off crew.

108
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:46,070
Alright, climb in, we've
gotta buckle big girl.

109
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,718
Buckle up kiddos.

110
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:48,551
Bye.

111
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,214
She's waving.

112
00:04:56,844 --> 00:04:58,562
It was sad to say goodbye to family,

113
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:01,371
but I have to document this happy moment.

114
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,601
Laura is almost asleep,
Jenae's quiet or asleep.

115
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,062
I don't know which one,
but I'm happy either way.

116
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:07,780
And the three big kids are actually

117
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,568
playing really nicely in the back.

118
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:11,867
They're not teasing each other
or whining or complaining.

119
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,330
Jeremy's behaving well.

120
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,862
- Yep.

121
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:17,445
(upbeat music)

122
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:21,851
- For the first time in
our life, we left early.

123
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:22,989
- Like super early.

124
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,661
- Because we didn't
want to run into traffic

125
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:26,379
and we wanted to make
sure we were on time.

126
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,819
And we ran into no traffic

127
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,396
so now we're just here super early.

128
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,674
- Take that world.

129
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:33,810
I think we should never do that again.

130
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,505
- Nevermind, we're
going to reform our ways

131
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:37,037
and go back to being late everywhere.

132
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,620
(upbeat music)

133
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,468
- We did it, phase one complete.

134
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:48,635
Now we're gonna jump on the
shuttle to go to the airport.

135
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:52,061
- Can Isaac sit by me?

136
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,500
- [Kendra] You want Isaac to sit by you?

137
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,545
- Yeah.

138
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:55,706
- [Kendra] Yeah sure.

139
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:58,873
We do the buddy system when we travel.

140
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:01,952
Jenae's my buddy

141
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:04,228
and Jeremy gets all the
luggage as his buddy.

142
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,203
- Hey Momma.

143
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:06,225
- [Kendra] Yeah.

144
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:07,548
- Can me and Elise be buddies?

145
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:08,616
- Yep.

146
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,056
We made it on the shuttle
which is one small

147
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:11,519
step for most people,
but a giant step for us.

148
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,025
- A giant leap for seven in a family.

149
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,465
It's cold huh?

150
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:17,465
- It's cold.

151
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:19,597
It's cold.

152
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,270
- We decided to go to the bathroom

153
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,313
this time before going
through the security line.

154
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:25,730
Isn't that right?

155
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:28,493
It was a good idea.

156
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:31,076
(techno music)

157
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,293
We decided we wanna eat something

158
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:39,174
before we hop on the plane.

159
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:41,757
(techno music)

160
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,793
That's our plane coming in.

161
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:45,908
- The big one?

162
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,533
- [Jeremy] The big one.

163
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,648
- That one.

164
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:50,815
- [Jeremy] That's the one.

165
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,408
They're trying to check us all in.

166
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:57,169
It just takes more time
when you have seven people.

167
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,446
- This is cool.

168
00:06:58,446 --> 00:06:59,561
- [Jeremy] It is cool.

169
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,186
- Can I tell you guys
the best part of my day?

170
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,208
- [Jeremy] What?

171
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,741
- I just checked the
weather in Kansas City

172
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:06,806
and the forecast is
sunny and gorgeous out.

173
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,431
It's gonna be in the 60s.

174
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:11,014
(upbeat music)

175
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,861
- [Jeremy] Look in there you guys.

176
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:16,694
Whoa.

177
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,247
- [Kendra] Caleb, what
do you see in there?

178
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:23,872
All sorts of buttons.

179
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,455
(upbeat music)

180
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:30,792
Almost ready to go.

181
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,162
You ready to be home?

182
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:34,298

00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,772
It's better than school.

190
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:46,999
- I must be the only one, but
I'm ready to just be at home.

This is awesome.

200
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,563
(upbeat music)

201
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:27,409

- That's a lot, that'd break a house.

210
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,253

211
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,662

212
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:04,815
