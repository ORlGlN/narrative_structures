1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,841
- [Jeremy] Okay, Isaac.

2
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:01,813
Where are we heading?

3
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:05,420
- To the World Series, the last game.

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,920
(playful orchestra music)

5
00:00:32,922 --> 00:00:35,714
- We're coming up to get our parking spot.

6
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:36,547
See this, Isaac?

7
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:38,985
So people do what's called tailgating.

8
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,339
All right, so we're waiting
in line to actually go inside.

9
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:44,339
(upbeat rock music)

10
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,812
What do you think?

11
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:56,232
- And I see Jeremy Guthrie there.

12
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:57,695
- [Jeremy] Do you see Jeremy Guthrie?

13
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:58,633
- Yeah.

14
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:01,300
The number eight for the Giants.

15
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:03,939
- [Jeremy] Do you see him?

16
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,541
- He's my favorite Giants player.

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,228
- So I have butterflies, I'm all excited,

18
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,938
like Christmas morning or something,

19
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:15,855
when I was a kid Christmas morning.

20
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:19,285
Isaac, what are you feeling inside?

21
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:20,118
How are you feeling?

22
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:21,719
- Excited.

23
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,318
- So Kauffman Stadium has a
lot of cool stuff for kids,

24
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,995
and there's not a lot of kids
here at the World Series.

25
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:28,444
So the lines aren't long.

26
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:31,632
You ready to go out there, bud?

27
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,110
Whoa!

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,040
(upbeat rock music)

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,123
He's running.

30
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:42,928
(laughs) Look at you.

31
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,919
- We are so high, look!

32
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,529
- (laughs) Right.

33
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,464
We really get the best view of the game

34
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:16,760
from up really, really high, so we wanted

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,010
the seats in the very back.

36
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:24,248
You dancing?

37
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:28,609
This was a really good $30 hot dog.

38
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:36,930
("The Star-Spangled
Banner" by Joyce DiDonato)

39
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,315
(crowd cheers)

40
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:01,857
We're about to have the first pitch.

41
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:02,984
What do you think?

42
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:04,589
- I'm really excited.

43
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:05,810
- You're really excited?

44
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,560
(crowd cheering)

45
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:17,123
We scored, buddy, we scored, woo!

46
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,571
(crowd booing)

47
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:23,293
- [Crowd] ♫ Let's go Royals

48
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:26,669
♫ Let's go Royals

49
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:28,449
♫ Let's go Royals

50
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,563
- So Isaac needed to go to the bathroom.

51
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:31,827
It's always such a fun atmosphere.

52
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:34,380
Everyone's giving fives with everyone.

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,190
We decided to just take
a fourth inning break,

54
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,857
come out, hit some balls around.

55
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:43,178
Good shot, buddy.

56
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:44,269
For me as a little kid, I would go

57
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:45,815
and watch my dad play softball.

58
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:47,236
And I would go back
and forth from watching

59
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:50,958
the whole game to going and
playing with other friends.

60
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,791
And so I'm glad that
Isaac wants to come play.

61
00:03:57,726 --> 00:04:01,282
(crowd cheering)

62
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,867
- [Crowd] ♫ It's a shame

63
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,382
♫ 'Cause it's one, two,
three strikes, you're out

64
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,825
- All right, we're going
into the ninth inning.

65
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,654
We're down by one.

66
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:11,828
It's intense.

67
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:13,737
- Daddy, is this the last inning?

68
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:15,297
- [Jeremy] This is the last inning.

69
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,245
- [Crowd] ♫ Let's go Royals

70
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,205
♫ Let's go Royals

71
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,623
- It's two outs, last inning.

72
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,326
Alex Gordon is up to bat.

73
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:29,993
- [Crowd] ♫ Let's go Royals

74
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:34,532
(crowd cheers)

75
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,632
- Yeah!

76
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:51,883
So there's two outs, we
have a guy on third base.

77
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,466
Pérez is up to bat.

78
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,972
(crowd cheers)

79
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:12,489
No!

80
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:16,613
So we lost.

81
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,696
We lost the World Series.

82
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:24,800
(crowd claps)

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,300
Good job, Royals!

84
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,883
Let's clap for 'em.

85
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:33,408
(crowd cheering)

86
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,112
How are you feeling, Isaac?

87
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,112
- Kinda sad.

88
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,479
- [Jeremy] Why are you feeling sad, buddy?

89
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,541
- Yeah, we lost.

90
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,905
- [Jeremy] It could be
a bummer to lose, huh?

91
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:49,738
Yeah.

92
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:53,472
But it was still a really good game, huh?

93
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:54,958
They played hard.

94
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,791
Did you have fun?

95
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,624
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:05:56,624 --> 00:06:00,854
- I thought it was so cool
how the Kansas City Royals

97
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:04,371
fans responded after the game was over.

98
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:06,076
They were cheering for the team.

99
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:08,643
They were chanting, and people still

100
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,646
had smiles on their faces.

101
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,186
And it's neat with sports in general

102
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,287
just how it does bring
a community together.

103
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:17,212
I mean everybody was excited about it.

104
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,620
All right, little man.

105
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,487
- [Kendra] I'm glad to
have you home again.

106
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:21,519
- [Jeremy] It's almost morning.

107
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,906
We need to get you to bed.

108
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,063
- What?

109
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:24,896
What time is it?

110
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:25,976
- Check out this face paint.

111
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,576
This is awesome.

112
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:28,993
Did you have fun?

113
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:31,462
Are you gonna remember it forever

114
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:33,661
and tell your grandkids about it?

115
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:36,179
- Well, yeah, probably.

116
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,262
- I remember back in 2014

117
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:42,917
when my dad took me to the World Series.

118
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,819
- I definitely could have sold
the tickets that I bought,

119
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,304
because I bought 'em straight
from Kansas City Royals,

120
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:52,799
which means they were a lot cheaper

121
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,568
than most people are buying them.

122
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:56,552
But today, I could have sold the tickets

123
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,693
for more than three and
four times the amount

124
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,893
that I bought each ticket for.

125
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:03,787
But I'm still glad that I
went, because it was fun.

126
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:05,959
And I really do hope that you do remember

127
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,709
that we went to the World Series

128
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,792
and had a good time together,
and that it was just

129
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,827
you and me and it was a special time.

130
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,750
Because I am always gonna remember.

131
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,905
I love you, bud.

132
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,819
(Isaac mumbles)

133
00:07:18,819 --> 00:00:00,000
(peaceful music)
