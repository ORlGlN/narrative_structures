- [Kendra] You ready
for your next present?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,811
Why do you look like you're 18?

00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:08,644
- Baking?

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,213
Yay!

Sprite?

00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,030
- [Jeremy] That's right.

8
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,470
- [Kendra] We found one more present.

9
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,366
We forgot about it.

10
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,949

- Happy birthday!

14

How old are you?

15
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:35,336
- Four.

16
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,380
- Stand up tall, come over here.

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,710
- [Jeremy] With her hands up.

18
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:41,840
- Oh yeah, you definitely grew last night.

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,673
- [Jeremy] Grew a couple feet.

20
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:46,128

So Laura, what did you choose
for your birthday breakfast?

24
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,530
- Monkey bread and strawberries.

25
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,413
- [Jeremy] Yep and she
wanted some apple juice.

26
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,528
Your picture turned out great.

27
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,060
Alright, we're gonna go around the room

28
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,740
saying things we love about Laura.

29
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,650
We would love in the comments to hear

30
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,030
what you love about Laura.

31
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,330
- I love how thoughtful
and aware Laura is.

32
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,340
When someone in our
family is sad or upset,

33
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,550
she often goes to them
and gives them a hug.

34
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,640
And just is so kind.

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,010
- I love that whenever someone is like

36
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,900
doing something kind of scary,

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,900
she always is like, I don't
think you should do that.

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,590
- I love that Laura's really
cute and is always nice too.

39
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,130
- It's always been funny
to me that even though

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,610
Laura is on the younger
side of the family,

41
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,260
she has a take charge personality.

42
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,870
She's like, hey guys, let's do this.

43
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,790
I'm like, do you realize
you're smaller than

44
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,010
most everybody here.

45
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,650
She's an organizer.

46
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,640
- I love how Laura has such big hugs

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,090
every time she sees me.

48
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,690
- I love that she's so thoughtful

49
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,420
of like if someone was feeling sad,

50
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,060
she would go up to them and sit by them.

51
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,930
- Laura comes up with the
funniest stories and songs.

52
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,260
It brings so much joy to our life.

53
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,120
Her little Grandma stories.

54
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,310
Which could be like a TV series I think of

55
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,800
just your stories of
being a little Grandma.

56
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,850
We love our Laura.

57
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:17,160
What do you love about Laura?

58
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,155
- [Kendra] Laura I have some good news.

59
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:28,988
- What?

60
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,243
- [Kendra] You now are old enough to get

61
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:32,590
two vitamins everyday.

62
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,550
(cheers)

63
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,280
She has been waiting and
waiting for this moment

64
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,990
because the instructions
say that you only get

65
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,580
one vitamin if you're
two or three years old,

66
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,108
but if you're four years old, you get two.

67
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:44,548
- Vitamin dance.

68
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:47,706
- [Kendra] Vitamin dance,
do the vitamin dance.

69
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,210
- [Jeremy] What do we do after breakfast?

70
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,957
- Open my presents.

71
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:53,750

72
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,590
- [Kendra] Are you ready?

73
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,273

to give Laura a present?

74
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:58,273

Yes, my own band aids.

78
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,339
- When you give someone a
gift, but you actually want it.

79
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:16,589
(laughter)

80
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:20,661

- We're gonna be matching.

83
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,895
- [Jeremy] If you wanna stand up,

84
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:32,428
you can look in the mirror
once she gets it on.

85
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:35,011
- [Kendra] Oh, it's so sparkly.

86
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:40,613
- Pull on this.

87
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,230
You're own gum and this is lip gloss.

88

00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:58,770
- Did you wrap this one?

93
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,603
- Yeah.

94
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,630
You throw the ball back and forth.

95
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,350
It catches on this.

96
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,514
- Thank you!

97
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,420
- [Kendra] You ready
for your next present?

98
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,500
Why do you look like you're 18?

99
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,260
- [Jeremy] It's the lip
gloss and the earrings.

100
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,379
- [Kendra] There you go,
this one's from Granny Jo.

101
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,962
(upbeat music)

102
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:26,640
- I've always wanted one of these.

103
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,210
It's a mermaid dress.

104
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,120
- [Kendra] It's a mermaid tail blanket.

105
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,870
Watch, you put your legs in there.

106
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,360
Now you're a little mermaid.

107
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,930
You can snuggle up on the couch.

108
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,060
Watch, see how cozy it is.

109
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,180
- And sleep?

110
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,130
- [Kendra] Sure, you can sleep in that.

111
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,183
- [Jeremy] Our little mermaid.

112
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,729
- [Kendra] You could probably

113
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,354
disappear inside of that thing.

114
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,980
(laughter)

115
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,813

129
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,480
This one's a scissors and
this one's a tape activity.

130
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,243

- That one's a game.

132
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,380
It's an I Spy game.

- For just one person?

134
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,140
- It's actually for all
of us to play together.

135
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,963
So these are all activities for you to do.

136

you made a waffle.

184
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:29,920
Whoa, now wrap up this whipped cream.

185
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,410
- Fancy.

186
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,760
- [Jeremy] You got your
whipped cream on there.

187
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,220
- [Kendra] That looks so yummy.

188
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,903
- Thank you.

189
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,340
- [Kendra] Oh, is that a bagel sandwich?

190
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:44,490
This is adorable.

191
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,930
A fun part of birthdays is
playing with all the new toys.

192
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,763
- Good job.

193
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:55,129
(indiscernible singing)

194
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,180
- [Jeremy] Did you build a tent?

195
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,776
- Yeah.

196
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,609
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

197
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
- [Kendra] There's a lot of giggling

198
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,130
coming from inside this tent.

199
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,110
- We're playing ball.

200
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,590
- She's our teenager.

201
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
- So for lunch today we're having a bunch

202
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,670
of Laura favorites which
means it's a weird lunch.

203
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,780
We're having macaroni and
cheese, chips, apples,

204
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,827
a vegetable and a secret treat.

205
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:33,980
That looks like macaroni and cheese.

206
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,909
- Kind of a weird combination.

207
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,869
- [Kendra] Mac and cheese, peas,

208
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,410
potato chips, strawberries and apples.

209
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:45,780
- Sprite?

210
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,431
- [Jeremy] That's right.

211
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:49,060
- Yum!

212
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,720
- So we almost never
do soda with the kids,

213
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,840
so she's very excited.

214
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,883
She was hoping to have some soda today.

215
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,466
(techno music)

216
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,400
- [Kendra] This is quite the project.

217
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,620
- I was wrong.

218
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,220
- I'm just sitting here smiling.

219
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:15,943
- A ice cream cone.

220
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,660
(laughter)

221
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,250
- One more visitor coming
to stay with us tonight.

222
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,581
- He's waiting for us at the house.

223
00:09:25,581 --> 00:00:00,000
(techno music)
