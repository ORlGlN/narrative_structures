1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:03,055
- This if my favorite present
to give to little babies.

2
00:00:03,055 --> 00:00:04,589
- Thank you!

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,427
- Big present.

4
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:07,592
- Yeah!

5
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:08,711
- [Kendra] Guess what Isaac?

6
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:09,544
- What?

7
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:12,294
("Jingle Bells")

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,441
- So the craziest thing
has happened this morning.

9
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,474
None of our big kids have woken up yet.

10
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:24,024
It's past seven o'clock

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,762
and Janae is the one that
woke up Jeremy and I.

12
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:28,429
We are just stunned.

13
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:30,702
They're sleeping.

14
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:32,656
How is that happening
that on Christmas morning,

15
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:34,061
our kids are sleeping in.

16
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:35,535
They're usually really early risers.

17
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,368
(Janae babbles)

18
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:37,915
Can you say hi?

19
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:39,373
Hi.

20
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,243
- Gave us presents.

21
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:42,881
- [Kendra] Let's go see 'em.

22
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:43,714
- 'Kay.

23
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:49,020
- [Kendra] Janae has never
seen a present before.

24
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,954
She's like, what's this.

25
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:52,355
Can I eat it.

26
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:54,264
- Boys, time to wake up.

27
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:56,467
It's Christmas Eve.

28
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:58,053
- [Elise] No, it's Christmas.

29
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,776
- No, it's Christmas morning.

30
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,710
- Yeah. (giggles)

31
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,405
- Wake up boys, it's Christmas morning!

32
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:07,684
We heard Santa.

33
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,048
He needed to go poo.

34
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:14,555
(laughing)
(playful music)

35
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:16,643
Or did you need to go poo?

36
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,450
- [Jeremy] That wasn't Santa.

37
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,826
That was me!

38
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:20,659
- Oh!

39
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:23,902
- [Laura] I thought it was Santa.

40
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:25,909
- So this morning at like
seven a.m. I came out

41
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,980
and went to the bathroom.

42
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,461
In the kids bathroom out heer.

43
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:33,022
Apparently they thought it was Santa.

44
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:34,137
Going poo.

45
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,696
(Kendra laughs)
It was me.

46
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,784
Why did you take me away

47
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,317
from all those presents?

48
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:43,514
- Boys, I can't believe you
guys are the sleepy heads.

49
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:45,207
- This is the moment
I've been waiting for,

50
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:47,624
'cause then we get to open our stockings.

51
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:51,658
♪ Come all ye faithful ♪

52
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,991
♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪

53
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:59,912
♪ Oh come ye oh come ye to Beth ♪

54
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:09,218
So our family tradition

55
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,902
is that when we wake up
on Christmas morning,

56
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:13,612
we watch a video about
our Savior, Jesus Christ.

57
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:15,970
Then we sing songs, we pray together

58
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,543
and then we go into the stockings.

59
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:19,501
Here's the set up.

60
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,168
(playful music)

61
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:26,463
- Is this one mine?

62
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:27,606
- [Jeremy] That's it.

63
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,618
- It's a Beanie Boo!

64
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:31,736
- Look guys it's...

65
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:32,665
- A fan!

66
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:34,534
- My own crown?

67
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:37,701
- A pot of cotton candy, cotton candy!

68
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,696
- And my favorite kind.

69
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,235
Where's your toothbrush?

70
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,668
- [Kendra] Caleb did you get cotton candy?

71
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:44,902
- New toothbrush!

72
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:46,088
A fan!

73
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:47,571
- It's a mask.
- A superhero.

74
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:49,079
- Look what I got guys.

75
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,435
How do you turn this on?

76
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:51,633
- It needs batteries.

77
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,876
- A watch!

78
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:53,740
- [Isaac] Head lamp.

79
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,730
One of these!

80
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,563
- Yes!

81
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:56,512
I love it.

82
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,198
Isaac look.

83
00:02:58,198 --> 00:02:59,763
- What?
- Finally.

84
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,724
- [Isaac] That's the
old one I used to have.

85
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,371
- Oh my goodness.

86
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,258
- [Isaac] What's in here?

87
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:05,091
- Look at that!

88
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:07,020
- My own vitamins!

89
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,599
- A Fitbit!

90
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,000
- [Elise] Thank you so much.

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,497
- What? What?

92
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:13,089
- [Laura] Mom, Mom!

93
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:15,174
Mom, is this gum?

94
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:17,340
- This is Band-Aids.

95
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,423
- My own Band-Aids.

96
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:20,726
- (laughs) Gum.

97
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:22,587
- What's this?

98
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:24,365
- It's Lego tape.

99
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,993
- What's Lego tape?

100
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:26,826
- You'll get to see.

101
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,784
We'll get to play with it.

102
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:29,667
'Kay Caleb.

103
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,043
- [Laura] Mom, can I try on my swimsuit?

104
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:34,856
- [Jeremy] This is Janae's first stocking.

105
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:37,233
- [Kendra] (gasps) Look.

106
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,107
You found it.

107
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:40,847
It's a bath toy.

108
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:45,290
She's like there's stuff
in here that crinkles.

109
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,610
(gasps) It's a toy.

110
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,860
Janae's enjoying her stuff.

111
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,207
So Lise's setting up.

112
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,141
- [Elise] Yeah.

113
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,462
- [Kendra] All of her stuff.

114
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:57,129
(playful music)

115
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:02,104
- [Jeremy] How's the monkey bread?

116
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:02,937
- Good.

117
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,560
- This is my favorite breakfast.

118
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,876
- [Jeremy] Alright, we're doing
monkey bread for breakfast.

119
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:07,709
- Again.

120
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,942
I used to call it bread monkey.

121
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,330
- So Janae's ready for her nap.

122
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,579
But I just changed her
into her Christmas outfit.

123
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,134
And look how cute she is.

124
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,743
- [Jeremy] Best gift ever.

125
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:18,558
(Janae fusses)

126
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,391
She's tired.

127
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,410
- She's tired.

128
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,366
So this present is from
Granny Jo and Papa Keith.

129
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,199
- Can I open it?

130
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,449
- [Kendra] You can open it.

131
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:29,115
It's a Minnie Mouse outfit.
- So cute.

132
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,171
- [Kendra] That is adorable.

133
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,937
Look, there's how it looks.

134
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:35,717
- It fits perfectly.
- Yay!

135
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:36,897
- [Kendra] What do you say?

136
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:39,980
- Thank you Granny Jo and Papa Keith.

137
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:43,514
- What is this?

138
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:45,698
- [Jeremy] Smell it.

139
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:48,106
- Oh, now smell me.
- What do you think?

140
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:49,291
- Smell me.

141
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,548
- [Jeremy] How does he smell?

142
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:51,381
- Good.

143
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,214
- [Jeremy] It does smell good.

144
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:53,202
- It does smell good.

145
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:55,129
It smells so grown up.
- Can I smell it?

146
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,265
- Thank you Granny Jo and Papa Keith.

147
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:59,116
That is awesome.

148
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:01,350
I always wanna smell good.

149
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,043
- Pretty much every Sunday,
Caleb comes in and asks

150
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:05,735
to use some cologne.

151
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:06,869
'Cause he does like to smell good.

152
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,452
So that's a great gift for him.

153
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,415
- Okay, I'm not gonna do.

154
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,531
Smell.

155
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:17,364
- Um.

156
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:18,645
- [Caleb] Now can I smell?

157
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:19,490
(laughing)

158
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,323
- Ah!

159
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:21,156
- It smells good.

160
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,989
- Thank you Granny Jo.

161
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:26,647
(all laughing)

162
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:28,120
- [Caleb] It's just falling on you.

163
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,287
- Alright you guys can all
open this one at the same time.

164
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:31,932
These are Grandma and Papa.

165
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,602
- Ready, set, go!

166
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:35,755

168
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,959

169
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,534
- Thank you Grandma and Papa.

170
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:44,963

crazy, fun, loud home.

171
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:47,898
That is perfect for us.

172
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,068
- Thank you Mom and Dad.

173
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:52,050
(playful music)

174
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,986
(Laura gasps)

175
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:54,903
What is it?

176
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,539
- I've always wanted this.

177
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,541
- [Kendra] You have?

178
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,458
What is it?

179
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:01,945
- A toy.

180
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:02,830
- [Kendra] It is a toy.

181
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,203
What's the toy do?

182
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:06,032
- [Laura] I don't know.

183
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,429
- You can make cookies.
- Yeah!

184
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:10,105
- [Kendra] It's to play with your kitchen.

185
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:12,632
You get to make pretend cookies for us.

186
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:13,632
- Thank you!

187
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:19,584
- What?

188
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,257
Premium geesos.

189
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:24,668
- Geodes.

190
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:25,922
So you're gonna take rocks

191
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:27,081
and then you're gonna use this.

192
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:27,970
What's that?

193
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,803
- Hammer.

194
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:30,448
- And you're gonna break the rocks open

195
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:31,533
and see what's inside.

196
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,621
(Caleb growls)

197
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,204
You're tackling me.

198
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,726
You're welcome buddy.

199
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:38,443
- Thank you Daddy.

200
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:39,928
- You're welcome bud.

201
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:40,928
Let's do it.

202
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,680
- What is this?

203
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,759
- [Kendra] It is, good question.

204
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,707
What is it?

205
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:47,984
So Lise it's an art kit

206
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:51,567
where you make these
kinds of art projects.

207
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:53,356
- What?

208
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:55,244
It's the New Year in Sports.

209
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:56,627
They're at the library.

210
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:59,470
There's only like the 2015 and 2016.

211
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,407
This is the new one!

212
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:02,830
- [Caleb] You got this.

213
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,214
- And I got the Sports Illustrated.

214
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,391
Yeah!

215
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:08,535
- [Kendra] Guess what Isaac?

216
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:09,377
- What?

217
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:12,166
- [Kendra] You not only got
that Sports Illustrated for Kids

218
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,646
but every single month this whole year

219
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:16,987
you're going to get a
Sports Illustrated for Kids.

220
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:17,820
- Yay!

221
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,975
- [Kendra] You got a subscription to it.

222
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:19,808
- Yeah!

223
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:21,208
This is like when I play football games

224
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,438
and we're pretending
we're different teams.

225
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,712
We can like put them face to face.

226
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,625
- Yeah.
- Thank you!

227
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,615
- [Kendra] You're welcome.

228
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,944
- Kareem Hunt, I can get his card.

229
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:32,731
Since you got that.

230
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,814
I get Kareem Hunt's card.

231
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:37,732
- [Jeremy] That's a rookie card.

232
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:39,573
- Isaac.
- Yeah!

233
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:40,406
- Isaac.

234
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,298
- Jeremy.
- Bath bombs.

235
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:42,427
- Thank you Jeremy.

236
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:43,675
Ooo, smell it.

237
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,272
- [Jeremy] It's a potpourri
of different flavors.

238
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:46,105
- It's a big one.

239
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:47,844
- Me and Isaac helped get.

240
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:48,677
- Did you guys help pick it up

241
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,702
and you kept it a secret?

242
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:50,901
'Cause I didn't even know.

243
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:51,837
- [Isaac] Lavender.

244
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,364
- I love lavender.

245
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:54,246
That was a good choice.

246
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:55,079
Thank you.

247
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,174
- Yes!

248
00:07:58,374 --> 00:07:59,587
Slippers.

249
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:01,602
- [Kendra] Elise just asked if
we got him new church shoes.

250
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:02,976
Maybe you can pull that off.

251
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:05,393
- [Jeremy] Oh yeah, for sure.

252
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,143
- Racko!
- Racko!

253
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:08,415
- Yeah!

254
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:09,689
- [Jeremy] This is Mugga's favorite game.

255
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,955
- Yes, and it's mine.

256
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:13,472
I played with Jake, Caleb, and Grandma.

257
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:15,364
- And one of the rounds I won.

258
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:16,467
- [Kendra] Yes.

259
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:17,467
It's your turn.

260
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:20,050
(upbeat music)

261
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:22,328
- My own letters!

262
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:24,533
Thank you!

263
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:25,783
Thank you JoJo.

264
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:29,905
- You can make all of
these kinds of designs.

265
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,113
- [Kids] Thank you.

266
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,243
- Thank you everybody.

267
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:34,683
- Oh!

268
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:36,029
- [Kendra] It's a building toy.

269
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,604
- Thank you Grandmom and Granddad.

270
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:40,231
- It's a basketball.

271
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:41,313
- It's basketball.

272
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,304
- [Kendra] So you go boing boing.

273
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,168
- Pull it down?

274
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,001
Wow.

275
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:47,441
- [Kendra] Jeremy's grabbing
the presents from the back.

276
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,051
- Whoa, that is heavy.

277
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,051
- This is a big present.

278
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,674
- What?
- Roller skates!

279
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:57,043
- Roller blades.

280
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,571
- See, look at those.

281
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,491
You guy's switch from roller
skates to roller blades.

282
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:05,137
We take off the bottom
and then it turns to this.

283
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:08,225
- Isaac, we can make horses.

284
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,847
- [Jeremy] Yeah, there's little cones.

285
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,864
- (gasps) Real make up?

286
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:15,182
Can I put some on?

287
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:16,222
- [Kendra] Are you gonna try it right now?

288
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,576
- She's going for it.
- Yeah.

289
00:09:17,576 --> 00:09:18,576
- Lip gloss.

290
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:21,092
(Kendra and Laura pop lips)

291
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,295
Nice!

292
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,976
It's got all sorts of real makeup.

293
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:26,213
You've got eye shadow.

294
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,602
More blush.

295
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:29,286
And more eye shadow.

296
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:30,289
And what's this?

297
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:31,433
- Make up.

298
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,805
- [Kendra] Lipstick.

299
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,387
It's your own makeup bag.

300
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:35,438
Awesome.
- Bird feeder.

301
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:37,163
- Bird feed!

302
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:38,176
So I got bird feed.

303
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,289
And what's funny is I
accidentally opened my present

304
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,874
before Jeremy's present.

305
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,977
And I was like, they gave
us bird feed. (laughs)

306
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:48,251
(playful music)

307
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:49,575
- What is that?
- Osmo!

308
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:52,358
- Osmo, more, what?
- Osmo!

309
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,840
- [Isaac] Is there a new Osmo?

310
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,163
- [Kendra] So this is
a coding game with Osmo

311
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,762
that you guys can learn
how to code with Osmo.

312
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,050
- [Jeremy] It's like making a video game

313
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,576
or playing a video game with coding.

314
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,619
- Then who is he?
- Awbie.

315
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:04,115
- Awbie.
- And we're gonna learn

316
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:05,172
how to use him.

317
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,174
I love it when presents
are also educational.

318
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,223
That's my favorite thing.

319
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:10,448
- [Boys] Thank you!

320
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:11,826
- Thank you!

321
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:12,929
- You're welcome Stink.

322
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,434
So Janae just woke up from her nap.

323
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:17,264
And she's so excited about
exploring all the new stuff.

324
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:20,554
She hasn't paid attention to presents yet.

325
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,202
But we wanna watch her open 'em.

326
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:23,749
Nae Nae, what is that?

327
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,859
(happy music)

328
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,150
(gasps) You got some paper off.

329
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,067
What is it?

330
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:31,784
Look at that.

331
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:35,619
Nae Nae look.

332
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:38,190
- Hello, my name is Laura.

333
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,831
What's your name?

334
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:41,898
(Janae babbles)

335
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,231
- [Kendra] Aw, she loves it.

336
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:45,914
Yay!
- Yay!

337
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,066
- [Kendra] Peek a boo.

338
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,149
'Kay Nae Nae.

339
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,632
Yeah, what's in there?

340
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,949
(gasps) It's a book.

341
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:03,199
Little puppy wants to play.

342
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:07,214
(laughing)

343
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:10,692
This is my favorite present
to give to little babies.

344
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,192
Now pull this way.

345
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,793
- [Jeremy] Wow.

346
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:17,824
(Jeremy laughing)

347
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:18,774
Yeah.

348
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:21,024
(laughing)

349
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:23,851
Best gift ever.

350
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,650
(kids laughing)

351
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:32,861
(Janae babbles)
Yay!

352
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:36,804
(playful music)

353
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:39,639
Just chilling.

354
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,139
Look, a foot rest and Kleenex.

355
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,562
- [Kendra] Oop.

356
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:45,958
- [Isaac] I need to blow my nose.

357
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,496
I really do.

358
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:48,329
- Ready?

359
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,398
A toy!

360
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:53,270
Do any of you guys recognize this toy?

361
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,437
- [Kids] Yeah.

362
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,485
- There it is.

363
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:58,318
- Oh yeah!

364
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,353
- Do you remember this one?

365
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,811
So this was one of our favorite
toys that we had with Isaac

366
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:04,946
when he was little.

367
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,803
And it broke over the years.

368
