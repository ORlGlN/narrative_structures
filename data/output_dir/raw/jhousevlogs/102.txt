1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:02,419
- You are editing a blog.

2
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:05,039
Do you like it?

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,007
- So my awesome Aunt Kay sent us this kit.

4
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,019
Roll it up.

5
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,317
So Jeremy and I are trying to make

6
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:11,957
an important decision today.

7
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:13,932
I'm just, I still don't
know what we should do.

8
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:15,070
- All my kids are hiding.

9
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,569
- How did you know?

10
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:19,319
(exciting music)

11
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,246
- Laura, do you have footie pajamas?

12
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:23,226
- Yeah!

13
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:24,787
- Are they warm and snuggly?

14
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:25,628
- Yeah.

15
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:27,644
- You look so cute.

16
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:30,839
- We're going to put the
Christmas tree right there.

17
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,929
- We are gonna put a Christmas tree there.

18
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:33,837
- Yeah.

19
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:35,033
- Pretty soon.

20
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,709
What things are you looking at outside?

21
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,292
- Leaves and trees.

22
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,867
This is Jenae in her footie pajamas.

23
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:44,959
- She has footie pajamas, too.

24
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,209
- I love Jenae.

25
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:48,923
- Me, too.

26
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,806
- She's so cute.

27
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:51,865
- Laura, what are you doing?

28
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:53,257
- Making his bed.

29
00:00:53,257 --> 00:00:55,335
- Making Cubbie's bed for him.

30
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:56,573
Why are you doing that?

31
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,740
- Because, I'm his sister.

32
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:01,997
- That is really nice of you.

33
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:04,164
Thanks for making his bed.

34
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,434
That's good right there, you
can just pull the blanket up.

35
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,107
Alright, thank you.

36
00:01:10,107 --> 00:01:11,269
- You're welcome.

37
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:13,049
- That's a good way to
show people you love em

38
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,572
is to do nice things for em.

39
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:18,765
- Caleb is a little bit mean to me today.

40
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:20,896
- Then why did you do
something nice for him?

41
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,729
- Because.

42
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,298
- Because why.

43
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:25,711
- I like to play with
him and sing with him.

44
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,344
- Even though he's mean sometimes?

45
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:30,697
I think that's what it means
to be a brother and a sister.

46
00:01:30,697 --> 00:01:31,884
Sometimes we're mean to each other

47
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,829
but you still like em.

48
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:35,194
You like to play with them.

49
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:36,938
I love you big girl.

50
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:38,438
- I love you, too.

51
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,493
- I don't want to delete that part.

52
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:43,326
- You wanna delete it?

53
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:44,170
- Yeah.

54
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,351
- Your in and out point.

55
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,041
Isacc, what are you doing this morning?

56
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,875
- I'm editing.

57
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,087
- We've been wanting a long time

58
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,941
to like teach our kids how to edit.

59
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:54,928
So today I taught Isaac and the kids

60
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:57,306
a couple basic skills and
they're trying it out.

61
00:01:57,306 --> 00:02:00,048
- He cut something out.

62
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:01,298
- Speed it up.

63
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:02,381
- Or slow mo.

64
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,125
- So the kids are looking at music now

65
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,779
to put with their clips
that they're editing.

66
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,849
So, Isaac, what kind of music
do you want right there?

67
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:12,901
- Happy.

68
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,302
- Happy music, so you
can pick emotions, too.

69
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,777
Here we go, happy.

70
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:19,816
- Oh, actually, I think bright.

71
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:21,029
- I like this one.

72
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:23,517
(snappy music)

73
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:25,977
- Alright, so now you're
going to download it.

74
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:30,359
So you drag the song down
on to audio level two.

75
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,075
Now you have the song there.

76
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,718
Alright listen to it with the
edits and see what you think.

77
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:37,640
(baby yelling)

78
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,158
- You like it?

79
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,357
(feet stomping)

80
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:42,870
How did it look?

81
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,766
- I like it.

82
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,283
- I love how the music is lining up

83
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:47,679
with the noises from the toaster.

84
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,523
Do you see that?

85
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:49,356
- Yeah.

86
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:52,745
- You are editing a vlog.

87
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:55,075
Do you like it?

88
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:55,968
- Yeah!

89
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,282
- So editing takes a lot of work,

90
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:58,809
you put a lot of time into that

91
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:02,458
and then you only get to
see like 10 seconds of it.

92
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,291
- Let's see this clip.

93
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:08,176
- She can always push
undo, too, which is great.

94
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:10,560
Alright, so you pick
the color you want it.

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,395
Did it work?

96
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:12,271
- Uh huh.

97
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,104
- Good job.

98
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:15,453
Okay so now you can start
making your edits on that scene.

99
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:16,790
- Can we make a time lapse?

100
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,569
- Is the camera still enough for ya?

101
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,815
- Oh, for sure.

102
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:21,632
- We have a lot of apples.

103
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:24,253
So my awesome Aunt Kay sent us this kit.

104
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:25,533
And it has everything that we need

105
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,818
to make some caramel apples.

106
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,098
So we thought we'd give it a try.

107
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,190
I've honestly never made
caramel apples before.

108
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,950
I have made caramel onions

109
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,990
which the kids reminded
me of this morning.

110
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,323
Did you like caramel onions?

111
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,554
- I liked the caramel.

112
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,148
- So now should we make
real caramel apples?

113
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,243
- Yes!

114
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:45,303
- So Caleb and Laura are
removing the stickers.

115
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:47,594
I love caramel apples so I'm
really excited to try this.

116
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,588
- So I just got home from the office

117
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:51,258
and all my kids are hiding.

118
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:53,489
She jumped out and surprised me.

119
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,067
Should I go find Isaac and Elise?

120
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,734
I found Nene, let's see
where they could be.

121
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,520
He he (laughing).

122
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,503
- How did you know?

123
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:06,182
- I found you!

124
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:07,249
- Yes!

125
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:10,480
- Alright, let's see, under the bed.

126
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,235
Trying to find him,
could be in the closet.

127
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:16,402
You never know, he's not in the dryer.

128
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:19,616
- I don't advise hiding in dryers.

129
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:22,463
- No, don't hide in the
dryer, that's not safe.

130
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,666
Or the oven, he's not under here.

131
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,265
Let's see, this is kind of suspicious.

132
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,195
(laughing)

133
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:32,028
Found you!

134
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,437
- Take out those two.

135
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:35,839
- That was a good spot.

136
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,960
Don't tell me where he is.

137
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,769
- I have no idea where he is.

138
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:39,624
- Not in there.

139
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:41,358
- He can hide in the basement.

140
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:42,858
- Let's see, nope.

141
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:47,762
Where can he be?

142
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:50,334
Where is he?

143
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,813
There he is! (laughs)

144
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:00,379
Last one!

145
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,240
- I know, that's like
my favorite hiding spot.

146
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,194
- It's a good spot, good job, you guys.

147
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,349
I found all of them, what
are we doing now you guys?

148
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,034
- Making caramel apples.

149
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:09,172
- Did you get it?

150
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:11,376
- Not all the way, it's
like when you pull a weed.

151
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:13,044
- You got the stump left?

152
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:15,561
So we got out the needle nose pliers.

153
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:16,560
- I mean that's pretty good.

154
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,168
- That's good, it'll work.

155
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,337
Good idea, Caleb on
the needle nose pliers.

156
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:21,888
Then we have to wash
all these apples next.

157
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,305
(folk music)

158
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:28,194
- We gotta lot of helpers.

159
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,034
- Jeremy is now going
to use his brute force.

160
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,451
- To stab apples.

161
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,458
- It's gotta be in there pretty good.

162
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,546
- I think it's pretty good.

163
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:49,963
(folk music)

164
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:01,144
- Yay!

165
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:06,156
- You add sweetened condense
milk to the caramel.

166
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,678
- Cause it needs a little more goodness.

167
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:11,462
- This is going to be pretty good.

168
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:14,045
(upbeat music)

169
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:17,924
- The caramel's ready.

170
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,995
- I think we did it, I
think it turned in caramel,

171
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:21,495
you guys see this.

172
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,521
- Ooh.

173
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:28,104
(upbeat music)

174
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:37,761
- Ooh.

175
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:42,489
- What do you think?

176
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,436
Roll it up.

177
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:50,450
Whoa.

178
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,700
- That is mine!

179
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:56,101
- Spin it, spin it, good job, pull it out.

180
00:06:58,236 --> 00:06:59,069
Woo!

181
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,919
(upbeat music)

182
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,594
You did it!

183
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,497
Now before they dry, we
have to add the toppings.

184
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,686
- Decorate 'em.

185
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:14,269
(upbeat music)

186
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,317
- It's already not sticking.

187
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:23,227
Maybe I should just have
done these one at a time?

188
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:24,423
- Great method, Isaac.

189
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:25,394
- Nice.

190
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:27,635
- We're first timers.

191
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:29,802
- Eyes, nose, and a smile.

192
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:32,806
- Very cool, it's like a person.

193
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:35,389
(tinkly music)

194
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:44,154
- This is my brain.

195
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:46,169
- Did you do your brain
for your caramel apple?

196
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,482
- This is the math area,
this is the reading area,

197
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:52,698
and all the rest of it is
stuff that I know and do.

198
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,596
- So we're going to cut up
a few of these to share.

199
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:57,179
(upbeat music)

200
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:08,238
- Does it hurt to eat it,
Elise, without that tooth?

201
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,065
- I'll have another tooth.

202
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:13,685
- You got a little bit on your face!

203
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:15,689
- This is so good.

204
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,498
- That's awkward.

205
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,334
- So Jeremy and I are trying

206
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,428
to make an important decision today.

207
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:23,937
And it's stressful, it
deals with some money

208
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,182
and some time and time and
money are stressful things.

209
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:29,340
And I've made pros and cons lists

210
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,610
and Jeremy and I have talked about it

211
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,993
and talked about and talked about it.

212
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,706
And it's so hard, I feel like
there's no clear decision.

213
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:36,832
Usually when you talk about
stuff and you make a list

214
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,316
and you really think about it.

215
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,537
Like one decision kind
of rises above the rest.

216
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:44,879
And this time I still don't
know what we should do.

217
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,081
And what matters most is
what lasts the longest.

218
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,823
And what lasts the longest is family

219
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:53,199
and memories and relationships.

220
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,314
And becoming the people
that we need to become.

221
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,224
So I'm going to try to prioritize that

222
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,644
and see if that makes
the decision more clear.

223
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,415
What do you think we should do?

224
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,150
- Make caramel apples.

225
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,828
- You think we should make caramel apples?

226
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:09,010
(mellow music)

227
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,027
- We're at Isaac's basketball evaluation

228
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:13,871
and they're trying on their uniforms,

229
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:16,239
seeing what size he'll be

230
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,374
and we've been in line
for over 30 minutes.

231
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,415
There's ton's of people here.

232
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:21,819
We're almost getting to the point

233
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:23,645
where he gets to play basketball.

234
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:24,497
- How you doing?

235
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,330
- Good.

236
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,393
- Go.

237
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,143
(exciting music)

238
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,292
- Well you did a great job.

239
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,255
- Thanks.

240
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:54,088
- I'm done.

241
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,840
- Good night, J House out.

242
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,248
- So how do you feel

243
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,205
about the dentist looking at your teeth?

244
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:59,038
- Good.

245
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,080
- It's a little bit nervous making,

246
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,275
it looks under construction.

247
00:10:03,275 --> 00:00:00,000
- Open your mouth.
