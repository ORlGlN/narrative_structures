1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,263
- [Isaac] What?

2
00:00:01,263 --> 00:00:03,930
- [Caleb] Yeah! This is so cool!

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,796
- Coming for you!

4
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:11,804
He's making a baby gate.

5
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:19,287
(pleasant music)

6
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:28,119
Since Livy knows how
to do this by herself,

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,487
I can do it all by myself now.

8
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,810
- I'm teaching Laura the alphabet.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,950
N, give me N.

10
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:43,662
(Laura laughs)

11
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:44,803
- [Jeremy] Thanks for
helping her out, buddy.

12
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:45,897
- Yeah.

00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:50,897

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,683
- [Kendra] Spelling test time.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,943
Number 9, speedily.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,376
Number 10, angrily.

20
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:09,574
(Isaac growls)

21
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:11,570
And you write it angrily.

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,640
Number 11 is happily.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,229
Now can you write it happily?

24
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:17,425
Bigger smile, bigger smile!

25
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:19,181
- [Jeremy] What are you working on, Elise?

26
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:21,066
- I'm finished, Science.

27
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,816
- [Jeremy] Very good.

28
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:27,210
So we decided to take
the kids on a hike today.

29
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,943
It's starting to warm up, and that sounded

30
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,832
like a fun activity.

31
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,915
(upbeat banjo music)

32
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,283
What's this?

33
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:49,731
- [Caleb] It's a cave.

34
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,564
One more if it's safe.

35
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:56,820
Isn't it so cool?

36
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:01,400
- [Jeremy] (gasps) Oh!

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,590
- [Kendra] Can you walk
on the balance beam?

38
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:05,647
Ooh.

39
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:09,496
- [Laura] Hi!

40
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,317
This is our house.

41
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:13,168
- How did they build this?

42
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,490
- [Jeremy] Do you remember when we built

43
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,845
a thing like this at Papa's cabin?

44
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,185
- [Both] Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:19,018
- Wee!

46
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:21,255
Hi!

47
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:24,287
Two, three, go!

48
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:26,988
Wee!

49
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:28,992
(Laura giggles)

50
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,380
- [Isaac] I'm making an obstacle course.

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,213
- Brilliant.

52
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,850
So the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon Trail

53
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,430
actually run right through this park.

54
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,981
- There's some ruins at
the park of some cabins

55
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,450
that were built right along
the trail at that time.

56
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,397
- [Jeremy] It was a fireplace.

57
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:43,596
- A real one from a long, long time ago?

58
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,657
- [Jeremy] From a long time ago.

59
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:48,968
- [Caleb] How did they keep it so long?

60
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,700
- [Jeremy] It was the
only thing that lasted.

61
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,107
There used to be a whole cabin here.

62
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:53,269
- [Kendra] Look how big it is.

63
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,186
- [Caleb] Look, I'm in a fireplace.

64
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,940
- Hiking in Missouri in the winter

65
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,020
is not as pretty as the
other times of year,

66
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,870
but you don't have to deal
with any bugs, so that's nice.

67
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,460
- [Jeremy] Looks like there's
water coming from that cave.

68
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,710
- [Isaac] What?

69
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:21,006
- [Caleb] Yeah! This is so cool!

70
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,923
- [Elise] I wanna come!

71
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,087
Wow, cool cave.

72
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:26,979
- [Kendra] Can you guys see me?

73
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,537
- [Jeremy] They're right here.

74
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:31,037
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness!

75
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:31,870
- Hi, Mom!

76
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,537
- [Kendra] Hi, guys!

77
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,908
- [Jeremy] He climbed out of the cave.

78
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:41,753
- (giggles) Yay! I succeptisul...

79
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:42,692
How do you say it?

80
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:43,525
Okay.

81
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:44,475
- [Jeremy] Successfully?

82
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,896
- Successfully did it.

83
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:46,844
- [Jeremy] Good job.

84
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:48,139
- [Caleb] I wanna do it again!

85
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,722
(bright music)

86
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,687
- We're abandoning the
stroller for a minute,

87
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:00,271
because we want to go more off-road.

88
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,854
(bright music)

89
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,950
- I heard there was gonna be bears here.

90
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,097
There wasn't, and I'm really hot.

91
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:16,635
- [Jeremy] No bears. You hot?

92
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,027
- And thirsty.

93
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:18,980
- [Jeremy] And thirsty?

94
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,672
Happens when you go hiking.

95
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:22,142
- [Kendra] So Laura, why did you think

96
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:23,543
there was going to be bears here?

97
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:26,040
- I don't know, I thought
there was gonna be

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,343
really bad things here.

99
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,550
- I love this place a lot.

100
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,383
- [Jeremy] Why do you love it?

101
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:33,020
- I think it's really fun.

102
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,991
I liked the cave and the
playground was awesome.

103
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:37,905
- So apparently, the trail we're walking

104
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,757
is a big circle, and it's leading us

105
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,290
back to the front of the park.

106
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,779
So we have to go back and get our stroller

107
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,612
that has our car keys.

108
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:46,600
Oops.

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,650
Let's head back up to the starting point!

110
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,406
- I'm digging for gold.

111
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:56,448
- [Kendra] I think
we're in the wrong state

112
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:57,925
to find gold, buddy.

113
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:00,097
- Where do you find the gold?

114
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:01,344
- [Kendra] Where do you think?

115
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,333
- California.

116
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,720
- That's where the gold rush was.

117
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,048
So some of the adventures that we go on

118
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,162
turn out to be way better
than I think they're gonna be,

119
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:10,454
and some of them turn out a little lamer,

120
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:14,150
and, uh, this might be
one of those days today.

121
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,800
I don't know if it's just
that it's not, you know,

122
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,220
the gorgeous summertime,
but we're ready to go home.

123
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,753
- There must be a lot of
gas going through this.

124
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:30,853
- [Jeremy] There is a lot of gas going in.

125
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:34,112
- [Caleb] Cool!

126
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:38,390
(Laura laughs)

127
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,807
- Coming for you!

128
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,350
- [Jeremy] Caleb's trying
rollerblading for the first time.

129
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,139
- [Elise] Go, go into them!

130
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,806
Rollerblade in them.

131
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:03,080
- Well, the weather is amazing today,

132
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,840
I've got all the windows open
so I can feel the breeze,

133
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,020
and all the kids are
outside except for Janae,

134
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,260
and she was standing at the kitchen door

135
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,226
and she kept pounding on the door,

136
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:11,560
like she just wanted to go outside so bad.

137
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,202
So I brought her outside,
and it made me realize

138
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:16,196
that the deck right now
is not baby friendly.

139
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:19,191
So I need to change that so
when we go into springtime,

140
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,957
Janae and I can both be
outside, and be happy,

141
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:22,730
and safe, and watch the kids.

142
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,191
I think I want to put a
baby gate up right here,

143
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:27,063
that would be first step.

144
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:28,736
And then I want to do something different

145
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:31,000
with this area, rather
than this super classy

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,250
free table that we picked
up a few years ago.

147
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,849
But I can't decide if we should
make this an eating area,

148
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:37,940
like with an outdoor table and chairs,

149
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,646
or if we should make it
an outdoor sitting area,

150
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,890
with like, couches and a rug.

151
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,362
So let me know which one
you think would work better.

152
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,581
Ideally, I would love
to have both outside,

153
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,070
but we just don't have
enough space on this deck,

154
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,810
and the patio is used
for more important things

155
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,250
like basketball, and
rollerblading, and sidewalk chalk.

156
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,483
- [Jeremy] The trampoline
is like a giant baby gate.

157
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,817
- And she loves it!

158
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,220
- [Jeremy] She does.

159
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,582
Is that dog, doggie? Ruff, ruff.

160
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,613
She grunts when she's signing dog.

161
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,430
- Everything's so kind of
dead and dry right now.

162
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,726
I hope we get some more moisture.

163
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:11,971
It'll be nice to see everything
come alive in the spring.

164
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:14,530
Lisey's making an ice cream cone.

165
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,837
And Laura, are you writing your name?

166
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:16,670
- Mm-hmm.

167
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:26,945
- [Jeremy] This is the
winner, we're doing 8 to 9.

168
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,445
(funky music)

169
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:34,591
- [Isaac] Yeah!

170
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,653
- [Kendra] Isaac, you won?

171
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,313
- Yeah, 10 to 9.
- [Jeremy] Good game.

172
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:39,343
- [Kendra] Very nice.

173
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:40,176
Way to school your dad.

174
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,009
(Isaac softly laughs)

175
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,280
So I'm trying to increase
how many vegetables

176
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,306
we get in our diet, and so
I'm making spaghetti tonight,

177
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:46,040
and I'm gonna have some regular noodles,

178
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,870
but I'm also going to
be using some of these.

179
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,810
They're called veggie
spirals, so we're gonna eat

180
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,060
spaghetti sauce on top of that.

181
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,524
- [Jeremy] This smells so good.

182
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:58,200
- It's just sauteed onions,
mushrooms, garlic, and spinach.

183
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,407
- So I'm on day four of the cleanse.

184
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:04,010
I haven't eaten anything but the salad

185
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,488
that I get one day a week.

186
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:08,750
And today, one day,
each, I'm losing my mind.

187
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,204
But this smells so good,
and I've been like,

188
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,550
craving food all day.

189
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,765
So I have one more day
left and then I'll be done.

190
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:15,773
- You can do it.

191
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:16,660
- [Jeremy] I can do it.

192
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,670
- [Kendra] So this is,
I'm just kind of making

193
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,720
like a homemade spaghetti sauce.

194
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,793
- [Jeremy] Yeah, looks amazing.

195
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,227
- We're making a baby gate.

196
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,430
- [Jeremy] Ooh, is this
gonna keep Nae-Nae safe?

197
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,263
- [Laura] Yep.

198
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:27,096
- [Caleb] And I'm holding it.

199
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:28,580
- [Jeremy] Are you gonna have to be here

200
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,452
forever to keep her safe?

201
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:31,285
- Yeah.

202
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:33,299
- [Caleb] No, I'm gonna get
a different piece of wood

203
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,633
so that can rest and tape that back,

204
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:38,455
and then I'm gonna have to
tape those two together.

205
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:39,395
- [Kendra] How's it going?

206
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,829
- Good. Our baby gate's actually working.

207
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,623
- We don't want her to get out here.

208
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,571
- [Kendra] Yeah, you don't want
Janae to be able to get out?

209
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:49,479
- But then, once she's
older, I'll take it apart.

210
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,450
- [Kendra] Do you think
she could fit under there?

211
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,390
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

212
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,880
- [Kendra] You're a little
bit worried about that part?

213
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,783
- I think Nae-Nae might be strong enough

214
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:58,490
to just (imitates crashing sound).

215
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,864
- [Jeremy] We could test it out.

216
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:02,391
- No, not yet, once it's all the way done.

217
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:03,292
- [Jeremy] Okay.

218
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,193
- So this is my dinner,
it's zucchini noodles

219
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:07,422
with all the veggies on top.

220
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,640
- [Caleb] Mmm-mmm!

221
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,150
- This is really good.

222
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,370
- [Jeremy] Yeah, you nailed it.

223
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,890
My salad is good, too.

224
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,270
- The zucchini noodles, I really like.

225
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,010
I don't know if it's that I've been eating

226
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,799
really healthy lately, but I
feel like they taste amazing.

227
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,419
- Look at this mess waiting
to happen over here.

228
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,167
(Janae giggles)

229
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,310
- Nae-Nae.

230
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,250
- [Elise] Ah do do do do do.

231
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,650
- [Jeremy] So Elise is getting
ready to head to ballet.

232
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,202
And Isaac has a Scouts
pack meeting tonight.

233
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:38,285
(background chatter)

234
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:56,257
♪ Don't look at other people ♪

235
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:59,022
♪ Just be happy with who you are ♪

236
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:00,617
- [Jeremy] Laura, what did
we do for Scouts tonight?

237
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:01,739
- Got a cookie.

238
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:02,572
- [Jeremy] Cookie.

239
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:05,260
- We played human Hungry Hippos.

240
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,352
- [Jared] Human Hungry
Hippos for the pack meeting.

241
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:10,173
- Goodnight, J House out.

242
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,601
- [Kendra] So Janae is, shall we call it,

243
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:17,371
helping fold laundry.

244
00:10:17,371 --> 00:00:00,000
- Destroying. (Kendra laughs)
