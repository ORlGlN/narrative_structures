1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,742
- So I put Janae in
shoes for the first time.

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:04,159
- [Jeremy] Uh oh.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,820
- Today I'm getting baptized.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,929
- Oh, whoa!

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,512
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,150
- [Jeremy] Elise, what's
special about today?

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,822
- Today I'm getting baptized.

8
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:22,490
- [Jeremy] I'm so excited for you.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,900
And we have some special
guests who came in to see it.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,692
- A lot of special guests.

11
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:27,640
- [Jeremy] Who?

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,230
- Grandma and Papa,
Grammy Jo and Poppy Keith.

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,400
Oh, and Poppy Ron.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,760
And all our family,
but some couldn't come.

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,000
- [Jeremy] All right, go
get your baptism dress on.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,750
(pleasant music)

17
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:48,610
- [Jeremy] So someone is
adventuring up the stairs.

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,180
We're still standing close by, though,

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,800
because she falls a lot, still.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,580
(Janae vocalizing)

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,760
Come on, up to here.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,770
Good job!

23
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,310
Keep going! Push those legs up.

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,050
So Elise picked out a baptism dress.

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,169
I absolutely love it.

26
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:06,002
- Thanks.

27
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:06,883
- [Jeremy] You look adorable.

28
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:07,716
- Thanks.

29
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:08,549
- [Jeremy] How do you feel about everyone

30
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,840
being here to support you
for today's special day?

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,140
- Just makes me feel
happy that they're coming

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,930
to my baptism, it's a
really special thing.

33
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,150
- So one of the things we believe is that

34
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,353
baptism is an opportunity
to show the world

35
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:22,146
our faith and belief in Jesus Christ,

36
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:26,210
to follow his example, and
to make a promise with God,

37
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,304
a promise to try to follow the path

38
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:29,600
and the teachings of Jesus Christ.

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,239
- And I'm glad that I'm doing it.

40
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,607
- [Jeremy] Really proud of you.

41
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:35,857
("When I Am Baptized")

42
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:46,230
- I love her dress.

43
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,655
- She glissandos so well.

44
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:52,779
- [Jeremy] Oh, good job, Laura.

45
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,950
(piano playing)

46
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,043
- [Caleb] It sounds so good!

47
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,478
- (laughs)

48
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:00,645
It's called improvisation.

49
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,511
- Laura's really good at the piano.

50
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:04,713
- [Kendra] Are you excited?

51
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:06,276
It's your big moment.

52
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:09,735
♪ I like to look for rainbows ♪

53
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:13,293
♪ Whenever there is rain ♪

54
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:14,592
- Well it's really special to have so much

55
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,987
of our family with us here
today for Elise's baptism,

56
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:18,622
and it just reminds me of my baptism

57
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:19,900
when I was a little girl.

58
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,590
I was baptized when I was eight years old,

59
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,334
and through my life, it's
just been a great reminder

60
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:27,102
of choosing to try to follow
Jesus Christ's example.

61
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:30,167
So we're here at First
Watch celebrating Elise.

62
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,460
Whatchya gonna order?

63
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,678
- I'm gonna have french
toast and hot chocolate.

64
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:36,374
- They had something called the Bacado,

65
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:41,250
and it's like bacon, avocado,
scrambled, it sounds good.

66
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,650
- You can't go wrong with
the word bacon and avocado.

67
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,640
And I can't decide.

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,920
I'm hungry, and I want to
eat everything on the menu.

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,753
- [Jeremy] Thank you.

70
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,560
Hot chocolate.

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,980
- [Kendra] Jeremy ordered
a Morning Meditation.

72
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,670
- It's good, it's orange,
lemon, ginger, and guava.

73
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,120
- [Kendra] Does it feel very--

74
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:00,132
- Ahh!

75
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:02,860
(Jeremy laughs)

76
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,285
- What do you think of that?

77
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,118
- Awesome.

78
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:13,808
- [Jeremy] It's a fun time
when you're at a red light,

79
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:16,221
and your mom, my wife, is sitting

80
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:17,445
over there.
- [Papa] There she is.

81
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,350
- It was actually funny,
we were just like,

82
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,618
staring at her creepily,
and she didn't notice

83
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,311
for like 30 seconds, it was...

84
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:25,650
It was a good time when
she realized we were here.

85
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,337
Next on the agenda is Isaac's
first basketball game.

86
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:30,770
He's super excited.

87
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,596
So the hardest thing for
Isaac about being in San Diego

88
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:34,560
is that we were missing all of his games

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,884
and practices with basketball.

90
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:38,760
He's so excited to be back into it.

91
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,183
(energetic music)

92
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,370
We made it!

93
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,140
- So I put Janae in
shoes for the first time!

94
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,223
- [Jeremy] Uh oh.

95
00:03:57,223 --> 00:03:59,480
- And she's been mesmerized by them.

96
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:03,382
(energetic music)

97
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:15,852
- [Jeremy] Woo!

98
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:19,100
- I'm dressed in all
green to cheer for Isaac.

99
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,938
- [Jeremy] You're the best
little cheerleader ever.

100
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:21,771
- Oh yeah.

101
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:23,221
- Go!

102
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,300
- [Jeremy] Except for maybe
this little nugget of joy.

103
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,505
Go Isaac!

104
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:30,264
Those are so funny, what are those?

105
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:31,513
- [Caleb] Go Isaac!

106
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:33,370
- [Kendra] There she is!

107
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,220
We need to get her some
of those squeaky shoes.

108
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,030
- Oh, that would be good.

109
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:50,483
Woo! Good job.

110
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:54,283
(beat music)

111
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,057
- My favorite part was the
part that most surprised me.

112
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:05,610
The first part where they had us run out.

113
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,679
- [Kendra] That was awesome,
I did not expect that at all.

114
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,567
- It shocked.

115
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,770
- [Kendra] Yeah! Well, you
played really well, good job.

116
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,869
- [Jeremy] They're doing
the luge with Papa Keith.

117
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:15,121
(Caleb yells)

118
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,121
(Papa Keith grunts)

119
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,835
So we've been having so much
fun watching the Olympics,

120
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:23,387
and we're having some family over tonight

121
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:26,011
for some pizza, and the
figure skating is on,

122
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,670
and we're gonna watch it.

123
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,907
Let us know in the poll,
have you been watching

124
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:31,090
the Olympics, and do you like it?

125
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:35,250
- [Grandma] The only one
that plays the black keys.

126
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:38,771
That's it!

127
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,438
(piano playing)

128
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:48,159
- So Caleb's bike has
been having a problem,

129
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,530
and since Papa's in town,
we're having him look at it.

130
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,610
So what was wrong with it?

131
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,084
- Um, there was two of these, these...

132
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:56,175
- [Kendra] Oh.

133
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:59,337
- On this side, and there's
supposed to be one on both.

134
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:00,860
- Interesting.

135
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,820
So back in the day,
when Papa was a teenager

136
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,940
and a young adult, he
worked in a bicycle shop.

137
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,343
And so he's always our
resident bicycle repairman.

138
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:09,826
- [Caleb] Did you ever do stuff like this

139
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:12,185
when you were working as a bike man?

140
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:14,494
- [Papa] Yeah, pretty much.

141
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,590
Folks would have problems.

142
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,423
- Cool.

143
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:19,499
- [Boy] I want to be a
scientist when I grow up.

144
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,920
- [Kendra] That's a cool
thing to be, a scientist.

145
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,880
Caleb, what do you want to be?

146
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,960
- Maybe like a builder, NFL player.

147
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,060
- [Kendra] Great jobs.

148
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,460
- For dinner tonight, we're doing pizza.

149
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,134
We did bacon and pineapple.

150
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:39,176
Like actual bacon, not ham.

151
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:40,730
What do you think?

152
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,187
- It's very good.

153
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:43,937
- [Jeremy] You did the chicken one?

154
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:48,228
(upbeat music)

155
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:56,186
So for a long time, our kids
only wanted cheese pizza,

156
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:59,010
and I'm so happy that they're
graduating out of that,

157
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,360
where they want to try the other pizzas

158
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,915
with other fun toppings on there.

159
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:04,710
So we might not get a
cheese pizza next time.

160
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,367
(laughing)

161
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,784
(rock music)

162
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:18,214
So you've been watching the Olympics.

163
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:19,931
- Yep! We're gonna be ice skating.

164
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,000
- [Jeremy] You ready to get out there?

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,833
Go do it.

166
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,150
They're doing figure skating.

167
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,174
Very nice.

168
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:29,068
(laughing)

169
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:30,700
Is that your figure skating?

170
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,580
Oh, are these the moves? (laughs)

171
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,610
All right, so first up for the

172
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,380
United States, Elise and Luke.

173
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,041
(chuckles)

174
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,180
Nice!

175
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,928
(laughs)

176
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:00,987
Oh!

177
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:02,170
(Elise laughs)

178
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,520
That will be a deduction
of a half a point.

179
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,290
The heart ending!

180
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,760
From Korea, Isaac and Allison.

181
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,357
With their, oh, whoa!

182
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:15,140
(laughing)

183
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,300
There it is.

184
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,133
Very good.

185
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,240
Oh, onto the knees, whoa!

186
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,310
Is that the end? Woo!

187
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,375
- We are playing the game
Timeline in partners.

188
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,350
This'll be fun.

189
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,940
- This is like the nerdiest game.

190
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,048
You have to try to put, in order,

191
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:33,299
when things were invented.

192
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,639
And put it correctly in the timeline.

193
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,980
- [Kendra] All right, Jeremy,
which one do you want to do?

194
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,500
The invention of the combustion engine,

195
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,905
the invention of the Zeppelin.

196
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:44,229
This game is oddly intense.

197
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,464
Oh, I'm getting nervous!

198
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:46,297
- [Jeremy] They got it.

199
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:47,409
- They got it.

200
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,250
We are on our last card.

201
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,449
- [Jeremy] We're about to win the game.

202
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:52,276
- Hopefully, don't jinx it!

203
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:53,348
- [Jeremy] Will they win it?

204
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:55,025
- But you need electricity to pull it.

205
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,276
- All right, 1837.

206
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:58,491
(cheers)

207
00:08:58,491 --> 00:08:59,644
- [Kendra] You won! Woo!

208
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:01,451
- [Jeremy] They won it! The winners!

209
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,167
Looks like the kids made
a short track down here,

210
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,317
and they're working on
their speed skating.

211
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,355
Isaac's coming around on the inside,

212
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:11,361
trying to make a pass on Caleb.

213
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:13,447
Can he do it? He comes in!

214
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:16,880
So we're ending the night
watching more of the Olympics,

215
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,337
and we hope you have a wonderful night.

216
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,170
J House out.

217
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,003
(Janae vocalizes)

218
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,705
- [Kendra] You guys
wanna make giant kisses?

219
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:25,940
- Yeah.

220
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,170
- [Jeremy] All right, Caleb has his

221
00:09:30,170 --> 00:00:00,000
treasure hunt ready for us.
