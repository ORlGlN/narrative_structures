1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:02,610
- It's like a dream come true.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,193
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:10,620
- [Kendra] Here we go.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,246
- [Jeremy] So how did you
guys sleep last night?

5
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,616
- Good.

6
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,566
I didn't have any dreams.

7
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:16,774
- [Jeremy] No dreams?

8
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:18,631
- I had two bad dreams.

9
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,371
- I had two good dreams.

10
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,252
- [Jeremy] What was your dream Caleb?

11
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:25,133
- A transformer was trying to get me

12
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,128
and I was at first beating her.

13
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:32,470
I climbed up a rope and
she couldn't get me.

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,025
So then she started kicking the rope.

15
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:37,091
It started bouncing up and down.

16
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:40,574
I was just going up and down too fast.

17
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,491
Then I flew off and eventually won.

18
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:47,145
It was still scary.

19
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,933
- [Jeremy] For sure, I'm glad you won.

20
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,396
- Yeah.

21
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:52,778
- [Jeremy] You doing the laundry?

22
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:55,494
- Yep and Jenae nae's in there.

23
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:58,661
- [Jeremy] Jenae nae's in the laundry.

24
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,581
- Why is Jenae in there?

25
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:05,827
- [Jeremy] She just wanted
to help with the laundry.

26
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:08,410
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:13,905
Good job.

28
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:17,590
- Two, four, six

29
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,727
eighth, ten, 12,

30
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:20,977
14, 16, 18, 20.

31
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:25,694
- So with some of the
testing that we've doing

32
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:27,784
recently with Elise, we
found that her dyslexia

33
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:29,549
is affecting her math a lot too.

34
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,103
So we're just trying to make
her math really hands on

35
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:35,865
and engaging and help
with learning with that.

36
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:37,722
- One, three, five, seven

37
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,805
nine, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19.

38
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,756
- We'll keep working on it.

39
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:48,473
- I could only find one shoe.

40
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,122
- [Jeremy] Was that
only one you could find?

41
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:52,745
So you just decided to go with
the flip flop on the other?

42
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:53,578
Perfect.

43
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,343
How does it feel to have
one shoe and one flip flop?

44
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:03,676
- Feels like you

45
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,933
might hurt your ankle.

46
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,766
- [Jeremy] Stretch that ankle out.

47
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,063
- I want you to write down.

48
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:15,084
- Knob.

49
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,662
- Does knob rhyme with no?

50
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:19,612
- No, Mr. Snow.

51
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:21,493
- There you go, that one rhythms.

52
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:25,660
Laura's working on scissor
skills on paper thankfully.

53
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,456
I just got her this new sweatshirt.

54
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:32,453
It's super soft on the inside.

55
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:35,541
I got it from Walmart
'cause we're cool like that.

56
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,120
- [Jeremy] It was like three bucks.

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,462
- Isn't she so cute in
her little fall clothes.

58
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,088
- [Jeremy] This morning's a little chilly.

59
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,224
- Yeah it's in the 50s this morning.

60
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:47,267
Like 57 which is still gorgeous out.

61
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,566
But I just wanna make sure she is warm.

62
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,538
- We're going to a
homeschool party at the park.

63
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,464
(upbeat music)

64
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:56,741
- They're excited to meet new people

65
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,111
and see old friends that they haven't

66
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,272
seen during the summer time.

67
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:02,522
It's like a back to school celebration.

68
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,866
- I'm up here with some friends.

69
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,351
- [Kendra] Alright,
y'all have a good time.

70
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,046
It's so fun to be able
to feel this community

71
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:11,764
and to know that there's other moms

72
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:13,808
that are going through
the same things as I am

73
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:15,596
with trying to get into the
groove of the school year

74
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,732
and get their kids to do
their spelling homework.

75
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,379
And keep it fun and anyway.

76
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,879
So it's been fun to be with friends today.

77
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:30,619
Brixton, break your back,

78
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:33,684
bend your knees with lifting
please, clap, clap clap.

79
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:36,434
Are you enjoying reading with us?

80
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,554
Two, four, six, a million, billion bricks.

81
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,110
- [Elise] Oh my goodness.

82
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,316
- [Kendra] What do you think
Caleb, what are they building?

83
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:48,800
- Looks like a castle of some sort.

84
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,402
Look at there.

85
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:51,517
- So what do you think we need

86
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:52,794
to be able to build bricks?

87
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:57,159
- We need clay and then we
need um, that's all we need.

88
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,933
Well Mommy, I wanna
make bricks and then go

89
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,433
and build a house.

90
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,203
- [Jeremy] Do you know who did that?

91
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,666
Poppy Keith.

92
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,616
He built his whole house outta bricks.

93
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:09,845
- The mud house, that's why
we call it the mud house.

94
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:11,726
- [Jeremy] He did the
whole thing out of adobe.

95
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:13,421
- Bricks that he made out of mud.

96
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,765
This is Jenae's first
time in a shopping cart.

97
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:17,598
Hi.

98
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,269
So Laura, what are we shopping for?

99
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,186
- A wreath.

100
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,124
- [Kendra] A wreath,
where's the wreath gonna go?

101
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:26,819
- On our door.

102
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,352
- [Kendra] On our door, here we go.

103
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,907
This is a Home Good store.

104
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:31,463
I've actually never been
in a Home Good store before

105
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,228
so I'm hoping they sell wreaths

106
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:35,178
because that's what I need.

107
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:37,407
I need a fall wreath, we
have a Christmas wreath

108
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,962
and we have one that worked
really well for the spring

109
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,935
and summer, but it
doesn't work for the fall.

110
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:43,375
So we need to switch it up.

111
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,489
- Oh a pumpkin.

112
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:45,813
Flower.

113
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,576
- [Kendra] See these are fall things.

114
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:49,598
- Can I smell it?

115
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:52,686
- [Kendra] You wanna
smell the flower, sure.

116
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:55,240
We are looking for like
Halloween and fall things okay.

117
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,816
I'm letting myself get
distracted and I found this.

118
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:00,627
Wouldn't that look nice
next to Jeremy and I's bed?

119
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:01,812
What do you think?

120
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:02,810
- Good.

121
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,644
- So this outfit that
Laura's wearing today

122
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:05,898
she chose and picked out herself.

123
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,199
This is actually Elise's shirt

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,476
but she's wearing it as a dress.

125
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,171
- Because it's too big on me.

126
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:12,052
Too big on me.

127
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:13,329
- [Kendra] So you wear it as a dress?

128
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,443
- Yeah.

129
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:15,883
- [Kendra] Well it looks really nice.

130
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,694
- That is so creepy.

131
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:18,716
Wreaths.

132
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:20,883
- [Kendra] There they are.

133
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:22,781
It's pretty.

134
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,584
- [Laura] So pretty.

135
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,466
That is not pretty.

136
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,133
I need it like this.

137
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:34,157
- [Kendra] So you don't like
the one that Mom picked?

138
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:35,945
I don't know I think this one's pretty.

139
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,685
I'm trying to decide how
fallish I want to go.

140
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,682
I don't think I want
pumpkins hanging on my wreath

141
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:42,005
but I'm not sure.

142
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:44,588
(upbeat music)

143
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,734
Well Laura is surprisingly
very opinionated about wreaths.

144
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,685
She is saying the funniest things

145
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,382
as soon as I turn off the camera.

146
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:56,822
She's talking about how
all of these wreaths

147
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:58,772
are not nice except for this one Momma,

148
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,235
you need to buy this one.

149
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,371
She's very attached to the wreath she has.

150
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:04,159
This one's Laura's pick.

151
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:04,992
Hi Jenae.

152
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:07,735
So I told Laura not to touch
the wreaths but to point

153
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,220
and she's pointing with her toes.

154
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,845
This girl is so entertaining to shop with.

155
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:14,306
I am loving this shopping trip.

156
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:15,676
How are we doing?

157
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:16,698
- Good.

158
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:17,975
- So now I'm second guessing myself.

159
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:19,856
Maybe pumpkins are fun on a wreath.

160
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,598
I don't know they look pretty cool

161
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:22,596
especially with the hay.

162
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:25,220
I've narrowed down the wreaths
to three final choices.

163
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,101
Let me know in the poll which
one you would have picked.

164
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:28,726
I still don't know, I haven't decided yet

165
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:29,934
which one we're getting.

166
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,118
- This one.

167
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:32,093
- [Kendra] You like that one?

168
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,091
- Yepidy.

169
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:34,624
- [Kendra] So there's the white one

170
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:35,646
that Laura is in love with.

171
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:39,059
Then there's this
floralish one that I like.

172
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:40,642
Then an orange one.

173
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,982
(rock music)

174
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:53,466
- I made a football field
with yards instead of my feet.

175
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:57,565
I made it to 10 yards for each cone

176
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:00,723
and this is a 40 yard football field.

177
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:03,626
Two fifths of a football field.

178
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,065
- [Jeremy] Set, hike.

179
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:07,482
(rock music)

180
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:10,894
Good catch.

181
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:12,333
- I'm loving having audiobooks being part

182
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,121
of our homeschool routine this year.

183
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:16,002
It's going really well so far.

184
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,883
Elise is listening to Little
House in the Big Woods.

185
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:19,578
And I saw on Amazon the other day

186
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:21,714
this little set of paper dolls

187
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:24,617
that are Little House in the
Big Woods paper doll set.

188
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:27,101
So she's sitting in there
cutting out the little dolls

189
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:29,841
and the dresses while
listening to the book.

190
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,188
It just makes my heart happy.

191
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:33,417
I actually used some paper
dolls when I was a kid

192
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,460
and I remember my mom
telling me about paper dolls

193
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,945
and my grandma and I
just think that's cool.

194
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,802
I love old stuff.

195
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:41,288
- I finished the book.

196
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:44,005
- [Kendra] Okay so here's how
this paper doll set works.

197
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,140
In the front there's the dolls
and you just pop those out.

198
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,603
You don't have to cut them.

199
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:51,087
But then all the clothes
you have to cut out.

200
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:55,081
Leesy's already cut out
two pages of these clothes.

201
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,821
- But I don't know what
these thingys are for.

202
00:07:57,821 --> 00:08:00,027
- [Kendra] You mean the stuff
that sticks up at the top?

203
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:01,908
That's what attaches it to the doll.

204
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:03,371
- Oh so you fold them back.

205
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:04,392
- [Kendra] You do.

206
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:05,669
In Little House in the Big Woods story

207
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:06,691
did they have paper dolls?

208
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:07,666
- Yes.

209
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,245
- [Kendra] Is this cool to
have your own paper dolls now?

210
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:11,312
- It's like a dream come true.

211
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:14,645
I never had real paper dolls in my life.

212
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,279
- [Kendra] Yeah, look how awesome

213
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,230
you're doing with these too.

214
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,252
There it is.

215
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:23,154
- I had a few mistakes on some

216
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,919
but you can not see them.

217
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,149
- [Kendra] Yeah, that's totally okay.

218
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:27,334
Did you know we're actually gonna

219
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,889
read the next one as a family read-aloud?

220
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:29,722
- Yay!

221
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:33,214
Yay, yay, yay!

222
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,129
(laughter)

223
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:42,193
- I made this picture, it's a house.

224
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:44,144
- [Kendra] What's the house made out of?

225
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,608
- Bricks.

226
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,233
- [Kendra] Oh, how many
bricks do you think

227
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,276
it would take to build a real house?

228
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:52,643
- Let me see how much this one has.

229
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:55,337
- [Kendra] You counting all those bricks?

230
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,287
- It took me 43.

231
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,354
- [Kendra] 43 bricks to build that house?

232
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:00,937
I like your design.

233
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,869
- [Jeremy] Hey big girl,
it's time to wake up.

234
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:09,869
Did you have a good nap?

235
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,304
- [Kendra] Alright, well here's

236
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:13,419
the fall wreath that I chose.

237
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,441
It's not perfect.

238
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:15,973
It's actually nothing like
what I expected to buy

239
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,109
when I went to the store,
but I only had time

240
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,153
in my schedule to go to one store.

241
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:22,034
And I only had 15 minutes
to be in that store.

242
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:25,447
It is perfect because it's done.

243
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,328
That is something that I am
trying to learn in my life

244
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:28,860
as a perfectionist.

245
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,229
A good fall wreath is
better than intending

246
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:33,644
to go out forever and never
actually getting it done.

247
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:36,709
So here it is, our fall
wreath in all of its splendor.

248
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,661
How was ballet?

249
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,031
- It was good.

250
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,308
- [Kendra] I missed you wreath shopping,

251
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:41,840
I could have used your opinion.

252
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,466
- Yeah, I'm really good at shopping.

253
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,557
- [Kendra] You are.

254
00:09:44,557 --> 00:09:46,368
- So tonight Isaac's
scout troop is getting

255
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,737
together for a cookout, a
big barbecue at the park.

256
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:50,199
It smells really good.

257
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,616
(rock music)

258
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,506
- Ignore my messy house behind us

259
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:20,246
and just focus on these awesome boys.

260
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:22,289
They are watching football together.

261
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,193
- It's the Chiefs.

262
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,447
Who they playing?

263
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,632
- The Patriots.

264
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:27,909
- We're losing right now
but there's still hope.

265
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,627
- Seven to 17.

266
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,206
- [Kendra] You tracking the data dude?

267
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:33,373
- Good night, J House out.

268
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,802
- I just had a really, really scary

269
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,101
experience in the parking lot.

270
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:41,684
(upbeat music)

271
00:10:44,720 --> 00:00:00,000
One, two, three.
