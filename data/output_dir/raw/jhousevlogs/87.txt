1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,241
- Do they know where we're going?

2
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:03,074
(lively jazzy music)

3
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:04,750
- [Kendra] We'll be back soon.

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,559
- It's really kind of fun.

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:07,392
- Laura!

6
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:09,979
- Love you.

7
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:11,221
- Bye guys.
- Bye.

8
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,664
- [Kendra] So we're at this
crazy awesome house for a party,

9
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:16,081
and they said we can explore.

10
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,895
- [Jeremy] How'd you
sleep last night buddy?

11
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,815
- Good.

12
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,522
I slept until 7:10, I kept track.

13
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:27,640
- [Jeremy] What did you do to your hair?

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,407
- I braided it last night.

15
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:30,627
- [Jeremy] Very nice.

16
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:33,860
- [Laura] Nae Nae doesn't have any food.

17
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,210
- Do you want some food Nae Nae?

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,043
- [Laura] Yeah.

19
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:38,356
- [Jeremy] Let's get her something yummy.

20
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:41,005
- So basically, nothing about
today is going as planned,

21
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,500
and I'm trying really
hard not to lose my mind.

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,684
I don't know why I make plans,

23
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:47,061
because nothing ever goes
according to those plans.

24
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:48,765
So Jeremy and I are flying out today.

25
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:50,100
We're going on a little trip

26
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,404
and we're really excited about it.

27
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:53,002
Jeremy's Dad, we call him Poppy Rod,

28
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:54,589
is flying in to watch the
kids while we're gone.

29
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:56,643
They're really excited
to see their grandpa,

30
00:00:56,643 --> 00:00:58,619
but Jeremy unfortunately had some stuff

31
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,563
come up at work and he's busy busy working

32
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:02,739
all this morning, and so instead of me

33
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,827
being able to take a shower
while he goes gets his dad,

34
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:06,642
I'm taking all the kids to the airport

35
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:08,142
looking like this.

36
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:10,356
Awesome.

37
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:11,298
Do you want to go?

38
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:12,984
(Janae vocalizing)

39
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:14,662
Let's go get Poppy Rod.

40
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:15,495
Get in the car, baby.
- Da da.

41
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:17,597
- [Kendra] Oh, Dada,
did you just say Dada?

42
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:19,676
- So we got here at the airport,

43
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:21,876
so now we're looking for Poppy Rod.

44
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:23,785
It's really kind of funny.

45
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:27,681
- I'm excited that
Poppy Rod is gonna come.

46
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:29,396
- I'm really excited to see him.

47
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:32,351
And also I'm excited to talk to him

48
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,294
about Fantasy Football.

49
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,935
- I'm really excited
that Poppy Rod is coming,

50
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:38,791
because I can also talk to him

51
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,657
about Fantasy Football,
even though I'm not

52
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:43,417
doing it this year, I can still keep

53
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,367
on track of Fantasy Football.

54
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:46,872
- I see him.
- Poppy Rod!

55
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,512
- [Caleb] I see him!

56
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:50,761
- I see you guys.

57
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:53,217
- Get out, Lise unbuckle it.

58
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:54,134
- Hi buddy.

59
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:55,857
- [Kendra] They're all excited.

60
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:57,986
- It's cold out here,
I need to get in there.

61
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:00,077
- [Kendra] It is cold, get in here.

62
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,709
There he is, Poppy Rod.
- Yay!

63
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,202
- [Kendra] They're all excited.

64
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:06,044
- How are ya?

65
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:06,877
Ahhh!

66
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:08,670
Laura!

67
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,205
Lise, you can't sneak by me, no way.

68
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,563
Ahhh!

69
00:02:15,563 --> 00:02:17,017
- [Isaac] Who made this mess?
(bright music)

70
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:18,231
- [Jeremy] Thanks for cleaning up.

80

- Yay.

81
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,872
- [Jeremy] So Isaac, what's been happening

82
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:38,961
with Fantasy Football?

83
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:42,961
- Well, I barely made the
playoffs by .3 points.

84
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,845
- [Jeremy] Yeah, we had
to take down Poppy Rod.

85
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,990
- .3 points.
- It just barely happened.

86
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,783
- [Jeremy] But Isaac is in the finals.

87
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:52,616
- Yep.

88
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:53,980
- [Jeremy] There's only four teams left,

89
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,458
and we'll keep you updated on how it goes.

90
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,305
- And one of them is Isaac.

91
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:59,093
- [Jeremy] And Caleb just can't
wait to do this next year.

92
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:00,510
- Yeah I'm doing it next year.
- He's so excited.

93
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,343
- I'm already playing.

94
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,439
- I'm gonna miss you.

95
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,030
(groans)

96
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,635
- Give me a hug!

97
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:12,385
- See you guys later.

98
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:16,465
- I don't want you to go.

99
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,157
- [Kendra] It's a short trip kiddos.

100
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,451
We'll be back soon.
- We'll be back soon.

101
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:20,451
- [Kendra] And you guys
are gonna have way more fun

102
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,480
with Poppy Rod.

103
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,786
Well there's the real reason
they're gonna miss us.

104
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:26,355
(Janae coughing)
- Let me hug the baby.

105
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:30,172
- [Jeremy] Oh (laughs),
that's how she says goodbye.

106
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:31,025
- Okay, one kiss.

107
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,108
- [Isaac] Can I hold her?

108
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:35,722
- [All] Bye!

109
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:37,021
- We're waving.

110
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:38,845
- [Kendra] Have fun, bye.

111
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:39,857
- I forgot my jacket.

112
00:03:39,857 --> 00:03:41,498
- [Kendra] You're gonna
need it, it's cold.

113
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:42,415
Bye kiddos.

114
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:46,036
Thanks Lise.

115
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:46,975
- Love you.

116
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,648
- Bye guys.

117
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,231
(gentle music)

118
00:03:53,355 --> 00:03:54,491
Well the sky is beautiful

119
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:58,324
and that is a beautiful
reminder to chill out.

120
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:02,391
We had a really honestly stressful morning

121
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:04,454
and then it came down to crunch time,

122
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,215
you know, trying to shower

123
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:07,599
and pack and get out the door,

124
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,127
and the kids were kind
of jumping off the walls.

125
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:12,097
And I'm so grateful for Jeremy's dad

126
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:12,930
that he's here.

127
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,189
It was just stressful
for me to say goodbye,

128
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,022
but it all worked out.

129
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,797
I need to get better at that.

130
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:21,094
I need to get better at finding peace

131
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,709
during the chaotic moments,

132
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,421
because I tend to feel the chaos

133
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:25,589
and the anxiety and then afterwards

134
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,400
I'm like oh it all worked out.

135
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,577
I just need to get better
at feeling that peace

136
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,299
in the midst of the storms.

137
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:34,001
- Do they know where we're going?

138
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,343
- I don't think I told
them yet where we're going.

139
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,565
(playful suspenseful music)

140
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:39,677
- Jeremy's excited.

141
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:42,149
This is like a bucket list item for him.

142
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,484
- You know how sometimes there's people

143
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,897
you watch on YouTube, and you're like,

144
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,488
it'd be fun to meet them.

145
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,912
That's how I feel right now.

146
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:52,688
- He has been wanting to hang out

147
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:55,874
with these YouTubers for a long time.

148
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:58,697
This pre-dates most of our YouTubeness.

149
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,242
Where we're going.

150
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,833
- Oh yeah, before it was even on YouTube,

151
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,666
I was a fan of this.

152
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,969
- Yes and long before we were on YouTube.

153
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,542
This is like years before
we were on YouTube.

154
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,074
So Jeremy's gonna be a little
bit of a fanboy this weekend,

155
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:10,907
- Yep.

156
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:13,068
- and I'm along for a crazy ride.

157
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:15,985
(funky beat music)

158
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,405
She's ready to go.

159
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,596
- [Jeremy] We're at B-10.

160
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,223
I never forget where we're at.

161
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,544
- It's always good to
have a little reminder.

162
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,960
(playful music)

163
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,847
- [Jeremy] So they have little heaters,

164
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,744
where we're waiting for the bus.

165
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:36,678
- Thankfully because it's cold.

166
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:37,712
We made it through security.

167
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,393
And we just have about five minutes

168
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:42,570
until we start boarding and
poor Jeremy is so hungry,

169
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,889
so we are going to try to find some food,

170
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,738
before we get on the plane.

171
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:46,989
He found a salad.

172
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:48,600
- I was hoping for like a Whopper

173
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,415
or a big hamburger and
fries, but this will do.

174
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:52,366
- I just freaked Jeremy out,

175
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:53,199
I'm like do you have the camera?

176
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,077
He's like no, and I'm like
well I don't have the camera,

177
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:56,666
and I'm looking all over for it.

178
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,969
Guess where we found it?

179
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:00,074
- In Kendra's hand.

180
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:01,639
- Not even in my bag,
- She was holding it.

181
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,412
- it was in my hand.
- Nope, in my hand.

182
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:06,774
- Anyway, okay Janae, are
you ready for a flight?

183
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:08,859
Say, I'm gonna sleep.

184
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:12,026
(jazzy festive music)

185
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:27,548
So this flight was actually a little rough

186
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:29,973
for Janae, she is tired.

187
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,373
Our plane landed and there's a problem,

188
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:34,816
with, is it the jerry?

189
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:35,696
- The jetway?

190
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,505
- The jetway, like the
thing that you walk through

191
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:38,338
to get off the plane,

192
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:39,908
there's a problem with it
and so we've been waiting

193
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,872
for a little bit, like maybe 20 minutes.

194
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,066
- There's gonna move us to a different--

195
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:46,321
- So now we're all sitting
back down and packing back up,

196
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:50,017
and moving to a different gate
soon to get out of the plane.

197
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:52,202
Not a big deal, unless you're a fussy

198
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:54,297
nine month old baby who's tired.

199
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:56,722
- But this is gonna make
us more late to the party

200
00:06:56,722 --> 00:06:57,657
that we got to get to.

201
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:00,237
- 'Cause we're going to a party.

202
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:03,391
Yay, we're getting off the plane.

203
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:04,974
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae.

204
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,396
Hey (laughs).

205
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,507
Hey little stink bug.

206
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:13,424
(enchanting music)

207
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,663
- So the most important
thing you guys need

208
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:21,431
to know right now is about
this little button right here.

209
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:25,347
My bum is nicely warmed, toasted perhaps.

210
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:27,404
- I have a warm seat.

211
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:29,236
- So we are headed to a party.

212
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:30,659
Guys, we are so excited.

213
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,044
We are in Utah,

214
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,252
and we are going to be filming a video

215
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:37,211
with Studio C, which
Jeremy is a big fan boy of.

216
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,794
(upbeat music)

217
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:45,336
- I love Studio C.

218
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:46,169
- So, we're also gonna be hanging out

219
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,820
with some other YouTubers,
it's gonna be an epic video,

220
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,866
and tomorrow's the shoot
and tonight's the party,

221
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,527
so we'll see you there.

222
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:55,194
(uptempo music)

223
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:57,622
It's dark out and it's freezing,

224
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:58,998
but we are at the coolest place

225
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:00,542
for this party tonight.

226
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,792
This place has like a moat.

227
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:08,758
- Wow.

228
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:10,688
A climbing wall.

229
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:13,283
They said we could go look
at the master bedroom.

230
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,727
- So basically I get
to go on a house tour,

231
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,675
which I love.

232
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:18,123
- We're coming into the office.

233
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,416
Wow.

234
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,416
(atmospheric music)

235
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,391
- [Kendra] Is this the master bathroom?

236
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:27,224
- [Jeremy] I think so.

237
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:30,036
The toilet has magical
powers it looks like.

238
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,094
(Kendra laughs)

239
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,400
- Those are the weirdest toilets.

240
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,264
- [Jeremy] And I think the
toilets are warming up the seat,

241
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,600
because they know we're nearby.

242
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,258
I don't know, I'm guessing.
- Whoa.

243
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:41,967
- So I just had the best experience.

244
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,734
The hotel receptionist made my day.

245
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,830
Like she was just so nice and friendly

246
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,911
and sometimes I think we
have to do like these amazing

247
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,983
things to make a difference
in peoples' lives,

248
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,688
but we just have to be nice to each other.

249
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,191
- Thank you nice receptionist lady

250
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:57,952
for making our day.

251
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:59,191
- It's the little things.

252
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,087
J House out.

253
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:02,191
- I had to really bend down and push

254
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,868
with my legs to walk.

255
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:05,620
If only you could find a
jolly man with a beard.

256
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,228
- He's downstairs.

257
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:09,377
- There is it.
- Beautiful.

258
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:11,091
- The last step is the star.

259
00:09:11,091 --> 00:00:00,000
(bright festive music)
