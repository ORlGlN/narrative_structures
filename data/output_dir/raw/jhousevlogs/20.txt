00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,530
♪ Eh eh eh eh ♪

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,010
- So the boys were just
looking out the window

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,384
and they think they
see a bobcat on a tree.

4
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:12,967
(bright music)

5
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:17,406
There's that noise,
stop making that noise.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,030
- Hey.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,350
I miss you.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,660
She's walking so much
in just the little time

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,648
I've been gone.

10
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:27,470
- Good morning.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,700
I don't feel good this morning.

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,800
I have a headache.

13
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:33,270
I think I'm just tired.

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,025
- I helped Mom since she has a headache,

15
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:37,760
I made her bed.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,610
- [Kendra] That was so sweet of you.

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,930
- Today's a great day,

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,739
because Jeremy's gonna come home.

19
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,290
(lively music)

20
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,620
So I'm a big fan of hot yummy breakfasts,

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,380
so we're making French toast this morning.

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,310
Poll question, do you like
to have a hot breakfast

23
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,070
or just a quick and easy
cold cereal breakfast,

24
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,640
let us know up here.

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,060
French toast.

26
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,460
Alright Elise, what's your
favorite breakfast food?

27
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,920
- Breakfast cake.

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,290
- My favorite is French toast.

29
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,980
- [Kendra] You like that one the best?

30
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,813
Okay how about you,

31
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:08,850
what's your favorite breakfast?

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,760
- French toast.

33
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:13,578
(funky beat music)

34
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,380
- So I came to breakfast this morning,

35
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,660
got some French pancakes
and I'm getting ready

36
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,600
for my last day here in San Diego.

37
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,440
So I'm actually here at
the Children's Museum,

38
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,130
in San Diego, walking by it.

39
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,820
This is where the kids were painting,

40
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,660
and making Play-Doh.

41
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,140
Seeing all these places
brings back such good memories

42
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,707
from our trip in San Diego.

43
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:36,790
(upbeat jazzy music)

44
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:49,740
- So the boys were just
looking out the window

45
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,110
and they think they
see a bobcat on a tree.

46
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,480
- We don't know yet if
it's our neighbor's cat

47
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,760
or a bobcat.

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,820
It's huge.

49
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,138
It's huge.

50
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:01,450
- It might be a wild cat,

51
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,370
but it could be like a
lynx, a bobcat or something.

52
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,827
- [Caleb] What if it's a bobcat?

53
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:08,419
- [Kendra] So there's the
cat they're talking about.

54
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,959
Guys I think it might
just be a neighbor's cat.

55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,730
- [Isaac] Well then it has to be huge.

56
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,860
- [Kendra] It is a pretty big cat.

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,000
Janae do you see any animals out there?

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,250
So now that you can see it up closer,

59
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,370
what do you think?

60
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,240
- It's bigger, so I bet
it's not a neighbor's cat.

61
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,910
I bet it's probably just a wild cat.

62
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,690
- [Kendra] Do you think it's a bobcat?

63
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,819
- Actually not, because
bobcats are more dark,

64
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,760
in my opinion, but it could be.

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,670
- [Kendra] What do you think it is,

66
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,227
do you see it out there?

67
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:39,060
- I think,

68
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:45,970
It's really big because

69
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,440
it might be warning us
and it might be excited.

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,744
- [Kendra] Yeah?

71
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:54,911
(bright guitar music)

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,930
So where's Daddy been?

73
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,915
- At San Diego.

74
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:04,794
- [Kendra] Yeah?

75
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:06,410
- I miss him.

76
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,410
- [Kendra] What do you think
he's doing in San Diego?

77
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,430
- Going places to eat with friends.

78
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,630
- So we are at the restaurant.

79
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,128
I'm here with Dan from What's Inside.

80
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:19,970
- How's it going guys?

81
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,840
- And we're at the restaurant

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,910
where Tom Cruise sang
at the piano in Top gun.

83
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,310
It's just kind of a side
bonus of being here.

84
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,143
- Have you guys seen Top Gun?

85
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:28,810
A lot of our audience
probably is too young

86
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,820
to ever have seen Top Gun.

87
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,610
- There we go, poll question for the day,

88
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,500
have you seen Top Gun?

89
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,016
Let us know in the poll.

90
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,780
♪ Goodness gracious, great balls of fire ♪

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,220
- We finished the puzzle.

92
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,320
- [Kendra] I loved doing one,

93
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,840
it was really fun.

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,364
- But there's that one bad thing.

95
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:46,062
We lost a piece.
- Yeah.

96
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:49,020
- [Kendra] We lost one piece.

97
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,130
So the very first day

98
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,780
when we were sorting the pieces,

99
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,990
from edges and middles,

100
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,320
Laura helped us.

101
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,040
And I have a sneaky suspicion.

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,223
Do you know where the puzzle piece is?

103
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:00,056
- No.

104
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,080
- [Kendra] This was such a fun puzzle,

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,840
because there were so
many different patterns.

106
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,040
So it was a lot of pieces,

107
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,770
but it wasn't super hard.

108
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,040
- I think my last piece was that one.

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,873
- [Kendra] That's a good one.

110
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:10,956
Feels so good to put in the last piece.

111
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:14,012
- I put in a few of these pieces.

112
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:14,845
- [Kendra] Yeah you did.

113
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:16,209
So this is our next puzzle Elise

114
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,042
and I are gonna do.

115
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,500
She's kinda my puzzle buddy.

116
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,769
Are you our puzzle buddy too?

117
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,719
- Uh-huh.

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,960
- [Kendra] I think the sand
could be really challenging.

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,260
I'm a little bit nervous about it.

120
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,250
- 'Cause it's the exact same.

121
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,083
- [Kendra] Yeah.

122
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:27,970
What are you two working on?

123
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,390
- Well just the tree house.

124
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,740
- [Kendra] You're sanding these branches?

125
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,610
- We have to make wood,

126
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,240
since we don't really have
any long pieces of wood,

127
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,570
so we decided to do this.

128
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,250
- [Kendra] Working hard.

129
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,830
- So see how I made the top a little flat?

130
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,663
- [Kendra] Yeah.

131
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,690
- And then see how I made the sides flat?

132
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,887
- [Kendra] Yeah, wow,
that's a lot of work.

133
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:54,330
- So that's why tree
houses take a lot of work

134
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,987
if you want to make it from scratch.

135
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:58,360
(laughing)

136
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,030
- So the reason I come
to these conferences

137
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,300
on social media is that this space

138
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,900
is so new, it's like the wild west.

139
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,020
To be able to get together
with people who have experience

140
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,860
and are learning things,

141
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,140
I just love learning all the time,

142
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,510
it makes a business, what
we're doing on YouTube,

143
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,218
and with the law practice

144
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:14,550
and the relationships that I build

145
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,400
are probably the most important thing.

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,120
- So I feel like Janae has transitioned

147
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,610
from a baby to a toddler

148
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,160
in the few days that Jeremy has been gone.

149
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,370
When he left she was crawling
more than she was walking.

150
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,470
And now she's walking
more than she's crawling.

151
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,540
She also just committed
her first act of mischief,

152
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,373
check this out.

153
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:30,290
She grabbed a pencil,

154
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,960
climbed up on the fireplace
ledge and colored.

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,390
I looked over there and she
was so proud of herself.

156
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,900
She was grinning, like check me out,

157
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,733
I'm such a big girl.

158
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,960
And I'm like, oh my goodness,

159
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,410
I'm tired already,
thinking about everything

160
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,690
that she's gonna get into this year.

161
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,670
Yes, you colored right there.

162
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,920
Should we clean it up?

163
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,270
Should we get a rag and clean it up?

164
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,920
Uh-oh, we're pooping, we're busy.

165
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,880
Oh, do you see shoes?

166
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,009
Oh she saw a shoe, she's coming for it.

167
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:02,842
(Janae vocalizing)

168
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:05,420
Oh there's the jackpot of shoes.

169
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,810
It's the shoe bin.

170
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,180
- I had a great time at the conference.

171
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,570
It was fun to get to speak

172
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,870
and to share some of the
experiences we've had.

173
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,906
But I'm excited to get home
and see the kids and Kendra.

174
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:18,180
(upbeat music)

175
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,670
- So to be honest, today
has been quite a rough day.

176
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,300
And the problem today has been me.

177
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm struggling with a lot
of anxiety and grumpiness

178
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,170
and I'm just easily irritable.

179
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,430
Like I feel all of my
sense are heightened.

180
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,290
I'm like oh my gosh, that noise,

181
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,860
stop making that noise kids.

182
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,890
I'm feeling really grateful

183
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,380
that Jeremy is coming home tonight.

184
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,870
He's actually been gone for a couple days.

185
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,890
I didn't film all the
days when he was gone.

186
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,723
We just miss him,

187
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:46,720
so we're really excited.

188
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,700
He's getting home in the
middle of the night tonight

189
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,380
and tomorrow morning it'll be so nice

190
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,030
to have him here with us.

191
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,510
(chill atmospheric music)

192
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:26,428
♪ Eh eh eh eh ha ha ha ha ♪

193
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,715
- [Kendra] Are you guys
staring at each other?

194
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,690
- Yeah.

195
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,960
- I'm gonna try to make
it so I don't look down.

196
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,793
- Oh boy.

197
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,240
- [Kendra] You're doing awesome.

198
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,073
On days like today,

199
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:39,200
I'm so grateful for the pretty weather.

200
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,630
'Cause when the kids can get outside

201
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,710
and I can feel the sunshine,

202
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,460
it feels like everything
just that much better.

203
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,712
Hi Nae Nae.

204
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:47,962
(wind chimes clinking)

205
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,430
So Isaac just ran inside and was like,

206
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,140
Mom, I just invented a new sport.

207
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,200
And I'm like oh, what sport?

208
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,560
And he said swing dancing.

209
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,800
And I'm like that's actually a thing,

210
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,200
I've actually swing danced.

211
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,510
And he's like really?

212
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,180
And I said yeah, like you have a partner

213
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,200
and you're dancing.

214
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,430
And he's like no Mom, dancing on a swing.

215
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,730
So I'm gonna come see what they

216
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,700
have created as swing dancing.

217
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:13,760
(playful music)

218
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,440
A synchronized swing dancing routine?

219
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,120
- I did it.

220
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,953
I did it.

221
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:31,510
- [Kendra] Whoa, that's complex.

222
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,003
- Yes, I did it.

223
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:34,140
Whoa.

224
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,807
(Kendra laughs)

225
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:38,488
I did it.

226
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,009
- [Kendra] I think you
gotta go all the way

227
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,270
from one side to the other side Lise,

228
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,410
let's see your best cartwheel.

229
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,660
Laura, stand to the side.

230
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:48,578
- [Janae] Ha good job.

231
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:49,961
- Did you just say good job?

232
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:50,810
- Mmm-hmm.

233
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,390
- So I'm ordering pizza for dinner tonight

234
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,910
and I just pulled up one on the screen

235
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,530
and what did you think
it had inside of it?

236
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,690
- Worms.

237
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,280
- Do you really thing that
I would order a worm pizze?

238
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,360
- Yeah.

239
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,225
- No I would not.

240
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,350
- It actually was worms.

241
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,800
- I had a pizza up on the screen

242
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,830
that had peppers on it.

243
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,560
And apparently she thought in the picture

244
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,610
it looked like worms.

245
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:15,600
Lydia are you painting her fingernails?

246
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,990
Well the kids are having
fun with their friends.

247
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,530
They're exploring in the woods,

248
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,690
they're playing sports,

249
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,810
they're doing all kinds of silly stuff.

250
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,750
And Janae just wants to get down

251
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,079
and do it all with them.

252
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:25,912
(Janae vocalizing)

253
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:27,504

We finished off the night with pizza

270
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,220
and a movie.

271
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,880

Jeremy's home and I'm so happy he's home.

I really missed the family.

278

- He's losing his mind a little bit.

279
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:40,280
- Let's go to bed.

280
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,140
- Goodnight.

281
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,140
