00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:05,486
- [Jeremy] ♫ Dun, dun,
da-dun, dun, dun, da-dun,

2
00:00:05,486 --> 00:00:06,319
♫ Hey!

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,486
♫ Dun, dun, da-dun, dun, dun,
da-dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

4
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:14,858
♫ Miss Laura you

5
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:17,616
♫ are so stinking cute

6
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:20,340
♫ I adore ya, missus Laura

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,400
♫ You're so beautiful, boo!

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,067
(playful music)

9
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,802
- So Kendra was just telling
me that she has a close friend

10
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:56,521
who thinks they might be
pregnant when they weren't trying

11
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,702
to be pregnant and they're
concerned about that.

12
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:00,524
Let's just get your little face in here.

13
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:04,691
And I told her it reminded
me of this time recently

14
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:09,101
when Kendra, well you
tell them this story.

15
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,205
- I played such a good joke on him!

16
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,324
- Oh my gosh, it was not...

17
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:16,157
- I played such a good
joke on you! I got him!

18
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:20,663
So, what was it, a couple weeks ago?

19
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,339
- We were painting the deck.

20
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:24,139
- Yeah, so it was relatively recent.

21
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:27,898
And I tend to feel sick
even before I get a positive

22
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:30,248
pregnancy test in my experiences.

23
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:33,813
And I had had a few days of
just, like, not feeling great.

24
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,423
So I was getting worried. Right?

25
00:01:35,423 --> 00:01:36,751
- Oh no, well and I was like...

26
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:37,584
- Anyway...

27
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:38,838
- "Have you done a pregnancy test?"

28
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:40,879
And she was like, "I probably should."

29
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,726
- So, anyway, that was at
the point he's out painting

30
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:45,408
the deck and I go in.

31
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:46,741
And, um, anyway.

32
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:50,770
I pulled an old positive pregnancy test...

33
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,613
- Oh my gosh.

34
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:55,010
- From Laura, I had stuffed
it in the side of a drawer

35
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,597
and I still had it there.

36
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:58,687
And I didn't know if I did
still have it so I pulled it out

37
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:01,865
and I kind of laughed
to myself. I was like,

38
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,435
"this is gonna be good!"

39
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:07,011
- So I'm out painting, I'm
you know, painting the deck.

40
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,235
- And, anyway, I hand the
pregnancy test to Caleb

41
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:14,690
and I say, "go tell daddy that
mommy has a surprise for him"

42
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,327
'cause I knew if I went out
I would just bust up and

43
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,181
it wouldn't work.

44
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:23,600
So I come in and I'm working
on something in the kitchen

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,476
where I can see the deck, and
Caleb goes out and he says...

46
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:28,975
What does he say? I wasn't out there.

47
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:31,799
- He, you know, "Daddy, this is from mom,"

48
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:33,275
something like that, you know.

49
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,587
And I grab it.

50
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:38,513
And I take a second to read it

51
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:41,452
and I'm analyzing and I'm like, "no way!"

52
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,810
And I turn around and
Kendra is in the kitchen

53
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,570
but she's not watching me,
she's like doing something.

54
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,138
- And I turn around and I
see him and he's just still.

55
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,201
Just staring at it.

56
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,885
- I'm not expecting
currently to have a baby.

57
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,343
That's important to the story.

58
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,240
- Right now.

59
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,878
- Yeah, I don't want a baby right now.

60
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:04,001
So I was pretty surprised
and pretty shocked.

61
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,971
- We feel like our four
little babies keep us

62
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:07,406
busy enough right now.

63
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:10,669
- Yeah, and if you've been
watching this, you can see that.

64
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:13,443
- It's true. Caleb alone, Caleb alone.

65
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,798
- So, I came in, I don't
remember what you said.

66
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:18,354
- I don't remember either.

67
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:20,619
How do we not remember the punch line?

68
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:24,671
- The punch line was, oh
my gosh, and then you--

69
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,854
- And, anyway, I think Jeremy
said something along the lines

70
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:30,840
of "this is positive!

71
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,753
"This is..."

72
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,971
And I'm like "yeah, it is!"

73
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:35,134
Because it is a positive pregnancy test.

74
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:38,176
It's just not from this moment in time.

75
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,532
And he was like "oh my
gosh, oh my gosh..."

76
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:45,650
And I said, "gotcha!"
And he was just floored.

77
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,389
Anyway, twenty minutes later,
he's still standing out on

78
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,540
the deck, like zoned out.

79
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,958
It's like, "I got you so good!"

80
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,970
Anyway, every wife has to
pull that prank on their

81
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,862
husband at some point and
I got such a good time.

82
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:01,173
It was so believable. I got him!

83
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:02,758
- Yeah.

84
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:03,623
- I got him.

85
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:06,194
- It confirmed, though, that I
currently do not want a baby.

86
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:07,724
Like those emotions and feelings.

87
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,457
Like I was trying to be super positive.

88
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,944
But I was just like, "Hey,
yeah. Another baby..."

89
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:18,625
- And when I asked, he's like,
"well I was happy but..."

90
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,458
- Yeah.

91
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:23,625
- Anyway, and I, what was I
gonna say? It just left me...

92
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,627
It was just really funny. Later that day,

93
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:28,496
like multiple times that
day, and the next day

94
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:31,189
I was just remembered it
and I just laughed so hard

95
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,565
and I just, I got you! I got you!

96
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,206
- Maybe it's still to close
to home, like it was...

97
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:38,054
She got me really good.

98
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:41,308
- He actually believed
me. It wasn't just...

99
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:44,487
Like I effectively
pulled the prank on you.

100
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,075
- Oh completely. She got me.

101
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:47,732
- Yes! Nailed it!

102
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:50,771
- Not cool. Throw away
those old pregnancy tests.

103
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,369
That is not cool.

104
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:53,977
(Kendra laughs)

105
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:56,294
- [Jeremy] So Caleb was out
of our sight for how long?

106
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:58,340
- Seriously, was it two seconds?

107
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,061
- [Jeremy] Two seconds.
This is what happens.

108
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,891
It's so difficult!

109
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:06,224
So we leave him alone for like a second.

110
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,782
He's been into everything this morning.

111
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:12,683
Oh, he's gonna get green
all over everything.

112
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:15,171
- Say "goodbye daddy".

113
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:19,740
- ♫ Twinkle, twinkle, little star

114
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,964
♫ How I wonder what you are.

115
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:28,293
♫ Up above the world so high,

116
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:32,519
♫ Like a diamond in the sky.

117
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,696
♫ Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

118
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:39,904
♫ How I wonder what you are.

119
00:05:39,904 --> 00:00:00,000
(playful music)
