00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,820
question number<font color="#E5E5E5"> three dear DeLaGhetto</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a junior in high school I had two</font>

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,180
boyfriends I've never been with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy</font>

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,620
for over a month this is bugging me

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,610
because I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a long-term</font>

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,530
relationship but I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose feelings</font>

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,090
for the guy every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> they try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,830
a move my normal reactions are to avoid

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,510
people say I'm leading them on which I

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,490
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean to the same hard to get but</font>

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,109
the deal is I'm afraid I'll have some

perfectly natural you know I'm saying

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,300
especially at 16 to not want to

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,739
necessarily happen to a hardcore

18
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,270
relationship yet I mean my personal

because a lot can<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen between the</font>
