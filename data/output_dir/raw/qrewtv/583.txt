is the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> underrated player in the NBA</font>

134
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,060
honestly first of all Steph<font color="#CCCCCC"> Curry I just</font>

135
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,620
seen the highlights of the shots he took

136
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,690
like he tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a foul and he threw</font>

138
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't mind my hair right now Steph Curry</font>

139
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going for back-to-back MVPs and if</font>

143
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,010
these numbers he's putting up and also

144
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,110
James Harden of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> is always going</font>

145
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be really close to second place</font>

146
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's always second place with</font>

147
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,780
shouts out to James Harden anyway who do

151
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,380
as a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't they overlook</font>

152
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,450
his what he can do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of they think</font>

153
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,160
he's funny how they take him<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a joke</font>

154
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,510
but I think Chris Bosh is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

155
