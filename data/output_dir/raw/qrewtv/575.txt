43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,870
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my theory I want the Warriors to</font>

44
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,000
get the record I do you know I was

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,860
supporting them last season Bay Area

46
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,870
native but I want Kobe to end I know

47
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,490
this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be his last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> season so</font>

48
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,200
everyone's saying he's fallen off he's

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,880
not doing good i wanted to have one last

50
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,730
game where he<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into his legacy</font>

51
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,990
you know what I'm saying so he can

52
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,580
prevent the warriors from because

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,900
getting the record you know they tied it

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,210
that's good enough you know so hopefully

55
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can do it but anyway we're gonna go</font>

56
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,620
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> copies i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> season I know I hope it i</font>

57
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,360
hope it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> his last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> season just because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want him to retire injured the</font>

59
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,860
thing is he said I he said that if

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,840
if nothing changes then the knee eyes

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,240
this is it for me basically that's what

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,010
he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sammy hope I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

64
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,959
