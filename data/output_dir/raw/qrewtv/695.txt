live alone so um she doesn't work so I'm

304
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,059
the one supporting her so I mean I have

305
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,499
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wake up every day and I have to get</font>

306
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:17,819
my butt up off that bed and I have to go

307
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work I have to get some money and</font>

308
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,169
have to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she has a plate</font>

309
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,389
of food on the table every night so

310
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:27,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's kind of where it goes for me how</font>

311
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">about you</font>

312
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,580
with me man it's it's it gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font>

313
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,280
at times with YouTube because you know

314
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,530
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent like I said</font>

315
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,870
earlier and you have to put out great

316
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,210
content in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep your supporters</font>

317
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,940
happy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um what motivates me I mean</font>

318
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,500

319
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,870
opportunities and knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I reached</font>

320
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,400
out to so many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the past few</font>

321
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,050
years so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main thing</font>

322
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,580
when I get out of bed is either I could

323
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,940
be lazy or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

324
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,830
and putting smile on people's faces or

325
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,020
if I am lazy you know someone else can

326
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,760
come into that what I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

327
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,070
my spot so that's manually one of the

328
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,260
biggest motivations for me and on top of

329
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,360
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely you know trying to</font>

330
