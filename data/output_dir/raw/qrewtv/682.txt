me and I feel like I'd be in better

70
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,350
shape and I'd be more focused instead of

71
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,660
worrying about other people's tweets and

72
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,450

00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,490
like getting back into that has lessened

114
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,530
my spending money on sneakers and things

115
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,970
like that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't been paying as</font>

116

much attention to sneakers as I used to

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,530
being a sneaker it does cause something

122
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,360
but never going to get over sneakers

123
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,720
