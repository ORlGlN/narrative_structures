SummerSlam so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you my</font>

190
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,010
SummerSlam predictions as well I believe

191
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Undertaker will be Brock Lesnar in</font>

192
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,690
the main event I believe John Cena will

193
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">beat Seth Rollins in the WWE</font>

194
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,420
Championship a match but i have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

195
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,810
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won Seth Rollins to win I feel</font>

196
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,940
like J&J security and Kane are going to

197
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,040
return to help him win I still think

198
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">John Cena's going to come out on top I</font>

199
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,430
think Sheamus is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be Randy Orion</font>

200
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,410
as much as I want and you want to beat

201
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,959
Sheamus I don't think Sheamus is going

202
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,240
to cash in so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> my Summer Sun</font>

203
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,240
