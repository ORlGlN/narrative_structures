9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,619
first off you guys know yesterday's vlog

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,510
was depressing as hell if you didn't

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,430
watch it go watch it these are fake a

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,869
company tried to send them to me

13
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,430
basically he was saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,320
fake and I don't know what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,269
about and that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pairs that come</font>

16
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,800
out are going to be just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this the</font>

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,000
main thing that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out of</font>

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is for you guys to see don't</font>

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,840
just buy off of every website<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,730
it's a trusted website or if you do buy

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,469
make sure you do get an authentic check

22
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,829
before you rock it or you know try to

23
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,510
show it off and people make fun of you

24
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,190
it's just personal preference like

25
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,840
obviously not<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody cares about</font>

26
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,940
wearing figs but a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get</font>

27
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,410
worried about wearing fake so I just

28
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,300
want to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys know and a lot of</font>

29
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">people actually tweet DM me and email me</font>

30
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,440
asking to legit check their shoes I

31
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,690
don't reply because through pictures

32
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,250
it's kind of hard to confirm whether or

33
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">not and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to be responsible</font>

34
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,280
for that so I'm gonna make a video soon

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,920

36
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,750
can spot fakes like for instance

37
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,549
