want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be publicly announced or not and</font>

17
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:06,190
more times than none they say no because

19
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,670
people harassing them or whatever you'll

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,380

they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> win and they'll start</font>

22
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,289
tweeting the person that that does win

23
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,759

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,399
and whatnot so sorry to the people who

25
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,590
