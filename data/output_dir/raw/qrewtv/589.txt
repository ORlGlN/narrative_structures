32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,430
seasons of the NBA like when Lakers are

33
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,830
still on<font color="#CCCCCC"> top every team had one good</font>

34
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,630

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,950
whole movie took place in three

179
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,060
different days over a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 year span or 15</font>

180
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,250

<font color="#CCCCCC">so sometimes in the neighborhood itself</font>

189
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,240
there's no parking so I gotta park on

190
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,940
the street wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> early and go move my</font>
