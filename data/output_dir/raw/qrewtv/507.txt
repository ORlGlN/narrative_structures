so just uploaded crew<font color="#CCCCCC"> kicks and I'm not</font>

98
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,759
uploading a vlog today and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

99
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,020
for that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because yesterday I</font>

100
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,909
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do much so I don't have</font>

101
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,310
too much footage and that basically is

102
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,139
the deciding factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of whether i upload</font>

103
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,699
a vlog or not it's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

104
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,129
before and what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have enough footage</font>

105
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,750
for that day because sometimes i feel

106
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,129
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want to upload a vlog if</font>

107
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,650
it's just me talking for five hours kind

108
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,629

128
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,340
got three trash bags from the kitchen

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:25,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got to throw out what's up this</font>

130
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,889
is why you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> text and drive people</font>

131
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm guilty so I drove all the way to</font>

132
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,660
Santa Monica and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally looked</font>

133
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,669
up the address for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Shake Shack and</font>

134
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:35,830
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Santa Monica Boulevard</font>

135
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,560
but it's in Hollywood which is really

136
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,300
closer to where I live so basically I

137
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,650
drove all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to Santa Monica for</font>

138
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,260
nothing so now i'm stuck in LA traffic

139
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,070
like always what is this fam

140
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,889
this is way too long this guy bought

141
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,289
hella

142
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,249
this is a Yeezy line or shake shack line

143
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:01,229
all of a sudden vlog camera alright<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

144
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,270
so shake shack wasn't meant to be even

145
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">though I drove</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way from over</font>

146
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:06,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">here I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to wait in a line</font>

147
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,699
with 200 people for a burger I'm gonna

148
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,169
wait till it dies<font color="#CCCCCC"> down a couple days</font>

149
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:12,479
maybe it was meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be because now i'm</font>

150
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,979
at subway<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge</font>

151
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,599
downgrade<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look obviously</font>

152
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,099
as good but maybe it's a sign and

153
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,289
another sign is at my fit foods which

154
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:24,270
