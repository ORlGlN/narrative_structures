00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">dad's video about the time he died and I</font>

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,599
figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something that I could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,130
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> too because you know I remember</font>

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly when this happened actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,320
it's sort of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an agreed standpoint</font>

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I went to wrestling the night</font>

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,449
before he went into surgery<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't we</font>

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,740
didn't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was gonna be such a</font>

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,570
major surgery the doctor told us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">he'd be in and out he'd be home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the day or the next day or so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,149
said he would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a day to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recover</font>

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,070
and he would come home so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't know</font>

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,320
it was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a major surgery so I</font>

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,739
went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raw on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Columbia the night before</font>

18
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,930

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,739
was in October<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 2000 2006 I think</font>

20
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">2000 say it was something it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,109
2006<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this happened and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know he</font>

22
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,840
goes through the surgery<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah he got a</font>

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,870
bypass surgery<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he was younger and</font>

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,479
hernia<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it sort of protruding out and</font>

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,060
so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad off and we finally</font>

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">found somebody who would do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surgery</font>

30
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he did the surgery</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and died on the</font>
