00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,770
because it's epic and really getting

97
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,959
into the storyline of it which is

98
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,010
strange because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never fought with an</font>

99
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,910
adventure map or would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

100
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,100

101
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,200
what's going up next<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff and what</font>

102
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,040

103
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you know what's what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

104
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,400
