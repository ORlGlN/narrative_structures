the commentary because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally find</font>

72
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,080
it more entertaining to<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch rather</font>

73
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,340
than just wait in all the time and

74
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,110
changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from like saying a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>
