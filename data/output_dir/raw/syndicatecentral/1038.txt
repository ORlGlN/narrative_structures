time it looks so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> because and the</font>

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,160
stones in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I love you two faces</font>

109

118
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,410
out just like in talks with Warner

119
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,390
Brothers these are a huge company<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

120
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,769
reason I did this and people that why

121
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,019
did you even<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it right is because what</font>

122
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,310
i wanted to because it's gangster squad

123
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,320
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm being genuinely serious you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

124
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,570
know me I love gangster films like ah

125
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,120
just a huge fan of them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> our set go</font>

126
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,080
stitch talk it too<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast</font>

127
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,169
oh and but no then the other reason was

128
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,849
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think without someone being</font>

129
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:33,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">nosy out there wait what was ever isn't</font>

130
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,460
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so tape did someone like</font>

131
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,919
promotion work for him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too sure</font>

132
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">what company was but it was the film</font>

133
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,550
with Nicholas<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept ghost rider too and</font>

134
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,129
he got to be in the film so my thoughts

135
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:48,039
are if they reached out to me and I was

136
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,009
like hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know boo yeah you know I</font>

137
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,389
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> that luckily it's a franchise that</font>

138
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:53,889
I like and you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far out like a</font>

139
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,300
gangster film if they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me it was</font>

140
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,240
like a like just a normal horrified but

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,620
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> know go away that's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weird</font>

142
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,770
because it's my genre I was like yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz</font>

143
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,870
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they were like hey you know</font>

144
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know that syndicate guy from</font>

145
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:07,870
the YouTube that time who hope to doubt

146
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,729
let let's see if he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in a</font>

147
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,530
part of a film like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-second like</font>

148
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,840
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you seem you know even if I</font>

149
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,800
