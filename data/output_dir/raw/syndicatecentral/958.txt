169
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,250
shirt and that's just how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works and</font>

170
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've been seeing you guys going crazy on</font>

and the one color think this for yeah i

179
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,010
think there's four designs the one

180
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,570
called by the way was the riot lion but

181
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,340
rather than cord it was just an outline

182
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,930
of all the individual pieces in it which

183
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked dope so that's what's going on</font>

184

that's everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am still walking</font>

185
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,420

186
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,830

<font color="#CCCCCC">know I skated on down there listen to</font>

206
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,530
some good music and then once that was

207
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,570
all done I was like right sweet take a

208
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,490
day break and then carry on the swimming

209
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,710
stuff like that but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

210
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,759
the UK's like yeah I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick to</font>

211
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,470
routine every other day but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I went</font>

212
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the local pool it was really</font>

213
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">shitty it's like all women swimming in</font>

214
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,780
front of me in my way and kids playing

215
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,460
in my way I'm like a school day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

216
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,110
was like fuck this this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

217
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,419
frustrating I don't want this I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

218
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,800
not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do it I know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it sucked it</font>

219
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,210
was bad decision but I just decided that

220
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,949
I didn't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

221
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,539
continue it on here whilst<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in the US</font>

222
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,340
but just less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a month that i'm here</font>

223
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,160
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm working out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here now and you</font>

224
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,780
know we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the visa cuz i</font>

225
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,250
decided that i literally have stuff i

226
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,750
need to do and work out here so we've

227
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,759
got the visa and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

228
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing so I'm going to continue swimming</font>

229
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,669
so I've got some new swimming goggles

230
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,099
which I like black with you've got like

231
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,380
mirrored ball lenses so when someone

232
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,639
looks at me rather than seeing like my

233
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,289
eyes like me in the background they see

234
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:24,520
like this badass reflection of

235
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,830
themselves so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like intimidation so</font>

236
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,819
when you when I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do swimming</font>

237
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,349
races they don't like goggles are you I

238
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,180
would want because when someone looks at

239
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,580
meaning like really see themselves so

240
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,750
they can light intimidate you with a

241
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,370
look I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was I used to do</font>

242
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,530
like competitive swimming and this one

243
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,229
time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other team was winning the</font>

244
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,940
other team was winning when I saw us 14

245
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,889
height seal the other team was like

246
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,509
absolutely beast in about half a length

247
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,820
which is a lot in swimming terms in real

248
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,800
ale<font color="#E5E5E5"> a so it went one two three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four and</font>

249
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was number for the last basically this</font>

250
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,009
guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> got in and was like look to me and</font>

251
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,009

252
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,050
knew I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> good I was that I would like</font>

253
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,289
the fastest in my age and even who I was

254
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:06,280
the oldest old it been the fastest in

255
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,319
the club for doing front crawl freestyle

256
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,509
which she's not from crawl but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

257
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:11,710
that but you know you seen the video of

258
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,039
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it if you have basically I just</font>

259
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,139
was like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so this guy set</font>

260
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,699
off with half a length ahead of me and

261
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,190
as soon as my point cave I just fucking

262
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,069
dived in the water I<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely dived in</font>

263
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:26,349
and wish if I boom and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

264
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:28,389
absolutely rocketed down there and

265
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:30,159
absolutely loved it I'll be like one my

266
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,389
favorite swimming memories because I

267
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,849
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was as being</font>

268
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,828
cheeky like modest like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you're good</font>

269
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,078
swim I was like all right you know she's

270
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:39,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">not gonna go beyond the fucking best I</font>

271
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:40,599
met swimmers like that and then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

272
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,570
beat him you're like you but when I God

273
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,890
when I smashed that guy swimming I was

274
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,380
like fuck yeah and I was that like dead

275
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,670
proud of the moment I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I was Bobby</font>

276
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,079
I think it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to us memories</font>

277
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,850
like that but then when I got to the end

278
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,720
and then I think

279
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,740
I can see it i'm pretty sure i did

280
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like yeah I'm all right to him</font>

281
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,819
and then he was like her because his

282
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:01,550
team was winning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we be in ib ib</font>

283
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,560
