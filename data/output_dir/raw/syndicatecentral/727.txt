8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,400
choice of the top of nutella pots with a

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,160
water you can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm all about them</font>

10

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,779
have read oh I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to catch the</font>

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,490
last rays of Sun that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly can</font>

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,460
I've probably got about 30 minutes

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,290
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Sun actually goes down so I'm</font>

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,940
just saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here topping you up and I</font>

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,410
had a guess it was a woman up here with

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,140
a kid so I was like hi I just looked

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,460
really awkward cuz I walked up to the

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,739
roof stood here and randomly a Nutella

20
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,690
part nope stood up I didn't sit down

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I wouldn't be in the sunlight</font>

22
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,570
and then I'm drinking a bottle of water

23
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,579
so I looked really really fucking random

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,170
i look like i was like plotting a

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,899
terrorist plots in a while so that was

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,070
kind of weird it was hands down the most

27
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,840
depressing about a son I've ever got on

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,670
myself at one point I feel like I was

29
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,309
like milking a dusty nipple but because

30
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,809
I what a jeep wrangler I'm gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and</font>

31
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,369
rent one first to see if I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

32
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,229
way it drives because if I just hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

33
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,490
then what's the point in having it so

34
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,170
I'm ringing up a bunch of places try and

35
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,909
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've got any for rental right</font>

36
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,320
now through the companies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ranked</font>

37
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,270
