3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,899

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">really a found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sort of thing so this</font>

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,770
is if any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys had an experience</font>

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,090
with it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what I'm going to do</font>

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,800
you show you when i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna stream to</font>

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,650
you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to connect my HD PVR one</font>

13
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,660
down there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to connect that</font>

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,240
instead of using my HD PVR 2 which I'd

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,740
rather you because you know like the

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,540
quote is much better you going to see me

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,160
on here so this is using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HDP you go</font>

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,930
to the quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's like 10 times but I</font>

19
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,239
when I record isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> an EP a box you know</font>

20
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,940
all much much better but the problem

21
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,010
that I've got now is that when I have

22
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,500
the the PVR 2 so say if I make this full

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,079
screen real quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I put my streams</font>

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,460
out there you can see I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got my</font>

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,020
streaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> cell bear that's it looks like</font>

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,899
it's fine and dandy and it's all good

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,910
but the camera as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see in this top</font>

28
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,280
corner this camera is a live feed with

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,570
the microphone so you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

30
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,399
camera connected as you can see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my on</font>

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,589
my listings here I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera sec</font>

32
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,350
I've got logitech camera and I've got a

33
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,049
screen region so the screen region

34
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,900
record the audio that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows creates</font>

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,490
sort of this thing bought it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

36
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">second delay so now what I need to do is</font>

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,130
I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this camera image here I</font>

38
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,409
need to somehow delay the camera image

39
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,170
by three seconds and an awesome audio

40
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,299
now I know how to do my audio and like

41
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,850

42
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,740

to delay this video feed on the webcam

44
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,860
so if I can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can stream and</font>
