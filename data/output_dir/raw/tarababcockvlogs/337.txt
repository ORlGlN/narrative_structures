32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,880
was watching on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the show I was reminded</font>

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,100
of a part of my past there is a part in

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the show which I'm not going to give</font>

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,689
away too much because of spoilers but he

36
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,759
has to resuscitate someone who he cares

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,270
about and in his emotional pneus the way

38
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,640
he emotionally handles the situation he

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,310
starts hitting the person mmm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,409
reminded me of a time in my childhood I

41
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,320
think I was around 13 years old i would

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,360
say because I started smoking weed at

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,119
like twelve and a half or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something when</font>

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,090
my boyfriend and I found like I used

45
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,130
like a little package on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground in</font>

46
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,509
the rain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was closed but there was</font>

47
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,220
like a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of weed left and we</font>

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,590
tried it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from then on my friends and</font>

49
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,060
I like all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends I had a lot of</font>

50
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,360
guy friends we would all try to procure

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,680
as much weight as possible which was

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,659
very very hard when you're in like

53
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,740
middle school it's like near impossible

54
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,780
so we would get very little of it and

55
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,919
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were there were like kids who</font>

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,629
would sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and there were high</font>

57
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,730
schoolers that would sell

58
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,129
you let me make sure my boobs are in my

59
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,780
shirt there were high schoolers that

60
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,220
would sell to like the younger kids

61
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,530
stuff but I smoked a lot of pot when I

62
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,819
was younger and part of it at first it

63
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,680
was just for fun and it was like really

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,239
interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> great and it was like an</font>

65
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,160
exploration and then later when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

66
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">dating the guy Jared who was like a</font>

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,879
complete and terrible waste of my two

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
years I started doing it kind of in

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,170
spite of him because he didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it</font>

70
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then when I did it it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

71
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,400
kind of forget of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much like how much</font>

72
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an asshole he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was you know and it was</font>

73
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like so stupid I don't do any kind</font>

74
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:48,739
of drugs anymore i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even really</font>

75
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,440
drink it because for me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would rather</font>

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,700
live a healthy lifestyle and I would

77
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,709
rather have a healthy respiratory system

78
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,019
and I'm very active I go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gym and</font>

79
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:59,930
stuff not only does we'd give me the

80
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,480
munchies like a lot you know i'm just

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,450
like more in tune<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my hunger and you</font>

82
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,480
know the tastes are just you know

83
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,920
heightened so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like much more fun to</font>

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,420
eat and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much what munchies</font>

85
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,510
are not everyone gets them but um I also

86
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,609
feel more out of breath when I work out

87
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:20,349
when i try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do cardio and when i am on</font>

88
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,950
like weed<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very paranoid like I</font>

89
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,450
can die and I know that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

90
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,049
actual you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases of people dying</font>

91
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,130
directly from weed when they're healthy

92
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,269
themselves like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a thing that</font>

93
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens it's it's a very safe drug as</font>

94
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,769
far as drugs go but you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

95
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,180
get in like car accidents or like do

96
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,650
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> stupid things it's there's a loss</font>

97
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,630
of blood cells there's things that can

98
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,680
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your respiratory system and</font>

99
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,940
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not interested in that and I</font>

100
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,910
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this like really depressing</font>

101
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,130
feeling like everything around me is

102
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,209
just like awkward and gross<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I feel</font>

103
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,130
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm trapped in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the body of someone</font>

104
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,540
who's not confident and who is very

105
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,230
self-conscious and unhappy with

106
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,900
themselves when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smoke pot and that</font>

107
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,519
doesn't happen when I drink but drinking

108
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:05,930
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a lot of calories and there's</font>

109
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,250
no reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of my</font>

110
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,169
inhibitions inhibitions I don't really

111
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">like have any to begin with I also took</font>

112
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,879
caffeine this morning so I apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

113
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,470
anyway let's get into the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was</font>

114
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,970
working a lot of pot but it was hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

115
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,519
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> by so my friend Zach with a seed he</font>

116
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,048
had this like cute list but he was like

117
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,690
a boy with like hair this color<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

118
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,770
had hair this color when I was younger

119
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,600
too so we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> both like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blondes</font>

120
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were brother and</font>

121
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,060
sister but we were really good friends

122
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,300
and we hung out a lot and he liked to

123
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,770
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> video games and he liked to smoke</font>

124
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,840
and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do as well one</font>

125
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,130
day he comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and I'm like did you</font>

126
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,360
get any weed because the sister was

127
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,950
older I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think she had a way of getting</font>

128
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,620
him we'd i'm not quite sure and my long

129
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,870
term memory isn't that great i<font color="#E5E5E5"> only just</font>

130
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,520
remembered this story<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i was</font>

131
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,400
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking better call saul um as</font>

132
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,900
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of how bad my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font>

133
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,910
memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably as a results of</font>

134
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,580
smoking pot um he comes over and he's

135
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,440
like I have an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can get us high</font>

136
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,030
that doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with weed and</font>

137
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to procure and I'm like</font>

138
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,280

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm like is this safe and he's like</font>

153
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,600
well I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe nothing's ever</font>

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,370
happened it's fine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's like egging</font>

155
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,160
me on and as much as I experimented in

156
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,990
as many things as I did when I was

157
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,870
younger that I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

158
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">done heard that could have brought me</font>

159
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,150
harm I<font color="#CCCCCC"> always had the sense to question</font>

160
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,400
things and to not want to do things but

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was also young and susceptible to peer</font>

162
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,660
pressure especially from someone that I

163
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,860
cared about I've never been susceptible

164
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer pressure from people I don't</font>

165
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,890
give a shit about like<font color="#CCCCCC"> people I don't</font>

166
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,660
know or like bullies but when it comes

167
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,100
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friends I've always trusted my</font>

168
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,990
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I was like okay sure it's</font>

169
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,210
a very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just inhale</font>

170
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,590
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you just like put it in your</font>

171
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,050
mouth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you inhale it it's really like</font>

172
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,440
cold and minty and then immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

173
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,730
like you restrict all um oxygen to your

174
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,260
brain I'm not sure exactly what happens

175
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,800
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it deprives you of oxygen so</font>

176
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,720
that your brain can't function as well

177
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,990
and the high only<font color="#E5E5E5"> lasts like like a few</font>

178
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">seconds and it's like you see the dots</font>

179
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,830
like when you when you look into a

180
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,000
bright light or you get a flash and they

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,990
close your eyes and there's like dots

182
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,950
everywhere that's

183
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,530
all you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see pretty much have no</font>

184
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,650
auditory or visual perception just like

185
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,680
dots and euphoria and weirdness and this

186
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,430
is like a very vivid memory to me I

187
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,570
don't know what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with my throat I</font>

188
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,310
think i deep throated too much last

189
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,650
night or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had pretty rough</font>

190
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,230

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,610

195
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,680
intermittent cold but anyway ah they

196
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,850

197
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,800
Tara digress<font color="#CCCCCC"> babcock because that's</font>

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,300

200
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,660
was hitting it and Zach was hitting it

201
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,590
and I was hitting it and we were like

202
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,070
switching off back and forth and I was

203
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,360
getting a good high but I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

204
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,650
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel really nauseous and I didn't</font>

205
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,590
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore and Zach takes his</font>

206
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">last hit and I'm like that's all for me</font>

207
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,000

208
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,680
you're on when you're like experiencing

209
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,500
the higher kind of just like

210
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,120
non-responsive and stuff I were like

211
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,160
enjoying it and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> being with your</font>

212
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,320
eyes closed it's really weird but Zach

213
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,210
wasn't moving afterwards and he just had

214
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,240
it like the the aerosol can like in his

215
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,470

216
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,070
like package day or whatever um yeah and

217
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,600
like coolant I don't know what it's made

219
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like forgetting but he like slumps</font>

over in my like it's like my grandma's

221
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,640
like it's a chair like this but smaller

222
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,740
and it's like a rocking chair he like

223
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,630
slumps over and is non-responsive and

224
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,620
I'm like Zach and I like touch him and

225
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm like Zach and he's like not</font>

226
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,680
responding and you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

227
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,000
like tell you can tell just by looking

228
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,350
at someone whether or not they're like

229
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,960
breathing normally he wasn't breathing

230
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,060
from what I could tell but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't you</font>

231
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,730
know trained in CPR so I didn't do the

232
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,170
whole like you know put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand or</font>

233
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,520
your face next to their face and see if

234
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,750
they're breathing at all and then do the

235
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,510
CPR I wasn't trained in that yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um I</font>

236
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,090
just like kind of freaked out and the

237
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing I was thinking is I'm going</font>

238
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so much fucking trouble I'm</font>

239
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,020
going to be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much fucking trouble I</font>

240
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't really understanding the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gravity</font>

241
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,179
of the situation and the fact that you

242
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,620
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this person could actually die and</font>

243
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,900
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know this is safe so</font>

244
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,940
what's going on with him like is he sick

245
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,400
did he fall asleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> as normal and I start</font>

246
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,480
shaking him like violent

247
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,610
and I I like slap him across the face

248
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,579
like twice and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my god I'm</font>

249
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,019
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zach what the fuck I'm like yelling</font>

250
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,000
and no one's home so like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

251
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">us there and I like punch him as hard as</font>

252
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,680
I can on space and he like immediately

253
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,850
wakes up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like throws up all over</font>

254
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,720
himself and I'm like oh thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> god says</font>

255
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,490
so much better i'm so fucking glad that

256
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,570
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's never do this again</font>

257
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,970
and we decided never to do it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

258
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,850
don't know if he ever did but it was

259
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,260
like pretty like I opening you know like

260
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,910
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do your research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

261
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,620
try anything and obviously household

262
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,850
cleaners and things like that are not

263
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,139
things that you should be using or

264
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:33,050
huffing or you know markers all of these

265
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">things can be detrimental to you and I</font>

266
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,980
definitely don't recommend doing any

267
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,790
like harder drugs or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know things</font>

268
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see on the house cough syrup</font>

269
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,850
don't abuse any of that stuff because

270
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no like actual studies on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

271
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,110
whereas if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really need to get high</font>

272
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,790
or drunk do drinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal amount for</font>

273
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,620
your body<font color="#E5E5E5"> weight or you know trying pots</font>

274
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,480
look my fucking throat it's like a

275
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,100
tickle that I'm like trying to not have

276
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">um you should definitely do things that</font>

277
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,970
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sanctioned I guess I would say</font>

278
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,550
as drugs if you have to but I recommend

279
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,750
just not doing there's no reason to do

280
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,819
it like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

281
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:17,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to be an interesting person or to</font>

282
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,550
have epiphanies or anything like that

283
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,420
it's fun when you're young to

284
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,829
experiments but I definitely it's it's

285
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:27,949
not really worth the trying things out

286
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:29,810
like like take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from me I don't like</font>

287
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,569
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give advice where I'm telling you</font>

288
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,790
guys what to do often I feel like it's

289
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,230
just kind of pretentious and like

290
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,449
everyone is different so people might

291
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">have like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good like experiences</font>

292
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,339
with weed and really good experiences

293
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,160
with certain drugs and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

294
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,660
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you more creative I mean look at</font>

295
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,850
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rock stars of the like 70s</font>

296
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,089
fifties 80s 90s<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everything being is</font>

297
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:54,290
different for everyone else but I

298
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,540
definitely recommend doing things that

299
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">have no actual cases of direct death and</font>

300
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">then doing them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the comfort of your</font>

301
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,360
own home not going out driving and

302
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,010
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and putting other</font>

303
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,030
people's lives at risk like really

304
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,470
if you're only harming yourself and

305
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that you can be</font>

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,960
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in life you should probably try to</font>

307
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">find another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hobby but I mean you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

312
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,770
the washer and dryer and I still had

313
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,120
that sweater like I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not my</font>

314
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,500
parents house I just like had it forever

315
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,480
because whatever I cleaned off my

316
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,310
grandma's chair and he said he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">feeling fine and we just went back to</font>

321
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">smoking weed and then eventually we</font>

322
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,240
started drinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff like that</font>

323
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,030
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got older but um I haven't</font>

324
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked to Zach and ever he like moved</font>

325
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,640
away and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was one of my best friends</font>

326
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really shitty like it was</font>

327
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,060
like Chris Zach and then my boyfriend

328
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,670
Casey and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other guy friends</font>

329
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I had around the neighborhood and</font>

330
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">Zach was one of my favorites he was into</font>

331
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,990
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was into we would play a</font>

332
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,280
bunch of video games high and it was

333
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,370
great and I'm really glad that nothing

334
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,990
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that bad experience and I feel</font>

335
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,420
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really great that we were able</font>

336
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,220
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and know that like</font>

337
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,940
you know do your research weed is safer

338
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,990
everyone's doing it there's no reported

339
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,430
cases of deaths and stuff like that so

340
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah oh please this is interesting to</font>

341
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,450
you guys I like doing story times and a

342
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in my patreon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

343
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,810
don't do this like topic because we

344
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,040
don't like negative things and I'm like

345
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,020
well it had a happy ending right like

346
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,520
nobody died it wasn't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Andrews</font>

347
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
story or somebody actually did die I

348
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,350
like doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> story time videos but I feel</font>

349
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,360
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I either forget a lot of my stories</font>

350
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,770
or I'm not good at telling stories and

351
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,780
then I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as many stories like</font>

352
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,670
when I watched like Shannon roses

353
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,680
channel she has so many stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

354
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,570
her childhood and her life is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so</font>

355
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,980
fucked up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many crazy things</font>

356
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,360
happening and she kind of feeds off the

357
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,600
drama at night I avoid drama and most of

358
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,830
my stories are from when I was younger

359
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,530
because now all I do is stay at home and

360
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,240
play video games<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I go out to</font>

361
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">wear these like cute skirts and things</font>
