7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,079
I have now so I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go over it</font>

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,849
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time to do makeup and i was</font>

15
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,340
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about my past and growing up</font>

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,809
and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bullying</font>

17
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,160
situations that I've had and I was also

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,210
thinking about something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went</font>

19
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,390
over on my stream a couple days ago and

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,070
that was something that day<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 actually</font>

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,629
said to me day 9 is a starcraft

22
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,070
personality he also does some other

23
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,500
stuff and we were pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> close friends</font>

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,450
for a while but he said that he found

25
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,340
out the hard way that if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

26
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,289
like really confident about something no

27
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,460
matter what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it's something</font>

28
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,469
nerdy like you know video<font color="#E5E5E5"> games are</font>

29
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,350
playing D&D or you know playing Magic

30
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,460
the Gathering it doesn't matter as long

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,109
as you have charisma as long as you have

32
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,940
confidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> as long as you really sell</font>

33
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,589
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you're doing then</font>

34
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,200
people will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel drawn to you</font>

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,460
and feel the same way and they're not

36
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bother you as much because they</font>

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,310
don't feel like you are you know you're

38
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,560
not socially inept anymore you're kind

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,030
of like the charismatic nerd that

40
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,710
everyone likes and everyone revolves

41
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,479
around and has respect for and that's

42
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,939
kind of how everyone sees day 9 like

43
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,939
even if they um are cooler than them and

44
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,040
not into gaming they're like all day 9

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,479
is a cool guy yeah and he has a lot of

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,280
friends in very different places because

47
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,680
he is that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of person who can sell</font>

48
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of charisma and I learned that</font>

49
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,030
too but I never put it into the words

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,250
like he did so it was really refreshing

51
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,750
and nice to hear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> from him when he</font>

52
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,740
told<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we were talking</font>

53
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that a couple years ago because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

54
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,780
that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt my entire life I did</font>

55
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,110
not have the experience growing up that

56
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,360
a lot of people would assume I had I was

57
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,960
not a rich I was not the popular pretty

58
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,420
girl in school I was like a slightly

59
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,030
overweight chubby girl who

60
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,830
only had guy friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not</font>

61
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,479
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that people were</font>

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,580
into so when I was really young let's

63
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,410
say elementary school maybe early middle

64
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,540
school the things that I liked were Pink

65
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">Floyd was my favorite type of music I</font>

66
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,069
was really into Monty Python and any

67
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,660
time in class we would have one of those

68
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,010
show-and-tell days where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would talk</font>

69
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about our favorite actors or whatever</font>

70
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,060
people would be talking about the the

71
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,459
newest and latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> cartoon or movie or</font>

72
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,260
cool movie that everyone was seeing and

73
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,459
I would be like John Cleese is my

74
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,560
favorite actor and to this day I still

75
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,100
will say that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he um is one of</font>

76
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,340
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who solidified my personality</font>

77
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,580
and my sense of humor and I just fucking

78
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,070
love BBC like a lot of my humor from BBC

79
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,340
um as well as Fawlty Towers I think

80
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,780
Fawlty Towers is actually better than

81
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,360
Monty Python in a way um monty python

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,030
has a lot of really good gems like wink

83
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,800
wink nudge nudge and all that stuff and

84
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,920
um the parrot dying and everything I

85
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,170
fucking have like the box set of both

86
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,660
but Fawlty Towers is just from beginning

87
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,019
to end fucking hilarious and I really

88
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,459
wish that it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer series but</font>

89
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,100
anyway um so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would ask me</font>

90
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,079
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things I would be like yeah</font>

91
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,670
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite it's fucking awesome</font>

92
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,170
you guys should watch it sometime and

93
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,299
the fact that I acted that way about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

94
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,820
people flocked to me and even if I was

95
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,470
like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird to people or people</font>

96
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,299
would consider me weird they would

97
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,980
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew me and I was popular and I</font>

98
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,540
had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of friends because I was like</font>

99
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,739
that and I would show my friends this

100
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,780
and all my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends were guys obviously</font>

101
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,910
because little boys love video games and

102
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,290
I was a spoiled only child and I don't

103
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,180
know what it was when I was growing up

104
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,790
that made me so comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with myself</font>

105
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,590
and so confident I think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

106
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,970
the fact that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spoiled only child</font>

107
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,010
and my parents told me you know you know

108
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,570
do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you love and showed me all these</font>

109
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,130
cool things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a lot of stuff at</font>

110
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,780
home so if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought a friend over it</font>

111
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,489
would be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoa it's so cool you are</font>

112
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,930
spoiled and have all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I love</font>

113
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,430
hanging out with you because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

114
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,170
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> play any board game or play any</font>

115
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,940
video game and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have it oh you're so</font>

116
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,380
much more fortunate than me and your

117
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,670
parents are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and laid back</font>

118
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,799
and chill and all that and that's

119
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,720
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> what made me who I am today the</font>

120
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,430
fact that they didn't they didn't

121
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,810
shelter me they didn't try to force

122
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,250
little kid things on me they kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

123
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,690
just treated me like a friend and I was

124
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">really close to my dad too because my</font>

125
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,250
dad introduced me to

126
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,600
Jungians my mom and my dad both

127
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,010
introduced me to video games before I

128
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,839
could even fucking walk like that's what

129
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was doing and that was my favorite</font>

130
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,410
thing and I had a whole separate room in

131
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,840
our house was dedicated to video games

132
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and had like a rack with like two</font>

133
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,920
different tvs and all the consoles and

134
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,600
the games were in like books and night

135
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,180
like a big book of video games and then

136
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,460
cartridges like the stacks of cartridges

137
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,080
that you would put and like the

138
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,670
cartridge holder and like a weird Carter

139
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,620
told her we would slip cartridges in

140
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,240
there and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have pretty much everything</font>

141
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,920
and I was spoiled<font color="#E5E5E5"> as fuck and I loved it</font>

142
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,420
now would invite boys over and we would

143
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,919
hang out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and back then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

144
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,510
about looks obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> because boys</font>

145
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,430
weren't as into girls and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

146
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,020
politics of high school wasn't really

147
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,430
kicking in yet but when I got into

148
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">middle school it was kind of a weird</font>

149
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,530
phenomenon like some of the boys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

150
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,450
would hang out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with became part of the</font>

151
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,340
nerd community so they wouldn't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

152
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,660
me anymore because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they thought that I</font>

153
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,760
was selling out when really i<font color="#CCCCCC"> was still</font>

154
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,800
owning the things that I loved loving

155
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,360
the same things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they loved but they</font>

156
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,340
felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like somehow I had abandoned them</font>

157
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,500
because I got more popular it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

158
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">weird it sucked when I got into high</font>

159
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,710
school and I realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of my old</font>

160
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,080
best friends who we never had qualms<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

161
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,970
never had any problems we still enjoyed

162
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,470
the same things but they were hating on

163
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,390
me and acting<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

164
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,130
stuck-up bitch when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't at all and</font>

165
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,390
I was always nice to them it was very

166
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,570
odd um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> my best friend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> growing up was</font>

167
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,700
named Chris he was my<font color="#E5E5E5"> next door neighbor</font>

168
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,710
and we played video games today<font color="#E5E5E5"> or today</font>

169
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,390
we playing video games every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day</font>

170
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,910
and when we got into middle school was

171
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,050
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we actually went to the</font>

172
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,310
same school he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year older than me</font>

173
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he was a great higher than me but we</font>

174
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,540
had our lockers right next to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

175
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,010
and I remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking to Chris</font>

176
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,169
one morning and then he<font color="#CCCCCC"> left and one of</font>

177
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,790
my popular friends came up and was like

178
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,050
why the hell<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you talk to that guy i</font>

179
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,150
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like why the fuck would i not talk</font>

180
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,710
to that guy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's like he's a nerd</font>

181
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like so am i he's like yeah but</font>

182
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,060
you're a cool nerd and that makes you

183
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,340
not a nerd and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like no it doesn't my</font>

184
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,200
social skills is not what makes me not a

185
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,600
nerd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe in the derogatory sense</font>

186
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,850
where nerd just means socially an<font color="#CCCCCC"> apt to</font>

187
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,120
retard or something but like I like the

188
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">exact same things we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are almost the same</font>

189
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,590
person because we grew up together how

190
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,470
why am I cooler than him just because I

191
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,090
can express it better just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I own</font>

192
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,090
it just because I love it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like one</font>

193
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,110
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that happened when I was</font>

194
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">in elementary schools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon came to</font>

like the best time of my life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,660
would see kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> going off topic here</font>

213
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,060

237
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,250

252
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,220

260
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,860
started disliking me because I didn't

261
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,490
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

262
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,799
interest as them and they kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sorted</font>

263
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,570
alienating me at the party<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm like</font>

264
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,240
that's fine I called my mom like I want

265
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like yeah we didn't</font>

266
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,399
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you here anyway we were just gonna</font>

267
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,480
bring you here to make fun of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

268
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,310
like okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just never talk to them</font>

269
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,770
again right and for a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> Misha</font>

270
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,300
and her friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> were like a bitch to me</font>

271
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,580
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just was like okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care</font>

272
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,500
and I feel like to someone who was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

273
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">raised as I was or someone who didn't</font>

274
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't able to just be confident</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in all</font>

275
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,209
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she likes and be excited</font>

276
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,589
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that she likes openly</font>

277
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,540
and I was just like I was more mature

278
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,910
than everyone my age I was better so I

279
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,430
was more well-spoken than everyone I had

280
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,860
more friends you know than any of the

281
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,959
nerd people and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that alienated</font>

282
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,160
the nerds and the fact that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

283
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,810
different alienated the popular people

284
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,330
so I had my own group of friends usually

285
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,480
um people who weren't into the same

286
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,529
thing as me but they thought I was

287
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,940
really cool he looked up to me because I

288
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">was so open and so that's kind of how my</font>

289
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,080
middle school went and there were guys

290
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,510
that I liked that dated Misha like my

291
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,339
bet one of my best guy friends name was

292
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,920
Omar and he really liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> Misha but he</font>

293
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
didn't get along with Misha he was just

294
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,529
attracted to her<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thought she was</font>

295
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:46,510
pretty and so he dated her and he would

296
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">always bitch to me about her um and talk</font>

297
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,760
about how I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the best guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> friend</font>

298
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,470
or whatever and like that kind of sucked

299
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,610
for a while that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was the tomboy that</font>

300
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,660
couldn't really get the guy because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

301
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,370
wasn't like girly enough or whatever but

302
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,529
I didn't care I had friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was happy</font>

303
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,750
and the chase is always more fun than

304
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,730
the actual catch right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the middle</font>

305
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,779
school you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really need a boyfriend</font>

306
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,490
but it was nice because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

of a sudden after high school when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

345
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,540

347
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kathy started hating me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cassie</font>

348
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,579
became a totally different person and

349
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,829
and she started like calling me a slut

350
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,999
and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was like what the hell</font>

351
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like why these people</font>

352
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:40,839
are acting like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm against them when</font>

353
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,309
I'm the same person is then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so</font>

354
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,410
stupid the social status fucks you up

355
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,990
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but basically I'm just telling</font>

356
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,579
my story now not actually giving you any

357
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,490
advice on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to not get bullied but the</font>

358
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,139
basic point and it's easier said that

359
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,970
it's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier said than done is</font>

360
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,679
to just be confident in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font>

361
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,059
you like and know that you like them for

362
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,040
a reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> try out other things like try</font>

363
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,120
going and hanging out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the popular</font>

364
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,490
girls and then find out for yourself if

365
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,959
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of crowd you want to</font>

366
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,610
be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find out why and then be</font>

367
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,439
confident in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fact love yourself</font>

368
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:10,389
find reasons to love yourself find

369
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,480
things like little quirks or little

370
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,470
personality traits that make you special

371
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,389
because being different and being weird

372
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,959
is so much fucking better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

373
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,249
exactly the same and trying to conform

374
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:24,129
for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of soup stupid like high</font>

375
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:26,019
school social status bullshit because

376
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,730
none of that fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> shit matters once</font>

377
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,079
you get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> high school none of that</font>

378
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking shit matters once you leave</font>

379
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,009
whatever stupid job you're at where

380
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,240
people are putting you down or whatever

381
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,209

386
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:50,139
like explore different options and just

387
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,110
be happy with yourself if someone calls

388
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,389

390
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:59,139

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,580
are people who have bad lives themselves

419
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,200

beat me up to which made no fucking

459
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,430
sense but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time I was so</font>

460
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,070
popular but for bad reasons so I had my

461
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,200
own friends who didn't care and I had my

462
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,970
sidekicks and my girlfriends and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my guy</font>

463
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,230
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> who I played video games with</font>

464
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,550
and they didn't care and I had my

465
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,620
boyfriend who loved me a lot and didn't

466
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,790
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he was like the sweetest boy in</font>

467
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,010
the world um and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of brush</font>

468
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,020
that shit off to me it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're</font>

469
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,370
saying bad things about me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

470
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">hurt my feelings but these are just</font>

471
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,580
factual things that I did and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> own up</font>

472
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">to and I think they're normal and I</font>

473
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,280
enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so why the fuck would I be</font>

474
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,310
sad and I know it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to just</font>

475
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,830
say laugh it off like i was talking to

476
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,020
another friend who thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was stupid</font>

477
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,790
to tell people to just laugh things off

478
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,180
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting offended um but I</font>

479
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,770
really feel like that is such an

480
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,450
integral part of being confident with

481
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,010
yourself is understanding why people do

482
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,690
things understanding why you shouldn't

483
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,310
give a shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and loving yourself and</font>

484
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,660
getting over the hurdle of loving

485
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,310
yourself is probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardest part</font>

486
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,930
I've never really had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem with it</font>

487
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,820
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone says that it's the hardest</font>

488
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,840
part so I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take their</font>

489
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,380
word for it I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding out</font>

490
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,030
what you love finding out who you are

491
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding out your flaws and then working</font>

492
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,320
to change them or you know loving your

493
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,660
flaws and telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to fuck off who</font>

494
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,430
say that they are flaws like all of

495
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,690
those things are just very important so

496
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,310
don't let anyone bring you down I

497
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking told off so many bullies I've</font>

498
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,210
bullied so many bullies I've protected

499
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,220
my friends or like nerds I don't even

500
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font>

501
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,990
oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking love everything nerdy in</font>

502
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,400
the nerd community I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

503
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,990
should be a derogatory term I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

504
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,970
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own up to</font>

505
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,260
and that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> love and I think you should</font>

506
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,850
find your own reason to be charismatic

507
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,890
and outgoing and your own group of

508
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,270
people who respect you for who you are

509
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,590
and everyone else could just go fuck

510
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,680
themselves so yeah hopefully um this

511
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,710
little interesting flashback of mine has

512
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">been helpful to you or interesting post</font>

513
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,000
in the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've had any</font>

514
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,520
experiences bullies and then you know

515
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,560
tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fuck off and sometimes it's</font>

516
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as easy to tell them to fuck off I'm</font>

517
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,010
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about emotionally being</font>

518
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,599
bullied than physically being bullied

519
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,010
and I hope none of you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through</font>

520
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,699
that I hope that there's someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

521
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:11,900
could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you or some way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

522
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,660
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of them but uh yeah I'll see</font>
