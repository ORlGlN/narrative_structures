35
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,580

Tara is all about boobs is something I

48
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,250
don't like because<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that's not</font>

49
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,079
all i'm about and to say that is to kind

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,119
of be like literally disrespectful<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

51
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,439
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the only reason people</font>

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,720
think that talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> girl's body</font>

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,460
is disrespectful is because it

54
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,130
insinuates that that is all the thurs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

55
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,200
look at or that's all there is to the

56
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,399
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's all the matters and</font>

57
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,290
that's kind of rude you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like you</font>

58
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,479
want someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take you like at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

59
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,000
when you see someone of course you're

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be looking at their looks</font>

61
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,310
because that's all there is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

62
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,288
act like<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell about you don't know that</font>

63
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're a good person you don't know</font>

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they do charity or what</font>

65
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,110
not so I mean it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you to</font>

66
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,250
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh you're so beautiful or</font>

67
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,210
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that shouldn't</font>

68
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">be offensive even though it is offensive</font>

69
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,760
some girls because they're stupid I

70
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,080
don't know I don't know how to explain

71
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,560
my gender I apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the men out</font>

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,910
there who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to deal with crazy</font>

73
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,640
feminist bitches I apologize I do not

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">identify it all with this gender but I</font>

75
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,120
understand where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're coming from in</font>

76
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,000
terms of sexist comments meaning to

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,330
degrade rather than to you know be like

78
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,620
oh you're so beautiful and actually mean

79
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,450
it and just mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay part of you</font>

80
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,130
is beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other part</font>

81
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,360
is too but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know about it you</font>

82
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,280
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of thing but that's</font>

83
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,990
mostly why people don't like that or

84
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,280
women don't like that is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

85
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,230
think that it insinuates so that's all

86
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,230
they are which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking stupid right</font>

87
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,640
but some men do use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like on</font>

88
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,900
my stream and stuff they'll be like oh

00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,490
nice boobs whore you know and that's

90
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,290
obvious that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to degrade</font>

91
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,300
you then other people just being like

being respectful<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's no reason</font>

94
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,100
why you shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font>

95
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">especially to someone who is a model</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be logical and have this certain</font>

127
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,389
level of common sense and then I

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,400
haven't uploaded it yet and just a bunch

151
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,259
of other things it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like my philosophy</font>

152
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:21,789
on life like practical things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

153
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,770
would use in life why I'm a vegan I

154
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,120
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to touch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

155
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,479
because I don't like having that

156
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,680
argument is that when I'm a little bit

157
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,110
too passionate about and I'm sober

158
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,570
enough right now in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of view to</font>

159
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,130
know that I probably shouldn't get into

160
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,449
that argument because usually when I

161
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,400
argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people or when I post</font>

162
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,380
something online it's like I'm so

163
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,229
confident<font color="#E5E5E5"> in myself and how I feel and</font>

164
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,969
what I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't give a shit</font>

165
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:46,870
what anyone else says you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

166
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't offend to me doesn't hurt me I</font>

167
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,529
don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get flustered when I see</font>

168
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:53,919
comments that are against me but with

169
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's so I'm so</font>

170
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,069
passionate about it and so emotional

171
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:59,110
about it and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like almost to the</font>

172
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,549
point where if someone makes one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

173
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:03,369
those kinds of like anti vegan jokes

174
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,559
like oh it tastes good or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font>

175
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,059
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like totally disrespectful to</font>

176
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,649
my opinion I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't be friends of</font>

177
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:10,119
them anymore you know so like I don't

178
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about it with anyone and that's one</font>

179
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:12,999
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that I haven't shared with</font>

180
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,619
you guys very much as to why I do that

181
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:18,279
oh yeah maybe someday I will probably

182
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">not though because I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

183
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into it but everything else you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

184
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,239
I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share with you guys</font>

185
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,919
and let you guys know how I think so

186
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,899
maybe it'll challenge your own opinions

187
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,519
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own thoughts and make you think</font>

188
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,769
more if nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> else it will engage</font>

189
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,419
everyone and thoughtful conversation

190
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,339
which is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I love</font>

191
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,379
philosophy psychology sociology all that

192
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,509
stuff is really interesting to me but I

193
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:42,069
should go because my Toph is probably

194
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,829
burning and yeah I hope you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys like</font>

195
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,239
this deeper conversation that I had

196
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,639
while laying on the couch<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a long</font>

197
00:06:48,639 --> 00:00:00,000
day of gaming and modeling whoo bye<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>
