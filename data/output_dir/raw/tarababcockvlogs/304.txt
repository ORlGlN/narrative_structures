12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,850
very close to vaping and something I've

<font color="#CCCCCC">been hearing a lot about is exploding</font>

14
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,320
vape pens well vape pens aren't actually

15

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,859
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> practice battery safety so</font>

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,210
today I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to outline a few tips on</font>

how to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe when you're using your</font>

21
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,630
battery<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your sub box or whatever you</font>

22
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,340

website will be down in the description

25
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,930
educate yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as I always say</font>

26
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,460
don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything in the media</font>

27
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,809
saying that vaping is unhealthy or

28
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,850
dangerous a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this propaganda is</font>

29
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,500
fueled by the tobacco companies who

30
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,690
stand to lose a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money if everyone</font>

31
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,730
switches to the more healthier vaping do

32
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,320
your own research think for yourself

33
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,879
don't be a fucking sheep number one

34
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't carry extra batteries around in</font>

35
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">your purse or your bag and what not</font>

36
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,010
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> a battery case number to make</font>

37
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,300
sure you're putting your battery in the

38
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,530
right way putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> your battery and</font>

39
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,210
backwards can be pretty dangerous use

40
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,979
the correct charger don't improvise and

41
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,119
use one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the charges you have laying</font>

42
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,350
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because it has the same</font>

43
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,729
adapter it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have the same</font>

44
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,890
voltage it might not fit correctly and

45
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,509
it can just be dangerous also don't use

46
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,670
cheap replacement chargers do not over

47
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,680
discharge your battery meaning don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

48
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,390
it drain all the way to empty this can

49
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,710
kill your battery over time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

50
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,330
isn't good for it this goes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

51
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,220
device it careful not to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> too low</font>

52
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,990
resistance and exceed your amp allowance

53
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,850
