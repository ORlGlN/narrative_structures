substances in the first place for<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself</font>

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,199
because um when I was younger<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was with</font>

that guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jared who was like awful to me</font>

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,090
cigarettes but he didn't like drugs and

34
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,260
alcohol he didn't like me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

35
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,549
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he knew that I got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

36
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,860
crazy or whatever same reason Jay kind

stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> which I won't I mean I'm crazy</font>

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,110
when I'm sober I'm just slightly crazier

41
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,119
when I'm drunk and I'm aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what I'm</font>

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,890
doing I've never gotten drunk enough or

43
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,710
high enough to where I don't remember

44
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">what happened or I'm not coherent and</font>

45
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,720
the closest I've ever gotten is

46
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,740
documented in a video called my

47
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,180
sluttiest moment if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys want to</font>

48
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,439
watch it it was the first time I took

49
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,500
Molly but so um drugs alcohol Molly and

50
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,270
some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a weed laced with cocaine</font>

51
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,710
and that's pretty much all I've done and

52
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,810
then there's salvia whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,939
alternative to<font color="#E5E5E5"> weed those are the only</font>

54
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,479
things i've done um at all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to</font>

55
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,180
do drugs a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I was unhappy in</font>

56
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,500
my relationship with Jared and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

57
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,420
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going through a rough patch so I</font>

58
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,759
partied my way through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and every time</font>

I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and everyone around me</font>

62
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,399
would seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> so pathetic and I would get a</font>

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,690
little bit paranoid and I would have

64
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,099
like I could feel my<font color="#CCCCCC"> heart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beating in my</font>

65
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,900

sex which is my second most popular

75
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,190
video because I show my butt in the

76
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,950

79
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,990
for sex I feel like there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

80
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,880
place for it in my life because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

club or why I don't club when I'm party

85

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that it's not really my</font>

86
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,740
thing I don't really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that but</font>

87
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,480
when I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to a friend's house or I</font>

88
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,670
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> um partying and getting drunk it</font>

89
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,580
always makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me feel less than happy it</font>

90
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,250
also messes with my fitness regimen like

91
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,310
I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel about smoking</font>

92
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,040
cigarettes I'm pretty sure we'd affects

93
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,930
your lungs that way because I feel more

94
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,580
weighed down and when I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done any</font>

95
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,370
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drugs for a while smokes drugs I</font>

96
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,760
feel so much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh and I just don't</font>

97
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the way that affects my my like</font>

98
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,920
lungs and trachea and all that stuff it

99
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,720
just doesn't feel good it doesn't feel

100
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,630
healthy and people always talk up you

101
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,920
know we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it has health benefits</font>

102
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,630
and stuff but for me I would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather</font>

103
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,570
be clean and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into fitness and that's</font>

104
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,140
a similar a similar philosophy that Jay

105
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,720
has he loves smoking pot and he does it

106
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,870
sometimes with Jesus but um his main

107
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,060
philosophy is that he wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be clean</font>

108
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,220
because his you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know lifting and his</font>

109
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,480
working out and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way I</font>

110
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,970
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like the cleanest healthiest</font>

111
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,040
version of myself possible and the way I

112
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,420
feel when I'm doing all the drugs and

113
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">alcohol is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way I feel when I've been</font>

114
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,780
eating too many<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap meals or cheap</font>

115
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,519
food it feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it weighs me down it</font>

116
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,230
doesn't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthy so for me</font>

117
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,610
personally I try to stay away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

118
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,900
especially because it doesn't make me

119
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,370
feel that great and I don't know if

120
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,040
there are any other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there who</font>

121
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">have like bad highs when they're on weed</font>

122
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,390
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever but um</font>

123
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,459
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just I look around and I'm</font>

124
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,589
like these people are so pathetic just

125
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,089
wasting like this is what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font>

126
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,620
head these people are so pathetic just

127
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,080
wasting their lives away on alcohol<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

128
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
drugs what are we doing just sitting

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,110
here like laughing like idiots not doing

130
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,400
anything productive and I start like

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,660
feeling like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I look in the</font>

132
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,370
mirror and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with</font>

133
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,830
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like I feel like when I'm high</font>

134
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,770
that is what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on is that I'm</font>

135
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting the insecurities that I've never</font>

136
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,060
had just like come like spring long me

137
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,919
all at once and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it feels awful and I</font>

138
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,720

139
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm like is this how people normally</font>

140
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,840
feel when they're unhappy with

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,370
themselves what's going on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

142
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,620

143
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,720
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it that much and</font>

144
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,730
that's why I belies at the opinion that

145
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,460
people who smoke or drink too much our

146
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,400
kind of low lives and I don't I don't

147
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,620
hold that as like a very like where I

148
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,630
look down on people but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've always felt</font>

149
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,730
like I could never really be close

150
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,890

favorite fucking band in the whole world

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,000
since I was really young so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

167
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,690
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really a cool experience</font>

168
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,400
there's some other things like the

169
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,950
rejected skit on youtube if you watch

170
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,330
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> shit hi it seems like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

171
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,030
amazing and there there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

172
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that it's cool to alter the way</font>

173
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,530
your brain thinks and that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

174
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,660
fascinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me I've always wanted to</font>

175
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,940
try a hallucinogenic drug so I could see

176
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,320
what it's like because i can't imagine

177
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,350
actually understanding a different

178
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,360
perception is reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> i couldn't imagine</font>

179
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is so fucking amazing your brain</font>

180
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,100
has ways to do that even with chemical

181
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,280
help like I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to study and experience</font>

182
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,930
that kind of thing and it's very

183
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,130
interesting to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at the same time</font>

184
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,600
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not something I want to do for</font>

185
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">myself and I've always thought that we'd</font>

186
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,760
people who smoke a lot of weed are

187
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,610
obviously much dumber my mom has a lot

188
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:25,770
of

189
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,500
blonde moments more so than I feel like

190
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,849
she had when she was younger because she

191
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,490
did a lot of drugs and um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

192
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,800
she and my dad were living in that age

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
of being a hippie right like most people

194
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,180
my age as parents would did so it's like

195
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,120
I feel like those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have less clear</font>

196
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,430
thoughts and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes I</font>

197
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,440
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues with my own memory and I</font>

198
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,180
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can attribute that to how</font>

199
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,460
much pot I smoked when I was like 14 and

200
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,789
I thought I wish I hadn't because I want

201
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have the sharpest mind possible and</font>

202
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,060
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my best friends Jesus no offense</font>

203
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,000
Jesus but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has brain farts every five</font>

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,130
seconds and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I am</font>

205
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,370
smoking weed my mentality everything

206
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,780
that I'm doing slows down so much that

207
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,490
it bothers<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually stressed</font>

208
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,900
out and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the reason why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

209
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,060
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like doing it is because like I</font>

210
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,669
played magic once when I was high I got

211
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,050
high and I was like oh fuck out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

212
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,270
magic this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is awful and it was so hard</font>

213
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,460
to concentrate like I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

214
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">better a better focus like I could focus</font>

215
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,490
on one specific thing better but<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

216
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,020
same time I it made me slow overall and

217
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,180
I would forget things like a blonde

218
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">moment type of feeling and then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

219
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,930
like oh why did I do that fuck and I had

220
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,460
to like take a long time to do anything

221
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,759
and someone like me who I like working

222
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">on my mind and I care about what it</font>

223
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:47,460
means to be intelligent I love working

224
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,400
on that and stuff it kind of doesn't

225
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,440
make any sense to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to smoke weed</font>

226
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,069
because weed makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me feel dumber and in</font>

227
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,719
the long run<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably makes me dumber</font>

228
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:00,270
and it's just I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do that</font>

229
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,889
and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

230
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't care about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and it's kind of</font>

231
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,340
sad to me I don't know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally</font>

232
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,659
understand doing it for fun with your

233
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:10,860
friends i do it for fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my friends</font>

234
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,279
very rarely but overall<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've never</font>

235
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,900
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> understood people who do it</font>

236
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,400
very frequently and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live in the state</font>

237
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,710
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fucking legal to smoke weed I</font>

238
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,389
don't understand people doing harder

239
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,070
drugs I feel like the way people act

240
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,780
like oh you do crack once you're hooked

241
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,550
forever I don't feel like that's

242
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,380
actually the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you</font>

243
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,789
can experiment with that stuff and you

244
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you can definitely be fine I know a</font>

245
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,510
lot of people who have done that stuff

246
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,469
at least once and they're perfectly

247
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">functional human beings afterwards but I</font>

248
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,969
do understand the how badly people don't

249
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,409
want you to try it because you could

250
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,029
slip<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that you know you could be</font>

251
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,290
that kind of person and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font>

252
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,089
a weak-minded kind of person who does

253
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:53,550
that and um I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel like drugs</font>

254
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,010
are good for anything other than very

255
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,880
occasional recreational use and that's

256
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">just my opinion I don't look down on</font>

257
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,690
people who do it more frequently I just

258
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,470
feel like for me I don't want to because

259
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,990
of all of the repercussions and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

260
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way that I feel when I do it so</font>

261
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,050
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't offend too many</font>

262
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,510
people i know a lot of people who smoke

263
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,310
weed on a regular basis some people who

264
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,709
are my friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> but for me it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

265
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't make any sense to do that I feel</font>

266
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,820
like there's so many better outlets I

267
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,470
feel like if you want to let loose you

268
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,970
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just learn to let loose and not</font>

269
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,040
be so uptight I everyone always blames

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,230
everything on alcohol like that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

271
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,500
dumb<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me no like I saw a comment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

272
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,760
the video about me almost getting

273
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,260
molested or whatever and they were like

274
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,820
oh but if you were drunk imagine what

275
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,300
you would have done no no like alcohol

276
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,310
just gets rid of my inhibitions and

277
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,990
allows me to do the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

278
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,970
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to do unless I'm black</font>

279
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,580
out drunk right listen all my blackout

280
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,230
drunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and someone just comes in and</font>

283
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,720
like oh fuck i thought some I didn't

mean to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was really raped like</font>

285
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,529
that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that is the only way</font>

286
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:02,670
I'm gonna have sex with someone I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

287
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sex with alcohol allows you</font>

288

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be as inhibited by your own you</font>

289
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,400
no morals and insecurities and stuff and

290
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,600
allows you to do things you already

293
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,220
blame things on doing that it just

294
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,470
doesn't make any sense like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> my god</font>

295
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,870
you know and a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide behind</font>

299
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,620
only reason you didn't was because you

300
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,360
weren't as horny<font color="#E5E5E5"> as when you started</font>

301
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,890
drinking or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not something</font>

302
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,960
that changes your personality but anyway

303
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
uh there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if anyone had a good app in mind</font>

307
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,590
for a dictionary thing giving you new

308
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,360
vocabulary words like a new vocabulary

309
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">word of the day I found a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple but</font>

310
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,380
they always give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> really basic</font>

311
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,240
vocabulary words and i really love but

312
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,590
like something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love about myself is</font>

313
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,470
that I pride myself on having a pretty

314
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">extensive vocabulary and I want to work</font>

315
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,060
on improving that as well it's something

316
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I find fun improving and if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

317
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,250
just do that by you know getting in a

318
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">wake up call every morning telling me a</font>

319
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,100
new vocabulary<font color="#E5E5E5"> word that's actually</font>

320
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,720
advanced that would be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool I'm</font>

321
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
completely fine with having once in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

322
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">while of vocabulary word that I already</font>

323
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,720
know but giving me something like savage

324
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,820
and then the definition of savage

325
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,840
because the fuck does another definition

326
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,570
of savage like there are people is like

327
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,540
English second language like barely just

328
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,940

329
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,500
know what fucking Savage means I want

330
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,890
like a real like scholarly vocabulary

331
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,990
even if it's like Old English where you

332
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,210
know like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you read Shakespeare or</font>

333
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,590
something like that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes you a while</font>

334
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,610
to understand what the fuck they're

335
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about because it's written in</font>

336
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,880
such a weird way and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

337
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,160
spoke like Yoda back then or there were

338
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,470
words that aren't there like you know

339
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,250
antiquated words but um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I</font>

340
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,010

341
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,710
app that was teaching me<font color="#E5E5E5"> german and i</font>

342
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,160

343
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">german from just teaching myself on apps</font>

344
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,210
and looking things up that people said

345
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,520
or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know reading lyrics of mega hairs</font>

346

348
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,330
pretty cool if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys know anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

349
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,680

351
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,080
of the words and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

352
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking daunting task and it's not just</font>

353
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I really like the idea of</font>

354
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,200
integrating learning into my life in a

355
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">way that is not going to be taking up a</font>

356
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,810
lot of my time because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have a</font>

357
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,980
lot of time just sit around and learn I

358
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,200
used to sit around and read things about

359
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,769
psychology or like anomaly

360
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,360
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would read like out-of-body</font>

361
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,059
experiences or sleep paralysis all that

362
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,220
stuff interests me I read an article

363
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,129
about a guy who took a bunch of

364
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">different drugs and drew the same</font>

365
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:52,149
picture on you know each different drug

366
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:54,399
oh no he drew his self-portrait on each

367
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,569
different drug and sometimes it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

368
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:57,129
like fucked up shit and it was hilarious

369
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought that was interesting I</font>

370
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,129
thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very insightful and even</font>

371
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,929
if it was supposed to be kind of for

372
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,850
just for fun it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

373
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me so yeah let me know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that let</font>

374
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you feel about drugs alcohol</font>

375
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,790
weed and cigarettes oh yeah that's what

376
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about I think it goes</font>

377
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">without saying that i find cigarettes</font>

378
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,040
disgusting i think they smell very bad

379
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,459
it's like someone elected to slowly kill

380
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,649
themselves for no apparent reason just

381
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,089
because it relieves stress you need to

382
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,529
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to relieve stress go</font>

383
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:24,670
to the gym or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something you know like</font>

384
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,129
running really hard or lifting really

385
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:29,019
hard or like punching a bag or learning

386
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:31,389
you know some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jujitsu thing like</font>

387
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,339
that will really stress way better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

388
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">slowly killing yourself making yourself</font>

389
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,459
smell bad and making your teeth yellow

390
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,439
all that stuff is just awful I don't

391
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,480
understand why now that we've learned of

392
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,759
the health risks and everyone finds it

393
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,369
detest<font color="#E5E5E5"> full that people are still doing</font>

394
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:48,069
it I don't understand why we can talk

395
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:50,559
shit about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> though and not talk shit</font>

396
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,879
about someone's weight which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font>

397
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,730
slowly killing them like all of the

398
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,709
social stigmas in the world and all the

399
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:57,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we need to be politically correct</font>

400
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,929

406
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,290
feel about every single legal and

407
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,799
illegal substance basically in a

408
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,619
