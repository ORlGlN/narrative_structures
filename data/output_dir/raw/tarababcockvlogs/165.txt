what is it called the water that's the

45
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,439

fucking dollars a bottle and we weren't

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">like using them thinking like I whatever</font>

48
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">we could get like free water at the gym</font>

49
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">or like you know have though the water</font>

50
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,260
brought up with our room service and

51
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,180
stuff but we just like used all three so

52
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,519
fucking 18 times three dollars on water

53
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,440
and then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also three disowning</font>

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,150
is in the fridge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those de Sade's</font>

55
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,010
were like six dollars or eight dollars

56
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,440
or something it's pretty ridiculous how

57
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,590
like expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is to buy things or to</font>

58
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,870
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> room service with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oreos very weird</font>

59
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,000
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fine it was doable my phone</font>

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,980
bill was eleven hundred dollars and

61
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,130
sixty-eight 1111 hundred sixty eight

62
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,769
dollars yes I figured it out and Jays

63
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,989
with $75 because apparently this morning

64
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,660
is breakfast<font color="#CCCCCC"> was somehow put on him so</font>

65
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,230
yeah is 120 dollars a night and then the

66
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,549
flights were thousand dollars this is

67
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,280
like a two-thousand-dollar trip at least

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,390
which is really annoying because it's

69
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,950
such a close it's like an

70
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">hour-and-a-half flight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from Seattle so</font>

71
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,060
it's kind of annoying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I waited</font>

72
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long to book the flights and then it</font>

73
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,269
was like a negligible difference I think

74
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">I told you guys on patreon appear on my</font>

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,750
patreon but it was such a negligible

76
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,349
difference between a there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cocks man</font>

77
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,640
it was so funny yesterday um we were

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,129

82
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,000
didn't even realize like there's

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,560
something wrong with you if someone says

84
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,989
force you to take cocks and no one

85
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,459
