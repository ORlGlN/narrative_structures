00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,240
constraining and then also stretched out

102
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,800
sexuality<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a rare</font>

103
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,120
combination of beauty and sexiness and

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,680
that is why I follow you there are

105
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,760
thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful sexy people</font>

106
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,930
scattered across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet I follow</font>

107
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,890
you because of your intellect it is

108
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,450
axiomatic and permeates from your

109
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,890
content to your audience this is why I

110
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">find it comical when I read the comments</font>

111
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,170
of your videos where people refer you as

112
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,370
a dumb blonde or a slut it just shows

113
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,270
that they're missing the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are</font>

114
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,500
too focused on the venality of their own

115
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">lives to see the possibility of a</font>

116
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,720
different way of thinking what you are

117
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,710
creating is the epitome of having a

118
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,030
voice and inspiring others reevaluate

119
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,290
how certain social constructs especially

120
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,580
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes to sexuality are defined</font>

121
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,840
however when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes to black culture I</font>

122
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,590
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there are many misconceptions</font>

123

which you may subscribe at the block my

<font color="#CCCCCC">that it does not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cast shadows which will</font>
