exciting i've been playing that a little

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,049

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,500
couple seconds and it's like this weird

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,520
freezing we're like it freezes for like

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,990
two seconds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fine for five</font>

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,310
seconds and it freezes for two seconds

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,779
dude not cool so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like really hard</font>

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,160
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up my key bindings and</font>

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,840
stuff but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually finally</font>

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,450
figuring out FPS a little bit which is

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">making me excited let's go to the</font>

18
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,469
bedroom because i am lazy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,690
have anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do on the computer when</font>

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,430
the computers are injury I'm gonna

21
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,420
backpedal we're gonna go backwards to

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bedroom by course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to fold</font>

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,440
out ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yeah um I think I'm</font>

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,570
figuring out FPS I never really put FPS

25
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,770
growing up because well I played

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,180
something like I played doom obviously

27
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,300
and i played Wolfenstein Wolfenstein and

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,890
I played Oh what<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i play goldeneye</font>

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,770
double seven obbi but i never really

30
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,780
played like a military modern

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,250
first-person shooter or something like

32
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,680
Call of Duty or battlefield or anything

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,189
like that not even halo so yeah um

34
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,450
basically because it used to make me

35
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,250
really really dizzy and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it still</font>

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,420
kind of does like and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm playing</font>

37
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,380
through the campaign when I'm playing

38
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,909
the campaign I'm just walking around and

39
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,729
stuff I often get dizzy because there's

40
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,590
like shaking and a bunch of other weird

41
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,020
stuff but it's not as bad and I can play

42
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,670
definitely like multiplayer modes now

43
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,740
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool oh and I take a lot of</font>

44
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,780
tips from people on YouTube telling me

45
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,909
that I should keep my camera up high so

46
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,649
that when someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes up it's like I'm</font>

47
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,329
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a head shot I'm not like</font>

48
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,899
facing down toward the throw the ground

49
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,270
Oh what else play through the campaign

50
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,060
mode play<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs AI don't just jump into</font>

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,770
like a crazy multiplayer online game

52
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,200
where I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just totally gonna get stomped</font>

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,909
what else was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh a setup key</font>

54
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,320
bindings that are comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

55
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do the weirdest thing you know how</font>

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's WASD well instead of a and D I have</font>

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,959
it um enww<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tnw</font>

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,310
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's the end of you for the</font>

59
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,650
moving left and right strafing type and

60
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,310
then for s and D I have run and<font color="#CCCCCC"> crouch</font>

61
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,500
because putting my<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's my hand</font>

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,200
right I have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that to be</font>

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,480
moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and running with shift or</font>

64
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,099
control and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hurts my hand like</font>

65
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,390
crazy after a while and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

66
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,160
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost constantly running and then</font>

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,410
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Crouch I'd rather just be like</font>

68
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,330
right there as well so I kind of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

69
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,450
weirdly set up and I have let's say

70
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,269
melee is like C&V because I just

71
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">randomly like mash the keyboard what</font>

72
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,230
else do I have one will be like interact

73
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,569
the mouse scroll is switching between

74
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,360
weapons the mouse click or the middle

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,420
mouse click is um throwing a grenade or

76
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,750
whatever tactical things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are t like</font>

77
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,819
tactical things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay send Riley</font>

78
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,099
which is the dog Riley meshes are so

79
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,840
much fun I've played like two so far and

80
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,340
I'm just having a lot of fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

81
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">think i might do it let's play of call</font>

82
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,769
of duty ghosts is that weird because

83
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,720
most people are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh fuck the</font>

84
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,720
campaign this is a fucking multiplayer

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,130
heavy game all we care about is a

86
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,049
multiplayer you know but actually think

87
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,730
those military shooters definitely have

88
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,260
good stories like<font color="#CCCCCC"> so calm for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i played</font>

89
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,220
through the campaign and that's a

90
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,170
third-person shooter put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ps3</font>

91
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,690
so it doesn't count as a first person

92
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,190
shooter<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is a military shooter and</font>

93
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,870
I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that because in my</font>

94
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,269
pan there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more precision on a</font>

95
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,250
mouse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyboard for any kind of</font>

96
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,980
shooter then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like using the</font>

97
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">right stick to move the camera that's</font>

98
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,940
just like so clunky and weird to me and

99
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,910
there's like your<font color="#CCCCCC"> suppressed how far you</font>

100
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,919
can move the stick so it's it's kind of

101
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,120
weird where's the mouse it's like as

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,450
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you are you know and with you</font>

103
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,680
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> me playing starcraft and stuff like</font>

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,329
that I've gotten a lot better at using a

105
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,099
mouse so I'm more comfortable that way

106
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,049
but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I play something like outlast I</font>

107
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:58,370
definitely want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a controller</font>

108
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,109
because still overall i'm more

109
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,400
comfortable with a controller because i

110
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,730
spent what like 19 years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life</font>

111
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,510
using just you know joysticks analog

112
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,260
sticks controllers stuff like that so

113
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,030
it's definitely what I'm more used to

114
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,739
but when it comes to precision<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

115
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,630
definitely want a mouse especially like

116
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,329
my razer mouse my<font color="#CCCCCC"> orochi which is</font>

117
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,789
supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the travel mouse but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

118
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,349
use it because i have a smaller hand

119
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:24,830
like my

120
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,240
little hand if your hand is bigger than

121
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,919
your face you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> cancer you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

122
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:36,680
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean um yeah I think I have like 40</font>

123
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes left on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> render I think of</font>

124
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,979
it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a nap and then get up</font>

125
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,569
and play some call of duty on stream or

126
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:42,740
something like that I don't know or

127
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,150
maybe I'll just play some mario on

128
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,030
stream my friend cold wants to play some

129
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,210
call duty so I'm like sure why not and

130
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,270
I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know I'm having a good</font>

131
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,530
day so far i actually got up in the

132
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,590
morning i was showered by 9am<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now</font>

133
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,870
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like noon and that's it it's</font>

134
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:08,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome it's so amazing but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

135
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,500
to do anything else today just play

136
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,690
video games<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

137
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,639
uploading the losing my opportunity to

138
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">call of duty ghosts like as soon as the</font>

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,270
render finishes because it's like I

140
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,490
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to see what it's like</font>

141
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,259
to actually make content the day

142
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">something comes out and be excited for</font>

143
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,659
something to come out you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know cuz</font>

144
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,310
usually it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like okay I'll buy of the</font>

145
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,360
day it comes out if it's like one of my

146
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,069
favorite franchises like Assassin's

147
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,349
Creed god of war Metal Gear Solid

148
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,360
something like that you know but I

149
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,860
probably won't end up playing it for a

150
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,330
couple days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i definitely don't</font>

151
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,919
stream it or post videos like right when

152
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,659
it comes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like to really enjoy the</font>

153
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,610
franchise's that I love the most so it's

154
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,430
kind of intuitive for me to buy the game

155
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,750
right away and play right away but i'm

156
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,310
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create content right away</font>

like Matt covers over my phone to

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,349
dumb so I'll just chance it take chances

194
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,119
with it until I can put my glass cover

195
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,529
back on my phone because what happened

196
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,409
with my glass cover was I put it on

197
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:19,610
really sideways and there was like a

198
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,029
dust fuzzy underneath as well so when I

199
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:24,770
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting on this new cover that my</font>

200

202
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take it off since it came up</font>

203
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's really easy to take off um</font>

204
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,959
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like so badly done like I</font>

205
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,699
did a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really bad job I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

206
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,369
impatient at the at the AT&T store and I

207
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,259
was like fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'll do it myself and</font>

208
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,769
then I ended<font color="#CCCCCC"> up doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like terrible job</font>

wasn't my birthday last weekend they

212
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:54,829

213
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:57,259
time I had open my birthday is actually

214
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:00,860

216
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:06,860
awful it's almost mid it is mid<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 as I</font>

217
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,519
guess mid-20s is probably like 24 25 26

218
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:15,469
or something like that but getting older

219
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:17,119
I remember when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was 18 and everyone's</font>

220
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,069
like woh tera you've done so much for

221
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,050
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 now no matter how much I've</font>

222
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">done i can easily accomplish that and</font>

223
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,869
people have accomplished more by the

224
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">time they're 24 so i don't know i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna keep doing what I love and</font>

00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:31,579
enjoying life and hopefully I'll be

227
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,370
forever young maybe they can

228
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,318
cryogenically freeze me when I turn 30

229
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:38,568
and then I can wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> like centuries</font>

230
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,639
from now when you can like reverse back

231
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,068
like Benjamin Button where you just like

232
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,470
reverse back in age and I'll just stop

233
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,630
and freeze again when I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 just stay</font>

234
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,620
that way and I'll have all this

235
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,310
knowledge in like a 35 year old brain

236
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can apply it to being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 18</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again and</font>

237
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,650
looking 18 everything will be wonderful

238
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,570
and I'll live in a world where stuff

239
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,730
