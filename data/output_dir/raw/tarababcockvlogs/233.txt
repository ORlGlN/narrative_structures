00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050
hey guys and i'm back with another

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,909
BuzzFeed quiz and today I'm actually

3
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,100
sober we are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding out how</font>

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,259
much of a feminist BuzzFeed thinks I am

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,540
which is inconsequential but it's kind

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,710
of fun at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get to</font>

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about the stupid feminist issues</font>

8
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,070
and how stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> political correctness is</font>

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,170
and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> an SJ w well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also just taking</font>

10
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,330
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid test who doesn't love</font>

11
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,340
taking stupid tests right in reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,410
0% feminist I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,910
why people want to classify and label

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,650
themselves as one certain thing in the

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,480
first place much less<font color="#E5E5E5"> something is awful</font>

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,130
as feminism when you can totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

17
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,630
say you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a gala tarian if you want</font>

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,830
to say you're something and not

19
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,059
gravitate to all the negative

20
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,260
connotations that feminism has

21
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially in the Western</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

22
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,399
egalitarians work for equality if any

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,809
gala<font color="#CCCCCC"> therrien happens to see that</font>

24
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:40,950
there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of inequality for</font>

25
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,930
women at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point they work for women</font>

26
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,399
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say that there's an inequality</font>

27
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,170
associated with black still work for

28
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,309
blacks they don't need to make up

29
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">something called black lives matter or</font>

30
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,289
blackest I think the default position

31
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,059
most people hold is I'm an egalitarian

32
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,070
but I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to label myself because</font>

33
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,780
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the obvious but anyway let's</font>

34
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,859
go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this the first</font>

35
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,239
thing I see in the first problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

36
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,969
with it is find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how woke you</font>

37
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,979
are woke really if you're gonna use

38
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,409
unintellectual meme jargon you're not

39
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna be taken seriously by anyone who</font>

40
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,100
has an IQ over like 80 that's the soft

41
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,110
cap it might be even lower these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds</font>

42
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,030
of misuse vocabulary words are fine and

43
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,860
memes memes that you just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at for a</font>

44
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,820
second and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to make you</font>

45
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,960
chuckle and then you move on with your

46
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,210
day but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sporting like a strong</font>

47
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,130
stance or a political opinion you don't

48
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">use things like how woke you are guys me</font>

49
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,720
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's highly unintelligent</font>

50
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,700
and extremely unattractive when it comes

51
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,780
to actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

52
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,890
conversation with someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's go</font>

53
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,939
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do this we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't even gotten</font>

54
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,409
to the fucking test yet it's check all

55
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,570
that apply and this time I'm sober so

56
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,500
we're not gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> checking the wrong</font>

57
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,119
things I'm excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that part I</font>

58
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,799
would be willing to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> up some of my</font>

59
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,290
salary if i had to sew that equal pay in

60
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,450
my workplace could be a reality um no

61
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,850
why is that my fucking responsibility

62
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,340
why should I have to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

63
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,170
would that make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense in any form of</font>

64
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,670
reality oh so there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with</font>

65
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,530
equal pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> equality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just like so</font>

66
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,240
fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid no I would not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

67
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,770
before we go any<font color="#CCCCCC"> further I'm assuming</font>

68
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,090
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna happen here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there</font>

69
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a few things I do agree</font>

70
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">with and therefore I'm going to be</font>

71
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,290
labeled<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a feminist but a lot of these</font>

72
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to lack nuance they're</font>

73
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,890
going to not be in the right context and

74
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,508
have the right subtext to show how

75
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,099
stupidly feminists deal with these

76
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,200
issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

77
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,599
issues and how seriously feminists take

78
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,760
quizzes like this instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actually</font>

79
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,560
making a difference at all in places

80
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">where it matters like the Middle East I</font>

81
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,800
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that men and women should be</font>

82
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,300
equal I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> men and women</font>

83
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,819
should have equal basic rights I do not

84
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,200
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> men and women are equal I</font>

85
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,060
do not believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> each person is equal</font>

86
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,470
to the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> person I don't believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

87
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">human lives are equal to other lives or</font>

88
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,580
that each human life is equal to the

89
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,860
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I said this lacks nuance so</font>

90
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,330
I have no fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea if I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> click</font>

91
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,890
this let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just assume that they're</font>

92
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,420
saying in the general sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> where like</font>

93
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,220
we should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> equal basic human rights</font>

94
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,870
yeah I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can't help but</font>

95
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">be bothered when a song includes</font>

96
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,049
misogynistic lyrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when I</font>

97
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,790
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the song I absolutely</font>

98
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,170
don't give a shit about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I know who</font>

99
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,420
bell hooks is i dont and dont care to

100
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,310
google it i can define intersectional

101
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,650
feminism yeah but why is that going

102
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,810
toward me being a feminist that's just

103
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,160
because I watch a lot of videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font>

104
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,660
shit because it entertains me how people

105
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,190
they bunk the retardation that is

106
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,900
feminism and especially things like

107
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,730
intersectional feminism I don't use the

108
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,650
phrase hey guys we're referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

109
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,450
group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that includes men and</font>

110
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,099
women hey guys hey guys hey guys hey

111
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,870
guys hey guys hey guys hey guys hey guys

112
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,329
hey yes well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't be argued</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that my</font>

113
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,639
whole viewer base is men shout out to my

114
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,620
ten percent female viewers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes I</font>

115
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,209
definitely say hey guys in any

116
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,400
circumstance and the fact that feminists

117
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,480
think that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some kind of</font>

118
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,060
deep-rooted issue like words actually

119
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter and changing a word or phrase</font>

120
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,470
will change the world it just proves<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

121
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,910
fucking stupid they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've taken a</font>

122
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,920
woman's and/or gender studies class no i

123
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,420
haven't i actually had the opportunity

124
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that when i was in community</font>

125
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,150
college while i was in high school and I

126
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,290
turned it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down for creative writing</font>

127
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,440
because just infinitely more relevant I

128
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's important to encourage girls</font>

129
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,709
to pursue science and math as a career I

130
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,389
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important to encourage them</font>

131
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,609
if the interest is already there but I

132
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,200
do not think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important to tell</font>

133
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,639
them that those are the only fields of

134
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,859
study and places of work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

135
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,510
go to as if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only options they have</font>

136
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,280
are the ones that men find more

137
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,170
appealing statistically just so that we

138
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,660
can like decrease the wage gap pea you

139
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,040
know if you want to be in science if you

140
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,419
want to do math I don't know why you

141
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,459
would but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I definitely think that any</font>

142
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,019
gender any race should have the

143
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to do so and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leads us</font>

144
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,650
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one women should be allowed</font>

145
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,930
to apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a job if they fulfill sixty</font>

146
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,238
percent of the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements ah no</font>

147
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,680
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to apply for</font>

148
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,460
anything if they do not meet all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

149
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,790
required

150
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements they're not like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eleena</font>

151
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,720
it would be really nice if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

152
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,190
good at taping know it's like that is a

153
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,080
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the fucking job why</font>

154
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,910

166
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,150
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm not a piece of shit</font>

167
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,160
scum human being that doesn't see trans

168
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,930
people as whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to be seen</font>

169
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,280

170
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,450
labels and if you want to be seen as

life<font color="#CCCCCC"> who am I to judge I believe it's</font>

174
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,510
important to encourage women to

175
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,250
negotiate because women are so scared of

176
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,510
negotiating they go to the swap meet and

177
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,000
they get the worst prices yeah whatever

178
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">if they want to negotiate I don't</font>

179
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,090
understand why we have to encourage them

180
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,410
like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> a girls like no that seems like</font>

181
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,940
a fair price<font color="#E5E5E5"> err yeah that seems like a</font>

182
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,310
fair salary if you be like no you have

183
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,070
to fight tooth and nail to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

184
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,510
you don't deserve so I don't know how I

185
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,100
feel about that one again because<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

186
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,660
nuance I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jennifer Lawrence</font>

187
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,710
should earn as much as her female

188
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,020
co-stars there's nuance in that I also

189
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,490
don't like Jennifer Lawrence I don't

190
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">like her beliefs I don't like her</font>

191
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,700
censorship values I don't like the fact

192
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,470
that she prides herself on being not a

193
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,030
size<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero while still not being</font>

194
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,800
overweight and kind of making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people</font>

195
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,360
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually overweight feel bad</font>

196
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,010

199
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,740
should earn anything it is she doing the

200
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,720
exact same stuff with the exact same

someone else to elevate them up to my

level that's communism know if I had a

daughter which I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would not</font>

to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything yes that that's the</font>

258
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,179
fucking key word most feminists would

259
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:49,439
click this and then be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> holy shit</font>

260

<font color="#E5E5E5">literally anything she wanted to be I</font>

263
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,159
would make it clear to my daughter from

264
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,629
an early age that her identity should

265
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:02,519
never be defined by her relationship

266
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,349
status yeah your identity should also

267
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,239
never be defined by<font color="#E5E5E5"> what stupid fucking</font>

268
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,819
subculture you subscribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feminists I</font>

269
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,349
believe it's important to complement a

270
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:12,149
woman's intelligence over her looks

271
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely not especially of no</font>

272
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">intelligence is present and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

273
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,610
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that women are stupid I'm saying</font>

274
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to ascertain</font>

275
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,639
whether or not someone is intelligence

276
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,769
by just looking at them so obviously you

277
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:23,969
look at people more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you actually</font>

278
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,889
have a heart-to-heart conversation with

279
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,809
the person to decide whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not</font>

280
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:28,979
they're intelligent so there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

281
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,719
be more compliments on looks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

282
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,349
the main idea that I perpetuated in my

283
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:35,818
fucking feel free to fat video which has

284
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,229
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> five million views</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of</font>

285
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking hatred but a lot of people who</font>

286
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,679
are like wow this girl smart and you

287
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,969
know what they said that before they

288
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,740
said I have nice tits which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

289
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,899
clearly apparent way easier to see than

290
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,610
my intelligence if someone says I'm

291
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">intelligent that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean I'm ugly</font>

292
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,040
if someone says I'm hot that doesn't

293
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,490
mean I'm

294
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,110
intelligent I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some people it</font>

295
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,520
does but those people are idiots I

296
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,870
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a woman has the right to</font>

297
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,339
choose what happens to her body yeah I

298
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,500
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know unless her body wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

299
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,029
be outside of jail after she's just

300
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,040
murdered 40 people then yeah I'm

301
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,260
pro-abortion in an instance of sexual

302
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">assault against a female I am inclined</font>

303
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,290
to believe the assaulted person is

304
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,490
telling the truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> until proven otherwise</font>

305

<font color="#E5E5E5">found through YouTube and I trust that</font>

310
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,700
person I am not inclined to believe that

311
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,630
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not how the justice</font>

312
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,880
system works if I hear some random bitch

313
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,890
over in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other fucking state said</font>

314
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,510
that she got raped I'm not just gonna be

315
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,630
like yeah go bitch she's not lying women

316
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,120
never lie men always lie no I'm gonna

317
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,100
fucking look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evidence and I'm not</font>

318
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,320
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna form a solid opinion where</font>

319
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
I attack one side or the other because

320
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,380
I'm not the fucking justice system

321
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,240
innocent<font color="#CCCCCC"> until proven guilty it's</font>

322
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,130
unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rape is hard to prove</font>

323
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,899
but it needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be proven before you</font>

324
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,940
ruin the life of a guy I can explain

325
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,130
Marlene Dietrich's influence on women's

326
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,170
fashion nope I know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad feminist</font>

327
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,920
is all of them I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that women</font>

328
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,450
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to dress however they</font>

329
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,790
want without it dictating how they are

330
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,700
treated by society I agree to an extent

331
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,560
ok so i agree enough to click the button

332
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time you decide to dress</font>

333
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,000
a certain way and society will always

334
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,220
perceive you a certain way for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love</font>

335
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,380
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> body so much and I love working hard</font>

336
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,700
on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I love the clothes that I wear</font>

337
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,480
so much that I'm okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the obvious</font>

338
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,230
stereotyping that's going to happen with

339
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">me where people are gonna be like she's</font>

340
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,870
stupid she's only in her for attention

341
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,399
she's showing boobs for clickbait all

342
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,260
that shit I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with because I'm so</font>

343
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,510
secure with myself and because I care so

344
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,579
much to be myself but a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

345
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,020
who are looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a job they have to</font>

346
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,610
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can't dress a</font>

347
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,200
certain way if they want to fit into

348
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,850
society thankfully I'm kind of on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

349
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,610
outskirts of society being so reclusive

350
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,649
and having a job like<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube where I</font>

351
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,959
can be whoever I want but I think if

352
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,160
you're walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the street and</font>

353
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,410
you're dressed like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slut or your dress</font>

354
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,940
like a businessman it doesn't matter you

355
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,440
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the basic human rights so in</font>

356
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,149
that sense yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be treated</font>

357
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:55,860
equally or the same or whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck</font>

358
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,959
but when it comes to people making

359
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,240
assumptions based on how you look that's

360
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,010
just human nature and to tell of whether

361
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,390
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that person who's judging is a</font>

362
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:03,850
good /

363
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,709
is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not they just hold those</font>

364
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,569
instant instincts about a person forever

365
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:08,860
or if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have the</font>

366
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,810
open-mindedness to change their mind if

367
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,790
new evidence is presented like let's say

368
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,959
you look at me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like this</font>

369
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,880
fucking whore is so stupid she's a slut

370
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,589
and then I tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about fucking</font>

371
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,540
quantum physics or something you can't

372
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,639
keep thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a slut and stupid you</font>

373
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,920
have to now like shift your opinion and

374
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,300
it's fine to have those preconceived

375
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,370
notions I don't fall to people who come

376
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">into my youtube channel and say she I</font>

377
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,430
thought she was a dumb bimbo and now I

378
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,500
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> she is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a cool chick or</font>

379
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,420
whatever it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I immediately</font>

380
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,100
think something about a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on</font>

381
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,509
their looks but if they show me that

382
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:39,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're contrary to that I changed my</font>

383
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,540
opinion I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> never said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a woman</font>

384
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,550
asked for it I've probably made many

385
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,560
jokes to that effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> but never seriously</font>

386
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">no so I'm offended by catcalling not at</font>

387
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,910
all I think it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tacky and</font>

388
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,199
obviously you're probably not going to

389
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:51,579
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good response from that and if you</font>

390
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:52,990
do get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good response is probably a</font>

391
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,819
hooker or someone with a disease because

392
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:56,829
that's how our society is or me and

393
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,750
you're just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hot like you're</font>

394
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,370
like the buffest dude every I can't

395
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">bebek come over here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like but like</font>

396
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,509
someone finds<font color="#CCCCCC"> you attractive why were</font>

397
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:05,589
you so offended at that I don't

398
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:07,149
understand it's fine to object with the

399
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:09,040
way it's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in essence is just a</font>

400
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,779
harmless compliment I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> women</font>

401
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,370
should get VIP treatment at nightclubs

402
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,800
and bars just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for being women um I think</font>

403
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because they're the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minority</font>

404
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,730
and they want more of the minority to

405
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,680
come in so like ladies night is good

406
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,790
because they don't want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

407
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,500
sausage fest I think it's just marketing

408
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,350
I think when you go out to a club women

409
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,240
more often aren't looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mate so</font>

410
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,009
men have to try harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a mate so</font>

411
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:31,899
they do the free drinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and then</font>

412
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,209
if women decide and consents to doing

413
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:36,189
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's fine so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

414
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,540
fine I don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

415
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,740
there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are harder for men</font>

416
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,939
and things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are harder for women and</font>

417
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:41,860
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I would choose that it's</font>

418
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,480
harder for men in society but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

419
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,860
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have that opinion I think</font>

420
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,300
police brutality and its correlation

421
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,639
with race is a feminist issue no it's an

422
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,860
egalitarian issue or it's a fucking

423
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,259
justice system issue it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

424
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:55,959
little fucking niche group who fucking

425
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,449
cares about the bodies of supermodels

426
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:00,490
not your issue why did I click it I'm

427
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,170
doing that drunk thing again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

428
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,610
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop promoting models as the</font>

429
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,430
ideal female body type if someone is

430
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,089
promoting like this gaunt skinny

431
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,139
scary-looking girl who's been

432
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,839
photoshopped as the ideal I think we

433
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,059
should raise our<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

434
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:16,860
unhealthy which

435
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,060
raise our kids with knowing what's

436
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,310
healthy and what's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact that</font>

437
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,720
society is going to see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

438
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,520
isn't them attractive we need to teach

439
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,110
them to deal with that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach</font>

440
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,360
them to have a high self-esteem and to

441
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,970
love themselves no matter what society

442
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,900
says because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

443
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,570
portions of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are not like</font>

444
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,060
you that are praised or degraded you

445
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,250
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just base your self-worth on what</font>

446
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,570
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people think and I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so</font>

447
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,580
ridiculous how people want to censor

448
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,380
certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they find harmful</font>

449
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,150
when really you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just be taught</font>

450
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,560
how to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it because you can't</font>

451
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,500
change the bad people in the society or

452
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,290
the psychos in society or the way

453
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,970
marketing works and no I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

454
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,340
there's anything wrong with especially

455
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,660
when they're fit and they're beautiful

456
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,100
and they're thin I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font>

457
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,200
anything wrong with perpetuating that as

458
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,320
the ideal female body type in Western

459
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,270
society at this particular moment if

460
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,130
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

461
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,630
and it's not just society telling you to

society that's superficial but really

468
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,720
it's them because they're basing their

469
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,240
self-worth on what they look like

470
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,590
according to society I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

471
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,030
stop photoshopping women's bodies in the

media no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Photoshop can be a nice</font>

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,560
that make things look worse as a model I

475
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,390
have always put things in my portfolio

476
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,940
that showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> me exactly as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am I don't</font>

477
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,530
like nip and tuck parts of my body

478
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,090
because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who hire me to</font>

479
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,230
know exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I look like and that's</font>

480
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,000
what Polaroids are for where people ask

481
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick picture</font>

482
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,630
from all sides to know what you look

483
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,850
like exactly before they hire you but

484
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,310
when it comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is</font>

485
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,840
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be beautiful and supposed to</font>

look<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's a work of art why the</font>

487
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,380
fuck should we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go with what is a</font>

488
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent natural like that's the</font>

489
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,610
best thing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just stupid I like</font>

490
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,200
the way photoshopping on women's bodies

491
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,850
look but that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

492
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,070
have a blemish or a freckle I'm gonna go

493
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,900
kill myself because I know that that's

494
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,790
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's photoshopping I have</font>

495
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,040
never called a woman basi I have never

496
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,900
called a woman basi simply because i

497
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,610
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the word bossy is stupid I</font>

498
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,350
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have called a woman bitchy a</font>

499
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,600
cunt and all the other fucking words in

500
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,440
the dictionary they don't mean anything

501
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,390
and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the fact that</font>

502
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,830
men are assholes and women<font color="#E5E5E5"> are bitchy</font>

503
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,620
and if you call

504
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,120
a woman an asshole it kind of sounds

505
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,040
weird it's not because of sexism it's

506
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,470
just because that's the wording that's

507
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,540
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying her story instead of history</font>

508
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,500
just because you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

509
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,760
politically correct or some stupid shit

510
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,930
when you're talking about Joan of Arc

511
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,150
stop word policing and stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving a</font>

512
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,380
shit about things like that I think

513
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,670
company should offer more child-friendly

514
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,590
time and programs to women who are

515
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,750
having children I do not I think what

516
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,970
they are legally<font color="#E5E5E5"> offered is good enough</font>

517
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,620
I think you should have to think about

518
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to be a career centered</font>

519
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,300
person you should definitely not worry

520
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,830
about having kids at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment you</font>

521
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,630
need to like have your own priorities in

522
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,420
order and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think society or your</font>

523
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,460
fucking boss should have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

524
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for you I believe that a woman</font>

525
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,430
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> offered the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same opportunities</font>

526
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,410
for promotion as her male co-workers I

527
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,240
do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same opportunities not just</font>

528
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,130
handed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to her because she's a woman I</font>

529
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,840
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if a woman wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay on</font>

530
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,550
a date her date should let her fuck yeah

531
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,930
free money I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand why that</font>

532
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,820
would be a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe he does</font>

533
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,130
have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of issue with women if he</font>

534
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,470
doesn't want free money so bad that it's

535
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,270
like hurting his masculinity if he

536
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,010
allows another person to pay I believe

537
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that women should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy access to</font>

538
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,370
birth control I do I've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy access</font>

539
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,870
to birth control since I was like 14

540
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,880
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old I've loved the fact that</font>

541
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,860
exists I think it's very important to

542
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,510
teach<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids about their sexual</font>

543
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,130
reproductive organs reproductive health

544
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,900
how to not get pregnant if they do

545
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,820
decide to have sex but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the waiting is</font>

546
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,740
probably a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

547
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,730
actually ready for it it's a

548
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,800
case-by-case basis and I do believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

549
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,240
birth control should be really easy to

550
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">get I believe that in a relationship the</font>

551
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,630
domestic duties should be shared I do

552
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,790
not believe that should should ever

553
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,920
enter into my mind when I'm thinking

554
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else's relationship I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think you should do whatever the fuck</font>

556
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,720
you want with your relationship the

domestic<font color="#CCCCCC"> duties can be all in the guy</font>

558
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,440
all on the woman or you know you guys

559
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,880
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> live in squalor I don't give a</font>

560
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,770
fuck I think a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have equal</font>

561
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,660
responsibility over the aesthetic and

562
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,970
cleanliness of their home what the

563
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,710
fuck's should like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling people</font>

564
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,030
how they should live it's insane to me I

565
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,250
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that men should be encouraged to</font>

566
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,839
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved and make choices in the</font>

567
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">wedding planning process guys mostly are</font>

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,000
allowed to they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't want to</font>

569
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">because those types of things aren't</font>

570
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,609
interesting to them and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

571
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,140
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> married because they want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

572
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,520
perfect day<font color="#CCCCCC"> or that perfect dress or</font>

573
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,340
whatever so encouraged if they want to

574
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,840
they should be able to if they don't

575
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,310
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they shouldn't be pushed to but</font>

576
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,300
just like with the other ones with

577
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,310
encouraging women who want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or don't</font>

578
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,910
want to

579
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,050
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna click it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

580
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,730
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know it's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help in</font>

581
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,440
the wedding planning process why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

582
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,940
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> men and women i have the</font>

583
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,620
same emotional strength what is

584
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,650
emotional strength the strength in

585
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,610
emotions is that it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel the</font>

586
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> differently and you have like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

587
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,880
better time because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the highs</font>

588
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,790
and the lows of the world but emotions

589
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,350
generally are a flaw<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a weakness</font>

590
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,500
to me it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the absence of logic and</font>

591
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> men are often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

592
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,160
logical because of the way their brains

593
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,260
wired over women who are more emotional

594
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,840
because they are genetically predisposed

595
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,700
to having to be the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that raises the</font>

596
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">kids and be the bearer of the kids so</font>

597
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,150
emotional strength I don't know that is

598
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,740
so probably not because men and women

599
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,120
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> emotions differently not to</font>

600
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,770
say that there aren't a lot of emotional

601
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,020
men or that's wrong it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

602
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,850
fact I do not think that is the

603
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,530
responsibility of a man to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

604
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,900
woman physically I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is not</font>

605
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,490
the responsibility of anyone to stick

606
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,810
their neck out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else if they</font>

607
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,820
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to and I don't believe it's</font>

608
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,890
the responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> to society</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to not</font>

609
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,600
judge them if they decide to not help

610
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,230
the weaker being but women are as i said

611
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,120
before genetically the weaker of the two

612
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,580
genders and if a woman is in trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

613
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,320
a man is much bigger and has the means

614
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,970
to protect and it's not like a

615
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">life-or-death situation where he could</font>

616
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,910
just be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey man stop hitting her</font>

617
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,260
with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> fists not like a shooting</font>

618
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,240
situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

619
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,670
nice in my opinion for him to step in

620
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,320
and help but if it puts him in danger if

621
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,670
he doesn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to or if it's not his</font>

622
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,110
business I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that it's his</font>

623
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,520
responsibility at all no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't believe</font>

624
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,320
it's anyone's responsibility to protect

625
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,630
anyone else if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to and if</font>

626
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,790
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy is not protecting his girlfriend</font>

627
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,170
his girlfriend has the right to break up

628
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,340
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that men and women</font>

629
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,930
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be equally encouraged to express</font>

630
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,240
their emotions equal encouraged yeah

631
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,860
sure if they have those emotions or if

632
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,150
they feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like expressing them I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

633
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,530
like they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to I have never</font>

634
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,880
asked a woman why she does not have

635
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,440
children<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because there are people</font>

636
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">who seem like they would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

637
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,400
caretakers and the fact that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

638
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,380
a feminist test like if you have asked

639
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,880
someone that you're a fucking piece of

640
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,040
shit misogynistic sexist I think that's

641
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,390
ridiculous and it's just another fucking

642
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,070
way that people get triggered over

643
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,690
nothing literally if I see a woman who

644
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is good with taking care of her dogs I'm</font>

645
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,450
like why didn't you have children i'm

646
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,740
curious you're my best friend you can

647
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,970
tell me anything and that's like totally

648
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,440
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just being like a bitch</font>

649
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,330
why you not having<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids you 40 you're</font>

650
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,100
gonna fucking dry up soon it can't

651
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,150
believe that they don't take into

652
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,350
account than you wants and it's so

653
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,150
stupid and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

654
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is like a for fun test</font>

655
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,480
whatever this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually how feminist</font>

656
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,340
see these issues it's ridiculous I would

657
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,630
be equally excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a son or</font>

658
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,970
daughter yeah zero excitement from both

659
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,040
ends I think American workplace culture

660
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,660
is often not structured in a way that is

661
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,310
helpful or encouraging to women

662
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,890
succeeding no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't believe that I</font>

663
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,540
think women have a responsibility to

664
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">help and encourage other women to pursue</font>

665
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,930
their goals I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe any woman</font>

666
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,400
has a responsibility to do fucking

667
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,170
anything they don't want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless it</font>

668
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,120
is a law to do so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think women are</font>

669
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,500
equally capable to men to be the

670
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,880
president<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the United States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

671
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,640
debatable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I honestly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I think</font>

672
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there are women that would</font>

673
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,540
definitely be equally as capable to some

674
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,820
men but in like the broad spectrum of

675
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,620
things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know does the emotional</font>

676
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,810
aspect play a part is that a strength or

677
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,310
weakness i don't know maybe women<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

678
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,080
more capable Who am I to fucking say

679
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I don't have the statistics so I</font>

680
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,990
don't fucking know and I'm not going to

681
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,810
click this I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that women have no</font>

682
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,380
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a conscious</font>

683
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,090
effort to always be friendly and polite

684
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,800
why the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuck are there so many things</font>

685
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,660
saying what people should and shouldn't

686
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,020
do but then just the the basic being

687
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,060
friendly and polite is not something

688
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we should as feminists believe like</font>

689
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,010
what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck this is ridiculous it's</font>

690
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-sided it's got an agenda and a</font>

691
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,360
narrative<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in and</font>

692
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,010
she's fucking ridiculous I believe this

693
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,020
yeah nobody has a responsibility to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

694
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,910
nice or polite I'm often<font color="#E5E5E5"> not nice or</font>

695
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,010
polite if I don't feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

696
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,260
or that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person deserves me to be</font>

697
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,360
and I don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's a gender</font>

698
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,830
thing at all I have never criticized a

699
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,420
woman for not wearing makeup or wearing

700
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,300
too much makeup criticized<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I've</font>

701
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,800
definitely said you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> look really</font>

702
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,630
pretty if you got your eyelashes done or

703
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,340
he/she would be really pretty if she

704
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,260
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like white makeup on</font>

705
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,270
her lips and went with a more like

706
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,830
natural color or something it's not me

707
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,590
criticizing that person it's me telling

708
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,930
them my preferences if that makes any

709
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,460
sense I<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely have open to people</font>

710
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,500
being like I would rather you not tan I

711
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,000
would like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> better you would be</font>

712
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,470
hotter if you had smaller boobs that's

713
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,910
your opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're entitled to it</font>

714
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I'm a public figure I'm allowed</font>

715
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,260
you know that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of criticism from all</font>

716
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giving me that</font>

717
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,290
criticism and I have no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

718
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,060
i'll just be like nah not my thing or

719
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,260
yeah that's interesting i'll check it

720
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,760
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't see why people take so much</font>

721
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,190
offense to you know just saying hey you

722
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,990
would look hotter or you would look less

723
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,550
hot if you did this thing like that's

724
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,410
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a personal preference take it or</font>

725
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,149
leave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe a woman is a woman</font>

726
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,739
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is what she calls herself</font>

727
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:10,149
regardless of her physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> attributes</font>

728
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,029
and makeup<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I believe that you</font>

729
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:14,739
should be whatever the fuck he wants I

730
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:16,149
also believe that people get so caught

731
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:18,159
up in this they don't tell their doctors

732
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,779
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a pre-op or post-op</font>

733
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:22,299
like transgender and that can cause

734
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,619
problems because we're different

735
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:26,049
anatomically based on how we were born

736
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,580
and like what part of the process you're

737
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,899
in when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking hormones I think</font>

738
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:31,179
all of that is relevant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care</font>

739
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,009
but when it comes to like what I call

740
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:34,899
you or what I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as like it's up to</font>

741
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:37,089
me to make my opinion about you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

742
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,159
up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to tell me what you think and</font>

743
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:41,169
if I accidentally use the wrong pronoun

744
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:43,059
and that triggers you forever you have

745
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,099
the right to not be my friend show me my

746
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,979
results you checked out 25 out of 50 on

747
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:51,339
this list you are pretty woke pretty

748
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,559
woke and definitely try to stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> informed</font>

749
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:54,999
about what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world of</font>

750
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,529
feminism and how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it better</font>

751
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:58,960
what is there like a bad if I did none

752
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,269
of these would it even tell me anything

753
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:03,219
let's see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i click none</font>

754
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:05,409
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's click one I can</font>

755
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:06,879
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> why seventy-eight cents on the</font>

756
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:09,190
dollar is not an accurate description of

757
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,249
the wage gap<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you know your fair share</font>

758
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:14,169
one you know your fair share about them

759
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,239
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is like just trying to like</font>

760
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,589
jerk you off to make you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

761
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:18,999
feminists are nice when all these

762
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,460
questions are clearly loaded agenda

763
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,379
whoring awfulness like this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

764
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,479
worst shit ever I had fun talking about

765
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">these issues though it's not like I'm</font>

766
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:29,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">not mad I just really enjoy talking</font>

767
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:31,599
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things based on my</font>
