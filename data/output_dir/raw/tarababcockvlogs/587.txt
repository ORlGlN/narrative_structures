viewership and stuff and everyone was

46
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,740
really interested to see a Tristan would

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,259
win and I through two games kind of on

48
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,500
purpose because I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

49
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,790
easily beat him<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the first game</font>

50
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,470
was like easy peasy he played zerg<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

51
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,360
played Terran um I thought he was

52
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,920
platinum but he seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot lower</font>

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,409
level than I am and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily beat him</font>

54
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,720
when I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac rowing and stuff but one of</font>

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,750
the games i went to a proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to racks and</font>

56
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,560
i passed his<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlord with my suvs when</font>

57
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,200
i went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make um the racks so he</font>

58
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,729
like checked it and obviously I'm right

59
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,860
there like making my rack so that got

60
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,810
screwed over and then he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just decided to</font>

61
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,038
build a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of links to defend and</font>

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,319
then run across the map and that kind of

63
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:13,710
sucked

64
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,510
me so that's when I through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

65
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,000
also grabbed all of well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,590
actually one that did i win that I don't

67
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,760
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> which 1i one but i did</font>

68
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,050
something silly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya know i think i lost</font>

69
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and then i did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one where I just</font>

70
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,390
probe rushed well SUV rushed or just

71
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,650
grabbed what my SUVs went across and

72
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,200
obviously drones win so he won that and

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,880
I was pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much just wanting to level</font>

74
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,110
the playing field because at that point

75
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,360
it was 22 and then at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last game we</font>

76
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
went for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> base treated like the most</font>

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,660
crazy bass trade so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really</font>

78
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,670
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like an intense best of</font>

79
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,650

<font color="#E5E5E5">our schedules because he won fair and</font>

84
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,870
square and even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't win I was</font>

85
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,970
planning on going anyway because he made

86
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,160
the most amazing thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me I've never</font>

87

yours it's like I'm more entertaining

213
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,340
the most streamers or 8 i'm assuming i

214
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,719
mean the league streams I've watched I

215
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,400
definitely mortar<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken them maybe I'm</font>

216
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,189
just overconfident but um I think it's

217
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,870
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't play ranked enough and</font>

218
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,370
the fact that I don't play ranked means

219
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,620
I eat I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know if I'm ranked or</font>

220
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,419
if I'm bronze or what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

221
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,439
I like barely play it but I'm gonna

222
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,270

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,409
you who want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch me play league</font>

225
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Veigar in a remand in ranked so yeah we</font>

226
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,849
willing ranked 5 which is pretty cool

227
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:50,159
but and we're winning like every game

228
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,069
because half of us are like really good

229
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,110
and I'm decent and we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't deserve</font>
