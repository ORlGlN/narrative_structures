bored of Jay I get really annoyed and

61
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,579
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of deal breakers with</font>

62
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,680
knowing people intimately like I'll find

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,939
someone and be like oh he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool</font>

64
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,320
he's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting and then like</font>

65
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
10 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> later he'll do something</font>

66
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,020
absolutely awful or a month later

67
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,729
doesn't matter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like kind of like</font>

68
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,560
oh I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to waste any more</font>

69
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,350
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this person so they've</font>

70
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,730
go into the acquaintance pile and

71
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,110
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a thousand billion people</font>

72
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,540
that I know and then I spend time<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

73
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,790
like if I'm at a modeling shoot and

74
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,630
there's people that I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

75
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,630
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> or people that you know go hang</font>

76
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,800
out at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same place as they hang out</font>

77
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,930
with a tour like when I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

78
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,020
starcraft conventions and Starcraft

79
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,670
tournament and when I go to magic

80
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,510
tournaments all that stuff there's

81
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,740
people that I know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

82
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that I know and because i'm so</font>

83
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,440
confident now going a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will</font>

84
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">flock to me and i'll have people in my</font>

85
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,120
group and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never really alone but</font>

86
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean I really consider</font>

87
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,060
those people friend friends I don't know

88
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,550
if it's because I hold the word friend

89
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,170
to a higher standard but I don't like

90
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,580
invite people over to my house I don't

91
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,290
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to parties I don't go over to other</font>

92
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,240
people's houses when I have free time

93
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,160
whenever I do have free time I prefer to

94
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend it on the couch hanging out with</font>

95
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,780
Jay watching TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing video games and</font>

96
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,040
having sex like that's what I want to do

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,750
I feel like anything else is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

98
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,240
waste of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't really hang out</font>

99
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">with people that often like I'll carpool</font>

100
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,620
with Jesus to magic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll spend the</font>

101
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">day at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Magic and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk and we'll</font>

102
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,990
hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and in between rounds will be</font>

103
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,830
sitting together and we'll be talking

104
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things but I don't like it's been</font>

105
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,810
a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time since I've been to any kind</font>

106
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like party with him or he's come over</font>

107
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,320

108
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,690
something that I do and I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

109
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people feel pressure to do stuff</font>

110
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,000
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I say that the people</font>

111
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,820
who watch my channel or who watch my

112
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,740
streams or who comment in the comments

113
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,030
section feel more like family and

114
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">friends than my actual family and</font>

115
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,090
friends I actually mean that like I'm

116
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,860
more interested in reading the comments

117
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,750
section that I am going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to some</font>

118
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,310
house party of my friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

119
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider to be my friends in real life</font>

120
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,700
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really weird I feel like I connect</font>

121
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,500
more with someone when it's kind of like

122
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,990
a superficial we have the same interests

123
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,330
we're both into games or manga or you

124
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,610
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> both into you know exploring</font>

125
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,230
the psychology or sociology like that

126
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,850
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is more interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

127
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,070
like talking to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys and</font>

128
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,880
appreciating that you guys support me

129
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,290
that's more interesting than going to a

130
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,540
party with my friends and moreover<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

131
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,040
always felt like it's kind of fucked up

132
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,960
that my real life friends don't actually

133
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,830
support my<font color="#CCCCCC"> um my gaming career and my</font>

134
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,050
vlogging career as much as you guys do

135
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,298
it's like fans<font color="#CCCCCC"> or closer friends than my</font>

136
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,560
friends are and my friends are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

137
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,358
obviously trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be cool if I not</font>

138
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,280
supporting it that much but I mean my

139
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,010
subscribe

140
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,740
is on my my twitch channel a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

141
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,090
friends aren't even my subscribers in

142
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,890
fact I only like one friend other than

143
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,990
Jay who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually taking money out of</font>

144
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,400
our joint bank account<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

145
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,660
subscriber just to show his support

146
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,430
because he's actually a friend I've

147
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,390
always thought it was kind of ridiculous

148
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,220
like if I had a friend who had a startup

149
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,470
business or who had a Kickstarter

150
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,150
campaign or a patreon campaign like

151
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,460
anyone I know who is a patron on my

152
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,360

187
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,010
live with and when I spend too much time

188
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,420
with them they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really annoying and</font>

189
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,650
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of be overbearing because</font>

190
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,390
their parents so it's kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

their morals on me which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something i</font>

198
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,740
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is terrible when a parent does</font>

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,600
that they didn't tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how to</font>
