shirts with them on them their names on

25
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,340
them in things and I've also my entire

26
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,530
life had a terrible fucking time trying

27
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,539
to find clothes that had logos and

28
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,949
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I actually really liked but</font>

29
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,750
had like fabric and styles that I could

30
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,340
actually wear and this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

31
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,960
me having big boobs this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

32
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,730
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feel in the texture of the</font>

33
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">clothing and like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> styles have you</font>

34
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,730
ever found a shirt design that you

35
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,170
really liked whether it's like a gamer

36
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,090
thing or someone's merch and then you

37
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,920
touch it and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a standard</font>

38
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,619
like five cent shirt that feels really

39
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,510
rough doesn't cling to the body at all

40
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,250
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't flattering and then</font>

41
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,960
you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll wear it because I</font>

42
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,159
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe in the thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it said</font>

43
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the shirt but it's nowhere near your</font>

44
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,460
favorite shirt because of how it doesn't

45
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,960
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it fits you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well I've had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

46
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,820
problem every fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> day of my life and</font>

47
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,049
I'm also blessed to know someone like

48
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,700
Jay who's really picky about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font>

49
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
clothes he wears because he feels the

50
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,790
same way like we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out we see shirts</font>

51
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,290
with like superheroes and gaming related

52
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,820
things on it and he like really wants

53
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,380
the shirt but there's no possible way

54
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,119
for me to be able to shop online for him

55
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,439
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he always has to feel the</font>

56
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,759
texture of the shirt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how it fits</font>

57
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,470
on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> body really particular about that</font>

58
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,670
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so with this</font>

59
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,890
merchandise line my first objective was

60
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,479
to choose i'd have like this giant

61
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,430
expansive<font color="#E5E5E5"> catalogue which shirts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

62
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,930
wanted to print my logos and things on

63
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,729
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went through and it took me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

64
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,470
two hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i just went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there like</font>

65
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,850
the whole catalog and i was looking for

66
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,990
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're really soft really</font>

67
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,850
triblend things like this they kind of

68
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,350
have a heather pattern you know like the

69
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,579
bunch of different colors mixed in

70
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,070
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are soft and comfy and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

71
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally found the ones I</font>

72
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,380
so that was my first objective not just

73
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,479
like standard crewneck crappy shirts

74
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,459
that I just post my face on I wanted

75
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to be comfy and natural and</font>

76
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,489
something you would wear if it didn't

77
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a logo on it and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font>

78
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,280
pretty good<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that objective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

79
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,900
second thing I wanted was to not just

80
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,790
like plaster my face everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to</font>

81
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,400
like make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it super narcissistic with</font>

82
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,049
just like pictures of<font color="#CCCCCC"> me modeling and</font>

83
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,760
things like I wanted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be part of</font>

84
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,230
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a few that have me on</font>

85
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,970
them like the gamer girls are sexy one

86
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,950
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old school one but I wanted them</font>

87
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to also make a statement of something</font>

88
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I would actually wear gaming</font>

89
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,290
related things things for my streams and

90
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube channel I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

91
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find something on my store that you</font>

92
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,579
would wear if you didn't necessarily

93
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,590
know who I am and that was the thought

94
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,870
behind my favorite one I love this

95
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,910
fuckin heartbreaker design so all these

96
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,799
designs were inspired by me I thought of

97
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,420
these designs I told the<font color="#CCCCCC"> creators what I</font>

98
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,280
wanted and I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them finish</font>

99
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,019
changing it until it was perfect I'm

100
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,209
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys once again perfectionist now</font>

101
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,620
in the past when I tried out<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

102
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,599
merch I tried making the designs myself

103
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,459
and I'm like a decent<font color="#CCCCCC"> too graphic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design</font>

104
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,260
decent at Photoshop but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could never</font>

105
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,480
like just make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect you know there</font>

106
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,739
were things that I couldn't do so the

107
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,810
fact that I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> portray my ideas to</font>

108
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,920
someone who actually knew what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

109
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,329
doing a hundred percent and as a

110
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,280
background in making clothing lines was

111
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,709
amazing I got exactly what I wanted my

112
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,209
second favorite design is this one my

113
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,160
idea behind it was obviously like raging

114
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,420
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of playing video games but i also</font>

115
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,829
wanted like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> retro feel right so i</font>

116
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,120
wanted the controller there and all I

117
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,410
told<font color="#E5E5E5"> them was I wanted it to be about</font>

118
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,569
rage I wanted this quote here raging is

119
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,130
healthy let it out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

120
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,900
have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cuss words on it and I</font>

121
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,920
wanted it to maybe have like a

122
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,599
controller and they did exactly what I

123
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,099
wanted like you can't see it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

124
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,959
but the outline of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the controller is</font>

125
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,669
actually a bunch of cuss words bitch

126
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,470
shit fuck and just things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say</font>

127
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,880
when you're raging and I just love it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

128
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,139
much oh my god and then my third

129
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,690
favorite design is this one it's me<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

130
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Atari shoot with red hair where I'm</font>

131
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,410
like orgasming amongst all these really

132
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,450
really old amazing Atari games with my

133
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,400
Atari shirt on and I like they made the

134
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,810
center of the attention me but they also

135
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,040
still kept the games in there like

136
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,419
that's amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact that it says</font>

137
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">old-school underneath and I made them</font>

138
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,359
choose the retro font it's just so

139
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,220
perfect to me it completely encompasses

140
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,169
exactly how I feel as a gamer how games

141
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:03,430
just simply aren't made the way they

142
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">used to be whether it's difficulty or</font>

143
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,120
depth and as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love modern games</font>

144
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,709
my childhood is always<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna be at the</font>

145
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">forefront when it comes to what made me</font>

146
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
a gamer those memories that nostalgia

147
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,900
it's the best and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font>

148
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,310
