basically just been having<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun playing</font>

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,490
league in magic and doing all the

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,529
awesome things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we like to do but a</font>

12
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of things have been happening for</font>

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,699
christmas i think i showed you guys

14
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,740
mostly what I got I didn't really get

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,960
any gift so that I got like 10 games

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,520
from you guys on steam which is fucking

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,910
amazing um let's see hitman absolution a

18
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,870
foul space fuckin a bunch of other ones

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,070
so I'm really excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because</font>

20
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,020
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gives me a lot more options</font>

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,379
when it comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my losing my virginity</font>

22
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,420
series and I think I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play hitman</font>

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,920
absolution as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's play because</font>

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,809
hitman is one of my more favorite

25
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,730
franchises I would say and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

26
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">played absolution yet I was really</font>

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,390
excited about it i think two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font>

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,100
at e3 but I never actually got around to

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,620
playing it so I'm excited to do that

30
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,750
something I really hated it was a hitman

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,260
movie like I liked the movie it's like

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like cowering what I just said</font>

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,420
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the movie but the guy that they</font>

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">um got for the movie I felt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like he was</font>

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,369
way too like not the way hit man should

36
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,650
be they made<font color="#E5E5E5"> him seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me like some</font>

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,580
like weird like awkward shy guy who's

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,409
never been around a girl before but he's

39
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,259
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be like a colic he's not</font>

40
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,450
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have those kinds of like</font>

41
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,880
silly emotions although it makes the

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,500
character hotter to me because I like

43
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,090
that kind of weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> like virgin asst</font>

44
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,650
thing it's not what I want hit man<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

45
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,640
know I'm saying it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if they make</font>

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kratos like some mama's boy cry baby</font>

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,210
right it wouldn't make any fucking sense

48
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,430
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys probably won't agree i</font>

49
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,600
mean my roommate doesn't even agree with

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,180
me this bra makes my boobs look huge cuz

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,040
it pushes them up actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny</font>

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,780
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i never wear a push-up bra I</font>

53
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,939
pretty much ass wear a bra for support

54
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,950
with an underwire but when I wear a

55
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,860
push-up bra they're like ginormous Gant

56
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,439
'ok and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can just like put this here</font>

57
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,490
and you would even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know i have boobs</font>

58
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,740
which is awesome so friday night magic

59
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,139
was the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i played my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

60
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,270
blue deck and my mom my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mono glue deck</font>

61
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,260
is a net meta

62
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,849
that someone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it's not</font>

63
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,260
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I made and it's the first</font>

64
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,930
time that I'm actually playing meta deck

65
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,519
and basically because it makes sense to

66
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,129
me someone from the shop was telling me

67
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,299
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people from the shop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

68
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,650
we're telling me that it makes more

69
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,540
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a new player to play a net deck</font>

70
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,489
or a meta deck because it helps you

71
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,860
learn not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only that how the meta is and</font>

72
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,069
how like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deck is supposed to operate</font>

73
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,110
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current meta against other meta</font>

74
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,480
decks but it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to just learn the</font>

75
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,890
mechanics and to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's</font>

76
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">like more straightforward like an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aggro</font>

77
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,090
or devotion deck is really going to help

78
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,709
me learn so I've decided to stick with

79
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,840
the model blue deck for at least a month

80
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,549
to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and when</font>

81
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,260
the new set comes out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the GP is</font>

82
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,269
over and all that I can like add to it

83
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:56,040
or change it or maybe make my own deck

84
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,870
or switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a different meditech right</font>

85
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,269
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sticking to the model blue and I</font>

86
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,420
am passively passively I keep telling my

87
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,040
friends the site it's like a John going

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
joke now that I've told them I'm

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,450
passively building my red green monster

90
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,519
deck as well because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

91
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,780
German garrix which are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite</font>

92
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,730
cards ever Garrett is so fucking sexy

93
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,590
and then I have them in German I have

94
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,790
two German ones and then the German

95
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,590
emblem um and I also have this awesome

96
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,870
land it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Terrell and a sexy Terrell</font>

97
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,329
and I don't have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I I think I</font>

98
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,889
let my friend borrow it today and I

99
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,359
didn't get it back but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

100
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:31,230
and fifty dollars because it's

101
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,590
commissioned artwork on a foil land

102
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,859
basic land and it's me in my school girl

103
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,660
outfit with the under boob licking a

104
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,639
lollipop it's fucking awesome i have to

105
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,650
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys I can't wait to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you</font>

106
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,540
but anyway the best I had ever done

107
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,590
before that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a 13 in friday night</font>

108
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,690
magic with a the exception of a couple

109
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,139
like single games not actual sets but

110
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,810
this week<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went to two and i should</font>

111
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,220
have beaten<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris you guys know Chris</font>

112
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,349
he's brown<font color="#E5E5E5"> sugar from my stream um but</font>

113
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,389
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should have beaten him</font>

114
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,079
because he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing red agro mono red</font>

115
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,799
yeah and um two of the games out of the

116
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,548
three he<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking like I had lethal on</font>

117
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,310
the board and I just swung incorrectly

118
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,010
and lost it sucked so if I hadn't miss

119
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,419
played if I was a more experienced

120
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,800
player I would have easily beaten him

121
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,970
all three games there wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

122
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,590
three games because I would beat<font color="#E5E5E5"> him all</font>

123
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,390
three games but I easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> made him the</font>

124
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,700
first and that's why I didn't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3-1</font>

125
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,890
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pretty huge step up okay</font>

126
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,290
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine I'm a good player I would</font>

127
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,600
have gone 31 instead of 13 just because

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,340
I switched<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a deck that makes sense in</font>

129
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,080
the current meta instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

130
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my own because like it makes sense</font>

131
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,790
that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the knowledge of magic</font>

132
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,710
yet to be making my own deck and like

133
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,810
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> those hard decisions and thinking</font>

134
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,760
about what can be counters to the things

135
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,280
that I made and then when I do play test

136
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,780
it I've been play testing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel</font>

137
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,650
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am finally getting decent at the</font>

138
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,880
mechanics of the game even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's</font>

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,680
like such a complex game like you think

140
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,200
it's not that bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's so many</font>

141
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,280
things you have to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many</font>

142
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,590
triggers that you can miss like I don't

143
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it gets crazy but I'm really liking</font>

144
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,110
it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down one I have</font>

145
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,580
a one drop which is awesome it's either

146
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,280
a judge's familiar or a cloud fan<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raptor</font>

147
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,990
claw from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raptors cool because it</font>

148
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,060
evolves and evolve means that any time

149
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,440
something enters the battlefield that

150
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,750
has a higher toughness or or whatever

151
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,840
what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> word for fucking damage</font>

152
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,520
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it whenever a creature</font>

153
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,900
enters abella that has more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that on</font>

154
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">your side he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually gains a +1 +1</font>

155
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,580
counter to try to evolve you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

156
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,990
things in magic that actually makes

157
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,610
sense in real life like chained to the

158
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,330
rocks is something where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of</font>

159
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,810
just take control and have a creature

160
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,210
that your opponent owns attached to a

161
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,760
mountain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whenever that enchantment</font>

162
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,250
dies which is the chains or the mountain

163
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,710
dies you get your creature back so like

164
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,030
imagine like you have a cloud for a

165
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,010
raptor like a little rapidly and then

166
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,080
you put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and attach it to rock so it's</font>

167
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,240
fucking awesome it's like really literal

168
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,950
and i love that something i want to do

169
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,479
later down the line<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm like skipping</font>

170
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,590

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,940
situation going on right so like um for

instance a cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> fin raptor attached to</font>

179
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,289

community if I'm people who have similar

257
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,630
interests and not only similar interests

258
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,149

have a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of humor and stuff</font>

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,220
let's say one out of every three people

262
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,110
