3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,679
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't usually do and</font>

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,389
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be covering a popular</font>

5

topic that's going on on YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,230
now and the reason I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do</font>

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,120
that often is because I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a lot</font>

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that are going on like the</font>

00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,850
give a shit about it it seems shallow

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,450
and stupid and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't care and for</font>

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,640
me to like manufacture an opinion just

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,140
to make people click on my videos kind

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,750
of just very icky to me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

15
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people do that the same with</font>

16
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,290
like ALS bucket challenge and a bunch of

17
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,510
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things it was like not so much</font>

18
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">helping other people or doing what your</font>

19
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,860
subscribers want you to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more just</font>

20
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,140
you know pandering to more views in a

21
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,649
wider audience without actually having a

22
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,180
good reason to do so you know and when I

23
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,739
have an opinion on something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

24
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">a huge topic I do want to talk about it</font>

25
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,890
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have an opinion you</font>

26
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,960
know and today I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about</font>

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">my thoughts on the nicole arbour</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versus</font>

28
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,290
Matthew Santoro shit and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is</font>

29
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,630
just like really hating nicole arbour

30
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,700
and has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so since her fat is</font>

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,590
bad or whatever the fuck video that was

32
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,260
my video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did before she released that</font>

33
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,510
one a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> called fat is bad which is</font>

34
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,740
basically just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the same thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

35
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,150
it's more philosophical than it is

36
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,580
satirical<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's more just like me</font>

37
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,890
clearly thinking about what is good for

38
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,590
society and stuff like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

39
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,000
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's something that is in the</font>

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,930
same vein just less meant to be you know

41
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,460
shocking like hat it doesn't have the

42
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,700
shock value type of thing so um first of

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,920
all I've watched both videos all videos

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,619
relating the topic because i have run

45
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:42,439
out of videos to watch when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do cardio</font>

46
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,490
and it's funny because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of my</font>

47
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">favorite youtubers upload things like</font>

48
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,500
twice a week or once a week and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do</font>

49
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,380
cardio up to two times a day sometimes

50
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,640
depending on when Jay goes to the big

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,130
gym where I'm here on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my treadmill so I</font>

52
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,439
have to watch a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of fucking content</font>

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,079
um I am very happy I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say this I</font>

54
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,000
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to preface this by saying that I'm</font>

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,860
very happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that someone like Matthew</font>

56
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,739
Santoro is willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be so emotional on</font>

57
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,209
camera and willing to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

58
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">something so personal I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,830
some

60
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,900
great about vlogging I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's</font>

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,370
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to do and if I had</font>

62
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,720
more drama in my life I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would definitely</font>

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,050
be more open about it I just there's a

64
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,260
huge bad taste in my mouth from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

65
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he is conducting himself in this</font>

66
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,240
matter and the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

67
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,060
transpired on his end and while i'm

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,590
pretty sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the things he's</font>

69
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,620
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about her true and i'm pretty</font>

70
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's being mostly genuine we</font>

71
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,360
can honestly never know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

72
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,710
that I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put out there because I</font>

73
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,330
know that my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion is not going to be</font>

74
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">very popular i know people see Matthew</font>

75
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,110
Santoro and they're like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy is the</font>

76
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,820
nicest<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy in the world how could we</font>

77
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,220
ever hate him someone has hurt him he's

78
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,560
crying he's clearly the victim but I

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,570
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that in itself is the problem</font>

80
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,660
with Matthew Santoro not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> is he like</font>

81
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,510
too nice and too politically correct

82
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,190
when I see someone who's too nice and

83
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,880
too politically correct I genuinely

84
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,200
don't love them because I see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,580
being fake like there are people who are

86
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">just nice but people who like are afraid</font>

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,080
of certain topics or stray away from

88
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,040
certain things I the general public will

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,650
often like them but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find them as</font>

90
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,760
interesting or don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as much</font>

91
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,220
and it's obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when there's gonna</font>

92
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,720
be a conflict between someone like

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,760
Matthew Santoro and someone like nicole

94
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,769
arbour who's offended literally everyone

95
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,320
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me it feels like people are</font>

96
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,850
gonna side with Matthew Santoro because

97
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,830
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person but really how much</font>

98
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,300
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know about him how much has he</font>

99
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,519
divulged he said so many times in his

100
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,989
vlog channel which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've tried to watch</font>

101
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,230
that uh he doesn't really want to show

102
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,180
everything to the world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

103
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,470
are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in his life that he</font>

104
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,700
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep private and that's</font>

105
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's fine that's you know</font>

106
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,120
your teaches own that's something you

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do that's good you're a huge</font>

108
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,810
youtuber you often don't want your whole

109
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">world just professed to the internet</font>

110
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,950
like that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something i get i would</font>

111
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,690
never wanted to be someone like Marilyn

112
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,980
Monroe like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard stories about her</font>

113
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,650
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go shopping at a normal store</font>

114
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,900
our time and she would get bombarded by

115
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,090
people or people constantly be taking

116
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,500
pictures of<font color="#CCCCCC"> her and every celebrity I'm</font>

117
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,488
sure it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that it's just like</font>

118
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:18,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one that sticks out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my mind</font>

119
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,298
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be that way</font>

120
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's there in in that same vein</font>

121
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,350
that's probably why Matthew Santoro

122
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,139
wants to keep some things private

123
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sense but um I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

124
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,889
comes off as a little disingenuous<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

125
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:37,460
and the biggest flaw that I see in the

126
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,229
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matthew Santoro side of things is</font>

127
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,330
the fact that his he's allowing his

128
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,300
friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and like do interviews that</font>

129
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,210
are basically just smearing nicole

130
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,099
arbour and talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

131
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that person wasn't even involved in or</font>

132
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,969
actually knows no facts about just liked

133
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,129
what he heard from Matthew Santoro and

134
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,960
he doesn't even know nicole arbour he's

135
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,599
never met her supposedly and he just

136
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,289
wasn't part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and I love Rob</font>

137
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:04,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dyke he's like one of my favorite</font>

138
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,449
youtubers<font color="#E5E5E5"> till watch basically um I was</font>

139
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">just watching his video i was doing</font>

140
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,409
makeup actually but I doesn't make any

141
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:14,629
sense to me like if my friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

142
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:16,009
go talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

143
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:18,020
happened to me personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would be</font>

144
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,300
like no that's something that I'm either

145
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,839
gonna do or or we're not gonna do

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,729
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's just like there's no</font>

147
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,009
reason for someone who wasn't who wasn't

148
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:30,319
involved to talk about it and likewise a

149
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,419
like some people might be like well you

150
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,729
don't know that Matthew Santoro let him

151
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,919
well why is Mathew Santoro not mad about

152
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,719
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or apologizing about it he's clearly</font>

153
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,759
on board with it and that seems a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

154
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,289
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishy to me like why would you do</font>

155
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:45,319
that other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perpetuate drama</font>

156
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,870
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in itself just stupid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and why</font>

157
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,279
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not trying</font>

158
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to slander and smear and kill this</font>

159
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,139
person's career you know and it's so

160
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,360
dumb to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the society like let's say</font>

161
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,770
she did something<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible like worse</font>

162
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,589
than what she is you know have said to

163
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:03,710
have done you know let's say she did

164
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,060
something short of killing someone like

165
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,589
she was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad person for a while</font>

166
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,409
right like there's no reason that

167
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,960
society can't say she did some good

168
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,089
things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't like her as a person</font>

169
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,129
or she did some good things but I don't

170
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,719
like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard of her as a person</font>

171
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:20,990
like as a as a bystander there's no

172
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,240
possible way that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the exact</font>

173
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,680
facts of what happened all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your going</font>

174
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,839
off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> as he said she said so the fact</font>

175
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,500
that society gets so like up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tizzy</font>

176
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,789
about it like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like something my</font>

177
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,110
mom would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but for lack of a better</font>

178
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,750
phrase like they get so angry that they

179
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,190
wish her death like you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

180
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,899
anything about her you<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't a part of</font>

181
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,550
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the circumstances</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't know</font>

182
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,649
what's true and what's not true and like

183
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:45,440
to be frank like when I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing what</font>

184
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,659
he is describing as an abusive

185
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,310
relationship that to me sounds more like

186
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,139
a dysfunctional relationship one that

187
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,699
I've had numerous times<font color="#CCCCCC"> throughout my</font>

188
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,580
life we're both ends were just crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

189
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,839
you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font>

190
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,069
relationship and you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

191
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more self-respect and it's</font>

192
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,649
clear that he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very insecure and it's</font>

193
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:03,709
clear that he is new to a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

194
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,389
in life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he's just said like very</font>

195
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:06,889
sheltered nice person that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I see</font>

196
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,440
when I hear him<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things and I</font>

197
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,190
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it affected him deeply</font>

198
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,180
emotionally and that's absolutely fine

199
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,550
that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking relationships</font>

200
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,050
like that have affected me that way as

201
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,080
well but like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's more dysfunctional</font>

202
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,389
and it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> unhealthy than it is</font>

203
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,879
abusive like I've slapped guys you know

204
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,509
guys have like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've yelled at</font>

205
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:30,800
each other and told each other like

206
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,479
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> shit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

207
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,889
immediately regret like all I'm gonna

208
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,599
kill myself type stuff if you leave and

209
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,129
like there have been fights for someone

210
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,930
like leaves and you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

211
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,839
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all just personal shit and people</font>

212
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,039
are blowing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of proportion because</font>

213
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,389
this is the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they've heard</font>

214
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,120
someone actually vocalize it they've you

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,229
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people are just very</font>

216
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,639
private about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

217
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,110
you know get back together and it was

218
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,610
like wow that was an embarrassing moment

219
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,889
in our relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sometimes those</font>

220
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,330
you know relationships can be

221
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,830
dysfunctional sometimes they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

222
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,949
I felt that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little cringy that</font>

223
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,469
he kept equating it to the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

224
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:06,919
abusive relationship where the stronger

225
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,419
more dominant person the relationship

226
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,029
actually beats them on a daily basis and

227
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,289
doesn't let them get out of that

228
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,240
relationship and it felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it was</font>

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,669
doing an injustice to all of those you

230
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">know smaller people and I say smaller</font>

231
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">people because it is going to be</font>

232
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:23,839
biologically<font color="#E5E5E5"> more often women who suffer</font>

233
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,939
from domestic abuse because men are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

234
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,009
biologically larger and more aggressive

235
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,079
because of testosterone because of their

236
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,120
genes because of just their gender their

237
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,610
taller bigger and stronger I mean I have

238
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,309
guy friends that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like actually you</font>

239
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,039
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> way have weighed less than me and I</font>

240
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,260
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gym and they don't and they</font>

241
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,640
can hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> me down in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there stronger than</font>

242
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,439
me it's like men are just stronger

243
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,449
that's a fact so the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he is</font>

244
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:49,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">acting like he is</font>

245
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,480
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar position as those women</font>

246
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> constantly being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beat and if</font>

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,440
they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave you know they will be</font>

248
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">killed and women are killed in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

249
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,880
situation or like men that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

250
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> made to feel like they're</font>

251
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,010
worthless and or actually abused by

252
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,140
women like<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless it's a Ronda Rousey</font>

253
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,320
you know dating some like really tiny

254
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,140
little asian dude who's never lifted a

255
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,700
weight in his life then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an</font>

256
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,430
actual physically abusive situation and

257
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,770
I know he did say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's more of the</font>

258
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,810
the psychological abuse but it doesn't

259
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,460
sound like psychological abuse to me it

260
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,330
sounds like every woman like basically I

261
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't fur I know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna sound</font>

262
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,680
extremely misogynistic but like it is a

263
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,050
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a stereotype that women don't like</font>

264
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,610
their boyfriends talking to other girls

265
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,680
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at other girls even associating</font>

266
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,990
with other girls it is a known fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

267
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,820
when you fall in love you<font color="#CCCCCC"> lose two</font>

268
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,020
friends that's like the saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

269
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,020
everyone's heard because you when you

270
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,540
are so infatuated with a person and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

271
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,490
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> love with a person you end up pushing</font>

272
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,050
other things out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life and they</font>

273
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,160
become a priority and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just</font>

274
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that happens and although</font>

275
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,370
women can make that worse by making

276
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,990
their men not go out on guys nights out

277
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,700
or not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends or not see their</font>

278
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,070
family he even says something like she

279
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,080
made me like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paraphrasing I</font>

280
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,839
think but she said<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like she</font>

281
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,280
made me to believe that all people who

282
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,080
weren't okay with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship are</font>

283
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,710
losers yeah any girl who some guys like

284
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,240
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like your relationship you</font>

285
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,410
should stop dating this girl she's a

286
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,180
bitch of course she's gonna say they're

287
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,100
losers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course they kind of are</font>

288
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,540
losers because why are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

289
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,600
involved in this relationship and you

290
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,850
know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had times where I didn't like</font>

291
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,100
the family of my boyfriend or vice versa

292
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,959
and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of cut them off a</font>

293
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,730
little bit not in like a terrible way

294
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for a while or friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

295
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,060
didn't see any more<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I didn't</font>

296
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,650
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time like that just makes sense and</font>

297
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,020
like so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> women are jealous like I</font>

298
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,589
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and it's not as</font>

299
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,570
much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can like lightly call it</font>

300
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,290
abusive it's more dysfunctional so to me

301
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,650
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's alleging and how much it</font>

302
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,110
affected him just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make any sense</font>

303
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,140
to me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think that she should</font>

304
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,630
have you

305
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,610
like acknowledged it I really feel like

306
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,620
I i know i feel like the first video

307
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,510
where she's not asking him to get a

308
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,010
polygraph that's just fucking stupid of

309
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,570
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's not gonna do it and now she</font>

310
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">has some like fake moral high ground</font>

311
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,600
like three people who believe that

312
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">bullshit like it's really stupid um the</font>

313
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,970
first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> was good you know like she she</font>

314
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,040
talked about her point of view I don't

315
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,330
feel like she should have said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

316
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,340
didn't happen because like clearly that

317
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,050
type of stuff that type of stuff at

318
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,790
least happened I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like she should</font>

319
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,550
explain her point of view and admit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

320
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,340
she made mistakes and I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

321
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,680
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> was as close to a good response as</font>

322
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,240
she could<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly give but I feel like</font>

323
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,520
it's so gross that like so many people

324
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,890
like so many people Rob Dyke and all of

325
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,140
Matthew<font color="#CCCCCC"> Santoro's fans are just sitting</font>

326
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,690
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> like wishing death upon her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

327
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,220
Matthew Santoro should have been a

328
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more responsible in the way that</font>

329
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,460
he conveyed it to his fans because his

330
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,420
fans are often are impressionable

331
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,640
they're often younger they're often you

332
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,260
know internet keyboard warriors that

333
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,970
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know like avenge their</font>

334
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,490
favorite youtuber and to not say that

335
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is my point of view this is how it</font>

336
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,580
happened for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me this is how it made me</font>

337
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,520
feel but I don't wish any harm on her

338
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,200
cuz basically what he was doing is

339
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,170
asking people to start an army and

340
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack her you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and like I I like</font>

341
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,670
them both as youtubers I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

342
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,860
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nicole as much because when I'm</font>

343
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,480
watching things I would rather get like

344
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,970
infotainment type stuff or like

345
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about scary things like Rob</font>

346
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,880
Tycho's does on his channel rather than

347
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,340
satirical content because you know as

348
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,080
much as I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the things</font>

349
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,990
she says about whatever like abortion

350
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,770
and all that stuff um it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not my</font>

351
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,680
kind of content I don't know it it she

352
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">never really makes me laugh but she's</font>

353
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,030
funny and sometimes she kind of makes me

354
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,020
laugh I don't know I don't like her

355
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,880
editing style but anyway the point of

356
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,520
this is that I am not taking anyone's

357
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,960
side because<font color="#CCCCCC"> their content I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

358
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">their content that they're making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

359
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,260
entertainment purposes it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

360
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,360
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> for entertainment purposes and I'm</font>

361
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">not gonna hate the content if I hate</font>

362
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,810
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she did you know that</font>

363
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of thing like I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> admit that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

364
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,190
good content but I can't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> she did</font>

365
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,870
that shit to Matthew if I felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font>

366
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,430
or whatever like that some fucked up

367
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,990
shit but that's her own private life and

368
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,430
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> has weird shit that goes on in</font>

369
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,630
their private<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives and she doesn't</font>

370
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,860
sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like someone who's abusive or</font>

371
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,720
manipulative she sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like someone who</font>

372
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,390
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside</font>

373
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,240
and may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be damaged emotionally or</font>

374
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,590
psychologically she doesn't sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

375
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,780
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calculated demon like</font>

376
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,280
people are making her out to be and I

377
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,290
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like it's so illogical how</font>

378
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,720
people can't separate the two like

379
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,860
people are down but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more down</font>

380
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,680
votes on her video about abortion then

381
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,050
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> up votes and people are</font>

382
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,400
obviously doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because Matthew</font>

383
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Santoro is video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and because what he did</font>

384
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,520
to her but really what you're saying

385
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
when you download a video is that your

386
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,850
for abortion basically and like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

387
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine a normal person being for</font>

388
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,760
abortion so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> her for not abortion</font>

389
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,710
you're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're for the</font>

390
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">abolishment of the portion oh I love</font>

391
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,280
being a dumb blonde in some moments and

392
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,110
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> blonde moments but anyway um I</font>

393
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,100
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this was decently conveyed the</font>

394
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,080
way I feel about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's</font>

395
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very popular opinion</font>

396
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,650
because it's so much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just like</font>

397
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,720
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> your rage out on a random /</font>

398
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,190
internet personality that you don't like

399
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,470
than it is to actually be sensible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

400
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,500
logical and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my viewers are</font>

401
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,180
more sensible and logical so they might

402
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,460
actually you know get what I'm trying to

403
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,500
say and<font color="#E5E5E5"> might actually maybe not agree</font>

404
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,590
but try to understand what where I'm

405
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,230
coming from and how they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> cringy</font>

406
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,820
things that happened in Matthew Santoro

407
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,010
video obviously I feel like men should

408
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to cry obviously I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

409
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,060
it's a very noble<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to you know put</font>

410
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,950
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life out on the Internet i</font>

411
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,900
wish i had more life so that I could but

412
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,620
basically I'm like ah my fucking light

413
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,330
broke today when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was trying to record</font>

414
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,250
a video and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't get past this</font>

415
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,260
level and<font color="#CCCCCC"> kill the plumber and like</font>

416
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,120
that's basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most drama i have</font>

417
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,950
in my life and I've eradicated drama

418
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,500
mostly because I'm so emotionless now

419
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,010
and it's so more just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like have fun have</font>

420
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,570
a good life do what I want don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

421
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,950
people bring me down<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've kind of</font>

422
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,670
eradicated that that rung that<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

423
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,160
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in their life tree which is</font>

424
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like needless drama and needless</font>

425
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">hate and anger and all of that stuff my</font>

426
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,380
arms starting to actually get so tired

427
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,220
that it's like fatigued to the point of

428
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,920
shaking but um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I wanted to</font>

429
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,900
make an actual topic video without

430
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,590
taking up one of the days where I do

431
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,250
topics on things

432
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,600
it actually mattered to me like

433
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,550
psychology and stuff and I wanted to put

434
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,960
my opinions out there because I feel

435
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,220
like not a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people had these</font>

436
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,200
opinions but I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's helpful</font>

437
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,830
for youtubers and YouTube<font color="#CCCCCC"> Watchers alike</font>

438
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,540
to understand that there's a difference

439
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,940
between what's actually happening and

440
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,270
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are saying is happening and</font>

441
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,920
what's actually happening all over the

442
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">place and what's happening in your life</font>

443
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what's happening in their life</font>

444
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,110
is just pretty much the same shit and I

445
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,350
don't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so different what</font>

446
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,950
like they went through from what most

447
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,470
couples you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people have in a</font>

448
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,240
relationship in their lives like most

449
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,800
people go into a relationship where it's

450
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,840
on again off again we're like the sex is

451
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,200
so good but you know she's fucking

452
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,820
manipulative and doesn't want me to see

453
