134
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,270
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know the Slipknot and</font>

135
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,020
stuff like that a slipknot tours I'm

136
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,220
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember it's a pain in the</font>

137
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,720
grass in there was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that I</font>

138
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,430
saw but I don't remember and it was

139
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,870
really cool because around that time I

140
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,340
was also still working for cube so

141
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,660
anyone who would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross over and</font>

145
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,820
really like concerts but they're really

146
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,520
tiring and I feel like live music just

147
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,710
doesn't compare to studio music a lot of

148
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,030
the times but then that you have those

149
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,160
bands that are just absolutely immensely

150
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,350
amazing live that you like really

151
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,820
wouldn't pass up an opportunity to see

152
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">live I would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see pink floyd live</font>

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,680
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never gotten to and</font>

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,030
especially not in their prime because

155
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm far too young Rammstein came here</font>

156
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,930
and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see them live which</font>

157
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,280
was really sad because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like their</font>

158
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,170
last world tour some shit I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

159
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,900
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if till lindemann is actually still</font>

160
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,610
touring because I know he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

161
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">different like things going on but I</font>

162
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,640
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were saying that it was</font>

163
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,230
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be their last world tours of</font>

164
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,700
shit or last toured America I don't know

165
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,950
but it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sad if I didn't</font>

166
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,660
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see them ever so I'm hoping that</font>

167
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">they continue on but anyway um I think</font>

168
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,020
going to festivals is not for everyone

169
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,670
because a lot of people don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

170
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,830
the immense amount of crowds and the

171
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,410
people on the loudness and I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

172
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,090
of people who like put in earplugs I

173
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,590
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand that no way I want to</font>

174
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,630
fucking here at that loud you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

175
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,610
it's kind of sucks for the bands that

176
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,289
don't like have as goo

177
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,330
of a live performance as I do sue<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

178
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">recording and that's why I feel like I</font>

179
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:11,129
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be into going to concerts if I</font>

180
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,979
was in two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of music I</font>

181
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,689
wasn't into metal if I was more into the

182
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,430
like whole rap R&B auto-tune like pop

183
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,020
