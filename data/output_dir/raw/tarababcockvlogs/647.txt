starcraft finally someone's

00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,568
acknowledging starcraft what i think is

50
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,280
interesting is that he talks about

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,740
lurker when this was when starcraft 2

52
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,030
just came out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit later in</font>

53
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> episode they're playing starcraft</font>

54
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's definitely starcraft 2 it's not</font>

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,100
starcraft one so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

56
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,510
of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's funny because</font>

57
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that they say while they were</font>

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,800
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's not really intuitive to</font>

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,230
someone actually plays the game like

60
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,220
they were deciding whether they should

61
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,050
like turtle or whether they should just

62
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">go right now and they're playing like</font>

63
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,800
against each other and not actually

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,510
playing tues it's really weird but it's

65
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,630
super<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome to see that kind of like</font>

66
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">starcraft stuff in mainstream TV fuck</font>

67
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,390
yeah starcraft right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what else is</font>

68
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,010
there let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me go get more comfortable oh</font>

69
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,860
let's see um oh there's some kind of

70
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,040
thing on my boobie I think bugs have

71
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,350
been biting my boobs<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I'm not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

72
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,750
percent sure so don't like call the

73
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,670
detectives on it yet call the detectives

74
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,530
all the fuck does that mean but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

75
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,370
I have some kind of like animals that

76
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,739
stay in my house just to bite my boobs

77
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,050
which I mean is pretty like sensible I

78
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,370
mean if you were a bug wouldn't you like

79
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,110
come into my house and start biting my

80
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,810
boobs I think that's pretty sensible but

81
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,280
also let's see what else is new I

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,630
watched the whole twilight series

83
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,390
recently and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

84
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,829
was up with it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean everyone's like oh</font>

85
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,480
my god everything is a better love story

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,100
than Twilight and stuff you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it</font>

87
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">is so I had to watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and my reaction</font>

88
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the whole series</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it's way</font>

89
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,299
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I thought but at the same</font>

90
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,890
time it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as bad as I thought and</font>

91
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,989
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean is I got emotionally</font>

92
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,380
invested into this like love story<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

93
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,390
so funny like I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually almost</font>

94
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,030
tried like at the end and stuff when um

95
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,430
everything was like I won't spoil<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

96
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,579
you but it's so funny because I I can

97
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:56,310
relate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of love story you</font>

98
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,590
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like love triangle</font>

99
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,850
love story type thing but then it gets

100
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,500
fucking weird right it's just like what

101
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fuck and where are they going with</font>

102
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,890
this and like every single movie doesn't

103
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,900
really have a plot and it's funny

104
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,190
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually downloaded illegally</font>

105
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,150
because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to pay for</font>

106
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,790
fucking Twilight right we downloaded I'm

107
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,010
one of the ending was the second movie

108
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,168
and it was just like cut like someone

109
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,608
had cut the<font color="#CCCCCC"> movie like in a bunch of</font>

110
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:18,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">different spots and like flipped it</font>

111
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,700
around and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't even tell the</font>

112
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,930
difference until<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

113
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,030
movie were like wait this is not

114
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,780
chronologic

115
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,220
I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's no way this movie</font>

116
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,510
is this bad so we went and found it

117
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,790
online i'm streaming it it was pretty

118
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,650
funny that<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's how bad the movie</font>

119
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,600
is you can actually like discombobulated

120
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,750
the storyline and it's still like a

121
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,690
legit you know movie that you wouldn't

122
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,830
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> really be able to tell it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>
