<font color="#E5E5E5">sex said video and licking pussy and</font>

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,549

18
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,140
gaming videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to edit that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,770
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well but anyway so today i</font>

21
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,390
want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that a</font>

22
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,920
viewer wanted me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about actually</font>

23
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,430
um it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about staring in public so</font>

24
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,180
staring at a woman that you find

25
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,820
attractive and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's morally wrong</font>

26
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,230
or if we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something to stop</font>

27
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,110
that or if the women should just you

28
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,329
know shut up and deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it because</font>

29
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's our right to look within the</font>

30
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,510
direction that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

31
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,210
that latter stance is pretty much where

32
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,390
I stand um it's it's quite hypocritical

33
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,900
to me that women will look at other men

34
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,369
and be like oh look at that attractive

35
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,170
man in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a suit and he's got an ascot oh</font>

36
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,540
my God he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so hot right and that's like</font>

37
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,939
flirty and you know friendly and men

38
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,009
definitely are like please look at me I

39
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,900
want women to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm attractive but</font>

40
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,430
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the flip side if a woman is</font>

41
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,020
wearing like a low cut shirt and she's

42
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,130
got her boobs out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and she's wearing like</font>

43
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,509
a tight dress and she's wearing heels

44
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,640
and she's clearly you know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,070
look attractive and people look at her

46
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,110
will their pigs and their a misogynistic

47
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,880
that's so fucking stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me like</font>

48
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,250
especially for the women who are asking

49
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,640
for it by wearing a certain outfit it is

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright as bisexual or a heterosexual</font>

51
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,369
men<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a bisexual woman by the way not</font>

52
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,780
a bisexual man um to like you know check

53
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,310
people out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking without touching</font>

54
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,630
is one hundred percent are right you

55
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,610
can't you know tell us where our eyes

56
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">can stray and cannot stray by law that's</font>

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,409
actually ridiculous and acting like you

58
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,799
shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at um you know</font>

59
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,680
beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> people is actually stupid i</font>

60
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,079
mean people as a hobby will sit around

61
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,848
and people watch and just watch random

62
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,560
regular people and not for sexual

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,030
reasons not because they're attracted to

64
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,670
them

65
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,900
just because it's interesting to watch

66
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,370
people and when you're out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in public if</font>

67
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,900
you go out in public you pretty much

68
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,849
sign a waiver that says anyone can look

69
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,209
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if they desire to and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah sure</font>

70
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,739
if someone comes up to you and starts

71
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,989
bothering you or talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you or tries</font>

72
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">to touch you you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of goes</font>

73
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,970
past the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if it's you</font>

74
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,980
know in a creepy manner like someone can

75
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,970
come up to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful</font>

76
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,230
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out to eat that</font>

77
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,510
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm alone which is</font>

78
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">very rare but pretty much every time I'm</font>

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,290
alone some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ol asking that even if I'm</font>

80
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,360
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing sweats and no makeup</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,940
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like glasses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and stuff it's so</font>

82
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">funny that like they're still doing that</font>

83
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">but anyway um like that's perfectly fine</font>

84
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will do that you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

85
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,610
no thanks and if they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything other</font>

86
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,110
than being like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay nice to meet you</font>

87
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away then that crosses the line</font>

88
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,250
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it becomes part of your personal</font>

89
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,200
space if they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch you that</font>

90
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,150
could be considered molestation rape or

91
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,819
whatever the fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid shit um it's</font>

92
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">just there's nothing wrong with someone</font>

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,860
glancing and someone beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

94
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">should take it as a compliment you</font>

95
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,959
should you know not go out in public if

96
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,160
you have a problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people looking</font>

97
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,750
at you that sounds like an agoraphobic

98
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,579
or something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand why that</font>

99
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,100
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a problem everyone is going to</font>

100
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,269
look at someone who's attractive that's

101
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,280
just like how our biology works we find

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
someone attractive we're gonna look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

103

104
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,410
real quick it's not necessarily creepy

105
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,829
it's usually very like innocent

106
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,989
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh yeah there's a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">women will check out other women men</font>

so much so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it draws attention</font>

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">other men will look at him and be like</font>

116
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,430

117
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,350
of speech to say oh that's stupid bitch

118
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,670
like I get that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would be</font>

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,940
probably just checking me out and that's

123
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,250
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an epidemic around here where men</font>

124
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,840
can be honest to their women because

125
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,019
women are so on this feminist fucking

126
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,480
high horse it's like really awful i

127
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,149
fucking hate feminism the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

128
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the stereotype of a feminist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

129
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,750
sure there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many feminists other</font>

130
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,190
they're doing fine they're just misled

131
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,510
into thinking that they should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

132
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,530
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than an egalitarian</font>

133
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,080
because in itself it

134
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,620
like sexism to care only about the the

135
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,150
feminine problems in the world you know

136
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,740
it's like so stupid it's like hypocrisy

137
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,139
at its finest when you call yourself a

138
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,729
feminist<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want equality but</font>

139
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,830
really you're only caring about female

140
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems and that to me is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

141
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:44,620
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fuck no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be an</font>

142
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,879
egalitarian you should care about both

143
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,830
problems you should be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right</font>

144
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,270
now maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> in society there are more</font>

145
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,560
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with women but if a problem</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people or men or women or anyone and</font>

150
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,639
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like inegalitarian ism and</font>

153
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:07,030
fucking blog we should have like a

154
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,159
drinking fucking thing where if there is

a vlog well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work because i</font>

156
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,659

157
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:15,699
every vlog<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do stutter once so there</font>

158
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,590
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a game where if there's a</font>

159
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">vlog that I don't stutter I get like 20</font>

160
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,210
points or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know um but</font>

161
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,560
anyway um worrying about only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one gender</font>

162
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,659
or one specific group and then acting

163
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:29,919
like you're wanting quality is very

164
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,710
hypocritical to me and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

165
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the issues that feminists are</font>

166
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,699
worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 100% bullshit because</font>

167
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are bullshit like oh my</font>

168
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,090
god there's sexual pictures on the front

169
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,000
of a magazine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know uh like Oh some</font>

170
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,409
guy cat called it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> he thought I was</font>

171
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">beautiful you should go to jail like all</font>

172
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff is really stupid but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

173
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,199
there are actually issues out there I'm

174
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,539
sure that need attention just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as</font>

175
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,180
much as they're giving it by saying that

176
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,569
there needs to be a whole line of a task

177
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,550
force working against people being mean

178
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to women when no one's really mean to</font>

179
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,159
women and in my opinion women have it

180
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,870
much easier in society than men do

181
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,060
because they are being so protected and

182
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,370
because we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power of sexuality</font>

183
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,659
while women aren't that sexual so

184
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,729
they're not like like oh there's a sexy

185
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,289
guy who walketh walked up to me I'll do

186
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,150
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> for him I'll give him all my</font>

187
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,889
money like there are no women like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

188
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,800
because women or not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> driven by you</font>

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,620
know the sexual<font color="#CCCCCC"> hunt as men are anyway</font>

190
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,509
so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to look</font>

191
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">at someone attracted where you want to</font>

192
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,909
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weirder you want to look</font>

193
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">at someone in general and you're out in</font>

194
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,539
public go ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it women if</font>

195
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:32,949
you're fucking dressing like a slots and

196
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,389
then you're wondering why people are

197
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,310
just like like innocently checking you

198
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,589
out or any innocently you know looking

199
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">at you because you're drawing</font>

200
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,470
attention like how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fault them</font>

201
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,260
that's just like our eyes go to the most

202
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,030
colorful or most different or most

203
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,530
unique or most beautiful thing that's

204
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,540
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens you know we're looking</font>

205
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,910
at you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we look at anything</font>

206
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,770
that's weird just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if someone starts</font>

207
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,880
yelling at someone else we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

208
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,410
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if a girl fight happens we're</font>

209
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,270
gonna watch that if you know someone's

210
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,950
running away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from cops because they</font>

211
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,060
stole something and they're gonna watch

212
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,770
that if some guy is attractive we're

213
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,750
gonna look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and some people will</font>

214
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">hate you and some people enjoy you and</font>

215
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,650
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works you can't stop</font>

216
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,860
that it's our freedom<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put our eyes in</font>

217
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,540
the direction that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so I don't</font>

218
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,950
see why anyone would be bothered<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that</font>

219
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,900
I can understand someone who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

220
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,220
like going out in public and it's very

221
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,160
insecure about themselves feeling you

222
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,340
know insecure and unhappy that people

223
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,540
are giving them attention I know there

224
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,390
are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that don't like</font>

225
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,710
obvious attention because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can make</font>

226
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,680
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel uncomfortable but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't go</font>

227
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,900
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> policing where people's eyes go</font>

228
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,450
and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know live off of that</font>

229
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,860
kind of fear you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to overcome that</font>

230
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,170
any which way like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully get some</font>

231
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,260
kind of help for that I don't know like

232
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a lot of conditions where people</font>

233
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,020
don't like to go out in public<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

234
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,240
mentioned one before but um I know a lot

235
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people don't like crowds and</font>

236
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,940
basically if you think something is

237
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to make you uncomfortable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

238
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,740
subject yourself to it and don't push it

239
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,050
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't control the rest of</font>

240
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,400
the thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people out in public</font>

241
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,690
and whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're gonna look at</font>

242
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,190
you that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like something you can't</font>

243
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,860
control so yeah hopefully that makes

244
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,360
sense then I don't really have a strong

245
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,620
opinion on this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just kind</font>

246
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,450
of an obvious thing but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a viewer</font>

247
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,460
suggested topic and I like doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> veer</font>

248
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,930
suggested topics because I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font>

249
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,120
and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know say things that</font>

250
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,950
you guys find interesting like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

251
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,390
talk about topics that you guys want to

252
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,920
hear about in my opinions on certain

253
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,930
things so yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never had a</font>

254
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,070
problem with anyone staring me in public

255
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,600
it happens literally every time I go out

256
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,640
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it happens to most people I</font>

257
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,620
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even mildly attractive</font>

258
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,850
people are going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you or if</font>

259
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,280
you're mildly different from the pack in

260
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,450
any fucking way people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to look</font>

261
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,610
at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

262
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,960
necessarily a good thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

263
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,370
make you have a big head it just

264
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally means that you're out in</font>

265
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,370
public and people look around and people

266
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,350
judge people based on appearance that's

267
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,180
just how things work it's part of our

268
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,500
biology I don't know just that's just

269
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,750
what we do as a society is what we do is

270
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,470
people

271
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,090
that's what we do as sexual beings who

272
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,520
are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a mate it's just how</font>

273
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,840
things work and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of just</font>

274
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,040
logic<font color="#E5E5E5"> your way into understanding that</font>

275
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,540
like oh I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at people to I</font>

276
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,860
like to judge people<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

277
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,080
an open mind like if someone you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

278
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,640
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of something initially about</font>

279
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,350
someone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they changed your mind</font>

280
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,720
like don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that hard don't make it</font>

281
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,800
hard for people to change your<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

282
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,290
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it impossible for you to have</font>

283
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,550
an open mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> because then you end up</font>

284
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,610
being kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-dimensional</font>

285
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,980
less intelligent ignorant person and

286
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,150
that kind of sucks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot of</font>

287
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,730
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh that person looks a</font>

288
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,380
certain way so they cannot possibly be

289
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,860
any other way like stereotyping so

290
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,940
strongly that you think there's no

291
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,080
possible way that someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

292
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,360
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind is very toxic and you should</font>

293
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely try to go at most things with</font>

294
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,350
an open mind and not have any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

295
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,980
prejudices that you hold once someone

296
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,890
has you know given you a good reason to

297
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,300
give them the benefit of the doubt but

298
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,620
basically that's it just be positive

299
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,570
have fun look at people if you want to

300
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,310
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sexy if you want to have fun if you</font>

301
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,310
