15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,160
that I find a woman that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,140
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I connect with on a level that</font>

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,910
includes an intellectual level and a

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,899
level of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in common things like</font>

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,710
video games while also you know still

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,239
being feminine that kind of thing it's

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,210
kind of rare to have that total package

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,210
type girl right so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,739
do a video for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys even if you are</font>

24
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,090
the minority I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help you</font>

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,709
guys out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hopefully give you as much</font>

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,360
inside as I possibly can I feel like I'm

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,100
a little bit different than the norm and

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,270
I'm also<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I've had a lot of</font>

29
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,159
caffeine but I'm sort of used to

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,650
caffeine now to the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I feel</font>

31
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,689
like I'm my handshake and stuff but I

32
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,090
can contain the hyperness but it also

33
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,189
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messes me up so we're gonna try</font>

34
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,860
to do this as thoroughly as possible so

35
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,960
i don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,310
normal girl so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really hard for me</font>

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,890
to understand how normal girls do it but

38
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,990
I've never really had an issue finding a

39
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,790
guy if I wanted a guy or getting a guy

40
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,650
if I wanted a guy and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,130
entirely is attributed to the fact that

42
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,590
I am you know attractive<font color="#E5E5E5"> by society's</font>

43
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,270
standards I really don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

44
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,860
that's the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of it has</font>

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,079
to do with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that I'm so open in</font>

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,729
the fact that i don't really shun off

47
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,009
male interests things that are

48
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,439
considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like largely male</font>

49
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,020
interests one thing that males are

50
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,100
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not really interested</font>

51
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,570
in is a sports so I'm going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

52
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,619
understand it from the point of view of

53
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:02,670
a girl who's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really into sports</font>

54
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,189
because I see a lot of men who have

55
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,240
wives are a lot of men who

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,829
girlfriends and they're like especially

57
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,119
in the match community they're like oh

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,530
my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish I could get my girlfriend</font>

59
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">or my wife into magic oh my god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

60
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,010
could just like have her<font color="#E5E5E5"> show that</font>

61
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,209
interest in the thing that I love that

62
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,980
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking amazing and a lot of</font>

63
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,780
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> express</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to me because they're</font>

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh you're a girl that plays magic</font>

65
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,780
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fucking cool that you're</font>

66
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,040
into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wish my girlfriend was into it</font>

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,860
and stuff like that that's it's a large

68
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,750
part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i get about being a</font>

69
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,160
woman in the magic community or in the

70
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,390
video gaming community<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

71
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,680
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my girlfriend to this</font>

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,349
so my first tip would to be would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

73
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,180
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be unsupportive of a man's interests</font>

74
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,560
and to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give in to them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,819
like there's a lot of things obviously

76
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,019
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really into like if I</font>

77
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,120
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> boyfriend or a significant other</font>

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,830
or a partner<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a friend even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who was</font>

79
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">like super into sports like I'll humor</font>

80
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,000
him and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would go to a sports</font>

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,799
game there are things about every single

82
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of past time that you can find</font>

83
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,880
endearing to yourself like for instance

84
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,830
I've always wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a Seattle</font>

85
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,480
Sonics game even though the songs don't

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist anymore I'm hoping they come back</font>

87
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,049
but a basketball out of all the sports

88
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,989
is really my thing and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking like</font>

89
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,099
regular team sports that people get

90
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,420
excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like basketball football</font>

91
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,019
soccer um football that kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

92
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know a lot of people hated because I'm</font>

93
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,290
an American and I say soccer but that's

94
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,709
just what we say fuck you<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway um I've</font>

95
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,269
never really been into team sports the

96
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,480
idea to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> of football and people how</font>

97
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
patriotic people get like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i live in</font>

98
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,329
seattle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Seahawks have been doing</font>

99
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,470
well the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple seasons and</font>

100
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,480
everyone is just like wearing seahawks

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
jerseys and the Fairweather fans are

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,500
like yes our team is doing well now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

103
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,120
support them and like that kind of

104
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,829
mentality is like completely idiotic to

105
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,959
me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very annoying to see people who</font>

106
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,489
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even really like the team or don't</font>

107
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,079
really support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team supporting them</font>

108
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,280
when they do well it's kind of like the

109
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,650
mentality of society where if someone's

110
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,690
doing well you either are a fair-weather

111
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,790
friend of theirs or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hate</font>

112
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,840
them because they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing worse than</font>

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,850
you and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like human nature to be</font>

114
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,350
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way and that's just totally awful</font>

115
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,299
to me aside<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that all the</font>

116
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in the Seattle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Seahawks weren't</font>

117
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,269
born and raised in Seattle they're kind

118
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,030
of just traded around throughout teams

119
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,739
and stuff it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

120
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,510
why should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I be patriotic about this</font>

121
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,370
half the team isn't from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Seattle or more</font>

122
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,290
than half a team 117 I don't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuckin</font>

123
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,329
know but with sports it's kind of like

124
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:14,430
politics and trading around and they do

125
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,139
well sometimes they do bad other times

126
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,459
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do well because they</font>

127
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,709
transferred some guy who used to be you

128
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,510
know part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lakers into chicago</font>

129
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,830
bulls that kind of thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

130
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,539
like obviously I know that's basketball

131
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,460
I'm kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intertwining all of the team</font>

132
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,710
sports into one but that to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me</font>

133
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,270
disenchanted about the whole team sports

134
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,160
kind of thing sports that I'm interested

135
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,199
in I like playing tennis I like playing

136
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,210
basketball I am a really amazing free

137
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,880
thrower like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually went to a free</font>

138
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,289
throwing competition when I was in sixth

139
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:41,580
grade because I was so well known when I

140
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,020
because I was so good at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when I</font>

141
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,610
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I did not do well I fucking</font>

142
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,919
choked it was awful and I did zero out

143
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,300
of ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I do we get to the the</font>

144
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,490
fucking finals or anything example but

145
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,180
anyway um I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like team sports I see</font>

146
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way that I don't like League of</font>

147
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,720
Legends type games where it relies

148
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,660
heavily on how well we work as a team as

149
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,130
well as how good the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the people</font>

150
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">on my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team are and that can be</font>

151
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,830
frustrating sometimes but I also don't

152
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,360
like that the patriotism the people

153
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,800

sports that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch I think Golf is</font>

182

significant

184
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:09,199
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back on the point if I had a</font>

185
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,309
significant other who was into that kind

186
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:11,689

find things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I like about it and</font>

192
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:21,139
then the fact that I like that person

<font color="#E5E5E5">and I admire that person like this</font>

because there's some merit in and

198
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:32,929
because this person who is so amazing to

shoes and watching golden girls over

not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of woman I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like to</font>

209
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,779
just sit around the house and do things

210
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:53,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are considered girl things so it's</font>

211
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,409
been really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to relate to</font>

212
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,029
guys that I'm attracted to because they

213
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,529
like video games because they like to be

214
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,119
active because they like you know going

215
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the gym that kind of thing and I I</font>

216
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:01,819
can relate to all that and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I did</font>

217
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,610
find a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was into sports I would</font>

218
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">find aspects of sports that I like and I</font>

219
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,639
would support<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in doing so I wouldn t</font>

220
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,289
like why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to sports I don't</font>

221
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:10,969
want to go like I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> support him go</font>

222
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,439
with him because i'm spending time with

223
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,549
him and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand that</font>

224
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:15,079
spending time with your significant

225
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,369
other or someone you like or getting

226
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,689
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that they like is very</font>

227
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">important trying it out for yourself try</font>

228
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,829
out the video games that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he likes find a</font>

229
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,449
way to enjoy doing the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

230
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,339
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do together together and it's</font>

231
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,199
the flip side for men to like men should

232
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">be more interested or at least try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

233
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:31,039
more interested in some of the girl

234
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,749
things that are dumb that you know none

235
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:35,149
of them really want to do um I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

236
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:37,249
it shouldn't be as much of a compromise

237
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,019
as it should you should look at it in a

238
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,039
different way<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really like</font>

239
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,869
relationships in terms of compromising I

240
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:44,209
like relationships in terms of you know

241
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,459
finding things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

242
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,199
together and reasons that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like to do</font>

243
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,339
things that you wouldn't normally like

244
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,479
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because you're spending time</font>

245
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,709
with that person if that makes any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

246
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,769
so I'm the first tip that was verbose as

247
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,029
fuck it took me seven minutes to get

248
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:57,889
there I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about sports most of</font>

249
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,749
the time I'm so fucking sorry is that

250
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:02,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">you should you know find reasons to like</font>

251
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:04,309
the things that he likes not for just oh

252
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,019
I'm tagging along with him but try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

253
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,569
find reasons that the thing that the guy

254
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:12,330
likes is good to you as well you know

255
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,159
a really retarded sentence it was no

256
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,689
grammar there but um hopefully that

257
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:16,770
makes sense the second thing is like

258
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,580
women<font color="#E5E5E5"> are too afraid to be blunt and</font>

259
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,960
honest with what they want and I think

260
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,129
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that I'm so</font>

261
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,370
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> in having men that I want in</font>

262
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,319
my life in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> life is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just kind</font>

263
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,150
of honest with them like mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

264
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,130
what I start liking a guy most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

265
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,229
do is I'll message him I'll spend time

266
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,969
with him I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him I'll befriend</font>

267
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:38,250
his friends and you know it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font>

268
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,559
I'm interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in you so I'm gonna flirt</font>

269
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you and I'm gonna be nice to your</font>

270
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,349
friends and the people around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

271
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,180
because you know i'm i'm introducing

272
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,070
myself into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life and that's like</font>

273
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,899
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of way you can like casually</font>

274
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,519
start doing that what I basically do is

275
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,260
I'll message him and be like hey baby

276
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,420
was up and it'll basically be just me

277
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,029
flirting until I get a gauge for whether

278
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,380
or not he likes me too and I'll just

279
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">straight-out be like i like you i would</font>

280

<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just being knowing</font>

283
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,079
what you want can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be intimidating for a</font>

284
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,420
guy but being confident knowing what you

285
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,010
want and going after<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and getting it</font>

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,720
can be very attractive to guys well like

attention like that kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

300
