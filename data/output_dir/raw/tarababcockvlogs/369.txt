feel-good be yourself topic and I want

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start off by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about my sexual</font>

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,920
preference and what I identify as as my

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,950
sexual preference basically so um I for

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,109
as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as i can remember have</font>

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,390
identified as bisexual and this to me it

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">was just like a logical choice it made</font>

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,050
sense to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was like there's some</font>

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,420
beauty in the woman the female form

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,890
there's some beauty in the male form

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,439
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know great in bed both of them</font>

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,510
you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not equally but for</font>

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,369
different reasons you know there's a

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,670
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find a woman's breasts and</font>

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,100
vagina beautiful and like the the shape

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,950
of her body and the way she looks and

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,989
how like you know cute she can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

19
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,700
there's things about a woman that I just

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,890
find sexually attractive and then

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,539
there's things many things about men

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,190
that I find sexually attractive and

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,469
adding those two together I just feel

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,110
like is better sex it just makes for

25
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">better sex and I feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this might be</font>

26
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,449
because of how open I am and how I don't

27
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,190
really care about stigmas but it also

28
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,650
might just be that there isn't really a

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,799
stigma behind a feminine woman liking

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,360
another feminine woman or a feminine

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,640
woman being bisexual and that's why I

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,360
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of call my situation fashionably</font>

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,689
bisexual because for me like when I

34
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,150
advocate you know being whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,229
fuck you want or doing whatever the fuck

36
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,970
you want with your sexual orientation or

37
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,250
your sexual you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

38
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,680
gender assignment just do whatever makes

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,420
you feel happiest do whatever makes you

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,430
feel most yourself when I advocate that

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,810
I often say they instead of we for you

42
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,360
know gays bisexual lesbian transgender

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like I go through</font>

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same hardships that they go through</font>

45
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,930
i feel like if i was to say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in</font>

46
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it with you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm also bisexual i'm</font>

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,220
also here not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the norm</font>

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,740
then I'm kind of taking away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,630
struggles that they have because for me

50
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,219
I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out to my mom I</font>

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,590
didn't have to go mom and dad oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god</font>

52
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,170
I kissed a girl or mom and dad oh my god

53
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,969
I had a threesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my boyfriend like</font>

54
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:07,560
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I have to do</font>

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,538
because society sees like it's weirder

56
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,060
in society to make fun of or to de Grey

57
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,130
to someone who is bi-sexual bisexual

58
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,630
feminine woman than it is to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

59
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,560
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> because like it's one of the</font>

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,930
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular porn genres also it's just</font>

61
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,280
like so normal and so fashionable to be

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,800
a feminine woman who is also attracted

63
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,660
to other feminine women people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

64
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,790
it as like oh it's a phase oh it's just

65
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,580
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very you know it's not a big deal</font>

66
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,489
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> innocent and cute</font>

67
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,980
and sexy and men like to watch it and

68
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,840
it's just something that is supposed to

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">be sexy in society and that kind of</font>

70
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,870
sucks because I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there would be</font>

71
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,290
so many more bisexual men if it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

72
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,940
to be so there would be so many more

73
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,230
people coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the closet and</font>

74
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,180
being comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with whatever the fuck</font>

75
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,799
they want and I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

76
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:59,319
would open up and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hey that</font>

77
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,209
man<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks fucking nice I you know wish I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">like there would be a lot more</font>

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,660
experimentation going on sexually and a

84
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,730
lot less repression of sexuality if

85
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,190
people were more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so when I</font>

94
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,720
whatever sexual orientation you have and

95
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,180
this was kind of this topic was kind of

96
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,910
inspired by the reaction to my fan

97
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,470
service friday of my foot fetish video

98
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,359
like so many people just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hating on foot</font>

99
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,799
fetish because they don't understand it

100
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:48,970
because they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it themselves</font>

101
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,850
and any person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who feels like they</font>

102
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,769
should put someone down or say that

103
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,239
something is wrong just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font>

104
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,799
can't understand it or just because it's

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,269
not the case for them they're literally

106
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,220
just ignorant plebeians that like don't

107
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,420
know anything about anything like

108
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,190
literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think outside the</font>

109
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,160
box or raised one way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think</font>

110
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everything that they do is correct</font>

111
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,280
and anything that isn't what they can

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,930
understand or what they do is absolutely

113
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,670
wrong and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how ignorant that</font>

114
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,889
sounds and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> stupid it is because from</font>

115
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,418
all different walks of life people are

116
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:17,709
raised<font color="#E5E5E5"> just slightly different and have</font>

117
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,298
different morals and different views and

118
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,539
you know you're not choosing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> live</font>

119
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,760
this terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> life as a gay person where</font>

street and<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting beaten and killed</font>

123
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,260

problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like</font>

262
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,490

00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,540
opinion like one day I would be really

270
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,920
