time and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get everything</font>

way oh my fucking god I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go home</font>

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't feel like I'm behind and I fucking</font>

13
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:22,769
hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and if you can hear Jay it's</font>

14
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,330
because I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> close the door and he's</font>

15
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,859
yelling to his friend on skype while

16
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,449
playing league he gets to play a lot

17
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,310
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> league than I do because I actually</font>

18
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,050
have to make videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually have to</font>

19
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,460
edit videos I actually have to make

20
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,340
money but anyway today we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

21
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,000
talk about a severe suggested topic also

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,910
good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus evil and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that means</font>

23
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,030
to me and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic outline</font>

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,980
of this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've grown a little bit</font>

25
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,719
too open-minded I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there</font>

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,870
are a lot of fucked up things and fucked

27
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,030
up topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm like is that even a</font>

28
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,739
bad thing or<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that just a side use</font>

29
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,059
perception and it's kind of like a

30
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,699
paradox sometimes where I feel like good

31
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,039
and bad only exists because people have

32
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,049
an opinion on what is good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad so</font>

33
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,280
it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a weird topic um for</font>

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,770
me i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone has their</font>

35
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,970
own personal opinions and ideas and

36
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,650
moral compass comes into play a lot on

37
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,020
what they think is good and what is evil

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,409
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that the biggest issue and a</font>

39
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,000
lot of women<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i</font>

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,100
had this problem I dated a guy when I

41
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,470
was younger who was into stealing cars

42
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,450
and he was in and out of juvie and it

43
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,640
kind of fucked me up a little bit like

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,000
at the time where<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was kind of like an</font>

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,470
asshole but then sometimes he was really

46
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,790
nice and the problem is no one is truly

47
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,590
completely good or completely evil and

48
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,990
it's kind of funny because<font color="#E5E5E5"> um the</font>

49
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,060
distinction between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two can</font>

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,100
sometimes be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very thin line like</font>

51
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,079
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I might think that something is</font>

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,520
completely wrong while someone else is

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,140
like well that's life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a lot</font>

54
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,149
of really hard moral decisions in the

55
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,369
world like I was watching Gotham and I

56
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,200
know some of you guys kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hate it</font>

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,340
when I like put stupid you know like you

58
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,530
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see something on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the TV and then</font>

59
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,910
it reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of something that I want</font>

60
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about or it gives me some</font>

61
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,190
insight into<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I believe and it's not</font>

62
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,200
that that one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed my mind it's</font>

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,710
like it set me on a course and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

64
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,780
thinking process that made me come to my

65
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,670
own conclusion easier it made me think a

66
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,610
different way and in in Gotham this

67
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,900
isn't really a spoiler so don't worry

68
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,910
about it um there's some guy who's going

69
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,450
around and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the venom the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> venom</font>

70
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,610
guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well anyway there's Viper that</font>

71
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,920
kills people and the sky is working at a

72
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,380
pharmaceutical company and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font>

73
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,580
the backstory of venom is what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

74
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to say and this guy is working at</font>

75
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,700
a pharmaceutical company that's making

76
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,890
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's bait it's made</font>

77
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,560
basically to put into soldiers who get

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,380
super super strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and can take over the</font>

79
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,210
enemy<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> die after and it's a</font>

80
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,150
very inhumane way of doing things and an

81
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,040
inhumane thing to do to our soldiers as

82
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,560
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do to the enemy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the</font>

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,930
guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> works there is friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a I</font>

84
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,170
think he's like a psychologist or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

85
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,820
philosophy like teacher something in

86
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">this college and their friends and they</font>

87
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,570
came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conclusion that it would be</font>

88
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,610
okay to go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just start giving</font>

89
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,850
this out to a few people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

90
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,000
not used worldwide against a billion

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,920
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so he killed like 10</font>

92
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,740
people and some of them were noteworthy

93
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,240
in order to make the world come to the

94
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,650
realization that this stuff is actually

95
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,660
happening and make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company stop</font>

96
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,670
producing it if that makes any sense so

97
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,400
um this guy thought that it was okay and

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,950
not evil to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to save a</font>

99
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,770
billion people when he<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be directly</font>

100
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,170
and is directly killing like 10 people

101
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,630
right now the whole like idea that you

102
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,459
save one person or you kill one<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

103
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,709
to save a billion you know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

104
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:55,970
that a lot of people struggle<font color="#CCCCCC"> with or</font>

105
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,560
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's in</font>

106
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,730
their hometown like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

107
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,170
hypocrites like when it's in their

108
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,610
hometown and you're killing a couple

109
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,680
bums in order to save a billion soldiers

110
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,330
and a billion people you know on the

111
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,220
front lines like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font>

112
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,480
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">what if that was me what if that was my</font>

114
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">friend that's just inhumane to kill</font>

115
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,650
people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all there's got to be a</font>

116
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,760
different way and people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font>

117
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it more deep than that they</font>

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">just think you know well there's got to</font>

119
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,980
be another way and you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

120
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,180
going to make a change so let's just

121
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,560
leave it the way that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is easier to</font>

122
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,530
leave it out of sight<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of mind</font>

123
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,960
than it is to actually do something

124
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,010
about it so people rise up and kind of

125
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because it's</font>

126
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,340
right in their front yard and society

127
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,130
and people in general have a huge

128
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,340
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowing things to happen</font>

129
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,889
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of mind like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

130
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">people freak out when they see how</font>

131
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,220
animals are slaughtered or animals are

132
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,840
caged in order to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> food for us or</font>

133
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,700
like oh no Bacon's good I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

134
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,080
much else about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then when they're</font>

135
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,540
like faced with having to like kill

136
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,919
their own food they're like oh my god

137
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's so fucking terrible all that</font>

138
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,460
makes me sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my stomach and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

139
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing happens with like war like we we</font>

140
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,440
love these like war veterans and what

141
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,240
they do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us but if they were doing</font>

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">something similar as a vigilante in our</font>

143
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,690
own backyard and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the the</font>

144
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,150
fruits like<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote-unquote fruits in a</font>

145
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,570
kind of sarcastic ironic way of their

146
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,460
labor where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually dying</font>

147
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,910
and stuffs actually being you know

148
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">affected in their own home town they</font>

149
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,880
have like such problems with that but

150
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,160
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be killed in the like scores</font>

151
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,229
somewhere else and that's kind of

152
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,030
ridiculous like when 911 happened I'm

153
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,470
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to take away from the tragedy</font>

154
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,419
that is 911 in the tragedy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

155
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:32,979
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens in America like</font>

156
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the Unabomber or Columbine and</font>

157
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,390
stuff but we worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about small amounts</font>

158
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,100
of Americans being killed so much more

159
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,020
than we worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about anything else than</font>

160
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,610
like Africans starving a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

161
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,930
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pretend that they care about that</font>

162
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,640
kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they try to like you</font>

163
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,680
know as a faceless person give a dollar

164
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,180
a month and feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're making a</font>

165
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,200
difference and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even really</font>

166
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,580
look into the charity and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

167
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,850
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that where I would</font>

168
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,860
rather just say fuck the whole lot of

169
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">them because that's my honest opinion</font>

170
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,950
because I'm a human being rather than

171
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,840
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know pretending to be this like</font>

172
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,600
holier-than-thou person and that in

173
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,210
itself to me can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of evil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

174
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,390
people are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know selfish that</font>

175
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,190
they only care about their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> city or</font>

176
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,050
their own country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

177
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">give a shit about what's going on</font>

178
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,140
outside of it because if you gave a shit

179
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">about every single human life that was</font>

180
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,479
taken or taken away from you or like

181
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,120
taken in Africa like you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

182
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">sobbing your brain out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your entire life</font>

183
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,130
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much death just like there's</font>

184
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,530
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being born</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

185
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,270
opinion I really think that the only

186
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you should</font>

187
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,910
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about are the people who have made</font>

188
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,010
your life better and that everyone

189
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,630
should be protecting their loved ones

190
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,370
but they shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worried about</font>

191
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people's loved ones because you</font>

192
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,880
just can't do that you can't care about

193
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,170
everyone in the world and a lot of

194
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this holier-than-thou</font>

195
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,840
opinion that they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that</font>

196
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,250
when really they're just selfishly

197
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,870
caring about the things they can see in

198
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">front of them and not a big picture and</font>

199
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,190
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes into play too and it's</font>

200
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,690
just such a fucking deep topic I could

201
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,640
literally talk about it forever but I

202
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the place where people fall short</font>

203
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,940
in relationships basically is that they

204
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,730
have an evil guy or an evil girl and

205
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,300
then this person continuously comes back

206
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,670
and shows them the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> in them because</font>

207
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,590
not every like there is nothing that is

208
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,170
wholly bad or wholly good wholly evil

209
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,210
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> wholly good that's just not a thing</font>

210
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,770
everyone has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little good and evil and</font>

211
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was my problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the guy Jared</font>

212
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,430
that I dated where it was just like I

213
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,050
kept<font color="#CCCCCC"> going back to him because when we</font>

214
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,580
are together<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have these great moments</font>

215
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,810
and it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be amazing I would remember</font>

216
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,850
the good times but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

217
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,310
you have to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to even it out and</font>

218
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,440
you can't be sucked in again and by

219
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,540
negative things if this person has a

220
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">wholly negative impact on you even if</font>

221
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,870
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are good times even if you're</font>

222
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miss them you have to separate</font>

223
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,900
yourself from them and the same way i

224
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,080
feel like people dismiss other people

225
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,190
because they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that to</font>

226
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,350
them is evil when it's not factually

227
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,460
evil and that's what a lot of people

228
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,260
don't understand is that their

229
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,700
perception is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a fact their</font>

230
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,050
perception is actually just their

231
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,330
perception it's their experience it's a

232
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,220
hundred billion experiences and things

233
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were told and things that</font>

234
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you stacked up to make who you</font>

235
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,170
are as an individual and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why it's</font>

236
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,750
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> individuality because everyone is</font>

237
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,280
fucking different everyone has built up

238
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,590
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> billion different moments and yours</font>

239
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,880
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be the same as someone</font>

240
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,650
else to write someone else off and to

241
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,240
not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that understanding is another</font>

242
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,280
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those small picture things that</font>

243
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
humans like deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it I see a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

244
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,180
like what I consider to be unintelligent

245
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,820
people like just not understanding that

246
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,919
and maybe we weren't meant to understand

247
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,600
anything outside of our selfishness you

248
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,080
know like in the wild or whatever

249
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,830
naturally there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a bunch of people</font>

250
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">who you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like we would have to care</font>

251
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,940
only for ourselves and only for our

252
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,530
immediate family like that's that's what

253
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,610
makes sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the wild because</font>

254
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,840
otherwise we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get eaten if</font>

255
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,620
we're running around

256
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,910
saving other people we're just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

257
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,290
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> eaten and it's like kind of a martyr</font>

258
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,060
thing where why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you be a martyr</font>

259
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,200
for something that doesn't directly

260
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,390
affect you and it makes sense so that's

261
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,850
why I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have a you know a pathetic</font>

262
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,640
view on that a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit um something</font>

263
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,990
else I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say I don't remember</font>

264
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,779
what it was is going to be like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh so</font>

265
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,850
about the like when someone seems really

266
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,890
good it's kind of funny and this is

267
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be the little sexual part I</font>

268
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,339
have to put sexuality and everything but

269
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,710
um a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people would consider sexual</font>

270
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,450
deviancy especially like really deep

271
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,250
dark sexual deviancy like I have where

272
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,390
I'm like ah what'll be right and

273
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brighton like that kind of thing they</font>

274
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,630
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be bad and they</font>

275
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,400
wouldn't see that in a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

276
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,550
who are good people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i often get</font>

277
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,230
attracted to people who are good people

278
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,040
like there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

279
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,660
different communities people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have power</font>

280
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,930
people of popularity who<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem like the</font>

281
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,660
most angel angelic people that you will

282
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever fucking meat they're the sweetest</font>

283
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,450
nicest people that care about their

284
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,890
communities they love their fans blah

285
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,660
blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I meet them and</font>

286
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,730
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a fucking crazy sexual</font>

287
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,930
deviant just like everyone else like

288
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,270
I've literally not met a person who is

289
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,600
like actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a crazy sexual</font>

290
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,100
deviance I just like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna fucking</font>

291
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,260
dick like literally every single guy you

292
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,570
can think of like if you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

293
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,920
interact with them you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

294
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,570
assume that I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're also a</font>

295
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,130
sexual deviant there's no one I've met

296
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,510
and I've met a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've</font>

297
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,760
talked to a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> personally</font>

298
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,870
where I don't really know them that well

299
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've really get to know them but I</font>

300
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,680
do bring out the sexuality in people and

301
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,640
that's something that's very interesting

302
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,070
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me about being a quote unquote you</font>

303
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,440
