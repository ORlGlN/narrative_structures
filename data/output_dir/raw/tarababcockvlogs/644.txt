65
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,280
kind of out of the ordinary I got to

66
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,770
walk by like the the circus place and

67
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,880
all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see some of the shops</font>

68

but I can go into this new world so it's

69
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,459
