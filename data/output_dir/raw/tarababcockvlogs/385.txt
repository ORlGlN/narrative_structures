00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
hey guys it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for my weekly phone</font>

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,740
vlog I have no place to put my arm what

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,620
the fuck is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um I don't know</font>

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,110
from what angle to record things at

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,150
because everything is all crazy and

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,580
these are like fucking presents and

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,900
things down here that I haven't put away

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,730
and like a bunch of garbage and stuff

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where I film and I've moved</font>

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,830
the softbox down so it's actually

11
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,090
illuminating my face you can see me

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,590
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily a good thing</font>

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,849
right now because for some reason that

14
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having a bout of bad skin again</font>

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,990
which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I was fucking done with</font>

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,630
like Jesus Christ I started on the birth

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,700
control pill again and then I had like

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,309
perfect skin and now I'll Smoove over

19
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,370
here yeah and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,800
occasional like shitty ski and I think

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,629
it's around my period time which you

22
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,250
know makes sense but<font color="#E5E5E5"> still I'm gonna</font>

23
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,469
fucking adults that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

24
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about being an adult man is that you</font>

25
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,219
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with shitty skin</font>

26
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,989
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that's one of the perks at</font>

27
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,329
least today we're going to talk about um

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm actually gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a semi topic for</font>

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,879
this one but I want to address how I

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,760
feel about new year's resolutions and

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,040
also my new year's resolutions if you

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,189
want to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> them that I think like with</font>

33
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,390
most traditions the new year's

34
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,189
resolutions and all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

35
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,960
silly and are often counterproductive

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,000
and if you're one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people who</font>

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,150
can only console yourself to make a

38
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,890
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your life when there's some</font>

39
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,960
kind of time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be doing</font>

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that when it's tradition to do so then</font>

41
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,170
you're probably not the kind of person

42
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,460
that's going to be sticking to it and

43
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,740
therefore it just like it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

44
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent counterproductive and kind of</font>

45
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,759
stupid I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is a time where</font>

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,740
people at least try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change their</font>

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,630
lives because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people will make</font>

48
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,400
adjustments and will change<font color="#E5E5E5"> their lives</font>

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then things will actually improve</font>

50
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,729
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and that's good and it's fine</font>

51
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,799
if someone derives motivation from some

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,810
stupid thing like a tradition so don't

53
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">get me wrong if there's someone who had</font>

54
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,500
a New Year's tradition to completely you

55
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,240
know lose like 500<font color="#CCCCCC"> pounds and then did</font>

56
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,460
it or to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> start a business and</font>

57
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,049
then did it that's fucking great and I

58
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,880
applaud you but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really think that</font>

59
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,909
mostly most change comes from people

60
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,219
really wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then just</font>

61
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,659
doing it for themselves and it has

62
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing to do with the time of year and</font>

63
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">it has nothing to do with anything else</font>

64
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,400
and people derive motivation from a

65
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,830
bunch of different things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um usual</font>

66
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,120
most of it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,250
yourself and you have to really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

68
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,570
do it and it can't just be something

69
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel socially obligated to do</font>

70
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time of year so that's</font>

71
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,340
kind of why I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Year's</font>

72
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,740
resolutions are stupid and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that vein</font>

73
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,020
my new<font color="#E5E5E5"> year's resolutions are to just</font>

74
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,840
continue improving my content it's like

75
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,540
not something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be done at</font>

76
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,490
this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of year it's just something</font>

77
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,480
that always needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done in</font>

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,210
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do and</font>

79
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,300
so some of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have on the</font>

80
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,790
roster for changing most of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

81
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,830
directed at the gaming channel because

82
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,690
the gaming channel is kind of stagnated

83
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,490
a little bit and I realized that just

84
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,260
posting the two different types of Let's

85
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,550
Plays doesn't really do it for like

86
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,260
ninety percent of my viewership and

87
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,510
ninety percent of my subscribers so the

88
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,880
whole adding different things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

89
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,060
unboxings more lists videos I have one

90
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,890
going up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaming channel on I</font>

91
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,580
think sunday that's a list of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten I</font>

92
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,000
feel like I'm smelling blood like like I

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nosebleed or something which</font>

94
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,480
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very rare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me it's weird it's</font>

95
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,959
uncomfortable but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway um it's you</font>

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,550
guys you guys were so hot you're causing

97
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,209
a Japanese<font color="#E5E5E5"> nosebleed like oh so hot</font>

98
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,269
fucking boobies and shit<font color="#CCCCCC"> right um but</font>

99
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway um what the fuck was I talking</font>

100
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,580
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah um the list video is gonna</font>

101
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,360
be 20 hottest men games not in gaming in

102
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,769
games and gaming would be more like

103
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,360
streamers and stuff and there are many

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">hot guys in gay in gaming to be honest</font>

105
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">like there are more hot gamers who</font>

106
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,830
aren't making a living off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it then</font>

107
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,019
there are hot gamer personalities which

108
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,430
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of counterintuitive because when</font>

109
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,720
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the entertainment industry</font>

110
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,430
you think of all of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> attractive</font>

111
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,070
versions of real<font color="#E5E5E5"> life situations like</font>

things on my ps4 which should be cool

135
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,300
because you get a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

136
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,710
mainstream games in there as well like

like maybe it's seven to play it and it

156
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,759
sucks that I have this inkling to do

157
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,620
less plays of games that are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> old or</font>

158
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,060
games that people don't know about and

159
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,990
like it sucks that my most of my viewers

160
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,419
and most of the subscribers on youtube

161
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,099
in general or just interested in like

162
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,229
more mainstream games and I'm hoping

163
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,560
that I can kind of be the departure from

164
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,389
that and play all different types of

165
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:55,770
games and sometimes I'll play you know

166
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,779
popular games because I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

167
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,279
popular games<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mainstream games it's</font>

168
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,199
just that there's so many great indie

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,810
games and you know my highlight of my

170
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,089
life was playing retro games as a child

171
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:09,629
not like right now where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

172
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,479
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten favorite franchises and I play</font>

173
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,250
all those but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really want to be</font>

174
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,509
doing is just you know trying out new

175
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,099
indie games and reliving my childhood

176
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,680
basically and i also love playing things

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,449
you know like the the new fucking metal

178
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">your solids that come out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Assassin's</font>

179
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">Creed's right now I'm finally finished</font>

180
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,550
with unity I just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dead</font>

181
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,339
Kings<font color="#E5E5E5"> DLC and then I'm on to syndicate</font>

182
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,750
which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fucking awesome but</font>

183
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,029
the thing about playing my favorite

184
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,279
franchises on stream is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

185
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,719
rather just relax on the couch and not

186
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,339
have to worry about spoilers not have to

187
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,779
worry about anything like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for my</font>

188
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,129
first playthrough so usual

189
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,050
Lee if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be playing one of my</font>

190
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,339
favorite franchises is not going to be

191
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,529
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just came out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I want to</font>

192
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,169
get the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> full playthrough and private</font>

193
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:51,269
first and then play it for you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

194
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,459
often that just doesn't pan out because

195
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already like not a popular game</font>

196
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,279
anymore people don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it</font>

197
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,899
something I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing is</font>

198
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,519
let's plays of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assassins creed</font>

199
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,589
chronicles series because it's like a

200
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,689
side-scroller and fucking love side

201
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,159
scrollers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love this house is Crede</font>

202
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,499
and that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get the lure of the</font>

203
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:09,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">smaller games and maybe I'll do like</font>

204
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,589
liberation or something on stream as

205
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,649
well or I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> on youtube as well but</font>

206
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:15,839
yeah no<font color="#CCCCCC"> more talk about fucking games</font>

207
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,939
man I feel so bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I constantly talk</font>

208

about games the point is my new year's

209
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,379
resolution and my everyday resolution is

210
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,229
to just keep continuing improving my

211
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,019
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to improve my editing and</font>

212
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,879
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do more editing and make that</font>

213
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,259
things just more professional and look

219
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:43,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">started streaming a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font>

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,899
background of modeling and you know like

305
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
years even after playing like two years

306
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">now of League of Legends it's still</font>

307
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,330
awkward to me to use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking keyboard</font>

308
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,380
over a controller but I understand the

309
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,660
there's limitations to the skill cap for

310
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,310
games that use a controller in my

311
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,320
opinion a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people would argue that</font>

312
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,150
things like call of duty and stuff are

313
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,230
better played with a controller or

314
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,460
better played on a console that I

315
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,160
disagree with that so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

316
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i rambled so much</font>

317
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,520
about games the games are a huge part of

318
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,180
my life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just really excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

319
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,830

328
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,490
just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of silly and overplayed</font>

329
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,100
to see the gym full right after New

330
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,139
Year's and then to see the gym be empty

331
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,089
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> months later and it's just kind of</font>

332
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,970
sad like why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even do it at</font>

333
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,459
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point but there are people who get</font>

greatness from it and drive you know
