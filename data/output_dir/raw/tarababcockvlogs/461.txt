56
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,280
couch and doing stuff will make me

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,930
convalesce faster but I don't know I

58
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,610
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was better and then I got</font>

59
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,259
worse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I got a lot worse and</font>

60
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,030
it's just so fucking awful so some of

61
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,009
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got at the fair Jay got</font>

62
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,490
these in a large version and also it

63
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,990
came with two of these you click this

64
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,410
there and like it starts you see it's

65
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,750
like filling up with this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's</font>

66
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,840
heated

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,129
it's like a heat pack for your hands and

68
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">he has a really big one for his back</font>

69
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,780
because he has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lower back pains and</font>

70
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,099
it's kind of cool but I've realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

71
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,480
putting it in hot water doesn't work you

72
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,530
actually have to put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in boiling water</font>

73
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,069
so it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a pain in the ass then</font>

74
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,030
then actually having to microwave

75
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,099
something but it's so warm which is not

76
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,330
very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me right now because right</font>

77
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,150
