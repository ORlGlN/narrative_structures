where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just like smooth over in a</font>

60
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,729
ridiculous fashion and everything was

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,060
topic actually thought about this story

64
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,129
because I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of those pictures</font>

65
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,300
that I thought were gone because the

66
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,360
hard drive of my lap

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,340

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,600
see those pictures again but there was

69
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,820
some kind of cached version of my

70
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,730
myspace up on the internet yesterday

things and I'm just like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fuck</font>

156
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is all of my social networks</font>

157
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,400
everything I hold dear like a lot of

158
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,070
really important information of mine on

159
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,750
the internet and he goes I bought it for

160
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so you can now change your passwords</font>

161
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,160
and I like immediately going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which is</font>

162
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,539
changing on my passwords like freaking

163
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,250
out like oh my god<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is my life right</font>

164
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,259
now this is like part of who I am and

165
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,330
everything that's so important to me it

166
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,550
had like my my wild login which didn't

167
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,620
really matter because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was fucking you</font>

168
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,030
know I have the the little keychain

169
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,949
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> little authenticator thank</font>

170
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,660
well I did but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so don't hack</font>

171
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,260
my blizzard account guys and um it was

172
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,510
my myspace I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was Facebook</font>

173
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,010
back then I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite sure like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

174
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,930
starting just like a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

175
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,849
things my model mayhem everything and it

176
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,260
was just like so stressful to me because

177
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,300
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of the way that I built</font>

178
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,210
myself up as a model it was like a lot

179
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I really cared about it I</font>

180
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,349
was really worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh like a</font>

181
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,260
bug bite<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something Oh what the fuck</font>

182
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,500
you just see this all of a sudden I feel

183
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,240
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a sweater might or something</font>

184
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,380
anyway whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and so I immediately</font>

185
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,330
changed my passwords and I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanked</font>

186
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,919
the guy and then he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like do you want</font>

187
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,479
to pay me<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this i did a really huge</font>

188
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,760
service for you by you know paying for

189
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,130
this thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like you could</font>

190
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,080
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the guy who key logged me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

191
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,849

192
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,740
money like fuck off thanks for the

193
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,630
whatever you did for me but yeah this

194
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,789
seems really<font color="#E5E5E5"> much like a scam and I'm</font>

195
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,090
just not interested in at all and since

196
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">then I've been very very very scared of</font>

197
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,710
unloading anything because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

198
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,380
executable file so dot exe can

199
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,759
potentially be storing some kind of

200
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,889
virus or keylogger in it and since<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

201
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,300
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a few run-ins with like</font>

202
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,070
weird viruses that I don't know how the

203
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,389
fuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got them because i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

204
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,530
download anything but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just like ran</font>

205
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,360
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those like sweeper things and it</font>

206
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,440
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine everything went back to normal</font>

207
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,060
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would have I would download like</font>

208
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,990
random free like a different type of

209
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,850
like audio editing files when I was

210
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,919
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how I was going to</font>

211
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,990
do the podcasting and stuff like that a

212
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,840
while back and how I could edit my my

213
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,330
sound too for this like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mike that i have</font>

214
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was trying to figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how I could</font>

215
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,229
best edit my sound and a few of those

216
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:21,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">things came with some like weird shit</font>

217
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,350
that I just didn't click off remember

218
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">anytime you're downloading something to</font>

219
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,100
actually go through and do a custom

220
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,479
setup because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do a custom</font>

221
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,039
setup you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get a bunch of</font>

222
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,169
stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> toolbars on your shit and you</font>

223
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,849
could potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up installing a</font>

224
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:35,440
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other things you don't need and</font>

225
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
it's also important to go through in

226
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,320
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> control panel go through the things</font>

227
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,910
you have installed and just uninstall

228
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,050
things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

229
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,340
they're there or old games they haven't

230
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,620
played forever that's important but it

231
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,720
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very scary to me that that situation</font>

232
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,160
happened because i feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if anyone</font>

233
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">else had bought my my stuff it would be</font>

234
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,760
really scary also there were a bunch of

235
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,740
web cam pictures of me now like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

236
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,180
get naked in front of my computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

237
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,860
like when I'm not using my my laptop

238
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,360
it's like closed or whatever so they

239
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,940
didn't have like a lot of sexy pictures

240
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,169
of me and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never done anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

241
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,240
webcam shows but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did have like a</font>

242
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,710
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> pictures of just my face like</font>

243
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,639
sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> while I'm obviously</font>

244
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,080
looking at the screen doing something

245
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,300
and that was also creepy as well because

246
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,070
the fact that my webcam was turning on

247
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,500
wasn't just nothing it was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that</font>

248
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,020
somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain someone gained access to my</font>

249
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,669
webcam and this is like a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

250
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,110
that people do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really fucking</font>

251
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,020
creepy and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it out classes the</font>

252
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,909
creepiness of the people who indeed

253
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before I got a cloud server for</font>

254
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,708
my skype it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like way</font>

255
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,539
creepier way more invasive and way worse

256
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,779
and yeah you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any virus stories</font>

257
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,010
and you viruses you've gotten from

258
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,659
downloading like poor and our certain

259
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,760
programs is there anything that you can

260
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,529
tell me about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has happened to you</font>

261
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,510
that's kind of similar is very scary to

262
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,850
me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very glad that that hasn't</font>

263
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,950
happened since and I'm pretty protective

264
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,710
of all of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> information now so</font>

265
