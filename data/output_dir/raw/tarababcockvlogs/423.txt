00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
hey guys so one of my viewers which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't remember the name of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,650
wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down my phone and my phone</font>

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,060
fucking died as you guys know I'm doing

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">two videos today so if you watch the</font>

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,139
previous video you already know about my

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,360
whole plight with fucking phone dying

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,590
but anyway today we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

9
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,820
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my price or the the saying that</font>

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone has a price type of thing or</font>

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,720
everyone will sell out for a certain

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,970
amount of money the viewer actually gave

13
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,490
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really specific topic and he was</font>

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,449
like maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

15
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,880
a video and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like a man</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,620
a woman like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple asking for me to</font>

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,790
be their sex slave for a certain amount

18
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,260
of time if I give that if they give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

19
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">million dollars type of thing um and I</font>

20
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,520
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about my price in</font>

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,219
general or the idea that everyone has a

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,620
price and everyone will do anything for

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,210
a certain amount of money and some

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,070
people's threshold for what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

25
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,840
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> is higher or lower depending on the</font>

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
money and depending on their you know

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,370
desperation and all that um for me I

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,140
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like my life is absolutely fucking</font>

29
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,840
perfect and I want for nothing basically

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,550
like there are times when I'm like oh

31
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,619
you know if I had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money I would</font>

32
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,790
buy this and that and if I was a

33
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,229
millionaire I would do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in that and</font>

34
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would find things to do with</font>

35
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,400
money and last night on stream up

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,420
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> said they have more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money than</font>

37
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,770
they know what to do with and I kind of

38
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,259
made fun of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> notion because if I</font>

39
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,210
just like inflated my<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to a billion</font>

40
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,720
times you know my income would rise and

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,280
so would you know the amount of money

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I spend I would always know what to</font>

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,310
do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I could save it I could</font>

44
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,990
invest it i<font color="#CCCCCC"> could start another business</font>

45
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,090
on the side<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could give to charity i</font>

46
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,070
could start my own nonprofit like there

47
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,720
are a million things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to do and</font>

48
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,729
that i would do if i had more money but

49
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,130
there's nothing i want for me material

50
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,840
possessions like I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for someone</font>

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,500
who looks the way that I do I

52
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,189
surprisingly don't give a shit about

53
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,070
money it's like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make money and</font>

54
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,649
make a living<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can survive but</font>

55
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,299
all I want to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> be mildly</font>

56
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,939
comfortable and have that opportunity to

57
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,579
improve and what makes me happy when I

58
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,320
improve on youtube or what makes me

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,689
happy when I'm making<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

60
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,790
money off of certain things is that I'm

61
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,860
improving my business and I'm succeeding

62
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,329
and the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I love to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

63
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,729
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everyone in the world</font>

64
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,660
undeniably wants to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

65
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">they love and make money off of</font>

66
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,739
and it's weird that people kind of shame

67
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,239
me for that and act like I'm some kind

68
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,650
of money-grubbing whore or something

69
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,599
when you know i'm spending all my time

70
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,069
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like literally on my</font>

71
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,680
time and I'm making people laugh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

72
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,819
making people think and I'm you know

73
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">entertaining people and oh the notion of</font>

74
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,530
me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know wanting to be able to</font>

75
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,840
survive and eat while doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

76
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,730
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fucking despicable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on some kind</font>

77
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of serious moral flaw when it's not you</font>

78
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,420
know you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what you love and</font>

79
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,700
you need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> money to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> survive to eat</font>

80
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,860
to pay the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bills and stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

81
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,879
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

82
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,170
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> morally wrong with that and I</font>

83
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel like people are looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it very</font>

84
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,440
differently where they're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,629
I'm the rich getting richer which is not

86
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,720
the case at all I'm like actually barely

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,599
mom I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now like it'sit's</font>

88
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,040
been climbing and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working</font>

89
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,870
really hard to improve everything so I'm

90
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,239
actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and the amount</font>

91
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pride that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have in just the fact</font>

92
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,230
that I can support myself doing what I

93
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,569
love and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I did was successful</font>

94
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,109
is like worth so much more than any

95
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:10,849
amount of money and it makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel so</font>

96
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,500
good i'm looking back at pictures like

97
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,450
my plaque for 100k subscribers and the

98
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,340
fact that either of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my youtube channels</font>

99
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,489
they make less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 500 a month by a lot</font>

100
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,319
the gaming channel by a lot makes less

101
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,120
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't actually give direct</font>

102
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,760
amounts but I can you know you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

103
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,169
like extrapolate from what I say and

104
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,660
it's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like that doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

105
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,250
that money amount doesn't matter the

106
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,180
fact that you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are enjoying my</font>

107
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,010
content or I have more viewers and more

108
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,480
subscribers and more people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just</font>

109
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">like wow you're doing a good job like</font>

110
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that fills my heart with joy and that's</font>

111
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,799
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me happy doing what I love</font>

112
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,319
and so like for me I don't feel like I

113
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,959
have a price like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I can understand if</font>

114
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,340
someone was in a situation where they

115
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,720
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely desperate or they had to</font>

116
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,760
feed their family or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever I can see</font>

117
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,709
their price price threshold being lower

118
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,720
and that's completely fine and everyone

119
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,980
assumes that if someone's doing

120
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,720
something for money it's because they

121
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,980
are money-grubbing whores who are rich

122
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,299
getting richer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font>

123
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,590
at all a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people have to do it to</font>

124
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,849
feed their families a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

125
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,889
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they have to</font>

126
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,400
and that makes / like a fucking feather

127
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,900
that flew<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> face because I've got</font>

128
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,639
birds in here or something anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

129
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,109
that's like perfectly acceptable and

130
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,280
understandable and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people just</font>

131
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't put themselves in other people's</font>

132
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,970
shoes and they just like try to assume

133
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that someone is doing a certain way and</font>

134
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,048
that they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trick you into</font>

135
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:22,940
doing something and that just<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

136
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,010
make any sense to me

137
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,990
so if someone said I'll give you a

138
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,060
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars to do a porn or I'll</font>

139
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,320
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> million dollars to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have sex</font>

140
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,060
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I would turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that down because</font>

141
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,340
yeah a million dollars I would you know

142
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,320
by some fun stuff and I would get it

143
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,060
some you know cool things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font>

144
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,740
and you know I would improve some things

145
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,080
but at the same time I would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

146
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,580
saving a lot of it and giving a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

147
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,280
it to charity like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ASPCA or I think</font>

148
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,810
that's the the acronym or whatever the

149
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Association for whatever the fuck is</font>

150
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,540
something that I give<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to for</font>

151
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,940
animals and because that's one of the

152
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,620
ones that I've actually vetted and like

planes and I thought it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

286
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,100
stressful and I was uncomfortable with

287

any degrading shit like there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things</font>

307
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,699
that I would do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not for a</font>

308
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,980
monetary amount and especially how

309
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,290
comfortable I am right now like I'm fine

310
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,019
I can pay my bills I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little bit</font>

311
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:29,750
extra i'm slowly saving and sure you

312
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,100
know having more money would be nice but

313
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">i guess the summation of this video is</font>

314
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">just that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not really a</font>

315
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,350
materialistic person as much as you

316
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,389
might see me as that because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

317
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,699
I look it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that's just how I am</font>

318
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,290
and that's just how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel and you can</font>

319
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,060
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at face value or you can post in</font>

320
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,050
the comments that I'm a stupid

321
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,550
materialistic slut<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would probably</font>

322
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,990
suck a dick for a dollar and you know

323
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,300
you would be wrong factually but I

324
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,339
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you would feel that way</font>

325
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way I look or whatever</font>

326
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,870
but the way I look is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

327
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,180
representation of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money I want</font>

328
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,590
to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stupid shit it</font>

329
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,830
representation of me wanting the best

330

body for the one body that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in</font>

331

this life and you know me having a hobby

332
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,190
that took years to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a level of you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think oh she's ugly or whatever I like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">money but you know it's not worth it</font>

340
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,510
there's no reason for me to do something

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I don't want to do if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>
