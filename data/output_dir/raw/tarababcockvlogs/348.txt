00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,180
smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you want just in case you</font>

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,439
might have to do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,449

I'm going to be doing this series to be

26
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,610
honest the the phone vlog series because

27
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,230
most people are not watching the videos

28
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,760
and I thought it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like a cool</font>

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,770
way to like lay down and do them like

30
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,760
les hommes the less uptight videos I for

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,040
lack of a better way to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them</font>

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,869
but it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aren't</font>

33
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,820
interested in hearing how my week goes

34

rendering and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for that to</font>

53
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,079
finish so i can stream because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't</font>

54
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,729
stream while I'm rendering which kind of

55
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,460
sucks but i have in this year become

56
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,030
like one hundred percent full-time

57
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,490
content producer which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

58
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,100
amazing thing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world like up until</font>

59
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,788
like about a year ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was almost a</font>

60
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:09,899
full-time model and then i was like

61
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,730
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stream as much as i could and</font>

62
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,270
trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calm</font>

63
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,520
on my gaming and vlog channel that I

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,740
liked to<font color="#CCCCCC"> had just created and I am just</font>

65
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,450
so grateful that<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I now no longer</font>

66
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,030
have to model in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to make ends meet</font>

67
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,310
which is wonderful i love modeling but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

68
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,440
don't want to take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs anymore that</font>

69
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,880
are paid if that makes any sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

70
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,820
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very occasionally jobs that</font>

71
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,170
are paid that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually enjoy doing</font>

72
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,540
modeling for me is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an artistic</font>

73
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,370
release it's a sexual release it's like

74
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,290
something i do that um I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose</font>

75
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,580
what I'm doing if that makes any sense

76
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the shoots that I enjoy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our the</font>

77
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,030
shoots that I get to control<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I</font>

78
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">get to one hundred percent control like</font>

79
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,360
the Wardrobe the<font color="#E5E5E5"> editing afterwards</font>

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,310
which photographer i'm using what our

81
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,530
concept is then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not getting paid</font>

82
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,380
because i'm putting too much say in

83
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,360
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and usually the paid</font>

84
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,010
shoots are like Oh some guy wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

85
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,380
like improve his portfolio so he's using

86
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,720
his style or I'm shooting for like

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,340
hustler lingerie which is you know

88
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,200
obviously their lingerie just a white

89
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,510
background very you know flat lighting

90
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,940
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like get get in get her done type</font>

91
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,070
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like the quickie of</font>

92
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,290
modeling when you shoot like<font color="#E5E5E5"> lingerie</font>

93
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,590
stuff they<font color="#E5E5E5"> booked you for like a full</font>

94
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,570
hour or two hours right so you get your

95
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,190
hourly<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate but usually it only takes</font>

96
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,690
like fucking 30 or 40 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or even</font>

97
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,459
less sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you just like you just</font>

98
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,620
put on an outfit do a couple but to do

99
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,660
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another outfit do the same thing</font>

100
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,850
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's pretty much all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do and</font>

101
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,900
it's like the easiest thing in the world

102
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,270
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's good money but it's not fun</font>

103
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not what I want to do with my life</font>

104
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,230
it's not me feeling like I'm getting

105
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">some creative license in what I'm doing</font>

106
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,090
you know so like when I model for me

107
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,490
it's so much more fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like</font>

108
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,260
control everything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and it makes</font>

109
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,700
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know if you're a</font>

110
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,430
painter or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a writer or an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> artist you</font>

111
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,810
don't have someone else dictating like

112
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,180
what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing right so for me when I</font>

113
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,860
want to like my favorite shoot of all

114
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,690
time was the shoot I guess I actually

115
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,760
get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and show you because I can't oh</font>

116
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,910
so this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite photo of all time</font>

117
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,660
from my favorite shoot and I literally

118
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,400
did everything from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground up I'm</font>

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,700
gonna lay down

120
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I did everything for that shoot from</font>

121
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ground up from the the makeup I did</font>

122
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,360
the makeup um the concept the editing

123
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,919
afterwards I even got the syringe from

124
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,820
my from my plastic surgeon and

125
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,949
everything was just me you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like and</font>

126
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,810
I really loved it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was amazing and</font>

127
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,000
I'd feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an artist and I feel like</font>

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">my creative outlet is like fully fully</font>

129
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,810
encompassed in doing shoots like that if

130
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that makes any sense so um what else</font>
