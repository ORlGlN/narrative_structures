revolves around that and that happens

28
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,960
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do and</font>

32
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,500
in the eye<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are extremely</font>

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,880
ungrateful for their fans and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

34
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,160
a lot of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know entertainment avenues</font>

35
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,360
where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really matter if you</font>

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,860
have fans and that's not the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

37
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,320
make who you are but most avenues where

38
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,250
you are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in the</font>

39
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,840
entertainment industry your fans make

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,040
you who you are if you're fans didn't

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,570
exist and the people who watch your

42
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,830
content and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who support you</font>

43
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,330
if they didn't exist you would be

44
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,730
absolutely nothing and you owe so much

45
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,350
to them and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving back by</font>

46
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,270
going and meeting them and talking to

47
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,530
them for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit and you know</font>

48
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,480
giving hugs as much as possible like I

shake my hand like no hug<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah and I</font>

53
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,480
fucking love that and I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

54
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,000
conventions for modeling of one of the

55

Playboy Playmates and models and stuff

58
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,580

59
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,500
purchase autograph images or take

<font color="#CCCCCC">that but I actually made more</font>

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,470

that you think is beautiful or good you

92
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,470
know there's chances that there are

93
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,060
hundreds or thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font>

94
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,350
out there that feel the same way you do

95
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,050
and have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> tastes you do and</font>

96
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,250
showing your content to the world brings

97
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,350
them in to that fact and you have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

98
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,970
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> community of people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

99
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">same sense of humor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do the same</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you know taste that you do and you can</font>

101
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,870
find people who click with you so much

102
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,640
better through your like fan base or

103
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,110
your viewer base then you can just by

104
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,340
walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and viewing people and</font>

105
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,130
that's why I view my fans as an extended

106
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">family and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have many</font>

107
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,459
friends that I view as extended family I

108
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have many family members I just</font>

109
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,700
have my mom and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dad and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay and a</font>

110
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,840
couple of other people like I talked

111
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,330
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> respect but my fans</font>

112
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,860
people I haven't even met<font color="#CCCCCC"> in real life</font>

113
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,810
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time are just people who</font>

114
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,580
impacted my life the most and I fucking

115
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,989
understand that and I'm very grateful

116
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,049
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys but um that being said</font>

117
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,459
there are things that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of annoy</font>

118
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,769
me when like fans come up and talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

119
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,290
like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind fans coming up and</font>

120
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,760
talking to me or taking a picture or

121
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,010
wanting to chat at any point ever the

122
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,900
one thing that kind of bothers me and

123
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this happened a little bit um well at</font>

124
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,620
first I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to do it to</font>

125
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,510
me but then he didn't the one thing I

126
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,720
don't like is um trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monopolize my</font>

127
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,330
time if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes any sense like if I'm</font>

128
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,650
in a magic tournament which is a place

129
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">where you you aren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really moving</font>

130
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,350
around much because in between rounds

131
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,489
you're just sitting and talking to your

132
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:14,450
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> means you have a lot of time</font>

133
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,980
especially if you play an aggro deck or

134
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,380
aggro ish deck like I do so on this guy

135
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,089
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to me and he was like super like</font>

136
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,709
oh my god you<font color="#CCCCCC"> played magic I didn't even</font>

137
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,090
know you're fucking awesome I love your

138
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,130
videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like he wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like chat</font>

139
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,240
with me and pick my brain because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

140
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,169
guess he thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was smart or</font>

141
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,640
something because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the content that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

142
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,900
create and I was like yeah that's cool

143
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,580
but then I started feeling like he was

144
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,200
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monopolize my time like I'm</font>

145
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking to my friends and he comes up</font>

146
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,599
and he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to me for an</font>

147
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,520
extended period of time I'm completely

148
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,380
fine with you coming up and like hanging

149
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,360
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my group and making everyone in</font>

150
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,950
my group feel welcome but<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're</font>

151
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,450
just there to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and I kind of</font>

152
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,470
get that because you're watching my
