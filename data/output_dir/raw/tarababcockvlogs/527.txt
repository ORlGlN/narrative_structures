my feet in the rest of my body just feel

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,860
like they're overheating and I feel like

29
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,100
about the stupid new topical news topic

30
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,629

for attention and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that it's</font>

35
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,780
for charity or like pouring ice on you

36
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,890
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that it's for awareness</font>

37
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,090
but really you're just trying to give

38
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,830
use i usually don't partake in any of

39
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,049

marriage is a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing because it's</font>

41
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,460
finally legal to get married to the same

sex in every single state in<font color="#E5E5E5"> america so</font>

44
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,450
huge amazing thing and normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

45
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,009
have a strong opinion about anything but

46
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,600
with this I fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> do and to me it's</font>

47
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">not an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a fact the</font>

48
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,770
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that i'm correct like i</font>

49
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,640
can't imagine I can't fathom like some

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,189
kind of delusion where I am not correct

51
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,350
about what I feel about same-sex

52
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,090
relationships and same-sex marriage and

53
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,920
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should be having the</font>

54
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,259
same rights as every other human every

55
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,210
other American it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> no fucking sense</font>

56
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,149
it feels so archaic and so like we're

57
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,219
back in the the dark days of America

58
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,079
where you know blacks don't have the

59
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,189
same rights as other people because

60
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,689
they're pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much not considered to be</font>

61
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,890
human like that's how I feel people are

62
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,110
people are and were treating gays you

63
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,970
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LGBT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community and I think</font>

64
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,008
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the most like retarded</font>

65
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,120
thing in the world and like think about

66
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it these fucking</font>

67
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,200

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pissed off because you know</font>

70
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,150
they're not separating church and state

71
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that oh in the</font>

72
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bible it says isn't that so why should</font>

73
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,160
we you know jeopardize the sanctity of

74
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,060
marriage<font color="#CCCCCC"> or when you know like it's just</font>

75
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,400
so fucking ridiculous to me that people

76
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,230
still feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way people still think</font>

77
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are still pushing their</font>

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">own morals in their own religion on</font>

79
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,380
people in such a way that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

80
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,990
allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that other human</font>

81
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,910
beings other Americans have the right to

82
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,980
freely do and it's so fucking stupid

83
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,560
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get married you know just for the</font>

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,750
tax write-offs and it's like oh my god

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,120
it's so stupid how we're talking about

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sanctity of marriage when the</font>

87
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,270
sanctity of marriage has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been ruined a</font>

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,010
long long<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way our</font>

society is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking it's set</font>

90
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,010
in your old ways stupid traditions and

91
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,040
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about allowing gays lesbians</font>

92
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,450
transsexuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> bisexuals to marry it's</font>

93
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,680
allowing them to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same rights as</font>

94
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,790
everyone else because a lot of them

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,590
don't give a shit to marry they just

96
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,000
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the right to marry like</font>

97

101
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,459
because their heterosexual and we're

102
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,650
basing whether or not they're allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

103
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,080
be married on something so private and

104
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,940
irrelevant as who they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have sex</font>

105
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,040
with who they're attracted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who</font>

110
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,630
sin than just lusting in general and

111
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,350
like these fucking like bigots are

112
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,090
acting like oh it's disgusting we'll

113
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,070
stop imagining a guy putting his penis

114
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,380
into another guy and go home<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fuck</font>

115
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,090
your nasty fat wife which i think is

116
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,769
disgusting should you not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

117
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,690
married no you can do whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fuck</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want and I am a full supporter of</font>

119
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,310
everyone doing whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck they</font>

120
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,830
want with anyone else if they're both

121
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,320
consenting adults and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

122
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,750
who are religious and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is</font>

123
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,430
you know because people are religious

124
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,470
are saying that it's the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

125
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,709
pedophilia or bestiality which is like

126
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,050
what the fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all pedophilia is</font>

127
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,200
wrong because in our society<font color="#CCCCCC"> we treat</font>

128
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,190
anyone under 18

129
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,530
as not being fully developed developed

130
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,060
in their brain not being fully developed

131
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,320
as a person<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they can't make those</font>

132
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,020
decisions it's not wrong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess lust</font>

133
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,830
after them it's wrong to as an adult go

134
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">after them when you know that you could</font>

135
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,560
be putting them in jeopardy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

136
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,230
could be you know manipulating their

137
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,350
very weak<font color="#E5E5E5"> and spongy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minds you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

138
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,180
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait until someone is 18 to</font>

139
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,320
make their own decisions otherwise

140
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,000
they're not really of their own you know

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,730
mindset yet they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really able they</font>

142
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,140
don't have the capacity to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

143
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing goes with</font>

144
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,950
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> bestiality that's just like</font>

145
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,780
taking advantage of an animal that is

146
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,700
not giving consent because he's not on

147
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same intellectual level of us and</font>

148
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,340
can't give consent it's like also

149
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,840
anatomically incorrect because a lot of

150
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,190
the animals that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having sex with</font>

151
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,280
are not built for our large penises or

152
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just awful and</font>

153
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong because they can't give consent</font>

154
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,050
but a gay man another gay man are adults

155
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,640
they're consenting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there of the right</font>

156
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,170
mind they have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all their</font>

157
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,760
liberties and they fell in love<font color="#E5E5E5"> why the</font>

158
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,650
fuck can't they do the same shit that I

159
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,640
can with any guy and I keep saying they

160
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,690
and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm my at my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> words are</font>

161
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,160
distancing myself from the LGBT

162
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,970
community but I do identify as bisexual

163
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,620
I've had a lot of sexual encounters with

164
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,430
women I've never had a relationship an

165
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,690
exclusive relationship where i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

166
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,430
call someone my girlfriend with a girl

167
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">because um I just love cock so much and</font>

168
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,750
I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an integral part of</font>

169
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,880
having a relationship is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

170
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,640
stick a throbbing live member in me like

171
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,470
that's what turns me on the most but I

172
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,780
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much attracted to women and at</font>

173
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,820
the same time that identify myself with

174
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,490
being bisexual and having you know by

175
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,290
sexual encounters or lesbian encounters

176
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,910
I can't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have the same</font>

177
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,060
struggles as anyone in the LGBT

178
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">community because being an attractive</font>

179
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,050
young female who's attracted to other

180
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,000
attractive young females is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

181
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,860
just something that makes you cooler

182
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,350
like it's a novelty it's something that

183
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,390
most men find sexy it's something that

184
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,800
most women are like yeah I would

185
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,080
experiment with that and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

186
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">really have the same struggles like no</font>

187
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,539
one's gonna walk down the tree and be

188
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:39,640
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking bisexual whore and like</font>

189
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,639
beat me up or

190
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,199
like kill me or anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

191
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,080
wholeheartedly believe as a female<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

192
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,300
Western society who has gotten the brunt

193
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,360
of sexism and all of the shit that

194
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,939
feminists whine about I feel like the

195
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:57,379
LGBT community<font color="#CCCCCC"> knee is far more worse</font>

196
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,240
off than any female that's why feminism

197
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,830
bothers me so much because it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

198
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,810
pretentious and it's like oh we have all

199
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,430
these problems some guy got to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

200
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,650
said we're beautiful fuck them we need

201
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,900
feminism women are getting raped which

202
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,460
really has nothing to do with women

203
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,020
being degraded it's just some asshole

204
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,879
who's not right in the head going out

205
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,889
and you know deciding that the law

206
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,270
doesn't apply to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has nothing to</font>

207
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,810
do with actually making women have the

208
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">same rights because we do have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

209
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,750
rights who doesn't have the same rights

210
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,560
until I guess just now but still is

211
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,330
faced with so much more prejudice than

212
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,930
any other woman of LGBT community you

213
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,759
guys are fucking amazing I think it's I

214
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,310
think it's wonderful when someone can

215
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,020
stand up for who they are and when

216
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,629
someone can just be like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me I'm</font>

217
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming out of the closet in spite of you</font>

218
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,219
know all of the adversity I'm gonna face

219
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,779
like I think that's amazing I've

220
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,900
struggled with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shit myself um when</font>

221
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,250
I was much younger and now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

222
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,180
comfortable with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I feel like</font>

223
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,560
everyone should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable with it</font>

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,110
so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who face who they are and are</font>

225
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,029
honest with who they are and stand up

226
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">for themselves and are open enough to be</font>

227
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">like yeah I'm gay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what fuck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I</font>

228
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:04,939
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have rights that you have and all</font>

229
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:07,189
these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming together like gay</font>

230
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:11,300
pride kind of seems like sometimes when

231
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,120
people are faced with adversity they

232
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,889
create organizations and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

233
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,469
places where they are hating on people

234
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:20,000
who are not like them because those

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,710
people first hated on them if that makes

236
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,930
any sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're like oh fuck all in</font>

237
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,449
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like it's I don't like</font>

238
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,909
having communities<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let me I</font>

239
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,159
don't this is it sucks because this

240
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:33,380
isn't scripted so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to put</font>

241
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,049
my thoughts into coherent and

242
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,010
comprehensive like words but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

243
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,690
hard sometimes for me and I'm struggling

244
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,380
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right now so let me try to put</font>

245
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in terms that you guys might</font>

246
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,899
understand with an analogy and an

247
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,980
anecdote so um what was i even gonna say

248
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,480
now that I was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain that</font>

249
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,769
oh okay so um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> women in eSports</font>

250
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,410
right oftentimes they're not as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

251
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,180
men so they can't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know compete with</font>

252
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,649
men and when they can compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> with men</font>

253
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,680
they get kind of you know made fun of

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,660
about the way that they look because you

255
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,279
know obviously women are a novelty so

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,060
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

257
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,470
interesting that there's a woman in

258
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,959
eSports and um some people feel like

259
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,279
that's a huge problem so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font>

260
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">female-only tournament and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion</font>

261
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,470
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like feminist issues in</font>

262
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,720
eSports<font color="#CCCCCC"> are gaming or creating a place</font>

263
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,579
where only women are allowed segregates

264
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,190
them more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

265
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,079
whole gay pride thing kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

266
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,579
it brings attention to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative</font>

267
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,320
aspects rather than actually changing

268
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,220
anything and it makes people who are

269
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,380
usually on board with gay rights and

270
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,589
stuff be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of annoyed at how you know</font>

271
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,870
elitist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pretentious an organization</font>

272
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,089
sounds it's like yes we are proud of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

273
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,980
you know like yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're proud of being</font>

274
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,360
black you can say black pride all you

275
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,949
want because people were you know

276
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:55,410
oppressed at a certain point but if we

277
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,120
say white power or white pride that's

278
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,709
like oh my god and like that's so like

279
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,410
terrible but it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same fucking thing</font>

280
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,000
and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really annoying when you</font>

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,050
say stuff like that we're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

282
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,110
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know tolerate everyone and try</font>

283
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,899
to assimilate and try to be one as a

284
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,910
community of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in America and</font>

285
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,399
having that segregated place where only

286
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,170
women can go play<font color="#CCCCCC"> video games and it's a</font>

287
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,899
it's a woman loving environment with

288
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">only women where women can be together</font>

289
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,829
and you know talk about how assholeish

290
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:27,360
men are that's just segregates the more

291
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,610
so that's the only problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have with</font>

292
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,399
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of organization or</font>

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,620
that kind of movement is that you know

294
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,480
it segregates people more it draws

295
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,990
attention toward the negative and it

296
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,639
also makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normally be</font>

297
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,110
on your side<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not be on your side</font>

298
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,819
because of how annoying or you know

299
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:50,250
segregating or opposite hating it can be

300
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,110
you know so i don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

301
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,279
just like affirmative action to let

302
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,800
people don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that um the whole girl</font>

303
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,269
power thing the whole burning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

304
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,160
bras it just becomes like instead of

305
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,819
actually working to be like what I'm not

306
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,110
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> time a woman what I'm not</font>

307
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,339
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz I'm gay what I'm not</font>

308
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">different cuz I'm black you instead are</font>

309
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,140
creating

310
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,970
community that sticks together that is

311
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,330
all the same types of people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it</font>

312
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,310
can be harmful to becoming one as a

313
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,750
community if that makes any sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

314
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,970
that's my opinion on that but one

315
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,460
hundred percent gate should obviously if

316
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,040
like this is so fucking obvious why do

317
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,020
we live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a society where it took this</font>

318
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,600
long to make that a thing like it's so

319
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">weird to me but anyway I fucking think</font>

320
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,820
this is awesome I think you guys rock

321
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,550
and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad that we are finally</font>

322
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,500
coming to a society<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we can be like</font>

323
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,250
do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a boyfriend or girlfriend</font>

324
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,040
and then the person's like like as a

325
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,390
girl would say I'm like yeah I have a

326
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,250
girlfriend and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cool I'd love to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meet</font>

327
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,660
her one day instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being like do you</font>

328
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a boyfriend no I actually have a</font>

329
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,970
girlfriend oh you're a lesbian that's

330
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,790
weird so what's it like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be lesbian as</font>

331
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,320
if there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of fucking aliens</font>

332
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,450
right I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that comes to an</font>

333
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,610
end soon and then it's completely normal

334
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I do feel like I'm part of that</font>

335
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,110
community because obviously I couldn't

336
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,380
imagine only<font color="#E5E5E5"> being so vehemently against</font>

337
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,180
having sex with one type of gender like

338
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,800
for me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like women are beautiful in</font>

339
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,390
their own way men are<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful in their</font>

340
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,520
own way they can both be great for sex

341
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,620
they can both be great for friends and

342
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,210
they both have a place in society<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

343
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me is just how i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel it's</font>

344
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,940
always it's how I've always felt have

345
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,610
never been like I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

346
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,140
myself being attracted to other women

347
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,430
and women who have sex<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other women</font>

348
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,900
or men who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have sex with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other men are</font>

349
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,700
fucking disgusting like my<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire life</font>

350
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,420
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had like gay friends and mostly it</font>

351
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,970

352
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,350
into makeup you know you can identify

353
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that kind of personality and it's</font>

354
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,770
also because they've every gay guy I've

355
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,780
ever known his like had a thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> J</font>

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">J like we had a guide high school who</font>

360
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,270
hung out with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to get close to J</font>

361
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,020
and then when Jay went to college

362
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,780
university he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone there um who</font>

363
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,550
was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a position of power at</font>

364
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he went to work</font>

365
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then he had a guy at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work that was</font>

366
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,460

367
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,230

368
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,900
sent two gay guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyway I got</font>

369
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,880
keeping you that's basically the point

370
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,700
it's always been my stance and I think

371
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,350
it's pretty obvious that I shouldn't

372
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:20,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">even have to</font>

373
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,389
this topic if you're a longtime viewer

374
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,370
of mine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that I'm all for</font>

375
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,269
everyone pursuing you know life love

376
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,300
liberty and happiness at any cost no

377
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,399
matter who<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

378
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,630
do your oath that own thing and not

379
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,709
worry about other people are thinking

380
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,139
and doesn't affect you so why the fuck

381
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:39,639
are you worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so much I've</font>

382
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,209
always been of that stance and I still

383
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,620
continue to be up that stance today and

384
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,019
I think it's a huge hurdle that we've

385
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,370
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked across for America</font>

386
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,630
because I was starting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like</font>

387
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,790
everyone here is actually stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

388
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,800
fucking in the archaic old ways of you

389
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">know hating people who are different</font>
