43
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,960
technical difficulties with my isp

details because the hate haters who are

51
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,740
d tossing me are the people who spend

52
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,180
way too much time watching my videos and

53
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,210
streams so yeah anyway um so I decided I

54
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,100
know my patreon patrons know a lot about

55
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,600
of what's been stressing me lately and

56
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,250
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big deal or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

57
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,200
it's just uh I feel like I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

58
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,490
having too much on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> plate and they've</font>

59
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,500
been suggesting that I take a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

60
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,030
of a vacation so I decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

61
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,280
two maybe three days if I don't stream

68
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,810

69
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">already qualified because of the</font>

70
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,840
regionals top eight but I can have two

71
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,949
qualifications that I'm also going

75
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,060
named<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe and I'm not attracted to</font>

76
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,860
anyone named Joe in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I think of</font>

77
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,690
all the people named Joe I kind of don't

78
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,340
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I've ever met</font>

79
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,290
anyone right off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of my head</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

80
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,819
I like whose name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joe I'm sure i have</font>

81
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,319
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of viewers who are like-minded who</font>

82
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would think are cool but um just you</font>

83
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,220
know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway let's look at my</font>

84
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,330
spending time talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

85
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,769
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this done quickly so the render</font>

86
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,180
happens fast hilarious not want to make

87
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,040
this fast is because uh it takes a while

88
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,330
to render and I have to leave within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

89
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,250
next 20 minutes so if the render happens

90
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,019
or the render happens to go on too long

91
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,700
then I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to upload it before</font>

92
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,750
I leave and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it won't be</font>

93
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,790
uploaded until at least 5 p.m. tonight

94
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,220
so anyway um when I liked it I don't

95
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take vacations where I travel I</font>

96
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,430
think traveling is a huge hassle and

97
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,799
it's kind of like a waste of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

98
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:57,060
talked about this before on my vlog

99
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,650
channel but everything I have everything

100
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,060
that I want everything that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

101
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,099
is here at home<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that in pretty much</font>

102
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,140
includes just gaming relaxing and

103
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,670
spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> time interacting with my</font>

104
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,920
viewers so when I take a vacation it's

105
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and doing anything it's</font>

106
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,190
basically just taping my ass to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

107
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,739
couch ordering some pizza eating like a

108
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,799
fatass and just kind of binging on a

109
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,090
story driven game and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

110
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm playing life is</font>

111
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,400
strange and i know i'm playing life is

112
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
strange<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my youtube gaming channel</font>

113
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
here but um I always like when I really

114
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,910
like a game I always like to play it a

115
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,350
second time through with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay because I</font>

116
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,269
like to see Jays reactions and spending

117
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">time with Jay and just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through a</font>

118
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,859
game and experiencing it all with jay is

119
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:36,090
something that just makes my life

120
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,560
fucking amazing that's my absolute

121
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,940
favorite thing to do and I don't have

122
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to do it lately because what I</font>

123
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,180
like to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sit there for three</font>

124
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,919
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight playing a game from start</font>

125
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,450
to finish and maybe like getting every

126
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,769
single trophy and becoming a trophy

127
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,160
whore I become a trophy or when I really

128
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,079
really like a game and life is strange

129
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,250
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those games so that's what I'm</font>

130
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing right now and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um days of doing</font>

131
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,209
that I realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm feeling</font>

132
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,489
unhealthy I'm feeling lethargic and and

133
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,290
weighed down and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

134
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,700
my schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I start feeling guilty</font>

135
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,290
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't been streaming then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

making videos and actually uploading

139
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,419
content because really that's what I

140
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,220
live for but when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really stressed</font>

141
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,750
out all I want to do basically is take

142
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,130
one of these mini vacations where I said

143
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,780
on the couch<font color="#E5E5E5"> and play one or two games</font>

144
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,849
from start to finish so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what I'm</font>

149
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,520
regular viewers and they've been saying

150
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,810
that the gaming channel is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something</font>

151
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,100
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch as much because they</font>

152
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,390
like to play games rather than watch

245
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,860
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get people who only watch</font>

246
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,330
streams to come over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch youtube</font>
