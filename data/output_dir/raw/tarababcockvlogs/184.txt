going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing an update video</font>

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,550
specifically the updates and the future

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> channel as well as a little bit</font>

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,910
of the gaming channel I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,830
a few changes all of which are positive

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,269
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feel like I need a bit of a</font>

12
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,980
refresher so if you guys aren't really

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,330
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to me talk about</font>

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,429
my life or where I want this channel to

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,810
go this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really one of those</font>

16
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,210
blatantly entertaining videos so I

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,550
warned you but I did make a notepad of

18
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,050
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I want to change and</font>

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,520
all the reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to change</font>

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,230
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few things that i want</font>

21
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never want anything to</font>

22
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,680
stagnate or at least for me to feel like

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,300
it's stagnating and the change that i

24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,620
made recently with Tara Reid's comments

25
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,270
and stuff like that is one of these

26
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes what I have here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tara</font>

27
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,010
babcock patch notes I call them patch

28
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,329
notes because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like the way</font>

29
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,340
League of Legends does their patch notes

30
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,629
where it's all like bullet pointed and

31
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,550
like laid<font color="#CCCCCC"> out for you perfectly I kind</font>

32
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">of did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for myself and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm gonna do here for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys so the</font>

34
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,470
first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is i got a new outro for</font>

35
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,299
both channels it's the last 20 seconds

36
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,500
of the video and it looks kind of

37
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,790
similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

38
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,400
but it has two video suggestions for you

39
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
and it allows you to click to<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribe</font>

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,180
to my<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel or click to subscribe to</font>

41
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,009
my other channel it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool it's</font>

42
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,450
actually a feature that<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube added</font>

43
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,799
recently and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got around to</font>

44
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,600
making a new overlay for it but I spent

45
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
about an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday perfecting 2</font>

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,840
overlays wonderful vlog channel one for

47
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,189
the gaming channel you'll be able to see

48
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">it here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depicted at the end of the video</font>

49
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">but what's really cool is one of the</font>

50
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,630
videos that it shows that the end is

51
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be tailored</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your liking I</font>

52
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,049
have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> how YouTube does this or</font>

53
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,729
what algorithm they use but what they do

54
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,590
is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to find a video that you</font>

55
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you haven't watched</font>

56
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,130
from my channel pretty cool right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

57
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,390
assuming if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've clicked on a bunch of</font>

58
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,430
the ones about my ass or anal it might

59
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,930
give you another anal based video you

60
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,369
haven't seen yet I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really excited</font>

61
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,689
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that which brings me to the next</font>

62
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,159
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's gonna be no set</font>

63
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,420
schedule and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason that the end</font>

64
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">credits brings me to this is because I</font>

65
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,420
didn't have enough room to put the

66
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,619
schedule there and no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

67
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,119
looking at it anyway it was only like

68
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,890
the hardcore subscribers that actually

69
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,509
knew my schedule like people would

70
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,460
constantly ask me when's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next sex</font>

71
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,350
head video so it wasn't really helpful

72
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,270
and it's also not helpful to me to have

73
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,740
a set schedule I feel like when you're

74
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,598
on a set schedule as a youtuber or as

75
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,160
any

76
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're not heavily funded</font>

77
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of extra time you end up</font>

78
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,690
spitting out a bunch of content that

79
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,370
isn't as good<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it should be and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

80
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,540
opinion that was happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Tara</font>

81
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,590
Reid's comments so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

82
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,090
rectifying that and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

83
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,500
you guys have suggested for a long time

84
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,750
is anytime<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see a comment that I want</font>

85
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,490
in Tara Reid's comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to save it</font>

86
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,170
into the folder and not worry about it

87
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,510
until I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have about 20 comments 20 really</font>

88
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,280
good worthy comments of Tara Reid's

89
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,840
comments what I used to do is I would

90
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,490
just like the day before two<font color="#CCCCCC"> days before</font>

91
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,200
whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna film it I would go</font>

92
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the most recent comments and</font>

93
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,560
just try to cherry pick something that

94
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">was good and that made people not want</font>

95
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,530
to comment initially and it made

96
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,060
comments drop a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit off on my</font>

97
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,290
channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> because people didn't think they</font>

98
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,430
had the chance to be in Tara Reid's

99
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,600
comments and let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay waited to</font>

100
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,710

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,880
the Friday video I feel like it's really

105
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,110
really important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to connect with</font>

106

<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys if your interaction is like the</font>

109
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,770
my opinion so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still doing the</font>

00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,230
friday unboxing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> friday QA the friday</font>

112
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,650

113
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,660
friday<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fan service but we'll get to</font>

114
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,340
that no fan service isn't coming back

115
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,020
sorry if I told you for less than a

116
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,520
second there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be returning</font>

117
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,500
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my sexier roots the one thing</font>

118
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that bothered me a lot is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I haven't</font>

119
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">been doing many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sex-based or just like</font>

120
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,020
sexy for no reason videos and I know I

121
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,820
can't do things as crazy as fanservice

122
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,290
Friday that people will consider to be

123
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,360
porn but I could do fun flirty things

124
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,430
like my bra collection or shopping for

125
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,320
bras talking about different sex things

126
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,850
that I like like I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

127
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,920
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anal properly I feel like I</font>

128
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,209
definitely still talk a lot about sex

129
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:39,770
and people who have an inversion to it

130
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,330
are like oh you talk way too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

131
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,220
sex because of all the jokes I make and

132
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,840
stuff but I fucking love sex and I

133
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
stopped making videos about it and I

134
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,690
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess it was because</font>

135
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,190
recently i've just been so interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

136
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,890
psychology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sociology and philosophy</font>

137
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,030
that I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about</font>

138
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,459
making a sex based video much but I'm

139
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:56,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try my best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do more sexy and</font>

140
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,760
sex related videos whenever I get a good

141
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,380
idea to do so i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new broad</font>

142
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,360

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">implants those are good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places to start</font>

144
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,930
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> i read a comment recently that i</font>

145
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,040
really liked that i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share with</font>

146
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
you guys that also inspired these few

147
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,090
changes latula Jensen says you produce

148
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,590
great content because you aren't afraid

149
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,180
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the sensitive topics in</font>

150
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,430
the world and I felt like yeah I do do

151
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,810
that and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to do and</font>

152
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,649
I'm a hundred percent

00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:21,978
other people think but i feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like i</font>

155
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't portrayed that very well on my</font>

156
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,310
channel lately so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try my best</font>

157
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do more aunt is JW anti-feminist</font>

158
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,770
anti-religion videos whenever I have the

159
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,810
inkling to do so I have this one

160
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,100
anti-feminist video that I've been

161
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while that takes a</font>

162
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,919
little bit of production so I've been

163
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,360
putting it off but I don't want to put

164
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,949
off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bigger production more</font>

165
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,240
interesting videos just because I'm

166
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,860
afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna fuck them up any longer</font>

167
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,960
like the relationship video about me and

168
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,430
Jay if I sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

169

<font color="#CCCCCC">way I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'll just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking redo it</font>

170
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,759
until I get it perfect next thing is sec

171
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,620
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so have you noticed how many</font>

172
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,510
sponsored videos I've done with sex head

173
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,220
like at first I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just be</font>

174
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,380
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> occasional Adam and Eve videos but</font>

175
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,750
there is no end of demand for people

176
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,419
wanting me to review or unbox their sex

177
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,070
products and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam names a different</font>

178
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,810
story but anytime I take one of those

179
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Commission's I'm making five hundred</font>

180
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,870
dollars so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like why wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

181
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,000
it I like trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> out new sex toys but I</font>

182
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,229
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's flooding the sex that</font>

183
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,970
series too much and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> killing it</font>

184
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,530
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my opinion it's not as good</font>

185
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,030
as it used to be so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

186
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,099
the hard questions how to learn to

187
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,840
deepthroat and negate your gag reflex

188
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,150
how'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> it come really fast things like</font>

189
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,949
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want the sex that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> series to be</font>

190
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,090
more like that because those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

191
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,770
videos that get so many views people

192
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,750
actually want to learn more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sex</font>

193
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,370
they don't necessarily want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if</font>

194
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,289
this sex toy is good or just have a fun

video with me playing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex toys they</font>

197
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:37,490
or not and they also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear me</font>

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,260
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the more taboo topics and I</font>

I take suggestions from you guys like

all the time I also want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make more</font>

207
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,900
philosophical content I don't want to

208
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,400
stop doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the</font>

209
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,750
least viewed thing on my channel and if

210
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,490
it gets less than 10,000 views I don't

211
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,780
care I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to take a second to thank</font>

212
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of my patrons on patreon who make it</font>

213
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,220
possible for me to make content than I

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,050
enjoy and that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys enjoy them might</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the big view count bring her</font>

216
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,889
inner I don't have to give a shit at all

217
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,870
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my view counts and that makes me</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">feel so good so relieved and I don't</font>

219
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:15,260
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about making things that</font>

220
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,849
are catchy or using<font color="#CCCCCC"> click bait or</font>

221
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,229
anything like that I can just make the

222
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:20,150
content that personally makes me happy

223
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,789
and makes you guys happy and I thank you

224
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:24,979
so much for allowing me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

225
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,919
through supporting me in such a way it's

226
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,080
amazing thank you because of you guys I

227
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,569
have the life I've always

228
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,339
wanted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am free to make the content</font>

229
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:34,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I've always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted without the fear</font>

230
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,789
of making a quota of views so if at

231
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,289
first the philosophical content doesn't

232
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,209
do as well I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you guys are</font>

233
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,919
really engaged in that there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

234
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,169
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> on those videos especially for</font>

235
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,309
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of views that they get and</font>

236
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:46,809
maybe you know my viewer base will grow

237
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,639
because I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> more diverse content and</font>

238
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,139
that's what I'm all about this channel

239
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,119
is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything Tara which brings me</font>

240
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,159
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> up occasionally I would like to</font>

241
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,990
make some makeup videos makeup review

242
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,879
videos maybe get ready with me is but

243
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,529
very rarely I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be posting</font>

244
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:01,300
ever on the third channel it's just so

245
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,860
hard to promote different channels in

246
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,419
fact I wish I had kept the gaming

247
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,949
channel and the vlog channel all in the

248
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,749
same channel two channels i can manage

249
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:09,580
but three channels is just too much and

250
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">i end up working way too hard on a piece</font>

251
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,449
of content that barely gets viewed just

252
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:14,740
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the vlog channel</font>

253
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,240
where the followers are people want to

254
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,409
see it they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know there's a</font>

255
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,849
third channel and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

256
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,580
reach everyone as a group and say hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

257
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,499
have a third channel I feel like the

258
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,659
vlog channel is everything Tara whereas

259
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,610
the gaming channel is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tara as a gamer</font>

260
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,110
which is such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge part of my life</font>

261
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,729
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of makes sense but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vlog</font>

262
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:32,139
channel can have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like makeup on</font>

263
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,599
it why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> make up sex philosophy just</font>

264
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,979
so long as you guys enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I enjoy</font>

265
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,959
making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also want to try my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best to</font>

266
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,490
do things you guys have been asking for

267
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,289
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily that interested</font>

268
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">in things like a vlog entitled a day in</font>

269
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,159
the life of Tara as boring as it's gonna

270
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been asking for it so</font>

271
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,639
much I'm telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I literally don't</font>

272
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,800
go anywhere I just work and play things

273
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,869
and work out and sometimes eat and

274
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,550
shower the showering part might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fun</font>

275
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,050
and I can do things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like my beauty</font>

276
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,360
regimen or how I up keep my beauty

277
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,289
things that are gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

278
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:00,669
interesting to my lovely female

279
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,649
demographic but<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also be kind of just</font>

280
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,269
soothing to listen to my voice or watch

281
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,740
and learn about girly things to the guys

282
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,599
as I said I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

283
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,159
the views I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make quality</font>

284
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,360
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also going to be doing a</font>

285
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,009
vlog when I go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vegas on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 8th gonna</font>

286
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,629
be house shopping going to a wedding so

287
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:14,919
that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more along the</font>

288
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,479
lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vlogs that you guys like</font>

289
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,339
who really like out and about vlogs all

290
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,779
right let's move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the gaming</font>

291
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,699
channel i figured it's fine to post the

292
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,499
gaming channel updates here because most

293
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:24,909
people who are subscribed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gaming</font>

294
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,469
channel are also subscribed to the vlog

295
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel most people also if you don't</font>

296
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:29,589
know the gaming channel is my main

297
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:30,610
channel if you haven't checked it out

298
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,130
youtube.com slash tara babcock games so

299
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,448
the first change is I'm no longer going

300
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,789
to be continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> syriza's so like let's</font>

301
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,380
plays and stuff where the viewership is

302
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,938
dropped off and the engagement has

303
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:41,620
dropped off so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the viewership is</font>

308
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,449
actually enjoying it I don't see a

309
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:48,949
reason to get rid of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if no one's</font>

310
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:50,269
enjoying it I shouldn't feel obligated

311
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,069
to finish the game this is happening

312
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:53,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">with my attack on titan let's play so</font>

313
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna drop it I already</font>

314
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,839
finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game off stream anyway so</font>

315
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,069
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that big of a deal and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

316
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,720
always do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I haven't and always</font>

317
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">do do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I haven't so there's</font>

318
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,379
really no real reason to keep it going

319
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,850
if you guys aren't enjoying it I can

320
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">just play it on my own time the indie</font>

321
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,699
games and the retro games aren't gonna

322
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,139
go anywhere but i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start making</font>

323
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">more mainstream content and what i mean</font>

324
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,000
by that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a video a week or every</font>

325
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,129
other week about the newest game coming

326
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,449
out that i might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be too interested</font>

327
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,160
in just to give it a shot and see what

328
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like it might expand my mind more</font>

329
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,819
about which kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> games i like and i</font>

330
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:24,439
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also bring in new viewers who will</font>

331
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,569
appreciate the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> alternative content</font>

332
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,279
that i make the indie game stuff the

333
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,319
manga stuff and the retro stuff what

334
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,610
sucks about trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow my gaming</font>

335
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,170
channel is I have a vlog channel and

336
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,670
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people just prefer the TNA of the</font>

337
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,259
vlog channel so they don't have time to

338
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,459
watch the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other channel even if they do</font>

339
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,079
kind of want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then a lot</font>

340
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people who come in and watch one</font>

341
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,959
video immediately think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

342
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,610
really into games despite having like

343
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,800
thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos on that channel of a</font>

344
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,720
diverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> range of games but the thing</font>

345
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that keeps me down the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the fact</font>

346
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,230
that I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like most mainstream</font>

347
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,329
games I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cod I don't play wow</font>
