my videos in supporting me today we're

12
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,400
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about long-distance</font>

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,350
relationships something I've avoided

14
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,640
because for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> long distance</font>

15
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,769
relationship help is basically just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

16
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,199
don't have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not a good idea in my</font>

17
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,050
opinion and that's because I value the

18
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,640
emotional connection you can get from

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,410
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> in person with a person and people</font>

20
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,840
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh well absence makes the</font>

21
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,370
heart grow fonder and that's true for

22
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,219
like to an extent i would say like if

23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,660
you you know go to work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you're</font>

24
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,340
like missing your wife or husband or

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,600
significant other and then you come home

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,980
and you see them and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I'm</font>

27
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,270
filled with Joyce I finally get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

28
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,160
them and missing them can make something

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,949
you know I can make more passion arise

30
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,289
but at the same time spending a lot of

31
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,270
time together in person is very very

32
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,670
very important and I wouldn't trade<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

33
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,620
amount of missing or being away from a

34
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,989
person that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really care about just to</font>

35
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,760
you know strengthen my desire for them I

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,750
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there are other ways to do</font>

37
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,369
that through like sex or spending time

38
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,420
together are getting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know each other</font>

39
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">better and to each his own obviously but</font>

40
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
I really like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend as much time as</font>

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,040
possible with anyone who I you know feel

42
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,930
a strong physical or emotional

43
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,790
connection to that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just who i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am i'm</font>

44
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,460
very clingy i would say but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in a in</font>

45
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,320
a way that's annoying i like to share

46
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything with the person that I'm with</font>

47
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,090
or people that I trust a lot and if I

48
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,650
really like someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is very rare i</font>

49
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,790
like to spend a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

50
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,850
but um in regards to actually being like

51
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,130
okay for the next over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year i'm not</font>

52
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,630
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you or we're going to live</font>

53
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,549
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate places that just doesn't</font>

54
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,890
make any sense to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean first of all</font>

55
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,140
after a while you're going to you know

56
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,880
lose that passion for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person like</font>

57
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,290
you might still love that person like

58
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,549
there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see very</font>

59
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,530
often that i consider to be friends or

60
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,290
that used to be lovers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I still love</font>

61
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,790
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like in the front of my</font>

62
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,140
mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not like if I can't live</font>

63
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,969
without a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to make my</font>

64
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,270
situation so that I can fucking be with

65
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,590
that person all the time or I can be in

66
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,600
the proximity of that person a normal

67
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,098
amount of time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least it doesn't make</font>

68
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">any sense like I see in in movies or</font>

69
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,540
whatever where people really

70
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,280
fucking love each other so much where

71
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,150
they would do anything for each other

72
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,489
and then a job or some stupid shit takes

73
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:18,780
them away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand that there</font>

74
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,400
are circumstances where you might have

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go on a business trip for like up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

76
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,859
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months or something because you know</font>

77
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,510
like that just makes more sense to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

78
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,269
it happened a lot in it happened a lot

79
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,400
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the office and also Parks and Rec</font>

80
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,829
where one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the people in a</font>

81
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

82
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,290
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good opportunity for them</font>

83
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,540
and I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal growth and</font>

84
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,159
like living out your dreams and stuff

85
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,450
and like you know you can't let someone

86
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,250
stand in the way of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> dreams like if</font>

87
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,329
you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your dream job and it's</font>

88
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,829
somewhere else you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

89
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,840
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking in love with a</font>

90
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,189
person you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't imagine living your</font>

91
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:51,659
life without them they should move with

92
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,939
you or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should move with them or you</font>

93
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">should turn down the job and that's just</font>

94
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">my personal opinion I might be kind of a</font>

95
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,599
romantic in that sense but when I find a

96
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,280
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I really enjoy spending time</font>

97
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,750
with there is nothing better in the

98
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,909
world and having all these amazing you

99
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,739
know opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things in these</font>

100
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,209
amazing experiences in life are very

101
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,389
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very not important if I can't share</font>

102
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">it with that person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so to me it</font>

103
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,959
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense to have long</font>

104
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,549
distance relationships for any amount of

105
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,500
time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can understand maybe like six</font>

106
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,819
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to be away and you know</font>

107
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,409
you're going to be back but like someone

108
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,359
moves away forever it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like</font>

109
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,379
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the end of the relationship</font>

110
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,479
and you think I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the best way</font>

111
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,829
to handle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way I would handle</font>

112
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is if it was impossible for me to</font>

113
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,030
move with him<font color="#CCCCCC"> my fucking hood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just came</font>

114
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,979
off if it was impossible for me to move

115
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,599
with them or impossible for them to stay

116
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,400
or move with me I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you know we're breaking up maybe</font>

118
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,949
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> day our stars will align and we are</font>

119
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,169
passable cross again and will fall back

120
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,849
madly into love and you'll always<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

121
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,049
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that got away and the one that I</font>

122
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,359
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever and you know I would</font>

123
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,620
move on and I would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to date</font>

124
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,840
other people and the sexual connection

125
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,819
that you have with<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone it needs to</font>

126
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,680
be there it can't not be there you have

127
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,199
a need sexually and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people try</font>

128
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,970
to depreciate that by saying oh you know

129
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,500
sex is just physical it doesn't mean

130
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,849
anything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the flip side</font>

131
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,349
they're hypocrites because they say you

132
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,669
can't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex with anyone else because</font>

133
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's you know something you only do with</font>

134
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,970
this one person<font color="#CCCCCC"> you love and it's based</font>

135
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,650
on love so you can't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both ways</font>

136
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,629
you either allow them to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex with</font>

137
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else where you're gone to</font>

138
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,649
fulfill that sexual urge or you stay

139
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,060
there and you fulfill that sexual urge

140
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,430
for them as much as possible and it just

141
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,110
doesn't make any sense like I wouldn't

142
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font>

143
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,860
the function<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I was taken away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

144
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,360
the person that I truly love<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all of</font>

145
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,800
the experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have would mean</font>

146
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
so much less if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that person</font>

147
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,910
wasn't there and like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

148
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,960
there's anything in the world that's

149
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,550
worth like any amount of money any

150
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,160
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of job that would be worth me not</font>

151
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,889
being with that person on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a daily basis</font>

152
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">and me not being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around the people that</font>

153
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,460
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be around and like often in</font>

154
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,199
movies<font color="#CCCCCC"> or TV shows I'm just like what</font>

155
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,550
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck are you doing you're so fucking</font>

156
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,169
stupid why did you leave and they regret

157
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:53,449
it and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like dude it's like a lot of</font>

158
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,260
premises of movies would be completely

159
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,630
changed and rectified in there wouldn't

160
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">even be a movie or a climax or a you</font>

161
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,950
know a resolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wouldn't exist in</font>

162
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,450
movies that people were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligent</font>

163
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,680
and smart and didn't make mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

164
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,960
a good example of that is horror movies

165
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
where a lot of the time you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

166
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,780
screaming at the TV like why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

167
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,490
doing that you're so fucking stupid off

168
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,500
and I saw um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a vine</font>

169
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,419
recently where they said if horror

170
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,340
movies were<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic and then it was</font>

171
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,500
some like creepy guy in like the hallway

172
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,520
I'm sure you guys have seen it i'm sure

173
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's popular because i was seeing it a</font>

174
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,070
lot on facebook when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was scrolling</font>

175
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,760
down but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like this is like like</font>

176
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,130
spectre ii figure came down the hall and

177
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,680
like the guy was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like but i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

178
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,669
of beating the shit out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> him and his</font>

179
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,050
roommate comes in beats shove him<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

180
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,370
girl<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to beat the SH out of him and</font>

181
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,650
that's how a horror movie would usually

182
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,349
and if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were smart and often like</font>

183
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:43,940
zombies like The Walking Dead zombies

184
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,530
are so fucking slow how are they a

185
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,389
threat to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone I understand if you're</font>

186
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,860
like walking around no care in the world

187
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,300
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look oh no boat zombies and they</font>

188
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,910
comp like stealthily somehow because it

189
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">look good and loud they come up</font>

190
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,599
stealthily somehow and like bite you on

191
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,250
the neck and like all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking sucks</font>

192
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,340
sure that's a threat but it's like

193
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something's so slow can't catch you and</font>

194
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,789
be a threat when you're aware of it you

195
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,320
just got to be slightly careful and then

196
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,700
you can just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on with your life and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

197
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,650
understand I don't understand how like

198
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,320
randomly they get surrounded like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

199
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,270
a sudden there's walking down nobody on

200
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road all of a sudden surrounded by a</font>

201
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,860
pack of zombies all know I'm dead it's

202
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">impossible to get away it just doesn't</font>

203
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,550
make any sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and there are a lot</font>

204
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,810
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in movies like that they don't</font>

205
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">make any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense and the same goes for</font>

206
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,680
romantic comedies where people have

207
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,200
distance between them so in my opinion I

208
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,550
feel like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the healthiest</font>

209
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,770
emotionally if you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

210
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,900
person enough or it's impossible in that

211
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,870
circumstance to to go with them

212
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,390
to just kind of be on a tentative leave

213
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,740
from each other like a break or

214
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,060
something where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see other people</font>

215
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and explore your life because I feel</font>

216
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone so integral to your life</font>

217
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,030
is now<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone it's kind of like putting</font>

218
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">your life on hold and making you</font>

219
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,420
miserable and restricting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when that</font>

220
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,220
person is not even there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

221
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,080
benefits of their love and their you

222
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,180
know physical companionship and that

223
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,830
just doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make any sense to me so for</font>

224
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,570
me I would never embark on a long

225
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,400
distance<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship I would either put</font>

226
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,830
a pin in it until we once again reunite

227
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,960
as passionate lovers or I would you know

228
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,730
just break it off with them or move with

229
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,590
them and those are better options and

230
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,870
they're very very few times in the world

231
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,090
where it matters more to separate than

232
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,010
it does to stay together and make the

233
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,510
relationship work and it makes so much

234
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,160
fucking sense why you break up because

235
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,110
you lose passion when you don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

236
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">see each other and things get hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

237
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,730
you know like your schedules get flipped

238
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,230
around and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

239
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,060
intimate like when you need someone you

240
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't hold them when you're horny you</font>

241
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,930
can't fuck them and it just sucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for</font>

242
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,750
me my advice is you know to either go

243
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,160
over there and let your passion follow

244
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,810
you you won't regret it trust me if

245
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,490
you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> in love with someone like</font>

246
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,130
better to have loved and lost than to

247
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,600
never have loved it all in my opinion so

248
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,310
if you miss an opportunity because of

249
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,890
someone you<font color="#E5E5E5"> love because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are going</font>

250
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,750
out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> being a romantic and just you</font>

251
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,950
know following<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to the ends of the</font>

252
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,220
earth like literally I don't think

253
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,510
you'll regret it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long run even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

254
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,070
they turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to be a scumbag or they</font>

255
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,660
turn out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be not the one like that</font>

256
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,910
experience is definitely worth it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

257
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know showing that person that you</font>

258
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,420
care that much about them is something

259
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,590
that they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forget and they</font>

260
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,570
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> always be grateful to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font>

261
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,850
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking awesome right to</font>

262
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,380
like move your life around because you

263
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,610
love someone so much and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

264
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,230
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they should feel bad</font>

265
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,450
about like oh I feel so bad because you

266
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,360
know I made you say goodbye<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your job</font>

267
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,160
or some kind of opportunity it's a

268
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,660
selfish thing to you don't want to be

269
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,310
without that person they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

270
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">be without you and your defaulting</font>

271
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,059
saying you know like what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

272
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,559
you out<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I love you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

273
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you so it's not really something</font>

274
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that should cause guilts and I know a</font>

275
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people are like oh I turned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

276
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,980
that job for you way back when I can't

277
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,970
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they end up</font>

278
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,289
hating the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> or resenting the</font>

279
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,640
person for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and that's kind of dumb</font>

280
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,470
too because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you made the decision based</font>

281
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,110
on a semi selfish whim where you wanted

282
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,670
to be with that person at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time and</font>

283
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,500
that's your choice and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always your</font>

284
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,490
choice and you always

285
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,480
a choice you shouldn't blame other

286
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,760
people for your choices so I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
