00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">my character flaws and I'm trying</font>

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,879
something different with the lighting<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,039
it is not light outside you more but I'm

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting one of my soft boxes outside and</font>

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,349
and shining it through the blinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,969
to emulate natural light and it doesn't

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">look as good as naturally does but it's</font>

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,720
working my videos lit up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can sit</font>

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,070
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not hold the camera and stuff</font>

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,199
so that's cool um second of all my hair

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,119
looks really stupid I know but I kind of

13
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,680
like it it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a modern Princess</font>

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359

16
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,098
I saw a girl on Instagram do it and she

17
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,140
looked absolutely adorable and I don't

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,030
look as adorable as her but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

19
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,910
try it anyway and it's nice it's like a

20
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,920

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,860
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um first I want to preface</font>

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,570
this by saying that I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> made this</font>

23
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">video like two days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and said not to</font>

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the topic at all I didn't really</font>

27
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,050
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all the points that I wanted</font>

28
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not like me I</font>

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,770

30
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">about or thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my head all</font>

31
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,710
the things I want to say in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> next vlog</font>

32
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,329
and all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

33
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,188

39
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,130
anything and I ended up just talking

40
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">about things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I feel other people</font>

41
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,100
would think ur my character flaws but I

42
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,630
didn't actually think there were flaws I

43
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,460
thought they were good and interesting

44
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,619
things about me so um I didn't like the

45
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,990
video at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all and then I went to a</font>

portal portal I was a chordal a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wardle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">fucking crazy right I did this and while</font>

59
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,030
I was doing it I reminded myself of my

60
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,590
biggest character flaw which is what I'm

61
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,920
gonna make the topic of this video be

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,598
about so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I finally thought</font>

63
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,410
of I had a life experience

64
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,340
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Life Achievement where it made me</font>

65
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,810
realize what I should actually talk

66
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this video and I'm very grateful</font>

67
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that so the other video that I did I</font>

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,300
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> thrown away I actually uploaded</font>

69
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,010
it to patreon for all of my patreon

70
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,240
patrons it's really cool because it's

71
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,340
like a community where there's no hate

72
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,870
at all because people actually do want

73
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,010
to support me the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

74
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,840
there so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them extra content</font>

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,340
when I can i really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but um</font>

76
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,030
anyway let's get started so my biggest

77
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,930
character flaw ever is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying hard</font>

78
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,960
enough and it's funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there have</font>

79
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a lot of things like a lot of</font>

80
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,860
online like poles and all online

81
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,680
contests that depend on pushing yourself

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,000
out there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote for</font>

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,970
you and going above and beyond with your

84
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,260
fans and having a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fans that</font>

85
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,090
just want to support you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I never</font>

86
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tried</font>

87
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,170
really hard to do like um hometown

88
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,820
hotties like I did hometown hotties and

89
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,650
I qualified but then I never<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

90
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,760
tried very hard to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to vote</font>

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it was like some asian</font>

92
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,480
girl over there has her a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and</font>

93
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifty people in her family and millions</font>

94
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">and millions of fans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff and</font>

95
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,580
nobody's hating on her of course she's

96
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,080
gonna win and it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,850
matter who the best person for the job

98
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,290
is or who the best person for the

99
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,480
nomination is it's just based on how

100
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,340
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people will click yes or what you</font>

101
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,600
can do to bribe people to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

102
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,190
first of all I find that to be a little

103
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit shameless how you have to ask like</font>

104
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,990
please please vote for me please over

105
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over again daily it gets kind of</font>

106
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,050
redundant and kind of annoying and I

107
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,860
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I would lose a lot of</font>

108
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,209
followers now would alienate a lot of

109
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,380
followers because people would be like

110
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,030
why the fuck is this bitch so annoying

111
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,800
with this one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what is</font>

112
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,090
it exactly that makes you want to follow

113
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,620
her and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was another online</font>

114
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,510
tournament that I did for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an</font>

115
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,790
online tournament that's funny an online

116
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,540
contest that I did for maxim's gamer

117
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,830
girl or something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did it</font>

118
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">back when I was uh when I was doing a</font>

119
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,610
lot of starcraft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't win</font>

120
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,840
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I didn't have the</font>

121
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,310
biggest fan base and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

122
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,720
whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would represent them</font>

123
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,790
the best it mattered only that I had the

124
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,470
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> loyal and most positive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fan base</font>

125
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,880
and I don't I feel like I bring in a lot

126
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,050
of hate because I'll talk about things

127
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,020
that I am there that are very blunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

128
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,630
will alienate some people but the in my

129
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just my insights and I'm not</font>

130
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,959
afraid to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say and I'm not afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

131
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,589
stand up for myself and my actions

132
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,180
the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel in the way that I</font>

133
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,470
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's something that can turn</font>

134
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of people off whereas the next</font>

135
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,910
girl might just be very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> likable and</font>

136
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,889
like yeah I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone everyone's</font>

137
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:32,960
great and everything's perfect yay and

138
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,990
it's very fake but yet they will still

139
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,699
garner more votes because you know

140
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,470
that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of thing that will</font>

141
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,600
not never alien anyone you know you

142
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about religion you don't talk</font>

143
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know gender issues or feminism</font>

144
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,510
or race or anything that could alienate

145
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,760
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of group you just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know put</font>

146
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,220
on our fake persona and do what makes

147
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,380
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> most views and that's not me at</font>

148
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,660
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm 100-percent myself even if</font>

149
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,070
some things about me might garner more

150
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,840
views than some other things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

151
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,250
fact that I have to the fact that I like

152
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,870
to dress the way that I do that is

153
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,750
actually me that is what makes up who I

154
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,790
am and I do it off camera just as well I

155
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do anything that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will bring in</font>

156
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">more people that is disingenuous to me I</font>

157
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,700
am fuckin who I am and that's who I

158
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,050
showed you guys and I think that's also

159
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">what makes me have the most loyal in the</font>

160
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,350
most amazing and insightful and

161
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,000
intelligent fans and I wouldn't trade

162
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for more fans definitely it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

163
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,900
the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a lot of friends as</font>

164
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,500
opposed to the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> want like just</font>

165
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,090
one or two really good friends and

166
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how I am as well in my personal</font>

167
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,880
life so anyway um I'm not that was a

168
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,919
really long<font color="#E5E5E5"> intro but basically what I'm</font>

169
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,940
saying is that's not really what I'm

170
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,380
talking about I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

171
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,700
above and beyond and trying to be the

172
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,760
best and everything I view myself as

173
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,820
someone who is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> jack-of-all-trades a</font>

174
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">master of nothing and it sucks because</font>

175
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,530
I've always wanted to be really fucking

176
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,539
bad ass at something but anytime I get

177
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:56,180
anywhere close to it I freeze up and I'm

178
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,889
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't let myself care too much and</font>

179
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,590
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care too much I'm not gonna</font>

180
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">do my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best obviously if I don't put my</font>

181
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:05,660
all into it and I'm just like I will cry

182
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,820
if I don't get this and just allow

183
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,650
myself to get emotionally attached and

184
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,500
allow the emotions to drive me then I'm

185
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,610
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the best that I can be</font>

186
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,650
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I allow myself to do that and I</font>

187
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,380
fail it will be devastating to me and

188
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,389
that's why in my entire life my biggest

189
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,820
character flaw is I have never given

190
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,389
anything that where I could completely

191
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,639
fail my all except for this fucking

192
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,950
gaming thing this trying to live off of

193
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,040
gaming

194
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,560
and stopping doing the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

195
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like as much like modeling all of</font>

196
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,650
that stuff is it was kind of forced upon

197
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,980
me like Jay lost his job and then I was

198
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,200
like this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to try to see</font>

199
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,550
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can live off of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

200
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,930
best time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow my</font>

201
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,910
dreams and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

202
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very happy that I'm now forcing</font>

203
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,930
myself to give it my all and it's funny

204
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,280
because I have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this situation</font>

205
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,200
before where i was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to top it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

206
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,680
5 01 @ a ptq and I allowed myself to get

207
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,470
emotionally invested a little bit and

208
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,270
when I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing I almost started</font>

209
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,910
crying and I was like no this<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't be</font>

210
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,440
it felt like<font color="#CCCCCC"> my world was crashing down</font>

211
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,630
around me and I'm like no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't do</font>

212
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that anymore so when I was doing this I</font>

213
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,680
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever I'm just gonna try in</font>

214
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,090
the top eight a little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

215
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,800
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fumbled up and then afterwards I</font>

216
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,970
was like whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I didn't really</font>

217
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">let it hit me and I'm you know I'm</font>

218
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,380
borderline disappointed in myself yeah I

219
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,330
wish I had done better i wish i had you

220
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,270
know focused more and not allowed

221
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,240
outside issues to stress me and not

222
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,730
allow i should have gone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eaten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

223
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,470
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> given it my all so that</font>

224
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,690
afterwards I could have said I gave that

225
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">my all one hundred percent and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

226
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,560
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that I don't know why something</font>

227
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,960
stops me like the fear of failure

228
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,180
completely stops me from doing that ever

229
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's ridiculous like there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

230
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">time where I gave it my all uh it was</font>

231
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,880
for the Miss Summer Jam contest and

232
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,430
summer jam is like a concert here it

233
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,720
usually happens at the gorge but this

234
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,890
time it was at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> amphitheater the</font>

235
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">White River</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amphitheater I don't know if</font>

236
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,100
you guys are indigenous to Seattle but

237
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,140
uh if you know those words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means</font>

238
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,370
you kind of grow up around here but

239
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,980
anyway um it's a big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is like</font>

240
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,630
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started out modeling I</font>

241
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,490
would do stuff with radio stations and I

242
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,770
would do stuff with like at hot import

243
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,630
nights and I was like a car show girl at

244
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,940
first and i did this contest where you

245
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a thousand bucks and you get to be</font>

246
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,960
like the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss summer jam it's like a</font>

247
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,760
pageant but it's for like a rap concert

248
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,730
you know so um I gave it my all I had a

249
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,950
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hot underboob costume with a</font>

250
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,080
schoolgirl skirt and I took off the

251
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,510
underboob costume on stage to reveal

252
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,510
like pasties and I ripped off it was

253
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,820
like one of those side side velcroed

254
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,559
skirts and I ripped that off and like I

255
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,049
had

256
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,480
and I dance now the goo and during the

257
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,450
whole concert before the actual contest

258
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,920
i was like handing out<font color="#E5E5E5"> flyers and I did</font>

259
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
ten times more than any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> girl and i</font>

260
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,800
ended up losing it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like</font>

261
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,470
overweight black chick who didn't even

262
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">interact with anyone and was a real huge</font>

263
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,120
bitch she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was ugly on the inside and out</font>

264
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,890
i can say that for a fact nobody else

265
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,899
liked her and then there were like there

266
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:09,190
was another blonde girl who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

267
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,990
cute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was a fit brunette girl</font>

268
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,730
who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pretty and those two were</font>

269
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,589
like beautiful inside and out and they

270
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:16,930
were like last place and it really felt

271
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,220
to me like it was racial profiling

272
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,500
because you know nobody likes the fake

273
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,899
white girl everyone who you know listens

274
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,640
to rap or whatever likes hip-hop likes

275
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,860
the you know black chick or whatever who

276
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,360
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's into hip-hop or</font>

277
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,740
something and that's really how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt</font>

278
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,149
it's like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if that's gonna</font>

279
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,800
offend people or not but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

280
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,329
how I felt and that's like what everyone

281
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">was coming up and telling me like you</font>

282
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,529
got gypped it was like rigged and that's

283
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,060
when I that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I started actually</font>

284
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,970
realizing that yeah I'm never gonna win

285
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,350
anything like that there are too many

286
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,579
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who were gonna hate me there are</font>

287
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:46,690
too many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are gonna hate me</font>

288
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,860
just because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I looked and I</font>

289
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,329
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of being heartbroken</font>

290
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,610
about that even though I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in second</font>

291
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,380
place but I didn't get anything for it

292
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,620
and um instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being heartbroken I</font>

293
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,380
just you know realized that was kind of

294
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the politics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the game but when it</font>

295
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,529
comes to something like magic the

296
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,660
gathering or Starcraft if I could give

297
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">it my all maybe I could be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best the</font>

298
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,390
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the best right and it would be</font>

299
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,890
fucking amazing and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be</font>

300
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,649
like nobody can talk shit about the way

301
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,060
I look because the way I look we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

302
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,800
be another thing about me because I'm so

303
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,829
fucking good you can't devalue the fact

304
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,240
that i'm so fucking good based on the

305
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,709
fact that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font>

306
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">a slut or it goes against your morals</font>

307
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,040
the way that I act or talk or the way

308
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,170
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> live my life I'm just fucking</font>

309
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,820
good and you can't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that away from</font>

310
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,829
me and I've always wanted that feeling

311
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I'm always kind of good at stuff i</font>

312
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,020
can so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can do HTML CSS i can draw I</font>

313
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,440
can do fucking graphic design I you know

314
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm a businesswoman I handle my own

315
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,190
fucking bookings I worked with my own

316
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,550
legal documents for modeling and I do a

317
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of shit but like none of them not</font>

318
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">really amazing at any of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

319
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:54,929
be amazing at something but that is my

320
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,519
biggest character flaw not allowing

321
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself to give it my all for fear of</font>

322
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:02,009
actual failure and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get so</font>

323
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,169
close to being better than average and

324
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:07,079
then just make myself stay at<font color="#CCCCCC"> average so</font>

325
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,849
that i'm still a quarterfinalist and I

326
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,139
don't know if I'll ever be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

327
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">champion I don't know I'm afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

328
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,969
I do give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it my all I won't be amazing</font>

329
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,649
and I'll just end up being like everyone

330
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,899
else and then I'll know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no</font>

331
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,519
possible way for me to ever get there

332
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,829
and that's something that scares me and

333
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,929
I've always just kind of been content

334
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:27,659
with being a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better than</font>

335
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,059
average at a lot of things and amazing

336
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,679
and nothing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know maybe I</font>

337
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,299
should work on that so what do you guys

338
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:35,129
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest character flaws I like this</font>

339

<font color="#E5E5E5">video so much better even though the</font>

340

lighting isn't as good and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

341
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,859
little bit verbose and I don't know if I

342
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:44,719
