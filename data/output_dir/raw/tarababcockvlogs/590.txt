00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,300
through the night like I wake up like 10

29
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,579
times and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it was because of</font>

30
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,680
that dream job that I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go do</font>

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,000
I was nervous about it and I didn't feel

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,530
like I would do a good job but then when

33
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,360
that was resolved and I ended up not

34
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,280

35
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,409

binding of isaac so I'm excited about

54
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,799
that and I'm also excited to see how

55
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,530
good I am or how bad I am at Super Meat

56
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,060
Boy you believe I haven't played it yet

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,250
but anyway um so other<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that I've</font>

58
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,930
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> been kind of sleeping as you can</font>

59
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,100
tell like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you can tell</font>

60
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,649
with the light on here but I i just

61
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,720
looked tired and I am tired I'm still

62
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,710
fucking tired and I'm

63
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,720
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to bed bed in like three</font>

64
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,010
hours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how I'm going to</font>

65
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,350
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I pretty much just woke</font>

66
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,840
up but I'm assuming I'll sleep again

67
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,400
until 3am<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then be up for three hours</font>

68
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,930
on my phone laying in bed just like

69
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,060
typing to people it sucks cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll lay</font>

70
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,650
in bed and I can't sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm like</font>

71
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,880
when might as well play with my phone

72
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,170
but playing with my phone is

73
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,940
counterproductive to actually trying to

74
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">fall asleep so it's like if I could have</font>

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,050
eventually falling asleep the phone is

76
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,310
the thing that's keeping me up and like

77
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,290
ruining my life which sucks you know

78
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,210
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a dilemma and then if I end</font>

79
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,020
up laying there for three hours

80
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,460
literally not doing anything I'm like

81
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,200
why could have gotten up and you know

82
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,210
done some videos or been productive or

83
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,550
written something or made a script for

84
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,900
the next to our TV you know and it

85
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,880
pisses me<font color="#E5E5E5"> off so it's stressful and I</font>

86
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,920
think I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it by some sleeping</font>

87
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,540
pills which is so stupid because I also

88
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,780
have caffeine pills so I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm</font>

89
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,310
you know medicating like self-medicating

90
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,410
way too much so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you guys</font>

91
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,750
have any suggestions like it seems like

92
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,100
no matter what kind of schedule i have

93
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,780
my schedules fucked up if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've stayed up</font>

94
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,640
for 24 hours which I did the day before

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,460
I still can't get a whole night's sleep

96
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,040
i went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed at 12 after being up for</font>

97
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,610
28 hours and i woke up at 3am what the

98
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,560
hell it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's a certain timing in</font>

99
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,390
my brain that won't allow me to sleep

100
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,940
any longer than like three or<font color="#CCCCCC"> four hours</font>

101
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,500
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving me crazy the next topic i</font>

102
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">kinda good I don't want to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

103
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,070
about but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I promised you guys I would be</font>

104
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,210
a hundred percent honest with my life

105
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and tell you guys everything but I think</font>

106
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,380
some of you who think more traditionally

107
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,900
and follow a more traditional lifestyle

108
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,680
especially when it comes to

109
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationships are probably going to hate</font>

110
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,300
me but I may or may not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sex</font>

111
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a married man and not like not like</font>

112
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my bucket list things is to</font>

113
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,750
have sex with<font color="#E5E5E5"> any random married Matt no</font>

114
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,450
it's like a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I I have strong</font>

115
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,220
attraction to and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know why</font>

116
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,200
either but I have a strong strong

117
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,340
attraction to him and then I found out

118
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,850
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> has married I'm like fuck but um</font>

119
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,870
here's how I'm gonna handle this I do

120
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,560
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him but I I'm not telling</font>

121
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,360
him because I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could go one</font>

122
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,460
of two ways the first way is that like

123
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,810
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like oh okay and he's cool</font>

124
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it and he's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's hot and</font>

125
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,930
then we had this like hot sexual tension

126
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,040
between each other which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I want because I enjoy that I you</font>

128
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,550
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I get</font>

129
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,659
questions and I enjoy having the

130
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,919
crutches and the chase is fun and all

131
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,849
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and yeah and then the second</font>

132
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:33,220
good outcome would be if he's down for

133
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,539
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I am I to hold up a promise</font>

134
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I didn't make you know it's hard</font>

135
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">for me to like okay I imagine some wife</font>

136
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,259
and then let's say she found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

137
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,060
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> her being sad but it's like</font>

138
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to feel sympathetic for</font>

139
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,949
someone who is caging her husband based

140
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,020
on jealousy and old traditions and

141
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,099
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't have sex with</font>

142
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,449
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and that has to do with</font>

143
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,280
love because in my opinion you're going

144
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,690
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> desires to have sex with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

145
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,940
people while you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> married it's just</font>

146
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,400
how you work biologically it's a desire

147
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,919
just like eating that has nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

148
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,690
with anything and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion if some</font>

149
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,940
one desires to do something and they're

150
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,889
not acting upon it it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

151
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,629
they're lying to themselves you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

152
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,550
it's like sure yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a promise</font>

153
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,780
to your wife you're not going to do this

154
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's the part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's fucked up the</font>

155
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,650
lying part lying about the fact that

156
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,560
like yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever I am always yours and I</font>

157
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,940
will never think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else or</font>

158
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,710
you know have sex with anyone else and I

159
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,409
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's much better to not</font>

160
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,990
break promises but for me when I think

161
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,909
of a sad wife who got cheated on I think

162
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,279
of a woman who probably didn't sexually

163
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,409
satisfy her man and then keeps him in a

164
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,779
cage based on like who he can and can't

165
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,330
talk to or have relationships and with

166
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,580
and like he's not happy you know

167
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,380
sexually so it's like it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

168
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,750
for me too oh it's like you know you

169
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,699
should if it's your friend you should

170
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:52,990
definitely care about your friend's

171
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,460
feelings even if you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

172
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,169
irrational because you care and respect

173
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,060
about that person because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

174
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have gone through together but</font>

175
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,569
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

176
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,190
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they're acting illogically and</font>

177
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,659
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they're almost you know</font>

178
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,969
like it's their fault almost it's like

179
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,490
hard I do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who are married</font>

180
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,990
over wanna get married or who have like

181
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,610
the standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> morals or like oh my god</font>

182
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,500
Tara is such a fucking slut whore home

183
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,419
record but whatever I'm being honest

184
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,770
here so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I would feel bad if I</font>

185
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,930
was in a monogamous relationship and my

186
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,529
boyfriend was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> god I really</font>

187
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:27,669
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuck this other girl and he's</font>

188
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:28,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about all the time and he has</font>

189
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,310
the opportunity to do it I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like no you</font>

190
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't do it because if you have sex with</font>

191
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else it means you don't love me</font>

192
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,000
that liked<font color="#CCCCCC"> pace totally know</font>

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,860
no sense at all to me that's like being

194
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,720
like forever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have dinner</font>

195
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,370
together and if you ever eat with anyone

196
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,770
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're fucks mr. things like but I</font>

197
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,810
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not a gun on it's</font>

198
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,280
like well a good job that you have this

199
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,410
self restraint to not but the fact that

200
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,730
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in the first place you</font>

201
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,550
know I'm sure it's just the same to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

202
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,440
which is why I rationalized it and

203
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,390
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's that's my jealousy</font>

204
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,220
holding someone else back that has

205
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,660
nothing to do with them it's their body

206
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,080
etc so yeah and then the bad outcome

207
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,090
let's get to the bad outcome is I tell

208
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,230
him or he finds out and he like makes it

209
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,120
either completely awkward between us or

210
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,940
he won't talk to me anymore or it's like

211
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,290
he's afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm gonna act upon it</font>

212
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,780
see like the thing my thinking is here I

213
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,090
want I want him to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that I want him</font>

214
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to pursue it if he's</font>

215
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,600
open to it I'm definitely down for it

216
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,210
but I I enjoy the sexual tension between

217
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,560
us even if it's not actually gonna

218
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,280
happen so yeah and there's my spilling

219
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,120
the beans of the week I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only told one</font>

223
