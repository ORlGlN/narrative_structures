<font color="#E5E5E5">the day this is Teddy from persona 4 I</font>

82
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,750
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be a cute addition to</font>

83
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,040
my outfit because what I was going to

84
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring my Tribble when I was sexy Spock</font>

85
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,130
but I didn't have a prop for persona 4

86
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,170
but I got one there which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty cool</font>

87
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Teddy's the cutest he is awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

88
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,870
I loved it I didn't I got a bunch of

89
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,310
codes to indie games and stuff which i'm

90
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off because I don't</font>

91
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">know where I put them I think they're in</font>

92
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,989
my bag somewhere and also because I have

93
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,760
a terrible habit of holding it up and

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,530
actually showing the code so i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

95
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code you guys get the code or</font>

96
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,410
whoever is an asshole enough to like

97
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,510
pause the video and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the code I've</font>

98
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,370
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before and it's been awful</font>

99
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,810
that's why I don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> show things</font>

100
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,549
usually on giveaways if the code is

101
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,579
involved another thing that I got was<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

102
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,940
this I bought him it's Donkey Kong but

103
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,370
he's a backpack and literally the only

104
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,870
thing they can fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here basically is</font>

105
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,060
like my phone but it's like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cute</font>

106
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,200
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his backpack and I was wearing it and</font>

107
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,700
then Jay was wearing it because Jay was

108
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,920
wearing the shirt with all the Mario

109
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,359
characters and then Donkey Kong is also

110
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,380
in it I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why I guess because</font>

111
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">just Nintendo or something but I also</font>

112
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,090
got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> hyperx close stick which is no</font>

113
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,880
longer glowing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's he's so cute</font>

114
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to initially take him</font>

115
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,810
to magic as my magic backpack but

116
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,370
there's no possible way I'm gonna fit my

117
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,250
entire magic deck box in here like

118
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,810
there's no possible way I wish that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

119
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,940
was more hollowed out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> had less you</font>

120
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,620
know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fluff because it would make so</font>

121
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,669
much more sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would be able to</font>

122
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:04,560
fit so many more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in there but</font>

123
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
that's cool another thing i got is jay

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,710
chest the majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dice and a</font>

154
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,060
bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of pieces that</font>

155
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can get for tabletop games and they</font>

156
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,200
had a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> selection of dice you'll be</font>

157
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,430
able to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you watch the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video on</font>

158
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">my gaming channel that comes out around</font>

159
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> times this one but it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was so</font>

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,010
fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> sick like I was like oh my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> god</font>

161
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,420
dice heaven and now that I'm actually

162
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,340
playing something like magic that

163
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,530
requires dice I'm like all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

164
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,630
these are so fucking awesome they're

165
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,120
huge they're sparkly as fuck I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just love</font>

166
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,740
it and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had bigger dies in</font>

167
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,300
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in this color so I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

168
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,790
of sad about that we walked around we

169
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,250
took a lot of footage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just pretty</font>

170
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,050
much taking video of the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> area and</font>

171
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,400
just exploring and having fun because

172
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,350
usually when I go to an event I end up

173
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,090
spending most of my time working so this

174
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,820
time I only<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a couple appointments to</font>

175
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,320
talk to people the first appointment was

176
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,840
for binding of isaac after birth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

177
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,140
signed a what's it called an embargo

178
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,760
that I can't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I didn't</font>

179
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,890
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to it because we arrived</font>

180
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,990
late which fucking sucks but I really

181
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,980
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what was going on because</font>

182
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,720
biting flies Binding of Isaac can't

183
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,130
fucking talk today Jesus Christ I need

184
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">more caffeine or less caffeine I'm not</font>

185
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,490
quite sure but anyway binding of isaac

186
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,500
is one of my favorite games ever binding

187
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,390
of isaac rebirth specifically because

188
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,770
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one was good for the second</font>

189
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,380
one was even better and other having the

190
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,270
expansion for the second one which is

191
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be my favorite favorite with a</font>

192
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,800
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new content just basically it's</font>

193
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh fucking awesome i cannot</font>

194
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,010
wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it and i wanted</font>

195
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the hands on whatever they were</font>

196
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,710
offering but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wasn't able to make it</font>

197
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the second the second</font>

198
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,740
appointment i had was with

199
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">jake and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> magic is coming out with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

200
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,889
puzzle quest game and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

201
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,090
haven't paid it played a puzzle quest

202
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,550
game yet you absolutely have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

203
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,360
unfortunately right now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only going</font>

204
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,060
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on on mobile devices which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

205
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,319
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pissed off about because I don't</font>

206
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,849
play fucking mobile games unless I'm

207
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:54,280
playing on my 3ds<font color="#E5E5E5"> i play on pc or i play</font>

208
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,620
on ps4 and those are pretty much the two

209
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,810
platforms that i play on right now but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

210
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,150
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> never liked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to play on my phone</font>

211
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,419
or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the 3ds with 3d s is ok</font>

212
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,130
because the games are like cutesy so

213
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,599
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that bad that you're not seeing</font>

214
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,520
like a full screen version and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

215
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,400
graphic but whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuck but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font>

216
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,380
high resolution and I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

217
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,389
graphics and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell that on</font>

218
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,880
such a small screen basically so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel</font>

219
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,470
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing my favorite</font>

220
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,319
franchises enough service if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing</font>

221
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,090
on a small screen and they often<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

222
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,120
like the the dumb spin-offs on the

223
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,949
portable portable version I feel like

224
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why like there were a lot of</font>

225
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,690
portable final fantasy games that I

226
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,430
haven't played<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet and they usually</font>

227
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,229
would port the really old ones like

228
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,270
final fantasy 3 and lower they would

229
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,009
pour it onto a portable and then they

230
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,570
would also have like spin-offs they had

231
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,090
like a wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> there observers but it was</font>

232
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,940
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that they had forget maybe</font>

233
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,289
final fantasy tactics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my quite sure</font>

234
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,669
but there was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there and it's just</font>

235
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:55,840
like spin-offs that don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

236
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,219
anything because obviously they want the

237
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:59,229
big titles to be on the big consoles and

238
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,120
the big platform so that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to</font>

239
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">me but um I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really excited about it</font>

240
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,800
and I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes to PC because it</font>

241
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,270
looks really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool Puzzle Quest is really</font>

242
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,069
cool it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's kind of like</font>

243
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:10,840
bejeweled but then it has RPG elements

244
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,219
and you actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's a</font>

245
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,659
story with it so it's really cool it's

246
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,800
kind of like honey pop I'm playing honey

247
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,750
pop right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gaming channel which</font>

248
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,099
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a dating sim where you can</font>

249
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:20,400
you're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bejeweled type game</font>

250
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,539
during the dates but the rest of it is

251
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:23,889
like answering questions and RPG

252
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,870
elements and leveling up certain like

253
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,699
skills and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font>

254
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,050
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a more</font>

255
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,639
laid-back thing you can do and with the

256
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,349
magic when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

257
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,729
know how to play magic but it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

258
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">an edge and you can make your own decks</font>

259
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,950
as you like line up different mana you

260
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,279
you play<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards and you like order the</font>

261
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,169
cards in whichever order you want and

262
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,640
they it's just just really cool it's

263
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,040
really cool if you are into mobile games

264
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,660
and stuff and if you've ever played a

265
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,930
puzzle quest game

266
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,480
sick we walked around we hung out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

268
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,680

<font color="#E5E5E5">really fun and really nice and it was</font>

273
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,149
laid back because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do a</font>

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,930
of the pro players and people who are

280
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,850
important in wizards and magic and

281
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,920
apparently they thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was important</font>

282
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,450
enough to get one of these and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>
