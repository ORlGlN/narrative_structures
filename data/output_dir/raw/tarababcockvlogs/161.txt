00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking now a bitch so who cares</font>

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,819

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,440
say what they want hey guys welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,670
my 2016 end of the year retrospective

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,940
video this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my take on it at least you</font>

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,180
guys know that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very fond of</font>

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,820
arbitrary holidays or markers in one's

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,949
life that don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean anything in</font>

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,949
my opinion each year is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just another</font>

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,230
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to improve and as</font>

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,969
long as I'm constantly improving at

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,399
least in my eyes I am extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy</font>

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,559
and that is what I live for basically

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,420
just hedonistic alee living and doing

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,670
whatever the fuck I want and improving

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,210
in ways that I feel are important to

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,300
like intellectually aesthetically all

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,879
these things in my career everything and

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,680
as long as I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I am happy um</font>

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,800
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if i had to arbitrarily</font>

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,219
define a portion of my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> in years</font>

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,559
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best one I've ever had and</font>

stupid because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are and</font>

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,180
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just use it to</font>

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,909

in 2016 I will leave my dead end job and

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,290

like this if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at myself also</font>

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,430
a clean myself up but anyway I've seen

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,160
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking videos about like 2016</font>

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,378
is the worst year ever and memes talking

54
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,350
about Oh 2016 can you get any

55
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,990
worse and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a society</font>

56
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,380
today or at least everyone posting on

57
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,290
social media accounts they're all just

58
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,450
pessimistic pieces of shits that<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

59
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,940
more about the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> around them rather</font>

60
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,610
than looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their own lives and</font>

61
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,380
improving themselves and caring about

62
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with them they're just</font>

63
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,140
caring about what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

64
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone else now I totally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

65
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's sad that a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

66
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,230
celebrities died this year I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

67
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,850
sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a lot of talent</font>

68
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,620
out there that is now gone tragically oh

69
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,870
so sad also a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

70
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,520
who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost their lives to things like</font>

71
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,380
terrorist attacks I think that's fucking

72
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,360
awful obviously if I had the power to

73
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately rectify it I would do</font>

74
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,960
so that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> my number one priority</font>

75
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,720
no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> would suffer and everything would</font>

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,790
be a communist place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone has</font>

77
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,650
their fill of happiness it would be

78
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,280
happy happiness communism is what I

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,900
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but that would be</font>

80
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">extremely idealistic and not based in</font>

81
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,620
the real world at all what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

82
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,320
do in order to keep some semblance of

83
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,050
sanity is worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and yours</font>

84
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously it's sad when you hear that</font>

85
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,570
somewhere was bombed but crying about it

86
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,640
is not healthy crying about it doesn't

87
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,500
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense these people were not</font>

88
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,150
directly connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you and if you</font>

89
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,940
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help pay like pay money donate</font>

90
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,120
help them in an actual way that makes

91
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,830
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually does make a</font>

92
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,020
difference worrying about things being

93
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,120
sad<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the past being sad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

94
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you don't like people die every</font>

95
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,500
literal second a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these deaths are</font>

96
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,390
tragedies a lot of these people died too

97
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,340
soon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I always say there's no</font>

98
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,270
fucking way that you have the

99
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,410
omnipresence or the mental capacity to

100
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about every single life loss or</font>

101
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,220
every single baby that wasn't born or

102
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,710
every single piece of ejaculate that

103
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,140
sperma fight itself and never became

104
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,210
anything other than any something on

105
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,730
across the old sock you can't worry

106
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,290
about that what you have to worry about

107
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,250
is actually making tangible differences

108
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,170
in the world and making tangible

109
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,120
differences in yourself improve yourself

110
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,190
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the world for the people around</font>

111
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,130
you is better be a better person<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

112
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,290
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like improve yourself so</font>

113
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,300
you're happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that you are just</font>

114
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,160
radiant when you walk around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font>

115
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people so</font>

116
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,010
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy and it's like kind of a</font>

117
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,390
pay-it-forward situation where you're

118
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,250
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they're happy and it catches on</font>

119
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,630
and think these are things that are

120
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,980
actually tangible they're actually

121
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,230
helpful being<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad about something or</font>

122
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,690
praying for people are making a post so

123
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,370
you feel relevant when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you're</font>

124
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,280
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the spotlight mmm I love there's</font>

125
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,690
there's like a video<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a meme or</font>

126
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,070
something that makes fun of people who

127
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,260
post during tragedies or when someone

128
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">dies or when something in the media</font>

129
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,330
happens it's basically like them on

130
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,910
their social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media saying oh yeah but</font>

131
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,490

132
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,330
Carrie Fisher died don't forget about me

133
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,430
in relation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to carrie fisher's death I'm</font>

134
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,830
so thoughtful I feel like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

135
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">people don't even respect or care about</font>

136
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">these people who died before they died</font>

137
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,750
they just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like bring it up so</font>

138
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they you know someone retweets them</font>

139
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,710
and they feel special you know like it's

140
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,450
just like it's kind of it's kind of

141
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,270
shitty in my opinion like I will talk

142
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,430
about Carrie Fisher when I want to talk

143
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,470
about Carrie Fisher and it's not going

144
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,900
to be post her death just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

145
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,250
know that's the popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to talk</font>

146
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">about right now it sucks that she died</font>

147
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,790
obviously do I really need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

148
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,100
post dedicated to the fact that I am

152
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,520
there's no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say the 2016 is the</font>

153
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,980

I'm better than anyone else objectively

208
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:50,479
or that I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> rationally anyone</font>

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,200
pessimism the world is fucking just

213
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,840
drowning in these days it seems like at

214
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,220
least if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media and it</font>

215
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,710
sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the media fucking benefits</font>

216
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,570
from only talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> neutral to</font>

217
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,880
terrible things it seems like if you if

218
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a person who watches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the news</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they like to talk about you know they</font>

223
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,010
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blow everything out of</font>

224
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,720
proportion like every single cop is a

225
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,940
killer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single fucking Muslim</font>

226

as a terrorist and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shit like no</font>

227
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,110
wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many people think that 2016 is</font>

228
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,150
actually personally affecting them

229

because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all they're doing is like</font>

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,209
missed because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a model I had</font>

268
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,640
a lot of free time in between the trips

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,839
that I would take<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the shoots that I</font>

273
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,060
there were days that all I had to do was

274
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,209
keep social media and not much else my

275
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,699
website or whatever and I would read so

276
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:22,790
much into dreams into psychology and

277
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,500
things like that and I've been missing

278
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,779
that and I finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a few ways that</font>

coherently than I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2013</font>

325
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,790
nothing fazes me at all like I've

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,550
learned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cope with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

327
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">occasionally like I would read like a</font>

328
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,050
plethora of bad comments on one video

329
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,970
like someone found let's say someone

330
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,470
found my Dark Souls video this is

331
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,850
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually happened someone</font>

332
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,340
found my first Dark Souls video and I

333
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,710
guess it got really not viral but like a

334
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,120
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> started seeing it and it</font>

335
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,710
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a barrage of like safe</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Cairo girl fucking or shit you know and</font>

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,240
like I read that shit and it doesn't

338
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,770
faze me at all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then like a half hour</font>

339
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,600
later sometimes I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you guys</font>

340
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">have ever encountered this problem but a</font>

341
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,500
half hour later I'll start feeling like

342
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,600
what what's the problem i feel kind of

343
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,580
down why do I feel down and then I'll

344
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,840
have to like actually analyze everything

345
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
and be like nope everything's perfect

346
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,330
nope everything's perfect that I'm like

347
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,540
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stupid fucking mass amount of</font>

348
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,920
hate comments that I got on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my Dark</font>

349
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,430
Souls video and I don't like

350
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,260
and then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just immediately gone and</font>

351
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,420
I realized that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I needed to actually</font>

352
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,100
take a second if I ever felt a little

353
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,070
down to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pinpoint why I felt down</font>

354
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,110
and then as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I realized how</font>

355
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,760
stupid every single thing that I was

356
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,800
ever sad about was I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I've been</font>

357
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,110
such so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a happy person I</font>

358
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,149
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like I this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a rare</font>

359
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,100
occurrence to this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a small</font>

360
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,170
thing that I've improved this happens

361
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,690
like twice or three times a month where

362
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,950
I feel down and I don't know why and I

363
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,209
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take a nap and then wake</font>

364
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would feel better and it's just</font>

365
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">like in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the back of your mind something</font>

366
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:34,870
negative that you're not applying logic

367
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,610
or reason to is kind of getting you down

368
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,130
and I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can circumvent</font>

369
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,839
that by just you know thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

370
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,250
being like what was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then like is</font>

371
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,540
that actually something that I should

372
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,420
allow to even ruin three seconds of my

373
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,399
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking know then stop and then it</font>

374
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,230
stops it's awesome um what else I have

375
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,270

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,610
previously didn't tackle I've been

377
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,500

videos I've been you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking polls</font>

moving to a place that suits me better

398
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,430
handling situations that like when I

399
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,470
like handling situations where I would

400
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,870
previously be awkward I'm playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

401
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,520
games that I love now instead of like

402
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,130
forcing myself to improve in a ladder

403
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,959
which always stressed me out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

time my baby christmas tree

410
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,390

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I would make a positive</font>

416
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,020
video talking positively instead of

417
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,640
complaining instead of victimizing

418
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,420
myself instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of acting like my the</font>

419
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,180
outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life is dependent on</font>

420
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,730
anyone other than me I decided to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

421
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,380
2016 end of 2016 video that is positive

422
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,300
that is hopefully uplifting to the

423
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,270
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have felt like their year was</font>

424
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,550
awful just just think about it was your

425
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,980
ear really that awful a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

426
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,870
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on the negative more than</font>

427
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,020
the positive just try not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that you</font>

428
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,870
know like try to work on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

429
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,670
to work on don't let others tell you

430
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,070
what to do don't let others dictate how

431
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,320
you live your<font color="#CCCCCC"> life and don't let things</font>

432
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that don't actually affect you get you</font>

433
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,760
down for more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 10 seconds and in</font>

434
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,890
terms of things like the tragedies and

435
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,510
stuff if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

436
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,870
difference being sad is not the good

437
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,529
route helping by sending money to the

438
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,320
families is and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just try to</font>

439
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,920
understand that try to understand that

440
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,110
fucking camera 16 minutes and then it

441
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,270
stops just try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand that you</font>

442
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,410
know not everything is black and white

443
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,079
things have nuance and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a</font>

444
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,510
positive to most negatives and if there

445
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,880
isn't things can change things can get

446
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,770
better and I hope you guys have a

sillier that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be I</font>

456
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,359
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to be talking more</font>

amazing for me but then I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

459
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,730
