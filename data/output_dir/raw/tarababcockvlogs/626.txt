00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,950
hey guys i am rendering videos on my

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,080
computer which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> computer is</font>

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,050
rendered useless and unlike usually I'm

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,780
rendering like four videos at a time

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,630
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it says 40 minutes in the</font>

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,390
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> video which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a gameplay video</font>

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,490
that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 minutes and it takes a</font>

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,220
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> to render it so 40 minutes for the</font>

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,900
first video the next two videos aren't

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,760
is long but they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost as long</font>

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,039
so I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> like three hours until</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,199
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use my computer again and by using</font>

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,820
my computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean play any games or do</font>

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,200
any streaming or anything like that or

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,500
edit videos because rendering takes up a

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,559
huge chunk of my cpu like ninety percent

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,000
or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent and makes</font>

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,559
everything really fucking laggy and

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,460
stupid so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what it feels like to</font>

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,989
be bored as shit with<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

21
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:54,719
because fucking your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,149
work well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what works but you</font>

23
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I really hope I don't</font>

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,489
drop my phone on my face could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

25
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,710
hilarious and I wouldn't edit it out no

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,580
I wouldn't here's all my green screen

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,560
shit just above my head here i'm laying

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,479
on the floor on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red shag rug i I</font>

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,920

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,409
things we could do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gym</font>

31
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,450
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remain sexy for later so I</font>

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really feel like showering and the</font>

33
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,770
redo my makeup it's 4am here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I'm</font>

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,850
gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bed at like 7am because</font>

35
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,259
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> my roommate gets home and</font>

36
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,750
fuck it you know Yolo um I'll probably

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,119
sleep like three hours and wake up and

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,680
have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I have to do</font>

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,840
tomorrow but um I played hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus today</font>

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,640
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the fucking weirdest game</font>

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,350
the goddamn universe what the fuck is

42
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,149
wrong with that game you literally just

43
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,030
decode messages by saying click to

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,710
decode<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you just click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and you</font>

45
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,939
have this some robot bitch and fuck hand

46
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,469
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> robot bitch just wants to read</font>

47
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,240
messages that are decoded with you so

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,799
all you're doing is just reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,500
and like reading what she says and it's

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,538
literally like is the game only just a

51
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:09,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">two</font>

52
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,940
you how to read broken English made by

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,910
Koreans like that's I don't I don't know

54
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,510
what the point of the fucking game is if

55
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone could tell me I nobody plays</font>

56
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,610
that game like I looked online to try to

57
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,010
find like some kind of explanation or

58
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,930
like even screenshots or gameplay videos

59
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,060
nobody plays it now I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know why</font>

60
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,950
like I don't even know how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> game got</font>

61
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,330
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steam like I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's</font>

62
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,459
something I'm missing I got it because

63
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looked like it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to be some</font>

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of Japanese RPG or something but it</font>

65
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,049
appears that I've been foiled I didn't

66
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,160
buy it actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on my wish list</font>

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,450
and somebody bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for me though</font>

68
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,650
like this looks interesting I'm like I

69
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,019
agree and then I get it it's some kind

70
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,239
of like confusing facade of a game I

71
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,459
don't understand so what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do right</font>

72
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,200
now like I said I<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the gym</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I could</font>
