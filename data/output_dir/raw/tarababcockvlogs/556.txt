that my roommate ever bought me out of

42
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,810
like the randomest randomness right we

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,430
were inside disney and we were buying a

44
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,110
present for his cousin I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> for his</font>

45
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,880
cousin's birthday or some shit and he

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,140

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,509

it for you and I really do<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you are</font>

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,829
I think he's so sad and cynical in the

51
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,299
world he doesn't need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like that</font>

52
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,240
he's so cute so I take him<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere that</font>

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,239
Jay doesn't go which is my roommate

00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,590
out of the my carry-on

56
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,730

57
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of compliments and comments from people</font>

travel buddy I'm like yes duh oh my god

60
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,629
but um I'm a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit frazzled today</font>

61
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,019
so about yesterday's vlog one thing I

62
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed to clarify was that the married</font>

63
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,629
guy and Wesley are not the same guy so

64
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,910
the married guy is not churchy earliest

65
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,340
i don't think he is and Wesley has an

66
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,950
upbringing in church eNOS another thing

67
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,860
people asked me was how old<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am i'm 24</font>

68
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,500
and yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> wesley is 19 I thought he was</font>

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,060
older too because he's a foot taller

70
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,530
than me and like a hundred pounds

71
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">heavier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than me so I was like oh there's</font>

72
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,860
no way this guy's younger than me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,599
then I found out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was and that</font>

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird for me but it's all</font>

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,540
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh today I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little bit</font>

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,390
frazzled because a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit sad</font>

77
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,030
because I'm bothered by something that

78
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone did okay there's a few things</font>

79
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,410
that to me are like complete and utter

80
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,239
forever turn offs and um I don't really

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,040
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say what it is because I feel</font>

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,519
like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys to judge this</font>

83
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,680
objectively rather than taking what it

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,750
is and turning it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a debate</font>

85
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,549
about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I should feel bad</font>

86
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,260
about it and I should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> turned off by</font>

87
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">it or whether or not it makes me a bad</font>

88
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:37,410
person or too conceited or shallow or

89
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,910
whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck that doesn't matter</font>

90
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,230
what matters right now is there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

91
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,790
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in my brain if someone</font>

92
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,500
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to me it's a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,510
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal-breaker turn off type thing</font>

94
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,359
and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad that I'm seeing that</font>

95
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,319
in this person who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not my roommate by</font>

96
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,030
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really big</font>

97
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,769
complaints about my roommate we just fit

98
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:56,790
together we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> fitting together for</font>

99
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,130
like nine years so like any little

100
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,620
problems we have we always just you know

101
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">surpassed that and our relationship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cone</font>

102
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,680
blesses back into what it was before but

103
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,880
this person it was starting to be

104
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,650
important to me and now I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

105
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,849
disheartened about the whole

106
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,840
relationship and it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me sad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I</font>

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,608
was talking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it shut off because I</font>

108
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,649
need to make more room on my phone which

109
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,000
makes total sense because I have like

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,099
twenty ten minute videos on here anyway

111
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it makes me kind of sad because I</font>

112
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,860
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was getting really close to</font>

113
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,460
that person and that person could be

114
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,870
something really<font color="#E5E5E5"> special to me and</font>

115
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,220
something really important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and now</font>

116
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,500
I kind of feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh and I'm gonna</font>

117
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to like explain why I feel this way</font>

118
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,490
or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just try to ignore it and</font>

119
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,479
pretend it's not there or just deal with

120
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,930
it or something but um so this person

121
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,300
like we're this person really cares

122
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,360
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> me right and he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wants I told him</font>

123
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,069
we could never like maybe another life

124
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,139
we could you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> date and live happily</font>

125
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,110
ever after forever and he was like well

126
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">why can't we date in this life I was</font>

127
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,380
like well other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact I don't</font>

128
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,990
date there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and so he's</font>

129
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">making me tell him all the things and I</font>

130
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think he takes them as seriously</font>

131
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,060
as he should when I tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> him he's always</font>

132
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,889
like oh we can just work around that or

133
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,210
oh there's no reason to feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer</font>

134
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,880
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's just like I don't</font>

135
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you understand how big of a deal</font>

136
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,849
breaker<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things are how important</font>

137
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:21,190
these things are to me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you</font>

138
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,370
know I just oh so I feel kind of shitty

139
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,050
about all that I don't I don't know how

140
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,250
to explain it and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how big</font>

141
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,630
of a deal it is if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a big deal</font>

142
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,020
but it still makes me kind of sad cuz

143
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,039
you know fairy tales are fun and

144
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,259
happiness is better and passion is

145
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,759
awesome and you know new interests and

146
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,240
new like I guess you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> call it love</font>

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,810
it is fun you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but um new new</font>

148
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,520
passions with people and new friendships

149
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,500
and new<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that grow beyond just</font>

150
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,210
like an acquaintance which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rare</font>

151
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,800
for me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very rare for me to actually</font>

152
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,259
call someone more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than an acquaintance</font>

153
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,780
and usually when I do I soon realized

154
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,550
that that person isn't worthy of that

155
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,860
title and I'm just like oh he does have

156
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of those deal breakers or something</font>

157
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,039
that completely turned me off to this

158
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,130
person like<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instance um these have</font>

159
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,509
nothing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why</font>

160
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,009
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to use them as examples but</font>

161
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,440
one of the turn-offs I have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

162
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,289
really bad hygiene like that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

163
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,120
huge turnoff or someone who's like

164
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,190
really really into religion that that

165
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,659
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> huge turnoff none of these</font>

166
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,490
again I know you guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

167
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,409
fucking convolute everything I say but

168
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,150
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like</font>

169
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,469
giving you examples of right now are

170
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,419
actually happening in my life with

171
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,820
anyone that I know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not one of</font>

172
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reasons why</font>

173
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,270
I am feeling turned off to this guy or

174
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,149
anything like that um another reason can

175
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:48,599
be like I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he just has like a</font>

176
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,559
really super<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lake like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really super</font>

177
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">girly personality doesn't seem manly</font>

178
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,460
something like that or he has no

179
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,889
backbone he doesn't stick up for what he

180
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,180
believes in stuff like that just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

181
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,490
gets to me and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I can't call</font>

182
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,610
this person one of my closest and most

183
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,349
important people in my life you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

184
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,149
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just have that thing that's</font>

185
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,919
like oh that's a turnoff and I would

186
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,969
love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear down in the comments if</font>

187
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,080
there's anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any like</font>

188
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,089
little personality things that are like

189
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,069
deal breakers or any like even physical

190
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,419
things that are deal breakers completely

191
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:20,949
when you're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about getting into</font>

192
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,619
it into a new relationship whether it be

193
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:26,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">friendship or more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

194
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,659
like a sexual thing or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> boyfriend or</font>

195
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:30,430
girlfriend or even if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like been</font>

196
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,749
dating someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long time and</font>

197
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know popping</font>

198
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,360
the question or something are there

199
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,610
things that like stop you in your tracks

200
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,789
like certain mannerisms and behavior

201
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,379
things I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font>

202
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,629
everyone is an individual person but

203
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,370
there are some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I require in</font>

204
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,589
order for us to mesh and like as much as

205
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:51,580
I started to care about this person

206
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,379
without knowing him very much I feel

207
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the more he's making me tell him</font>

208
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,159
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are the reason why</font>

209
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,199
in this hypothetical world we could

210
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,759
never date forever and be happily ever

211
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,089
after all that shit like it's making me

212
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,740
realize more and more that I'm right

213
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,330
