it's that time of year again when I have

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
to do taxes and also because I got a

any other older guy or there's like a

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,329
weird relationship where someone is only

55
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,619
dating someone because they want a

56
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:50,880
better life you know because they want

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use them for money I don't I don't</font>

58
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,500
judge those people more often than not

59
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,990
the old guy knows what's going down and

60
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,610
he just wants to have you know a lovely

61
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,770
girl by his side and in that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

62
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,149
taking advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of her just as much as</font>

63
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,829
she's taking advantage of him and that's

64
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,299
how I see the situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I could</font>

65
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,160
never personally live that way ever like

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,348
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no amount of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that anyone</font>

67
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:11,849
can give me to make me have sex with

68
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,050
someone I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have sex</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with to</font>

69
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,860

I don't want to live<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if I get all</font>

71
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,880
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these like if I'm in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mindset of</font>

72
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> girl</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who takes advantage of someone</font>

73
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,870
for their money or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever or date</font>

74
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,430
someone they're not attracted to in

75
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,200
order to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> his fortune I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

76
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,020
like I'm not living a happy life so what

77
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,790
I have these products that I want or

78
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,620
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm living in a situation</font>

79
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,300
where I'm not comfortable and doing

80
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,890
things for money that i am not

81
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable doing and changing my</font>

82
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,930
lifestyle or changing my comfortability

83
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,660
is not worth any amount of money for me

84
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,980
that's why I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sex for money</font>

85
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,120
that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't get blowjobs for</font>

86
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,320
money a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say they have the</font>

87
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,990
price will my prices like just being

88
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,550
comfortable in general I don't know what

89
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,160
I would do if I didn't have the money to

90
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">just survive to just be comfortable like</font>

91
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,209
that's a whole different story but for

92
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like superfluous money like it</font>

93
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,060
doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any sense to me like I want</font>

94
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be rich so bad that I'm gonna suck a</font>

95
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,980
dick and like well I like psychic I like

96
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,209
sucking dicks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like to suck okay</font>

97
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,130
so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't suck dick but I</font>

98
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,050
will not suck some old man's dick for

99
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,640
money it just it's not worth it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

100
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,640
because the gain is so little like to me

101
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,380
money is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a necessary evil and I</font>

102
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,700
really do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have enough money to</font>

103
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,799
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable and it really gives me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

104
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,450
swell of pride to know that I can make

105
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,280
money doing what I love or the people

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,049
like my videos so much that they watch

107
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,209
it enough to get me like any ad revenue

108
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,010
like that is so fucking beautiful to me

109
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,200
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am so proud of where I have come</font>

110
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,630
and the money<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just kind of like a</font>

111
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,930
number that shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i have it</font>

112
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,970
increased in popularity and that people

113
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">like what i do and that's what makes me</font>

114
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,190
happy it's not the money so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

115
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,810
understand that and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

116
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do so if someone says if you</font>

117
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,370
stop you know buying video games or if

118
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,080
you stop getting plastic surgery or if

119
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,269
you stop a living with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay or something</font>

120
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,290
and I give you this amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money I</font>

121
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,700
would never do it because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

122
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,640
worth it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that means that I got</font>

123
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,260
another one I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about like</font>

124
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,090
why I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to afford plastic surgery</font>

125
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,670
because I'm in no way at all rich like I

126
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,310
do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> make six figures I am NOT doing</font>

127
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,810
amazingly well Jay doesn't have a job

128
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,690
I'm like paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for everything and I'm</font>

129
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,760
struggling at some point it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

130
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,339
it's it's I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save and its</font>

131
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,910
income that is you know could be very

132
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,800
not stable and I'm just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

133
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,289
slowly what I have and I'm very proud of

134
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,240
where I've come from but it's not

135
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,819
stable if that makes any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense so what I</font>

136
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,069
do when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have extra money is a lot of</font>

137
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">people will put it away like most people</font>

157
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,139
spend money on on going to places that

158
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,580
that's like thousands of dollars to go

159
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,690
on a vacation especially if you have a

160
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,729
family<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not gonna spend the millions</font>

wedding or a wedding<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all I don't</font>

166
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,180
spend money on trying to have a car that

167
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,680
makes me<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm more wealthy that</font>

168
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am that's another thing a lot of</font>

169
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">people spend money on so when I have a</font>

170
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,300
little extra money I either<font color="#E5E5E5"> save it give</font>

plastic surgery or some new<font color="#E5E5E5"> video games</font>

173
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,419
or video game paraphernalia and that's

174
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,099
what I decided to do I had to go to my

175
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,500
plastic surgeon<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how much it would</font>

176
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,090
cost so I could plan for the future when

177
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,650
I do have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get an upgrade on my boobs</font>

178
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">and while I was there I was like why not</font>

179
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,520
fucking treat myself you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of</font>

180
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,570
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to boost it's been a really long</font>

181
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,009
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I've gotten my alloderm</font>

182
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:54,810
implants and they've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of worn off so</font>

183
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,610
why the fuck not and I did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for myself</font>

184
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,699
and I mean when you go out and buy like

185
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,229
a CD like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people do that</font>

186
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore but when you go and buy a CD or</font>

187
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,250
a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> game you don't feel like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

188
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,690
to dictate how many hookers and blow

189
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,219
they fucking buy with the money that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

190
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,289
just spent and it's just ridiculous that

191
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:11,520
someone thinks that they can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

192
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,830
that someone thinks that you know that

193
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">even makes sense it's just crazy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

194
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,400
people act<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you tubing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a real</font>

195
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,750
job people<font color="#E5E5E5"> act like streaming is not a</font>

196
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,400
real job but it's very much so a real

197
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,289
job media is something that has always

198
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,090
been paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and the fact that we're</font>

199
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,969
making free media and someone might like

200
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,289
it so much that they want to you know

201
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:29,789
donate a little bit it helps a lot

202
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,770
because ad revenue is fucking shit and

203
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,330
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just makes sense doesn't make you a</font>

204
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,639
money-grubbing whore if you spend your

205
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole day like I do like my eyes are red</font>

206
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,710
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

207
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">our but I've recorded like three videos</font>

208
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,060
edited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and I'm going to stream after</font>

209
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,620
this for like fucking six hours and I do

210
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,970
that every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and that is my day and</font>

211
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,230
that's everything that I do and I don't

212
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,220
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time for my so-called</font>

213
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,050
vacations on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the couch much often and</font>

214
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,570
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than a real job like trying to</font>

215
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">make an empire off of nothing or of</font>

216
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,800
yourself or off of your talents it's

217
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,120
like being a starving artist and it's

218
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,590
beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wouldn't</font>

219
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,000
trade it for the world and it's like

220
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,310
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> better than modeling which also is</font>

221
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,900
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is half</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font>

222
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,230
free work you know and it just doesn't

223
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,580
make any sense that people act like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

224
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,020
get a real job or oh you shouldn't be

225
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,580
paid for this like I spend my whole day

226
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,170
doing it and hopefully i make people

227
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,400
laugh and hopefully i make people think

228
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,470
and that's why I fucking do it now

229
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,560
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what I do with my you</font>

230
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">know superfluous income which I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

231
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much of and what I'm thinking</font>

232
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,570
of doing on my taxes is like Jay does

233
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,610
some editing for me like for the gaming

234
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,020
channel I don't have a lot of time to do

235
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,810
editing he does the the retro series is

236
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,250
the main one that he does he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

237
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,600
much more editing most of the editing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

238
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,640
do myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking like what</font>

239
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,000
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put him on my payroll as as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a as an</font>

240
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,710
employee would that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better than just</font>

241
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,750
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having him file at all or like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

242
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know how many of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are tax</font>

243
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,660
experts but i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like advice on this</font>

244
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,830
topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been thinking about either</font>

245
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,950
putting him on as a as an employee or

246
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,930
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mon as a dependent which kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

247
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,790
sounds really fucking stupid but he

248
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,290
plans on streaming at some point and

249
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,940
that seems like a cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> Avenue to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

250
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,960
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's really funny and</font>

251
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,190
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always really good at games he was</font>

252
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,200
like masters in starcraft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

253
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,750
if he wasn't playing duo with me and

254
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,760
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know stay where i am and</font>

255
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,470
stuff i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if it's like my skill</font>

256
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,720
the champions i play or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font>

257
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,910
duo / dynamic queue is just fucking us

258
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,850
in terms of matchups but I mean he's

259
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,290
staying down in the level that I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

260
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,120
I have confidence that he could even be

261
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenger at some point so the fact</font>

262
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is so good at video games and so</font>

263
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,340
dedicated to<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are competitive</font>

264
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,590
I think he would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great streamer but</font>

265
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">until then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I should put</font>

266
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:38,110
him on my stuff or if it's more

267
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,760
beneficial to me if I'll you know

268
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if it's right off</font>

269
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,490
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm saying like I get to</font>

270
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,929
write off so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many things because I work</font>

271
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,030

spend that much money on games anymore

295
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,450
because a lot of the games i can get

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,430

comes in and tries to dictate what I'm

339
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,540
doing with my money when it's a

340
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,310

I am and I would never change then

379
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,199
changing that to get some like

380
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,000
superficial respect from someone else

381
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,190
would just be disrespecting myself and I

382
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,260
tell people this so fucking often but I

383
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,029
