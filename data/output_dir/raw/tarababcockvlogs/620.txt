00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,280
the Terra talks so I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put off</font>

until tomorrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> um what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else is going on</font>

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,530
and babbling while I was playing diablo

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,880
just talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on in my</font>

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,950
life and how I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really frustrated with</font>

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,830
a certain guy in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> life right now and</font>

32
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,110
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustrated at his unhealthy</font>

33
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,909
life choices and stuff and how he makes

34
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,780
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like just tells me what I want</font>

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,479
to hear and then makes me like feel

36
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,520
pseudo special but I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's just</font>

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling everyone the same things or</font>

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,659
telling him it so that I stay around

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,180
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know it's what I want</font>

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,820
to hear supposedly in his mind and it

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,200
annoys me because like the whole time

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay I'm not going to</font>

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,420
make anything any more serious than it

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,850
is but he encouraged it to be more

45
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,899
serious and so I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> more comfortable</font>

46
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,310
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> being more serious and then he</font>

47
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of like screws it up like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

48
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,820
and kind of shows his true colors<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I</font>

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,000
could be wrong about<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could be</font>

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,460
too hard on him but at the same time I

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,120
freaking doubt it just because the way

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,460
everything is going and like I hate

53
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,630
unhealthy lifestyles and that's

54
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what i was talking about i</font>

55
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,350
also talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> funny stories</font>
