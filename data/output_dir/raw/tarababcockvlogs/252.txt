00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
hey guys today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">my first time getting Botox as you guys</font>

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,460

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,500
open with who I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am what I do and why I</font>

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,000
do it and I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people have a</font>

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of misconceptions about plastic</font>

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,540
surgery and fillers and injectables and

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,000
things so if you are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman who's</font>

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,650
looking to get Botox or a man who's

10
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,180
looking to get Botox I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a few</font>

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,500
men who have actually gotten Botox

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,760
there's nothing to be ashamed about

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,970
their wrinkles kind of suck or if you

14
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,560
were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hater who wants to be a</font>

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,449
better informed<font color="#E5E5E5"> hater because oh my god</font>

16
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,400
I don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,470
people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have too much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Botox in</font>

18
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,270
my lips well<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's so not a thing</font>

19
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,980
and in fact that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to</font>

20
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,510
start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fact right there is what</font>

21
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,219
we're going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um if you</font>

22
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">are any type of person who is just</font>

23
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,640
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my life or want to know</font>

24
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,469
more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or you're ignorant to it</font>

25
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,390
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to actually stop being</font>

26
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,860
ignorant to it then just keep watching

27
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,000
the video it should be entertaining

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,239
because of course it is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my videos</font>

29
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,559
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I got done what</font>

30
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,329
the fuck so recently I got a procedure

31
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,309
done where I took a mole off of my face

32
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,379
and I closed this piercing hole here and

33
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,000
at that time I also got my normal

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
injectables which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jew</font>

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,930
demand my lips to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of plump it up</font>

36
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,700
and make it look the way I feel is

37
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,799
aesthetically pleasing and I also

38
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,930
decided to opt for some<font color="#CCCCCC"> preventative</font>

39
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,939
Botox now you might be asking me<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

40
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,830
why would i get botox<font color="#CCCCCC"> i clearly don't</font>

41
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,930
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrinkles</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my mid-20s</font>

42
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,580
there's no reason for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be getting</font>

43
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,590
Botox yet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> preventative Botox is</font>

44
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,909
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into for a</font>

45
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,710
while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's a very smart</font>

46
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,450
decision if you want to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

47
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,700
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to stress in the beginning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

48
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,689
this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to make sure i'm</font>

49
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,100
recording<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok because i don't want to let</font>

50
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,979
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this fucking rampage tirade of</font>

51
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,259
talking and then fucking not be

52
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,240
recording so anyway before you get any

53
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,159
kind of cosmetic surgery or literally do

54
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,689
anything in life make sure that it's

55
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,220
what you want to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to</font>

56
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">do only this is my canvas and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will do</font>

57
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,540
with it what I want to but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will never</font>

58
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,729
be pressured from outside sources even

59
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's like a boyfriend a friend</font>

60
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">Society telling me what I need to look</font>

61
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,399
like I do this for me I do this because

62
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,350
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my canvas and I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

63
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,119
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shame to not improve myself</font>

64
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,329
it makes its fun I Drive pride from it

65
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,890
that I've you know done something and

66
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,869
gotten somewhere it's like I have goals

67
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,369
and I'm reaching toward it and I'm like

68
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,920
gamifying basically my entire appearance

69
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,419
which it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me happy it's</font>

70
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,190
something that I enjoy doing I love

71
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,390
myself at every stage

72
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,670
age whether imperfect or as perfect as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

73
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,069
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be all stages I love myself so</font>

74
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,170
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for me to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

75
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,610
just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm insecure i'm doing it</font>

76
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,650
as like an art canvas type thing and

77
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,030
it's just something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I enjoy doing</font>

78
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,190
and it's just one facet of who I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am so</font>

79
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,600
that's why I do it I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it because</font>

80
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,520
someone told me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for any</font>

81
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,080
other reason and you should never do

82
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,959
anything in life<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you're sure you</font>

83
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,850
want to do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself that includes</font>

84
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,980
something as reversible and as temporary

85
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,200
as injectables or any kind of cosmetic

86
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,200
surgery no matter how crazy or how minor

87
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,209
it might be including just dying your

88
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,590
hair like even if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dye</font>

89
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,090
your hair because<font color="#E5E5E5"> your boyfriend thinks</font>

90
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,470
blondes are hotter don't fucking do that

91
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,360
unless you really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it and that</font>

92
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">is my I feel good sjw statement for the</font>

93
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,320
day aside from that there are a lot of

94
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,000
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who say that Botox can be put</font>

95
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,860
into the lips now let me tell you what

96
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,989
botox is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Botox is a muscle relaxer</font>

97
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,180
basically so you put it in certain areas

98
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,780
of the face to make your to relax your

99
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,370
muscles so that you're not creating

100
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,310
certain wrinkles and to also like

101
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,250
lighten like areas where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think you</font>

102
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">might be making funny faces that could</font>

103
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,400
eventually turn into wrinkles and that's

104
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
what preventative Botox is it's like if

105
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,070
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> making these faces and stuff and</font>

106
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,079
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're making wrinkles</font>

107
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,579
that might not stay there you can

108
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,310
prevent them by<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting Botox early and</font>

109
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,570
then you won't move the muscles as much

110
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,630
therefore not creating the creases and

111
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,370
the wrinkles<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you might get later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

112
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,720
in life so you're basically just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

113
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,640
delaying aging and at the same time

114
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,750
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

115
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,340
preventative Botox and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've only done it</font>

116
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,810
once now and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only had it for like</font>

117
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,640
less than a month so i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if</font>

118
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,680
this will work for me but it will often

119
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,260
like teach people out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

120
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,790
certain facial expressions that would

121
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,530
make them later on get wrinkles so if

122
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,120
you do it once<font color="#E5E5E5"> or twice or you do it for</font>

123
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,470
a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two years you might not have</font>

124
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it anymore in that specific place</font>

125
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,959
because you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> making those faces</font>

126
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,610
anymore because you've kind of trained

127
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,110
yourself out of doing it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Botox</font>

128
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,579
was not allowing you to do it does that

129
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,500
make any sense so like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i constantly</font>

130
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,359
go like or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and that creates</font>

131
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,980
certain wrinkles and then I have Botox

132
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,450
in my face for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a year that</font>

133
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,579
disallows me to do those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

134
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,560
probably stop trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do those things</font>

135
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it kind of subconsciously makes me</font>

136
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,220
stop doing them so i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have less</font>

137
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,690
wrinkles down the road and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

138
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,250
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> preventative Botox i'm</font>

139
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,630
not doing those things

140
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,950
as I can't because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the muscles are</font>

141
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,720
relaxed so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have as many</font>

142
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,370
wrinkles why i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my 40's and people</font>

143
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,280
say I keep like losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harris where I'm</font>

144
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">like dying or something I'm shedding for</font>

145
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer that's what's going on</font>

146
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it is really hot in here anyway</font>

147
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,970
a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that it can you know</font>

148
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">take 10 or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 years off of you down the</font>

149
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">line because you haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been creating</font>

150
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,730
these wrinkles that you would normally

151
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,010
create now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not meant to freeze</font>

152
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,770
your face and you should never ever in

153
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,650
my opinion at least get Botox at like a

154
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,810
place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't a doctor like there are</font>

155
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,910
so many like<font color="#E5E5E5"> beauty bars and things and</font>

156
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,930
like you can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it done at your</font>

157
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,790
nail salons sometimes or like I know I

158
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,280
went to gene juarez once expensive as

159
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,350
fuck fucking hair touch-up oh my god

160
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">like all I do is get my roots touched up</font>

161
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,920
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little like trim off the ends I</font>

162
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,480
don't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> like layer my hair and that</font>

163
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,550
cost me like 250 bucks never doing that

164
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,080
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is not worth it is not</font>

165
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,970
any better than the place<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I go to</font>

166
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,080
even though the chick was like really

167
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,850
cool and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we bonded it's just</font>

168
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,680
that that's too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> money anyway off on</font>

169
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,290
a tangent again of course but they

170
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,060
offered<font color="#E5E5E5"> Botox there and I would never</font>

171
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,640
get any kind of injectables not at a

172
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,080
plastic surgeon some people do it at

173
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,730
dermatologists and I think that's fine

174
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,100
because dermatologists no skin they no

175
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,200
wrinkles they know the muscles in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

176
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,340
face that you should and should not

177
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,280
relax and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the only side effect</font>

178
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,810
the only bad thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen is</font>

179
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,040
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an allergic reaction that</font>

180
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,250
gives you welts or you can they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

181
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,260
inject in a wrong place and it can droop

182
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,540
you instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like making you</font>

183
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,460
look more<font color="#E5E5E5"> youthful and that can be a bad</font>

184
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,230
thing and that's why I would never do it

185
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,850
if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't at my plastic surgeon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

186
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,050
actually knows what the fuck he's doing

187
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,760
and knows the human anatomy and isn't

188
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,290
just an<font color="#CCCCCC"> aesthetician you know what I'm</font>

189
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,840
saying so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided to get</font>

190
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,370
preventative Botox because Botox is

191
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,200
relatively cheap especially compared to

192
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,230
lip injectables but oh I didn't finish

193
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,940
my thought about the thing okay so guys

194
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,920
you if you stuck it in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> lips it</font>

195
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,180
would not plump your lips it would

196
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,320
probably make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look like you have a</font>

197
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,150
stroke so for those of you who like to

198
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,070
criticize people who have big lips or

199
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,200
people who get injectables or plastic

200
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,700
surgery in general by saying too much

201
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,410
Botox just because they have big lips

202
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,450
that doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense and the word</font>

203
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,770
you're looking for is probably just

204
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,200
injectables or collagen collagen is what

205
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put into their lips until</font>

206
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,140
they realized that the synthetic

207
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,080
versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eve last longer and have less</font>

208
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,450
reactions because a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

209
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,100
reactions to things that are both

210
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,740
vine derived you know because a lot of

211
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,240
people are you know allergic to cow

212
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,760
stuff so um they went to things like

213
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,500
Juvederm and wrestling so Juvederm and

214
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,210
wrestling are the two things that people

215
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,800
mainly put into their lips you would

216
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">never put Botox in your lips the only</font>

217
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,920
reason you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever put Botox anywhere</font>

218
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,440
near your lips is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lift your smile you</font>

219
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,210
can put it here or you if you smoke a

220
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,890
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have those like vertical</font>

221
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,510
lines from going like this and smoking

222
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have it here and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll</font>

223
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,570
relax it a little bit but basically if

224
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,700
you wait to get Botox when you actually

225
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,770
have wrinkles you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to get filler</font>

226
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,450
as well to fill in the wrinkles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

227
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,430
just more<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just it's</font>

228
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,200
dumb down the line so to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> early</font>

229
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,150
that in my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounded like a good</font>

230
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,240
idea now I was not super excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

231
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,890
this because I'm more excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

232
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,450
things that actually change the way that

233
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,340
I look<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's what excites me more</font>

234
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,960
i'm like oh my god improvement but this

235
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,780
is more like making something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

236
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,450
inevitable happened later and that was

237
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,030
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like oh you know it's something</font>

238
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'll like down the line but I want</font>

239
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,320
it right now you know I like the the

240
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,800
initial changes right so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't that</font>

241
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to get it</font>

242
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">done because I wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try it because</font>

243
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,940
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to start on a regimen of</font>

244
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">preventative Botox so I go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in I get it</font>

245
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,710
done it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like fucking</font>

246
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything like I felt nothing there were</font>

247
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,580
three places where he injected like

248
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,290
right here the three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> muscles</font>

249
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,200
to make me not like disallowed this

250
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,790
movement because I actually did have an

251
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,920
active set of muscles here when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

252
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,620
scowled<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had lines but nothing that was</font>

253
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,600
like staying it was just something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

254
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,980
I could do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I can't do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

255
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,300
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still emote you know like I'm still</font>

256
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">accrued and it's awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it feels so</font>

257
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,490
great now it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two to seven</font>

258
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,230
days to actually kick in which is kind

259
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,150
of weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> and initially at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the injection</font>

260
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,190
spot i had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> welt looking things for</font>

261
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,690
literally only 15 minutes it was the

262
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,010
weirdest experience of my life because

263
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,260
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get injected you don't feel</font>

264
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately you have</font>

265
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">these like red welts and then they're</font>

266
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,880
gone within 15 minutes it's usually

267
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,350
anything that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your face</font>

268
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,750
whether it's like a zit or you know like

269
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,490
a cold sore it fucking takes like at

270
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,990
least a week to go away at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

271
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,870
overnight right but this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

272
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,950
immediately gone and then I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

273
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything for I would say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about five days</font>

274
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,870
at which point I just I started feeling

275
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,230
like like tight skin but not in like a

276
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,640
bad way like some people might not like

277
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,420
it and I'm

278
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,800
right now that there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

279
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,329
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably be like oh this is a</font>

280
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:56,010
horror story and I would never get Botox

281
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,320
again Botox even in its best state is

282
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,510
bad but for me the feeling of like

283
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,250
having just like tighter better skin and

284
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,589
putting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> makeup on like this like</font>

285
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:06,959
perfectly flat amazing canvas was just

286
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
like great to me and I love the fact

287
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like I don't know if you guys know</font>

288
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,870
this but maybe guys I know girls know

289
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,160
this but maybe guys have seen this too

290
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,720
when a girl cakes on her makeup like

291
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,880
crazy which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not something I do but</font>

292
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,380
like even having any makeup on your face

293
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,720
at all when you like amote and stuff

294
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll like get into it'll set into the</font>

295
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,100
wrinkles that you create sometimes if

296
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,720
you don't set it correctly and then it

297
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,430
makes you look older so like makeup can

298
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,300
make you look older especially

299
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,010
foundation powders and stuff like that

300
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">but with this like I it's so great i</font>

301
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,779
just love it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much i really really</font>

302
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">love it and i would recommend it to</font>

303
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,620

<font color="#CCCCCC">just a hobby and it's just one aspect</font>

329
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,190
about myself and I like working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font>

330
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,990
inner self just as much learning things

331
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,310
talking about things talking about

332
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,899
philosophy with you guys making videos

333
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,930
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and the people who are saying</font>

334
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am superficial are in my opinion</font>

335
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:43,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are superficial because</font>

336
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,390
they can't see past the fact that I'm

337
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,699
creating an aesthetic canvas for myself

338
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:49,560
to see that I'm actually much more than

339
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,779
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes any sense and so I</font>

340
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,610
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you should be doing it if</font>

341
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,720
you feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to boost your</font>

342
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,790
self-esteem a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that oh</font>

343
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,470
it can boost your self-esteem just to

344
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">change a few things but I feel like that</font>

345
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,769
in itself is unhealthy and maybe I'm

346
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:02,430
just

347
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,800
a little more emotionally detached<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

348
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,360
other people or maybe I come at this

349
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,790
from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> too logical standpoint but for me</font>

350
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,770
it should only it like it should be of

351
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,360
no consequence to how you feel other

352
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">than like yeah that was fun hmm I'm</font>

353
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling good today it should never liked</font>

354
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,320
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> take you from a depressed</font>

355
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,870
person to a happy person because a

356
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,029
depressed person is not just sad because

357
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">of their appearance they need to like</font>

358
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,959
look deeper and figure out why they're

359
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,279
feeling the way that they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

360
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,270
should never do it just because they're

361
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,380
bullied about the way that they look

362
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,490
they should do it because they actually

363
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">genuinely want to improve themselves and</font>

364
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,410
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> look better and like be a better</font>

365
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,850
version of you and if that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hobby</font>

366
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,620
that you have if that's not something

367
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,209
that you enjoy doing don't fucking do it

368
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,959

376
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,610

still put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> makeup and do all of these</font>

378
