<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think we're gonna have a problem</font>

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,090
is because I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> took a bunch of</font>

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,080
caffeine and that's why I have this

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,309
water here I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably drink a</font>

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,049
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more today the topic is</font>

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,350
riches and bitches oh yeah and before I

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,630
get into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course I wanna have a</font>

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,330
precursor here talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bitches</font>

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,980
is something that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used colloquially</font>

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,500
for saying women else to say chicks I

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,029
saved<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bitch stuff like that it just</font>

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-drug Torian anyway wars are just</font>

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,410
fucking words I hate having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like PC</font>

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,260
politically correct myself often<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,040
just something that doesn't make any

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me like I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we should</font>

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,160
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> um as open and as verbal about</font>

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,559
whatever we want as we possibly desire

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,910
to be and that it shouldn't really

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,340
matter because everyone can understand

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,590
context and isn't easily offended and

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,449
understands that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know another</font>

25
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">person's opinion is you know shouldn't</font>

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,770
affect you really and that there are

27
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,230
context issues they have to take like

28
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,349
obviously if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am like that fucking</font>

29
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">bitch I'm angry and I'm like you know</font>

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,479

38
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone who is a female is going to be a</font>

39
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of a quote-unquote feminist</font>

40
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,670
so I moccasin are trying to hurt to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

41
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,860
other females in the world by using that

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,259
word so let's move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on um I watched</font>

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,500
another karl Pilkington video yesterday

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,710
it was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the episodes from the</font>

45
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,090
moaning of life i think is what it's

46
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,820
called and it's one of his newer things

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,659
from 2013 or whatever and he was what

48
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,950
was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he was oh yeah he was a</font>

49
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,939
learning vocation so he was wondering

50
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,250
how people come to decide which vocation

51
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,570
they want to go for and how much money

52
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to survive in how to live in</font>

53
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lap of luxury if you have like a</font>

54
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,649
surplus of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it struck me that</font>

55
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:05,610
like what

56
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,530
said about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the watches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so he was he</font>

57
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,419
was a he had some chick come in and try

58
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,038
to sell him like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred and</font>

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">seventy-five thousand pound watches over</font>

60
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,150
175,000 dollar let's just say even

61
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,470
though it would be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 190</font>

62
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,420
thousand dollars because you know the

63
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,790
exchange rate but anyway and I totally

64
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,590
agreed on his opinion like<font color="#E5E5E5"> often a lot</font>

65
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,970
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he oversimplifies</font>

66
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,410
because you know he's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to act</font>

67
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">like an idiot or river but it's like so</font>

68
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,280
obvious to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that these watches just</font>

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,750
look like a hundred dollar watches why

70
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,070
the fuck are they being sold for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

71
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred and ninety thousand dollars and</font>

72
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,820
it hit me that like okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

73
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,110
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here on out is going to be my own</font>

74
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,250
opinion in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own my own kind of</font>

75
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,420
perception and I could be totally wrong

76
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,590
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

77
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,150
hypothesize a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about why people are</font>

78
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,680
the way that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I'm something</font>

79
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,420
that's very important in psychology and

80
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,860
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I like to like learn from</font>

81
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,600
like I get my perception of why<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

82
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,590
are the way they are and then other

83
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,630
possible reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> why people are the way</font>

84
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,800
they are and then I talk to others about

85
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,239
it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to get others ideas and</font>

86
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's great this is a great Avenue for</font>

87
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,300
that because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

88
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,770
will have comments on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be</font>

89
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,970
fucking wonderful and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are</font>

92
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">me out in deciding why things are the</font>

93
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,630
way they are so if you've ever watched

94
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,170
an episode of MTV Cribs or anyone who's

95
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,760
in the limelight and gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> their like</font>

96
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,910
their house show who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really rich it</font>

97
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,650
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everyone kind of has the same</font>

98
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,790
things they have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really</font>

99
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,769
extravagantly nice house it's too big

100
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,360
for them to care take care of so they

101
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,100
have a maid or something and then they

102
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,700
have like a lot of cars a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of like</font>

103
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,950
product type clothes where like the

104
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,209
clothes are really expensive I don't

105
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,290
know the words cuz I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a shit</font>

106
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,600
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff oh and it seems like</font>

107
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,090
they'll have the same shit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what is</font>

108
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,160
common is that people have a bunch of

109
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in their house like at all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

110
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,459
and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

111
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,830
just buying these things because they're

112
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,540
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show off to others or trying</font>

113
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,250
to make friends through an avenue that

114
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,130
is kind of disingenuous because these

115
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">people aren't really actually going to</font>

116
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a friends where were those people</font>

117
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,850
before we were rich right where<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they</font>

118
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,380
going to be after you you know hit rock

119
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,820
bottom if that's the case if something

120
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,950
happens to your fortune like they're

121
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,840
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much Fairweather friends and you</font>

122
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,700
see on in the episode with karl

123
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,040
Pilkington about vocation there was this

124
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,380
guy in whatever country and he

125
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,990
was rich for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason and he had</font>

126
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a bunch of girls around his pool</font>

127
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,630
and a bunch of friends in his house<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

128
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,589
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it seemed like it wasn't</font>

129
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,740
really necessary for<font color="#CCCCCC"> him to have that</font>

130
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,450
like if I was rich like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna tell</font>

131
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,770
you at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this video or later in</font>

132
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video about what exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would do</font>

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,100
if I had all the money in the world but

134
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,780
it wouldn't be anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you see on</font>

135
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,730
TV and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

136
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,080
kind of correlation between the people

137
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
that get on<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV and the people who are</font>

138
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,890
rich like obviously they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

139
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">show with someone on MTV Cribs who has a</font>

140
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,940
really boring house or doesn't have a

141
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,440
lot of stuff going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it doesn't have</font>

142
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the standard things I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe</font>

143
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,530
that's what the viewers want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see they</font>

144
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,690
want to see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the high-end things</font>

145
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">but why is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who come from</font>

146
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,250
nothing and then become rich end up

147
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,840
wanting the exact same things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

148
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,610
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically as the things</font>

149
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,350
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it makes</font>

150
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,170
no sense to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me why someone 190 thousand</font>

151
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,630
dollar watch when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can have a hundred</font>

152
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,980
dollar watch and then spend a lot more

153
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,000
on something you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually passionate</font>

154
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,760
about so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very weird to me that they</font>

155
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,500
seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like all the same things like</font>

156
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,930
nice watches nice shoes nice clothes

157
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,390
nice cars nice houses it's all the same

158
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,820
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like why don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they do anything</font>

159
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,800
that adds personality with their money

160
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
why don't they like give back a little

161
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,890
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> on average why do they always</font>

162
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,270
have to have an immense amount of people

163
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,380
in their house it seems like they're

164
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of just insecure about things and</font>

165
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,410
they're showing off for other people

166
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,790
rather than actually doing what they

167
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,770
want if that makes any<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense and then um</font>

168
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,870
I want to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit like okay</font>

169
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,180
so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> the girls that sit around a</font>

170
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,610
rappers pool right people would call

171
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,960
them whores or something right or

172
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,820
they're just in it for the money but the

173
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,250
men are inviting them there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

174
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,360
know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want sex they want</font>

175
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,100
companionship they want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to look</font>

176
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,990
cooler to their friends like it's a

177
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,850
mutual relationship women want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live</font>

178
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,680
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lap of luxury and they get it by</font>

179
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,050
either be friending or hanging out of

180
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy's house or having sex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a guy</font>

181
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,680
who you know wants the companionship in

182
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,960
the sex it's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mutual thing and</font>

183
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,850
they are there knowing what they're

184
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,230
getting into it's not like one is

185
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,390
forcing the other and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font>

186
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,850
you know taking advantage of the other

187
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,470
like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people would see the</font>

188
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">rapper and be like oh he's such</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

189
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,410
misogynist and then they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

190
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,580
the girl<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be like oh she's such</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

191
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,800
whore it they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they want</font>

192
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,509
in a certain way why does<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone have</font>

193
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,039
to judge other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

194
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,300
wouldn't do it or just because you're

195
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">not interested in it which is kind of</font>

196
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,789
funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot of people are</font>

197
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:25,990
hypocrites and they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

198
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,220
have hot girls where their<font color="#CCCCCC"> pool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

199
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,599
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about if they</font>

200
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:30,129
became rich but they like to judge other

201
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,259
people because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see flaws in</font>

202
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,190
other people or because they don't have

203
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> morals and to me that's just</font>

204
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,520
kind of stupid like the girl is getting

205
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">what she wants whatever it is and the</font>

206
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,090
guy is getting what he wants whatever it

207
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,830
is and it's not hurting anyone else so

208
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,389
people shouldn't judge that so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

209
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:44,560
I see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people like hating on</font>

210
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,979
women in the sex industry or women who

211
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,539
you know date older men because they

212
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,099
want their money<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever this just</font>

213
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,050
the thing that like men want this woman

214
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,039
want this they're getting what they want

215
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,750
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really hurting anyone and</font>

216
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,909
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that girl is</font>

217
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,349
only interested in money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> has no</font>

218
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,550
their substance and now she's a whore

219
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,379
and she's like the worst part of society

220
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,270
she could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested in other</font>

221
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,919
things or maybe she's like has this

222
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,719
amazingly beautiful voice and really

223
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,280
wants to start a career so she's hanging

224
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people and doing whatever</font>

225
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,129
it takes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dreams come true</font>

226
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,449
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't know everyone's personal</font>

227
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:14,710
circumstance so that's another thing I

228
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,180
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just go over really quickly</font>

229
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,379
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to make this video too</font>

230
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,500
long so let's jump into what I would do

231
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,909
if I had all the fucking money in the

232
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,349
world the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing I would do is I</font>

233
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,979
would pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> off Jays like 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grand plus</font>

234
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,680
college debt because yeah that's just

235
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">awful and it's always looming over his</font>

236
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,770
head and I want to help him out that so

237
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,300
the first thing I'm do Oh the second

238
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,560
thing I would do is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would open</font>

239
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,870
in every major city<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open a</font>

240
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,659
no-kill animal shelters and then I think

241
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,370
for myself personally I would have my

242
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,430
own um I like exotic animal sanctuary

243
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,080
where like if an animal<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets hurt or</font>

244
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,240
like a bird sanctuary like I oh I love

245
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,949
following the people on Instagram who

246
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,659
had that kind of thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to be</font>

247
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,159
involved in the rehabilitation of

248
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,900
animals like on a daily basis I think

249
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,699
it's fucking amazing and I think hanging

250
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:59,259
out with animals just improves your

251
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,490
morale and makes you better than I

252
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,659
fucking love them and I would do

253
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything it possible to you know help</font>

254
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,889
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they get back</font>

255
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,629
into the world safely I understand um

256
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,680
the kind of issue with wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

257
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,320
exotic animals as pets and knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

258
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,910
they belong in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world and they're</font>

259
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,200
happier in the wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that kind of</font>

260
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
thing so I would definitely put them

261
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,640
back out into the wild after they're

262
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,200
taken care of but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

263
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that more of them survived and then the</font>

264
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,900
you know it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like a conservatory</font>

265
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,150
type of thing so what else would I do so

266
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,890
I would never buy a watch for 190

267
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,660
thousand dollars ever because I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

268
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,520
buy the $100,000 watch if I even liked

269
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,289
watches but I don't like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

270
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you think these guys are growing up</font>

271
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,030
impoverished and they're like God if

272
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,979
only I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get that watch of my dreams</font>

347
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,509
wouldn't really do that living in the

348
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">city type thing but I would have liked a</font>

349
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,019
Frasier Crane type home that I can come

350
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">to like in downtown Seattle or something</font>

351
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,429
or maybe LA but I don't only like LA so

352
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:33,829
somewhere else where I could have like a

353
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:36,720
high-rise type place I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

354
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">be pretty cool um as a secondary home</font>

355
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,489
but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very modern because I</font>

356
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:43,619
also do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> modern architecture but</font>

357
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,699
mostly what I like is um log cabins<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

358
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,069
comfy houses and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a bunch of</font>

359
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:51,839
rooms for content creation because if I

360
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,039
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> richest person in the world I</font>

361
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,599
would still<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fucking creating content</font>

362
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:55,799
because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing I love more it's</font>

363
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,419
fucking amazing I would have great

364
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,939
amazing setups I would do like skits and

365
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:01,619
I would have maybe a whole team for

366
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:02,909
skits and stuff when we do it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

367
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:05,339
a week something creative but the rest

368
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,899
of it would just be like one-on-one you

369
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,939
and me type stuff so that's basically

370
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:11,309
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would do they combined a lot of</font>

371
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:14,789
money just<font color="#E5E5E5"> games classic cars a nice log</font>

372
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,229
cabin somewhere where nobody would

373
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,720
bother me oh I would have a

374
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,120
full gym in my basement because like

375
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,589
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> air conditioned obviously</font>

376
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:22,939
extent like air conditioning but it

377
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:24,620
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the Fulton with like all of</font>

378
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,259
the machines and a freeway track that

379
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,629
goes up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a billion something I</font>

380
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:30,829
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I don't like going out of</font>

381
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,449
my house and also have a spray tanning

382
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,060
booth in a tanning bed because I don't

383
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,379
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out of my house very often I</font>

384
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,029
like having like a cozy place where I

385
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,199
can do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's something</font>

386
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,360
that's important to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I would do</font>

387
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as well but that's pretty much it</font>

388
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,639
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different from what</font>

389
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,899
everyone else does with money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

390
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,560
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot of giving to animals in</font>

391
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,600
need and a lot of just being comfortable

392
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">with my life not being extravagant</font>

393
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:53,839
because I feel like extravagance is just

394
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,100
ridiculous like I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a yacht</font>

395
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,259
and then my private plane and knowledge

396
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,089
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like traveling so I</font>

397
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,589
wouldn't do it I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it just to</font>

398
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,990
make people be like oh god is so cool

399
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,129
like that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think I don't have a</font>

400
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,329
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> hanging out my house I</font>

401
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have as many friends as I have now</font>

402
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:09,079
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very few that are that close to</font>

403
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,129
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my personal life but it would</font>

404
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,069
just be comfort to the max as well as

405
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:15,410
giving back to you know still giving

406
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,879
back to my viewers any<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that I can</font>

407
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,920
like I would support everyone's patreon

408
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,680
campaign like I have a patron who is a

409
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,269
good at art and I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> him you should</font>

410
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">start a patreon campaign and there's a</font>

411
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,550
another patron that I have who writes

412
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">German erotic stories and I'm a patron</font>

413
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,839
of his patreon campaign I feel like I

414
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,399
would give back a lot more to the people

415
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,680
who also support me and watch my content

416
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,079
and give me ideas if I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know had the</font>

417
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,899
money to do so and I was properly funded

418
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,670
but oh my god it would be awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

419
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,920
money makes it will go around yeah but

420
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,259
like I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use my way it seems like</font>

421
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">people do on like MTV Cribs or rappers</font>

422
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,129
or people who just come into<font color="#E5E5E5"> money I</font>

423
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,339
would use it to make my life my friends

424
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,920
lives and animals lives better as well

425
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,589
the people who helped make me who I am

426
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,570
now so on any<font color="#E5E5E5"> insight into why people</font>

427
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,360
shame people for using their sexuality

428
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,010
or for using something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get something</font>

429
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,860
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they want to or vice versa</font>

430
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,240
that's interesting to me so put post

431
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">dammit comments as well as any insight</font>

432
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,470
into why people all seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy the</font>

433
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,850
exact same things when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they come into</font>

434
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,250
money extravagant things that are pretty

435
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">much the same as the cheap things like I</font>

436
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,579
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that too so I'll see</font>

437
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys tomorrow that's how I'm gonna</font>

438
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,990
do a gaming blog I think soon about

439
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,910
because people keep saying i'm using my

440
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,529
sexuality looks the fuck does that even

441
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,860
mean first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all I dress less sexy on</font>

442
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,630
like twitch or might well if my youtube

443
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,769
videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fine I dress the way I</font>

444
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,120
dressed in the day but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes I'll</font>

445
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,610
feel I find myself changing into

446
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,930
something a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more modest</font>

447
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,250
because the twitch rules are just

448
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,170
fucking stupid so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I'm less</font>

449
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,810
sexual and just more<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself and like so</font>

450

453
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,720
