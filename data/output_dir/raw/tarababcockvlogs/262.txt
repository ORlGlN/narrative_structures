98
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,919
how to look at the things that I'm

recording and I don't know how to like

101
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,769
playback or I can't like access the

102
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,120
memory card for some reason even though

103
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,769
it should just be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be accessed</font>

104
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,629
because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the access cable there so</font>

105
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,219
I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to test it so what I'm</font>

108
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,440
when I'm quiet isn't that bad so I can

109
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,120
probably cover it up with music but if

110
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,250
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird sound issue it'll be</font>

121
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,220

132
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,540
of it until he was taking the test and

135
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">again because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you guys don't know</font>

136
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,739
when you're becoming a citizen it costs

137
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,810
like seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred dollars to even send</font>

138
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,130
in an application and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

139
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,449

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,600
have to like renounce all of your titles

145
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,340
from your other country unless you

146
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,810

<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the really pointy like claw type</font>

194
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,760
nails and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it would be</font>

195
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,070
inadvertently also a really good way to

196
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,510
like defend myself if I ever have to

197
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,560
because if you guys don't know this

198
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,810
about me I have a Taser I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

203
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,479

204
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,710
haven't had time the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years</font>

205
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,000
to do it but I've had a gun for a while

206
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,810
and I'm not overly about like the right

207
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,340
to bear arms type of stuff like I don't

208
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what my my one hundred percent</font>

209
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:28,780
stances on the right to bear arms and

210
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,190
stuff like that and having guns and gun

211
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,530
control and all that but I have certain

212
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,840
weapons small weapons legal weapons that

213
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,669
I carry with me because I'm a small

214
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:37,689
female who

215
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,879
also has a very public career and has

216
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,619

231
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,579

232
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,349
makeup that I've always hated and I

233
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,869
either go like drugstore brand that is

234
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:15,879
like doesn't test on animals or I go

235
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,219
like NYX and<font color="#E5E5E5"> NYX is like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lower-tier</font>

236
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">brand that's like really affordable but</font>

241
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:32,289
lip stuff but otherwise it's just like

242
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:34,809

like one of my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beauty youtubers</font>

252
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,819

253
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,649
bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have our and</font>

255
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,829
lens that I was trying but I really

256
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:03,789
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get her look and that's</font>

257
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:04,839
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's frustrating me</font>

258
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,759
right now here we go tangential Tara

259
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what you should call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me going off</font>

260
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,039
on a tangent is that uh I can't get the

261
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,389
look I want no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what like no</font>

262
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,949
matter how high quality the look is I

263
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,179
can't get the lighting right or

264
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:17,619
something I feel like it's something

265
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,689
with how high my ring light is or how

266
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,629
like far away my ring light is but I get

267
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,309
these like weird shadows on my face<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

268
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:25,959
don't exist and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get that like</font>

269
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,469
overall like blurry skin tone that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

270
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,389
just should get with a good lens and the

271
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,009
right settings and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't know the</font>

272
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,629
settings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay keeps saying like bring</font>

273
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:36,039
one of your photographer friends over to

274
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,659
deal with it but like they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

275
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,458
anything about videography or the exact

276
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,259
look that I want maybe they do maybe I'm

277
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,759
just feeling like I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to pay</font>

278
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,350
them or it would just be a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

279
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,300
or i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do a shoot or i don't</font>

280
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">know why i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling apprehensive about</font>

281
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,720
doing that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really should because i</font>

282
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,440
want

283
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,240
look that I want and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm never going to</font>

284
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop the fucking pursuit of perfection</font>

285
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,310
of my fucking production quality that I

286
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,990
have so yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing that's</font>

287
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,210
been bothering me anyway so I went out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

288
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,820
got some makeup I got my nails done and

289
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,410
my toes they're both black but these are

290
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,450
pointy and the other ones aren't I've

291
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,390
liked them so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they really hinder</font>

292
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,800
me play like playing a game on a

293
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,600
keyboard or typing it's awful when I

294
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,060
type like especially on my fucking awful

295
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,190
ass fucking laptop keyboard I'm just

296
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,960
like I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't even have</font>

297
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,340
fucking fingers I feel like I like these

298
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,290
hooves and restriction somewhat face

299
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,790
rolling on the keyboard and I keep

300
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,070
somehow hitting caps lock while I'm

301
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,870
hitting shift and it like completely

302
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,580
does the exact opposite of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

303
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,560
it makes me want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die so I don't know</font>

304
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">if I'm going to keep doing them like</font>

305
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,860
this but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really do like the kind of</font>

306
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">edgy feel and the like actual protection</font>

307
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,060
and the fact that i can just scratch

308
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,580
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can like oh just like you</font>

309
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,140

310
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,180
amazing uh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of I don't like it</font>

311
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,740
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I hate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on them before</font>

312
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,630
but I like them anyway so after that I

313
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,850
went tanning and then Jay calls me and

314
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,860
he goes we're actually gonna do my

315
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,110
ceremony today and I'm like are you

316
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,670
fucking kidding me so he's gonna

317
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,120
actually be like ushered in as a as a

318
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,160
naturalized US citizen that same day

319
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,750
even though they say that usually it's

320
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,770
going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of weeks before</font>

321
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,850
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually bring you back for the</font>

322
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,470
ceremony and he doesn't know how many

323
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are gonna be there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's like</font>

324
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,250
worried like his worries are so retarded

325
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,200
sometimes like oh my god like he was

326
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,390
worried that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might actually see</font>

327
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have these like pieces of tape on</font>

328
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,230
my face and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look kind of swollen</font>

329
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,780
and think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I am being beaten by him</font>

330
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,070
and I'm his girlfriend or wife or

331
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,480
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then not give him a</font>

332
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,640
citizenship and I'm like Jay when he's

333
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,140
like it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter if it's not</font>

334
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,120
probable I know it's not probable but

335
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
like at the same time what if it

336
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,410
happened and I'm like oh and like he was

337
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,330
telling me<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some people bring their</font>

338
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,670
lawyer to their naturalization like

339
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,680
tests and stuff and like that's probably

340
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,820
why because sometimes they can be

341
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,530
assholes and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling me about how</font>

342
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,210
some chick who gave him<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test was</font>

343
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,280
like a huge bitch for no reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

344
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,050
just like oh come on just let me come so

345
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,790
I was waiting in the car and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like</font>

346
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,870
whatever he's like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even care</font>

347
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,130
about this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that big of a deal</font>

348
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,140
whatever you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait and blah blah</font>

349
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,600
blah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like okay i'll just wait if</font>

350
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,860
it's not a big deal to you that I'm

351
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,290
there like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge like it's a</font>

352
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,270
milestone for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who like</font>

353
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,100
he came over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having like a</font>

354
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,200

355
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,030
u.s. bombing them so he came<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here</font>

356
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,080
on on a fucking visa<font color="#E5E5E5"> a travel visa or</font>

357
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,160
something and then stayed because of

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,140
asylum right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because his country was</font>

359

363
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,030
handles it the way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would handle it</font>

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">very rationally and it's like us on the</font>

people who are like now living<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

391
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,500
American dream because they were able to

<font color="#E5E5E5">be naturalized through like this long</font>

393
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,820
harrowing process of awfulness you know

been wanting to put makeup on I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I need to do I'm</font>

493
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:38,620
actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get my boobs upgraded</font>

494
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,240
on october and that was another thing I

495
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,999
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do at the at the surgery date</font>

496
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:44,620
I wanted to actually schedule that and I

497
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a lot of you guys don't like why</font>

498
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,499
would you get bigger boobs why would you

499
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:49,149
upgrade your boobs well every eight to

500
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,740
ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> years it's very important that you</font>

501
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that because they could start to leak</font>

502
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,949
because of wear and tear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

503
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:55,749
saline implants which I couldn't get

504
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:57,309
silicone because I wasn't 21 when I got

505
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:59,410
them and silicone implants are just far

506
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,180
better they feel better<font color="#E5E5E5"> they hold up</font>

507
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,949
longer they're just infinitely better in

508
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:04,360
every way and they have like stride

509
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,040
they've come strides in the last eight

510
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">years that I've had these implants in</font>

511
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,759
technology for implants I'm really

512
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,379
excited to get new ones and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

513
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,300
important to me that I do before I move

514
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,949
to Vegas because I want the same surgeon

515
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:16,600
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just doing it because I want</font>

516
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,980
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get bigger I wouldn't be doing that</font>

517
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,870
if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the case and I'm having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

518
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,120
few other just like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

519
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,339
fixes here and there but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

520
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:25,749
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> over with before I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traveled so</font>

521
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,189
everything is just like falling<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

522
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:28,180
place I want to go to a dermatologist

523
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,069
just to make sure my moles are all in

524
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:31,809
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> because for like a long time I did</font>

525
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,879
a lot of tanning bed stuff which I don't

526
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">do anymore and yeah I'm just really</font>

527
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,769
happy to be back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was my week</font>

528
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,870
just a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lounging around and doing</font>

529
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,069
absolutely nothing and I didn't do

530
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,079
anything for fourth of July but it's

531
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,870
funny because the part in lightning

532
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,970
returns where there's like fireworks and

533
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,040
you're in like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the use non area</font>

534
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,600
where snow is and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

535
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,579
fireworks festival that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening in</font>

the balcony door open and excuse me and

538
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,279
you can hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fireworks from the lake</font>

539
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we live kind of close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a lake</font>
