00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,799
skeptical at first about doing that

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,570
because I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe they</font>

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,739
participate in the actual magic

103
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,329

105
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:47,859

106
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:49,930
on when I could draw enough man and I

107
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,609
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any card draw card cards I</font>

108

didn't have anything like that that

109
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,380
would kind of circumvent damage that I

110
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,730
would get from just sitting there trying

111
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw lands but I don't have any lands</font>

112
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,810
