some<font color="#CCCCCC"> advice on what I should change</font>

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,640

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,579
asking me is why is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter account</font>

21
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,230

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,530
story what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I on my birthday</font>

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,510
I was having some guy that was like spam

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,770
messaging me um like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure some</font>

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,030
of you are familiar with it there's like

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,680

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,740
really awful from like before i even had

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,509
boobs but it's like some chick with

29
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,430
boobs and it's not actual porn it's just

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,220
like pouring like Sir whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

31

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,119
appreciate when people post it because

33
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,560
it's slandered but anyway he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,509
calling me a whore and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like posting</font>

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:28,710
it everywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was fine cuz i</font>

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,509
blocked him but then after<font color="#CCCCCC"> i blocked him</font>

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,890
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> started spamming all of my friends</font>

38
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,140
with it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i reported abuse to Twitter</font>

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,780
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter replied to me and was like</font>

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,820
can I have more instances of this so we

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,150
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> like regulate the site better or</font>

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,649
whatever so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally sent them like</font>

43
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,060
50 links or something from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy just</font>

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,630
harassing me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and um and they replied to</font>

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,920
me and they're like okay well his

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,540
Twitter account has been banned you

47
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,979
shouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

48
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,680
then the second after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got that email I</font>

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,030
got a Twitter message saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

50
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,689
banned at for harassing other people so

51
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,750
the only rationalization I can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

52
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,870
from that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this idiots working at</font>

53
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,120
Peter thought that the at tara babcock

54
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,519
was the one harassing not the at

55
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,849
whatever bitch that was talking shit

56
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,580
about me you know so he accidentally

57
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,110
blocked me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'm not getting any</font>

58
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,500
correspondence back even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,480
replied with all the details as to why I

60
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,010
shouldn't have been banned and how it

61
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,599
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a misunderstanding and I also did</font>

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,180
the regular protocol to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to becoming</font>

63
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,970
unbanned because um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like and she</font>

64
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,670
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> because um you when you get</font>

65
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">suspended on Twitter it's not permanent</font>

66
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,750
usually and there's nothing that I've

67
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,099
ever done wrong on Twitter like Twitter

68
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,690

70
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not in the the background</font>

71
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,409
the header or the profile<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture you</font>

can post any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing like porn or</font>

73
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,040
anything that's why there's actually a

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,379
setting that says do not show mature

75
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:10,629
content without you know warning you

76
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,310

just said like my pizza's already I said

107
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,080

whatever I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just leave it so then um</font>

111
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,289
basically the first day you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys can't</font>

112
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:37,250
see me right now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

113
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">dark but basically the first day they</font>

114
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:43,219
deleted my account because I can only

115
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:44,719
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they think that I'm like</font>

116
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:48,469
fake like not a person or something

117
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:49,909
because a lot of people were accusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

118
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,349
of being a fake profile but I think

119
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,599
that's hilarious that like it's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

120
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:57,110
guess unheard of someone like me I guess

121
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,389
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to have profile like</font>

122
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,060
that because yeah I mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first day I</font>

123
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,889
had it for one day before<font color="#E5E5E5"> they banned it</font>

124
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,300
and I got literally like fucking 50

125
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,400
messages in like six hours or something

126
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,650
I don't know like when I woke up I had

127
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,810
like so many I don't know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

128
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">weird i'm really tired but yeah I wanted</font>

129
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you guys about the twitter thing</font>

130
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,819
because literally everyone has been just

131
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,129
like asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> me like crazy i should get</font>

132
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,440
the twitter account back but i have had

133
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,779
some fans tell me that they've had

134
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems with twitter where Twitter</font>

135
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,259
doesn't respond and fix their issues

136
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,069
within like a month which would suck<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

137
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,849
really hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I get it back because</font>

138
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:36,919
it's like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of letting you</font>

139
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,210

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,949
most followers and everything it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

141
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:45,589

142
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,810
just be on my Facebook fan page which

143
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,569
you can find in the description um it's
