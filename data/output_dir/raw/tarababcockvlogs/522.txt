00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
hey guys I am sweating my fucking ass

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,080
off I think you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell that</font>

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,790
like this whole area here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,280
sweating so I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go dab off</font>

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,070
before i go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to F&M but um I want to talk</font>

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,139
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about the few comments that</font>

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,340
I saw where people were saying that I'm

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,730
selling out or something uh or that I've

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed it all which is kind of weird I</font>

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">know okay so to preface this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say that I understand where people</font>

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,320
are coming from what they say just

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ignore the haters don't respond to them</font>

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,279
it makes them go away or you know if it

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,330
doesn't bother you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

16
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,260
talk about it you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna ignore</font>

17
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,510
it and that's all well and fine for

18
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,680
someone who's in high school and who's

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,660
insecure and who is getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

20
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,440
bullying it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great motto it's a great</font>

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,690
philosophy to live by if you are just a

22
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,190
person who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get by and not</font>

23
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,750
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> let people bother you but that</font>

24
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,820
stuff doesn't bother me anyway um what I

25
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,550
want to do with my public forum is to

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,230
kind of give people a perspective like a

27
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,309
different perspective because a lot of

28
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in my position or a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,510
who are models or who are sexy or

30
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,890
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their bodies whether or</font>

31
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,609
not they're comfortable with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

32
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:00,780
bodies if they show their bodies off

33
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,940
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a place</font>

34
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,830
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about why they do it or</font>

35
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,450
why it's okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just like a</font>

36
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,580
widespread stigma that anyone who shows

37
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,650
up their body is like shallow or a

38
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,240
terrible person or<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in it for the</font>

39
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,900
money etc selling out yada yada um so

40
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,939
you know maybe I'll shed some light on

41
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,650
some stuff some people might change

42
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,450
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> minds if not at least one person</font>

43
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,189
will kind of get where I'm coming from

44
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand that wow maybe I wasn't</font>

45
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,930
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the full spectrum of</font>

46
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,790
why people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do things and maybe this</font>

47
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,890
person isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stereotype and I know</font>

48
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,390
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to stereotype people so</font>

49
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,829
I don't blame people who come<font color="#E5E5E5"> into my</font>

50
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,240
channel and think like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh another stupid</font>

51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,150
whore but um I kind of want to give

52
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">people at different perspectives so</font>

53
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,150
maybe they can think twice before they

54
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,100
just start to come in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be toxic to</font>

55
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,590
people because you know it creates an

56
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,259
ugly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and unattractive atmosphere for</font>

57
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,490
other girls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

58
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,049
I'm the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes other girls not</font>

59
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,130
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the entertainment</font>

60
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">business or not want to get into gaming</font>

61
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,360
but really it's people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are putting</font>

62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,710
people down without even knowing them

63
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,630
and there's no possible way for anyone

64
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,820
to know me based on just entering my

65
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,200
video and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then making some assumptions</font>

66
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,520
and a lot of the assumptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

67
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,140
make it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear that they haven't</font>

68
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,758
watched more than 10 minutes of any of

69
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">my videos ever but um okay so let's</font>

70
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,890
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

71
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,990
selling out I've always talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex</font>

72
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,490
I've always been sexy I've always had a

73
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,050
lot of fucking cleavage that's just

74
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,180
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> been something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I do that I</font>

75
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,590
love because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm comfortable my body I</font>

76
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,300
love my<font color="#E5E5E5"> body I work hard on my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> body so</font>

77
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,520
why would I not show it off I'm a model

78
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
I've always just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this it's not</font>

79
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything new so I don't know why</font>

80
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,280
everyone is acting<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's something</font>

81
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,560
that's new second of all um selling out

82
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,660
is more like someone has a passion they

83
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,070
start up a business or let's say let's

84
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,380
use a rock band as an analogy right so

85
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,300
someone has a rock<font color="#CCCCCC"> band and they really</font>

86
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,970
love have a heavy<font color="#CCCCCC"> metal growling that is</font>

87
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,500
not everyone's cup of tea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

88
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,420
that's their passion<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and then in</font>

89
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,220
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more money they decide to</font>

90
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,840
go mainstream and start doing singing

91
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,269
and start doing papi sounding like you

92
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">know albums and stuff in order to get</font>

93
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,050
more money in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more fans and</font>

94
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,280
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of following their passion</font>

95
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,959
they've changed their direction in a way

96
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,190
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more profitable to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

97
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,690
and that is the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason they're</font>

98
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,459
doing it that sure would be called

99
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,440
selling out now you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know</font>

100
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,570
all of the reasons behind why someone

101
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,310
would change their style or change their

102
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,470
sound like for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> Slipknot changed</font>

103
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,090
their sound a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot because Corey Taylor</font>

104
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,380
like blew his voice out or something

105
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,150
that had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get surgery so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

106
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,530
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons or maybe they're just</font>

107
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,329
tastes changed and they like the new

108
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,040
taste you have to see things<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all</font>

109
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,239
different angles instead of like

110
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,190
criticizing someone in a way that's

111
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,540
malicious like you can say i don't

112
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">really like Slipknot's new sound but to</font>

113
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,470
say like those fucking pieces of shit

114
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,180
sold out they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> love metals are no</font>

115
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,459
real metal artists like that's just it's

116
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,410
toxic and it makes no sense like if it

117
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,680
if it bothers you don't pay attention to

118
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">them because by talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about them</font>

119
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,400
you're giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them more popularity</font>

120
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,410
you're not actually deterring them from

121
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,120
doing anything you're just you know

122
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,370
feeding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire so to speak so every</font>

123
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,540
single person<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes into my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

124
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,420
and is it on approving of it I actually

125
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a few people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are like</font>

126
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,840
subscribe to my channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

127
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,340
literally post on every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single video</font>

128
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,320
about how much of a whore i am if you

129
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,570
want me to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supporting me</font>

130
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,890
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually supporting me by</font>

131
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,540
watching my videos so thank you very

132
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">much but it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes so much more</font>

133
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,630
sense to go on with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life and be</font>

134
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,400
more positive because you have this

135
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,260
negativity inside you and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

136
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,730
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out on others you're</font>

137
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,810
obviously not a very happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

138
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,640
because most people who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like me</font>

139
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,978
will just not spend the time to watch me

140
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,570
over and over again every single day you

141
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,310
know what I'm saying so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta look</font>

142
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,810
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things from different angles</font>

143
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,419
me I am doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm passionate about</font>

144
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,669
I fucking love my<font color="#E5E5E5"> body I love sex so</font>

145
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,230
fucking much it's my favorite pastime if

146
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,520
not my<font color="#E5E5E5"> second favorite pastime because</font>

147
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,860
gaming gaming and sex are like on the

148
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,389
same level if i could be having sex with

149
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone while playing games and do that</font>

150
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,470

providing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoying the</font>

that makes no sense every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

207
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,289
producer wants their videos to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> viewed</font>

208
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,030
now where I have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this is</font>

209
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,070
when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing like over the</font>

210
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,930
top titles

211
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,850
and thumbnails that are not related to

212
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the video at all for instance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tobyturner is a friend of mine Tobuscus</font>

214
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,440
you guys probably know him he's pretty

215
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,960
big on YouTube but his vlog channel is

216
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,669
literally like hot girls in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hot tub</font>

217
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,889
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then like pictures of like naked</font>

218
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:51,770
naked but like bikini clad models in a

219
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,210
hot tub and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you watch the video and</font>

220
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,710
it's three<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes of him talking about</font>

221
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,169
his new you know segment somewhere else

222
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and like a second of him turning toward</font>

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,520
a fucking hot tub<font color="#CCCCCC"> with no hot girls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

224
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
it whatsoever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

225
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,060
he had a girl over earlier it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

226
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,440
literally the most misleading shit in

227
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world or like Trisha Paytas she will</font>

228
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,340
post a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she will say</font>

celebrities I've slept<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and she'll</font>

230

talk about the celebrity she slept<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

231
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,740
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be one minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of like</font>

232
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,800
a 40 minute video now with me if I say

233
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,990
spit or swallow my whole video except

234
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,340
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first two minutes probably and</font>

235
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,020
maybe the last 50 seconds are going to

236
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,639
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it's gonna be about spitting</font>

237
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,810
and swallowing like that's what it's

238
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,389
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be about i 100% give you</font>

239
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,740
gratuitous titles with gratuitous

240
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,229
content at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact same level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

241
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,389
not misleading anyone whatsoever I love

242
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,160
the topics that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about I'm</font>

243
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,810
not doing anything for more money like

244
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,460
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> always say you dress up like that</font>

245
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,960
for money you use your body for money I

246
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,780
use my body for money i'm using my my

247
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,930
intelligence my humor my sexuality my

248
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,940
body everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have I'm giving</font>

249
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,320
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the form of content</font>

250
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,760
because I feel comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so and</font>

251
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,740
I enjoy doing it and I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

252
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,120
can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a career out of it yes because</font>

253
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,280
every content producer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fucking</font>

254
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,680
world wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a career</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of what</font>

255
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,960
doing what they love and you can tell

256
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,340
the difference between someone who makes

257
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">misleading content who doesn't really</font>

258
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,610
like doing it who's uncomfortable with

259
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,080
it and someone who's just you know

260
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,789
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enlighten the world trying to</font>

261
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">share things I already know my opinions</font>

262
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,360
on everything the reason I'm saying

263
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,250
these things in a video is to show you

264
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,690
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and to share it with you guys</font>

265
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,300
and to hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe I entertain and</font>

266
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,970
educate someone out there and you know

267
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be useful to someone or that</font>

268
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,449
it will brighten someones day or that

269
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,039
someone will have an epiphany because of

270
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,570
it or anything it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have to</font>

271
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,690
be so calculated and such a big of a

272
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,399
difference just making someone smile

273
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,899
making someone laugh that's you know why

274
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,250
I make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the content not to like hear</font>

275
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,779
myself talk I<font color="#CCCCCC"> normally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even watch</font>

276
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,820
my vlogs I find myself to be kind of

277
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,490
annoying and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cup</font>

278
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,050
of tea but I do agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with most of the</font>

279
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,400
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say i just wish i could say</font>

280
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,930
them without<font color="#CCCCCC"> being so verbose and</font>

281
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,000
little more you know formulated and

282
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,740
intelligent and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I want to</font>

283
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,060
script all my videos but I would take

284
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,380
too much time artists write out a script

285
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,029
I would have to do it I cut it up

286
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,649
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just making it very you know</font>

287
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,839
like that you know visceral and visceral

288
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,880
response to things um so I hope that

289
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">clears things up a little bit I love sex</font>

290
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,810
I don't put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> sexy clothes just for the</font>

291
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">video I dress like this i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to F&M</font>

292
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,529
immediately after this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have</font>

293
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:14,940
to stop within a minute because jesus is

there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing wrong with being the way</font>

299
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,130
that i am and i am so secure in that

300
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,420
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm willing to share it with</font>

301
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,860
