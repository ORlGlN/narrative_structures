00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
hey guys I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would do a quick</font>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,640
yeah I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would do a quick vlog</font>

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,170
before Wesley comes over and we're gonna

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">stream and then J Wesley and I are gonna</font>

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,190
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a magic draft tonight which should</font>

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,049
be fun but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to tell you guys about</font>

7
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,030
the ptq<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to a couple days ago</font>

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,100
since then I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been sick so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,039
been actually updating you guys as much

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">I should invoke form but the ptq was</font>

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,680
amazing for a few reasons first of all I

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,500
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> 501 in the first six rounds which</font>

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,830
was amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was playing at the second</font>

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,590
table everyone was watching my matches

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,910
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like standing around and I was</font>

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,200
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like the best people there</font>

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was at Table two twice and</font>

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,820
table for twice which is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,559
actual table but then they split it up

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,379
into like four sections so it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,579
the best people there with the best

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,190
matchups and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best results and I was</font>

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,600
there and I was winning and it was

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,030
amazing I was winning everything and

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,180
then I drew so what 501<font color="#E5E5E5"> means is five</font>

26
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,030
wins<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero losses one draw because it</font>

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,699
went to time so I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> holy shit I'm</font>

28
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,349
gonna make it to the top eight and maybe

29
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,750
you know what if I end up winning and I

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,130
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Pro Tour how amazing would</font>

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,720
that be right and so like I had all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,850
like adrenaline I was really hyped and I

33
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,830
was like okay usually I go like 20 or 30

34
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,390
before I start bombing the tournament

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">but today I went 501 oh my god so it was</font>

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the most amazing feeling ever like</font>

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,860
literally um when my opponent<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

38
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,180
shuffling a long time we're taking a

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,740
long time to sideboard I was daydreaming

40
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,049
about winning and going to the Pro Tour

41
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,200
and being like ultra super popular in

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,450
like the magic community and making mono

43
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue a thing again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just like Oh was</font>

44
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,409
so amazing feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the last</font>

45
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">three rounds of course I totally bomb I</font>

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,549
miss play like crazy i do some stupid

47
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:44,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">shit like okay I had um domesticated</font>

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,500
this guy's voice um voice of resurgence

49
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,780
or whatever and when it dies the

50
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,060
controller gets a token and when I got

51
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">the token I didn't remember to evolve my</font>

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,920
unevolved cloud fins and all he had was

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,899
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> four life left and if I had done</font>

54
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,399
that I would've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to attack over</font>

55
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,049
his things on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ground and win the</font>

56
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,909
game and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the type of it that</font>

57
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,310
the types of Miss plays that I do when

58
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,140
I'm like freaked out because I'm winning

59
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,500
too much so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really sad about that</font>

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,720
my friend Wesley who you've seen in

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,150
Allah

62
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,120
of my gaming videos recently and my

63
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,180
streams he placed fifth so he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in top</font>

64
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,730
eight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then lost the first match he</font>

65
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,470
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the top eight which sucked but</font>

66
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,019
it's whatever and he didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on</font>

67
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:27,159
the play and stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

68
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,709
sucked but he's really really good at

69
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">magic and it was nice being able to play</font>

70
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,519
next to him and my record he was like 51

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,349
and I was 501 so my record is better

72
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,510
than his and I was like holy shit what

73
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,950
if we're playing in the top eight that

74
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,459
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking amazing um I think this</font>

75
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,250
weekend i'll be going to spokane for

76
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,379

77
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,480
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> seattle ptq but not as easy as a</font>

78
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,459

<font color="#E5E5E5">and I can't really figure out a way to</font>

98
