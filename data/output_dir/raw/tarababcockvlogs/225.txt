00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,260
around him waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for him to finish so</font>

the same size

46
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,650

51
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,349
though this would be like the equivalent

52
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,690
of us eating like a whole pizza or

53
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,299
something because he's so tiny

54
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,180
