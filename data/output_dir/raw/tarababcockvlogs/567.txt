9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,260
the group other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay who didn't get</font>

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come because he didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,439
passport because he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a US citizen</font>

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and therefore would have to go to his</font>

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">embassy which is in Chicago which would</font>

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,380
suck and be really expensive so Jay

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,450
didn't come he also had work on sunday

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,469
so it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really possible so we drive</font>

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,510
down there some funny stuff happens at

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,129
the border or I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nacho I'm like</font>

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,719
vlogging and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking it seriously you</font>

20

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,350
cool-looking it's kind of like a a

24
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,609
slightly different slightly weird

25
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,710
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Seattle that supposedly as</font>

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,840
dangerous as New York which I highly

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
doubt because it seemed like everyone

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really nice there were a lot of</font>

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,409
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> indie looking things than any</font>

30
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking people a lot more attractive</font>

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
people not and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't like American</font>

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
attractive it's like once in a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,270
see American attractive like I guess I

34
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,590
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered American attractive</font>

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,799
we're like they've done a lot to look

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,810
good and they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that whole</font>

37
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,880
just like natural look everyone in

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,369
Vancouver is kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like they look</font>

39
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,290
good because they're not fat and they're

40
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,960
not like gluttonous or something which

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">is cool there are a lot of asians a lot</font>

75
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,700
too scandalous and I can't tell you

76
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,540
about it because it would incriminate

77
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,579
people so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much what i'm</font>

78
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,780
going to say every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time something</font>
