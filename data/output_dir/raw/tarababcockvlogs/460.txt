00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,640
a workaholic and other points I'm like a

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,860
lazy workaholic so everything has to be

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,680

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,420
Tara Reid's comments because<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I</font>

31
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,160
record Tara Reid's comments and it takes

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 25 minutes to record and then</font>

33
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,210
cutting out everything to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more</font>

34
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,950
comedic and to actually just cut out the

35
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,990
time so I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm scrolling or</font>

36
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,090
the times that I like mess up and like

37
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,979
say something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then like stutter and</font>

38
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,930
it doesn't it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that takes like</font>

39
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,600
a whole of like 45 minutes so 25 minutes

40
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,189
of recording plus another 45 minutes

41
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,710
plus the rendering plus the uploading

42
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,810
plus I have to do the gaming video and

43
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,299
I've been waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so my</font>

44
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,400
first shipment of groceries so I got

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,530
like a grocery service service that

46
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,720
sends it to you through safeway<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,270
chose a four-hour window because I

48
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,320
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it would be perfectly fine</font>

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,909
to have a four-hour window but today

50
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,979
happened to be the day that I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,570
record videos in the other room so I

52
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,070
wouldn't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door so i couldn't i</font>

53

57
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,829

120
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,829
I was a very horny preteen and we had

121
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,109
sex in my my room and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents house</font>

122
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it didn't last very long or</font>

123
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,849
something and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from then on we had</font>

or something and it was a terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

126
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,099
but his name was casey he was a really

127
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">sweet boy he made me drawings and we</font>

128
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,940
like the same rock<font color="#E5E5E5"> music and we liked</font>

129
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,529
the same video games and he was kind of

130
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,130
like a cute popular rocker guy

131
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,480
and I treated<font color="#E5E5E5"> him really poorly because</font>

132
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,420
back then I didn't I was like I didn't

133
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the same moral compass that I had</font>

134
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,360
back then I don't have I didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

135
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,520
same logic I let my emotions to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

136
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
best of me I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 years fucking old</font>

137
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,800
but I was beyond my years in most

138
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,480
aspects I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I handled that</font>

139
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,270
relationship better than a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

140
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,670
handle their relationships at 18 but

141
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,850
still I have progressed very far and I'm

142
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,100
not an asshole like I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

143
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,920
next one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I want you to taste my dick</font>

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,090
tase anyone's dick that's hilarious I

147
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,070
really hate my camera because it tells

148
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,660
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have full charge on my battery</font>

149
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then 10 seconds into recording it</font>

150
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,320
tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have like my batteries are</font>

151

154
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,000
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> see into someone's personality</font>

155
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,740
just by looking at someone like there's

156
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,360
no possible way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to distinguish Tara from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">some dumb big boobed blonde bimbo until</font>

sweet because he says it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font>

161
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,110
like an offhanded compliment but still a

162
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,970
compliment nonetheless he meant well so

pepper spray handle so it doesn't spray

172
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,400

<font color="#CCCCCC">of men don't really understand how easy</font>

174

it is to rape molest just harass a woman

175

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up to you and talk to you so</font>

197
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a small stature to have something</font>

205
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,430
say that my eyes are red some people

206
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,260
have asked if I've cried but I don't cry

207

every single video or ever so that's

208
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,850
kind of weird I don't know why it might

209
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,420
be because I boost the the color a

210
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,000
little bit in post-production so maybe

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,560
it's just looking Pinker that it is I

212
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have any problems with anything it</font>

213
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,740

230
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,150
attribute to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of redness that</font>

231
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,700
I'm not noticing so that's that I don't

237
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,790
attracted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way guys think and</font>

238
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,820
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what makes a friend and then they</font>

239
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,960
end up settling down with a girl who

240
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,220
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think like them and they think</font>

241
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's okay and to me that's kind of</font>

242
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,850
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like wrong with</font>

243
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,260
traditions<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you want someone that</font>

244
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,750
thinks a lot like you or that has the

245
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,520
same like you know someone you can get

246
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">along with someone that doesn't make you</font>

247
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,280
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you need a guys night out or</font>

248
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,390
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't make you feel like</font>

249
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,070
they're nagging all the time or they

250
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,540
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like anything that you like so um</font>

251
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,090
that's where I got that like I don't

252
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">really feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I need to act like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

253
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,550
lady I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

254
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,959
act the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to act and I'll find</font>

255
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,180
people and gravitate around people who

256
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,190
act the same way I do and if there's a

257
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,600
girl who's super girly I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like she</font>

258
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,339
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a guy who's metrosexual</font>

259
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:02,540
and it's just like how it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

260
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,370
because otherwise you end up finding

261
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,560
solace in your friends and missing

262
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,580
something in your life because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

263
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,959
not with your best friend and I think

264
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,670
you should marry your best friend and if

265
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,200
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck some girl who's only</font>

266
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,670
into Gucci and Prada in high heels and

267
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,269
talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this then you should but you</font>

268
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,920
shouldn't marry that person and then

269
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,779
expect to be happy in a happy marriage

270
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:22,010
anyway that got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little deeper than it</font>

271
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,100
should have the next one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how</font>

272
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,110
tall are you Tara and also just six foot

273
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,000
not to be rude or anything but that

274
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,220
isn't very<font color="#CCCCCC"> tall at all and i really like</font>

275
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,690
i like Tara Reid's comments because I

276
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,040
get to actually show this I don't know

277
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,360
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this at all i'm going to</font>

278
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to make it focus on this but this</font>

279
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,990
person who's saying this is literally

280
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">one year old in a picture with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his one</font>

282
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,880
6-foot is not very tall he is clearly

283
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,010
like four foot five because he's in

284
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,170
first grade and it's ridiculous that

285
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,550
people post things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's like</font>

286
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,990

pegged by a woman I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's cool and</font>

310
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,500

little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit in a sexual way not in any</font>

319

kind of regular way as you guys know you

320
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,480
