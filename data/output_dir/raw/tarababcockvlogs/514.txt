that soon I'm gonna do another

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,119
fanservice fashion show because I have

haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> made any fan service for a while</font>

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,890
so I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font>

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,080
what you deserve for being so supportive

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,510
of me and my channels both also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,098
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a schedule change for both</font>

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,540
of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube channels i will be</font>

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,180
uploading content at 3pm PST from now on

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,700
not 7 p.m. PST and that's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wake</font>

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,989
up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the day or in the</font>

20
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,820
evening and have no time at all to do my

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,890
vlogs and do my gaming stuff and then

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">upload it before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to stream or</font>

23
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,809
before 7pm so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i end up uploading random</font>

24
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,719
shit at like midnight or you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of the night when nobody is up</font>

26
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,210
and then it gets overshadowed by other

27
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,180
people's content filling up the new

28
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,370
content page of<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone all my</font>

29
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,600
subscribers and stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just</font>

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,829
doesn't make any sense it makes sense to

31
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,989
publish things in the middle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day</font>

32
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,320
PSC and not really really late at night

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">or in the middle of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the night because</font>

34
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,229
then people end up just missing it and

35
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sucks but today my topic is going</font>

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,299
to be my future the future where see

37
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,479
myself in 5 to 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a</font>

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,670
viewer suggested topic and I'm like hell

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,770
yeah let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it my eyes look really</font>

40
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,330
fucking green today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have made no</font>

41
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,140
changes it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the</font>

42
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">eyeshadow I'm wearing today that it</font>

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,450
makes them look<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great of that so</font>

44
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,530
something I think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool about</font>

45
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">my eyes is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking change</font>

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,759
colors based on what's around them and

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,259
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> optical illusion obviously</font>

48
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,049
or based on you know how small my<font color="#E5E5E5"> ppls</font>

49
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,759
get because how much light is projected

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,280
onto my face or how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't because</font>

51
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,570
sometimes when the light is really low<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

52
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,460
can look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have gray or like even</font>

53
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,439
darker eyes which is pretty cool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,490
really like the colors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and shapes that</font>

55
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,240
can come in eyes I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh I don't know</font>

56
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,829
I keep forgetting the word I always

57
00:01:58,829 --> 00:01:59,939
forget the word like I hear this word

58
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,170
all the time I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> uses word so many times</font>

59
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,450
I always forget it it's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kate</font>

60
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">bosworth has a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of other people</font>

61
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,240
wear one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their eyes is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a different</font>

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,979
color than the other or there's some

63
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,080
kind of pigmentation issues where half

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,879
of the eye is hazel and the rest is blue

65
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,260
i think that shit is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so fucking</font>

66
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,830
beautiful and so

67
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,390
cool and I can't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> its genetic</font>

68
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,920
deformity there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

69
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">are like genetic deformities like having</font>

70
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,220
really really big boobs when you're thin

71
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,040
and small that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you</font>

72
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,170
actually you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of your boobs are</font>

73
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,670
made up of fat and you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as much</font>

74
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,530
breast tissue as you need so having an

75
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,420
abundance of breast tissue or fat on

76
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">your chest is actually I considered you</font>

77
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,820
know a genetic anomaly whereas a lot of

78
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,860
guys were like fuck yeah natural double

79
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,810
D's on a skinny girl which is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

80
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,190
rare and if they're telling you that

81
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,810
they're probably pushing them up in a

82
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,630
bra and they're actually fake um but

83
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,390
anyway so the future is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of funny</font>

84
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,130
like you watch older movies and you see

85
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,410
that people projected that we're gonna

86
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">have flying cars and a bunch of other</font>

87
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,400
crazy things as the norm like you watch

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,900
The Jetsons and you're like what the

89
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">fuck is going on here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not how it</font>

90
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,950
is right now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not how it's going</font>

91
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in 20 years or even a hundred</font>

92
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,660
probably and I don't know what's going

93
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,600
on just like um nobody really<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what</font>

94
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,250
is that going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become the norm and a</font>

95
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,810
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times I'll I really like studying</font>

96
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,650
um economy in business I did a little

97
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of that because uh something that's</font>

98
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,380
interesting to me is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have</font>

99
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,019
the most amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea but if you don't</font>

100
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,560
like create a need in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market for it</font>

101
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,670
people will be like oh that's too

102
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,260
advanced for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> or oh that's not really</font>

103
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,489
interesting and nobody will catch on it

104
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't become the next phenomenon and</font>

105
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,820
that's what's pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

106
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,040
companies like Apple and<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies like</font>

107
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">other that have other technological</font>

108
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,489
advances is that um they were able to

109
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the market right when the need arose</font>

110
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,700
like if you go like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred years back</font>

111
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,709
and you ask people<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they need this</font>

112
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,180
tablet that does everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font>

113
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,190
connect you to the world and you know

114
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,380
check the internet feel like oh that's

115
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,690
too futuristic for me i can't imagine

116
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,610
using that too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't imagine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

117
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,230
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine having a need for that oh</font>

118
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,910
my friends wouldn't use it so there's no

119
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,640
real need to have it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

120
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,260
when the iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> hits are when you know</font>

121
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,760
smartphones hit it was like the perfect

122
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone wanted that and</font>

123
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,459
desired that and then it kind of just

124
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,040
became an epidemic where every single

125
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,480
person has one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're fucking weird</font>

126
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,070
you know and there are certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

127
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,228
like that that people don't need in the

128
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,298
time so it's really hard to advanced

129
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,650
technologically because a lot of the

130
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,479
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do have the technology to</font>

131
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
do nobody would really buy it and it

132
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,030
would

133
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,400
be too expensive or it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know</font>

134
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,830
not necessary in the common household so

135
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,139
you know we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a flying car we can</font>

136
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,730
make hover crafts but nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

137
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,210
needs that right now we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

138
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Society for that yet and I think that's</font>

139
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,230
pretty cool so in the same sense as we

140
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really know what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

141
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,510
happening happening in a hundred years

142
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,010
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> people will need 100 years I</font>

143
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,570
feel the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about my own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

144
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,580
but as a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

145
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,930
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people try to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things like about</font>

146
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty girls are about girls who</font>

147
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,590
supposedly live off of their looks is

148
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,210
that like when they get older they're

149
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,260
going to be irrelevant to what are you

150
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,490
going to do when you can't model anymore

151
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,630
what are you going to do when you can't

152

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,560
about the actual careers that make money

279
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,620

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,730
only MMO and so like I saw it as that

305
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,890
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> like FPS and I never really</font>

306
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,650
liked FPS I was like meth no I got into

307
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,640
it I realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were people</font>

308
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,500
making content for other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

309
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,810
interacting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a fan base and I was</font>

310
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,940
like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my god this is what I want to do</font>

311
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,470
with my life and I'm glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

312
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,730
switched I'm glad that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not a</font>

313
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,770
full-time model despite you know the pay

314
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,720
cut and despite you know certain things

315
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,820
I guess it's just the pay cut pretty

316
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,050
much that I'm lacking because I don't

317
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really miss anything else I mean I i</font>

318
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:40,060
miss um I miss making time because if

319
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,530
all I was doing was modeling I miss

320
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,450
making time on the weekends or whichever

321
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,330
days I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a shoot to like do fun</font>

322
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,800
shoots like it did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atari shoot was</font>

323
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,960
one of my last fun shoes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

324
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a year and a half ago so I haven't</font>

325
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">done any fun modeling in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a while and</font>

326
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,030
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because all I've been doing is</font>

327
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,370
just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the ends</font>

328
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,500
meet that I can't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet with gaming</font>

329
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,140
so it's kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

330
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">make my gaming dreams come true and when</font>

331
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a little bit more time and a</font>

332
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,059
schedule that settled in and

333
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,679
the extra money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so I definitely</font>

334
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to start doing like like I always</font>

335
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:13,539
say a sexy MTG shoot or sexy gaming

336
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,699
shoots and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool</font>

337
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,189
locations that I choose and editing that

338
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:19,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make up that I do like all that</font>

339
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,879
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really excites me and that's</font>

340
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,499
what really got me into modeling but

341
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:24,849
then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you realize that you have to</font>

342
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,859
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jobs that pay a lot they aren't</font>

343
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:28,419
really as interesting it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really as</font>

344
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,059
interesting of a career choice and

345
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,469
gaming is always interesting even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it</font>

346
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:34,389
can feel like oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to stream</font>

347
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,819
today because I'm tired or oh this game

348
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:38,109
is really frustrating<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I had a lot</font>

349
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:39,519
of days like that with starcraft 2 where

350
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,929
everything was fucking frustrating<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

351
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:42,159
shit and I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to quit and it</font>

352
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,619
was like ah like it's so much more fun

353
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,389
and so much more me and so much more

354
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,059
rewarding than like anything I can do in

355
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:50,589
modeling and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad that I</font>

356
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:53,589
chose to you know just go for it and I

357
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,939
feel like everyone should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go for</font>

358
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,189
their dreams and I mean have a fallback

359
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,839
plan have something else have like

360
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,699
either schooling or another idea that

361
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pursue or you know some kind</font>

362
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">of classes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take on the side</font>

363
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you have something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

364
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,219
fall back on but like you should just

365
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,709
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do your best possible</font>

366
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,469
at making whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> dream you have come</font>

367
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,689
true that is obviously viable like you

368
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:20,139
maybe you don't become the<font color="#E5E5E5"> astronaut</font>

369
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,339
that you thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would be or the</font>

370
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:22,689
dinosaur these that you would be when

371
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:23,859
you were younger obviously because some

372
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,299
of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are impossible but</font>

373
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,519
anything that you think is even remotely

374
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible you should try it and you</font>

375
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,299
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be half-assed at it like I</font>

376
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,589
know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people are like oh I want</font>

377
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:33,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a youtuber oh I want to be a</font>

378
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,109
streamer and my friends are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

379
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:36,849
and they'll stream like once and be like

380
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,229
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> five viewers I'm not going to do</font>

381
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:40,089
it anymore and it's like okay well

382
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not going to work and you weren't</font>

383
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:42,669
cut out for it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't deserve it</font>

384
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,079
and that's really how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like if</font>

385
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,949
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it if</font>

386
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:46,509
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep it up if you're</font>

387
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:48,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">not gonna be consistent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

388
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:50,109
deserve it and you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

389
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,669
it and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get lucky enough to get it</font>

390
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,769
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get lazy like I have a friend</font>

391
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,929
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> has Minecraft videos that had over a</font>

392
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,039
million views and he just stopped

393
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,389
uploading to youtube and he could have

394
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,579
been something but he decided to just

395
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,109
you know work at chipotle or the fuck

396
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:04,239
he's doing her now and it's kind of sad

397
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,799
that he didn't just like push through

398
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and just continue making content</font>

399
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,629
and you know doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's much</font>

400
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,939
more you know fruitful in the long run

401
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:14,709
it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people are afraid to take</font>

402
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,979
chances and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sad</font>

403
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:20,289
because you know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of living</font>

404
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:20,950
proof that you can

405
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,520
do it so yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a my stance on that</font>
