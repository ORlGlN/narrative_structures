79
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,299
last Wednesday so I didn't do the

80
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,829

83
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,150
and so I've been sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of</font>

84
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">these hot lights for an hour and a half</font>

85
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,349
just talking about video games which is

86
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,900
fun and I love the end result but it can

87
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,760
be really really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to articulate what</font>

88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm talking about I pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much one of</font>

89
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,260
the reasons I love working for zooming

90
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,329
games besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> just being more in touch</font>

91
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,620
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainstream gaming community</font>

92
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,060
knowing all the gaming news and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font>

93
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,109
kind of stuff and because they're great

94
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,700
people is because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

95
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,560
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> at speaking so I'm like working</font>

96
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,910
really hard at that and I think I'm

97
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,319
getting better like today it didn't take

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,970
us along<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I didn't lose my voice as</font>

99
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,730
much and I didn't stutter as much and I

100
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,400
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do as many takes so over</font>
