10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,359

12
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,250

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,230
5pm every day instead of around 3 p.m.

14
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,599
everyday PST pacific standard time so

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,529
that's West Coast America basically I'm

16
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,800
doing this new<font color="#CCCCCC"> leg of like middle part</font>

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,210
I've never done a middle part in my hair

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,739
before hopefully my nipples<font color="#E5E5E5"> not coming</font>

19
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,840
out no it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool just looked like it</font>

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,890
was because the shirt was so tight

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,680
anyway um I did my FM video and I always

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,239
work up a sweat doing it I thought it's

23
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,890
really cold in here and it's so nice

24
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,809
because it's finally feeling like fall

25
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,579
even though it's technically not yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

26
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,120
it's like 73 and under now which makes

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,530
me so fucking happy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font>

28
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,899
understand how happy I feel and how much

29
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,370
more energetic I feel when it's not like

30
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,170
a hundred thousand billion degrees but

31
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,600
um as I've been saying I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,790
start doing more full screen content for

33
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,560
my gaming channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also going to</font>

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,420
start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of vlogs that you guys</font>

35
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,159
want to hear I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really feel like I</font>

36
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,360
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change much about my vlog</font>

37
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,040
channel other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the sound and</font>

38
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,600
the production quality is pretty good

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,950
and just keep listening to what you guys

40
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to hear in what you guys want to</font>

41
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,090
have me talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and get my opinion on</font>

42
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,920
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever some people are asking me</font>

43
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,090
some questions I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

44
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,759
I can do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole video on things like</font>

45
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,140
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel about men who cross</font>

46
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,240
dress like I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's your own</font>

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,590
prerogative if that's what you want to

48
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to do then</font>

49
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,439
you should do it but you guys know that

50
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really attracted to effeminate</font>

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,860
men so something like that will kind of

52
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,150
be a turnoff and you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

53
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,009
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of different other things that</font>

54
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it better for magic I'm</font>

55
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,960
still playing my blue red and soul deck

56
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,220
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotate out soon which kind</font>

57
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,630
of sucks I really enjoy playing

58
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,430
artifacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't enjoy playing</font>

59
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,799
something like an affinity so it can be

60
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,119
kind of weird and I don't know I don't

61
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,920
know what I'm going to do with my magic

62
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,079
standard decks after rotation i think

63
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,299
i'm still gonna be playing of course

64
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,710
merfolk for modern but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

65
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,149
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing with</font>

66
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,639
standard and it sucks because if absent

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,440
still becomes or still stay as prevalent

68
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,090
it's not that great<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me because i</font>

69
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,120
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing out</font>

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I'm sick of it it's boring it's like</font>

71
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,959
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone does when</font>

72
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,799
they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what they want to</font>

73
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:19,870
play<font color="#CCCCCC"> or if they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to just you have</font>

74
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,430
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Titan deck right now that's</font>

75
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,950
like the best I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of fun at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PAX</font>

76
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,480
I talked a lot about what I happen to

77
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,099
pax and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been having a great</font>

78
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,629
time playing video games I showed Jay

79
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:30,010
honey pop and I don't know if this

80
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,049
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like a gaming vlog usually if</font>

81
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:33,610
I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about games at all it's on the</font>

82
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,989
gaming channel to try to push people

83
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,099
toward the gaming channel you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like</font>

84
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,329
oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have full screen content i have</font>

85
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">blog content where I'm just talking</font>

86
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,959
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my day but I showed him honey pop</font>

87
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,239
and yeah we together figured out a bunch

88
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:44,170
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it that I didn't</font>

89
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,590
understand so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> honeypot videos um</font>

90
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,620
they're going to be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like until i</font>

91
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,440
get to a new series or a new day when

92
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,420
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not wearing the striped crop top</font>

93
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,609
it's going to be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad and I'm</font>

94
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,260
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad attic so I wasn't realizing</font>

95
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,090
a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I forgot with what</font>

96
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,250
each token does when i'm doing the dates

97
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened when i</font>

98
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,940
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex and I know I now know that</font>

99
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,769
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steam version i have to kind of</font>

100
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,450
sensor if i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up on YouTube</font>

101
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,299
but I will what else is going on with me

102
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,470
I've been working out every single day

103
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,169
as usual trying really hard to just do

104
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,630
that and stay tan and keep a routine

105
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,790
because once you get into understanding

106
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,290
the routine it's much easier to do as

107
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,150
opposed to when I took the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

108
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,799
break I didn't go to the gym I didn't

109
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,599
and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chilling on</font>

110
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,280
the couch and at that point i picked up

111
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,060
the bad habit of watching the office

112
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,400
from start to finish again the offices

113
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,660
of TV show if you guys haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen it</font>

114
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,239
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good it's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

115
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,549
mockumentary about working in an office

116
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:44,859
a paper company and there's also a

117
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,780
british version<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the british version</font>

118
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,500
is only like two<font color="#E5E5E5"> seasons and it's with</font>

119
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">ricky gervais sits why I found out about</font>

120
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and then I started watching the</font>

121
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:54,790
American one didn't like the American

122
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,959
one as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the british one at first</font>

123
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then I didn't like the british one</font>

124
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,660
as much as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> american one when i</font>

125
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,730
rewatched it and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> i rewatched</font>

126
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,980
is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm like really into a ricky</font>

127
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,199
gervais and karl Pilkington right now

128
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,829
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like British stuff and then I</font>

129
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,359
got into the office and the office is

130
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:11,709
like oh I took a cluster fuck you never

131
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,940
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get off the couch so that's what</font>

132
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,349
I'm spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of my free time doing</font>

133
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,690
other than playing a little bit of life

134
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,149
is strange which I stopped doing

135
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,130
recently I have to buy it sucks I

136
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,520
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone got me the whole</font>

137
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,740
series like first second third and

138
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">fourth episodes but only on the first</font>

139
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,539
episode so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> finished the first episode</font>

140
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:32,620
was like fuck I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to buy the other</font>

141
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,819
one so now I have to do that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

142
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">even know how is there like a bundle</font>

143
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i can buy through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a like two three</font>

144
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,660
and four and save money or do I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font>

145
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,250
them one by one since I<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have one</font>

146
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,020
and it wouldn't save me money since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

147
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,220
already had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I'm</font>

148
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,840
confused but that's basically what I'm

149
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,849
doing is creating content trying to

150
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:51,699

154
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,080
patreon rewards and stuff and goals i'm

155
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,669
just like pretty much all i'm using the

156
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,979
money for is 21 survive and to to

157
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,259

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,729
to give like the best rewards like

159
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,680
autographed images a bunch of posts

160
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,259
early access and just so like whatever I

161
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">can offer the viewers for just getting</font>

162
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to me and helping support me it's</font>

163
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,229
so amazing and I'm actually talking to

164
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the patreon staff about fixing and</font>

165
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,280
improving some things because there are

166
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,220
some things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a little wonky like</font>

167
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,069
they they charge people they charge

168
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,750
things as if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a credit purchase</font>

169
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,659
and so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a percentage that is</font>

170
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a fee for just like sliding a card</font>

171
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,830
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so bad for business in</font>

172
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,150
my opinion when you can just process

173
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,090
things through like PayPal or whatever

174
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,800
the fuck is going on and even when they

175
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,960
process paypal you have to have a credit

176
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,500
card<font color="#E5E5E5"> so people who are like wanna</font>

177
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,820
support if they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a credit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> card</font>

178
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,930
but they do have a paypal account like

179
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,880
the new guy he's been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get me</font>

180
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,319
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it out for a while they can't</font>

181
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,150
pledge which is like actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid</font>

182
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,620
because people who want to pledge can't

183
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,840
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I'm trying to give those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

184
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,759
who want to pledge the same rewards as

185
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,889
on patreon just like for no reason

186
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,240
because they're supporting me through

187
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,400
other avenues because patreon doesn't

188
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,240
get their shit together but they're

189
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,990
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and they're really</font>

190
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,120
interactive and the support team is

191
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been to as much</font>

192
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,180
magic as I'd like to in the past like

193
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,560
two weeks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there hasn't been that</font>

194
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,090
much and there's not that much standard

195
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,520
before the rotation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jays</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really sad</font>

196
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,960
because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't play his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> monoblock deck</font>

197
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,819
anymore but he has an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> he always</font>

198
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,319
those brews and he does really well with

199
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,340
him he's like the only person<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

200
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,080
that's not on a team<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can actually</font>

201
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a deck and do well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it he's</font>

202
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so fucking smart and cool I love it</font>

203
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,110
and I envy that but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to play</font>

204
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,660
someone else's deck

205
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,860
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it because then I</font>

206
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,470
can gauge<font color="#E5E5E5"> how well I'm doing I'm sorry</font>

207
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,840
that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is um gaming</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool because someone said that</font>

236
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,190
they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> listened to my videos and</font>

237
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,240
don't actually watch because they don't

238
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,260
have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> or they're doing other things</font>

239
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,760
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's really productive</font>

240
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,350
because you can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font>

241
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,300
productive while actually listening to

242
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,350
content of your favorite content
