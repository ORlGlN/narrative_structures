6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,790
wired so i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook it up to my pc so i</font>

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,630
five I know has been taking way too long

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,400
it's been like two weeks or something

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,109
but that game is scary you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have</font>

11
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,020
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of like serious mental drive</font>

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,310
in order to want to play that fucking

13
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,650
game it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so crazy and I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get lost</font>

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,390
because it disorients the shit out of

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,760
you but anyway I need the cord so i can

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,308
plug<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into the adapter so i can use my</font>

17
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,610
xbox controller because I don't know

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the ps3 controller seems a little</font>

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,800
bit dumb because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set it up as</font>

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,020
if it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xbox controller</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it really</font>

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,160
annoys the shit out of me<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,989
don't like the Xbox controller nearly as

23
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,940
much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like the ps3 controller</font>

24
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,260
there's a full moon I wonder if I

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">stopped the video every time I press one</font>

26
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,370
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the side buttons they like turn up</font>

27
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the volume it stops the fucking</font>

28
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">video it's so stupid i wish i could like</font>

29
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,160
screenshot everything i'm doing on my

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,069
phone so I could like capture gameplay I

31
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,200
think that'd be really cool but anything

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,310
you do on the iphone i don't know if

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,439

34
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,590
the video and this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

35
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,600
don't know why it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't stop to</font>

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">take breaths when I talk so like it's</font>

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,140
basically like walking and holding your

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,659
breath the same time and we're almost

39
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,759
surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> um what else is going on I've</font>

40
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:27,990
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> really annoyed at everything lately</font>

41
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,470
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

42
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,850

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,189
and i think i've just been mostly

49
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,899
annoyed that I don't feel motivated to

50
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">do things like especially when it's</font>

51
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,899
something that doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a time</font>
