00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,850
hey guys today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">my sponsors and what I require in order</font>

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,620
to take a sponsorship and I've been

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,850
wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this for a while because a</font>

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,349
lot of people have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> requesting it my</font>

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,080
mic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not facing me it fell over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway</font>

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,670
sorry about that a lot of people have

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,630
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> requesting it I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,189
understand why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people just want</font>

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,840
to you know know more about how YouTube

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,180
works or what kinds of things i'm into

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,500
and people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,359
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever so i thought i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I have full transparency with you</font>

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,059
guys and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see any reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I</font>

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,199
wouldn't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but the one</font>

17
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,150
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have to hold back is exactly</font>

18
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,460
how much money someone gives me<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,370
exact terms of my contract with certain

20
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,339
people but I only have two actual

21
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,500
sponsors like ongoing monthly

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,780
sponsorships and that is a sample box

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,930
and kinguin kinguin<font color="#E5E5E5"> an sample box both</font>

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,369
allow me to do giveaways which is

25
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:58,350
something I holy require like if you

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't allow me to give away free shit to</font>

27
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,680
my viewers that I'm not that interested

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,629
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that I require is that</font>

29
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,309
I'm actually interested in the service

30
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">when's amplivox first contacted me I</font>

31
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,540
kind of had I saw the social stigma

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,630
around vaping and I heard that it wasn't

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,520
too healthy but I decided to do my own

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,080
research because it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good deal and</font>

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> people think that that's</font>

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,370
selling out like every single person and

37
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,390
entertainment whether it's like a

38
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">football player a youtuber and actor</font>

39
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,220
actress unless they're like madly

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,870
wealthy off of every movie that they do

41
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,850
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have sponsors because they have to</font>

42
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,860
fucking eat they're like slaving over

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,870
their art but they still need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

44
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money in order to survive</font>

45
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,340
and I am in no way wealthy by any means

46
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,600
and i still would turn down a

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,730
partnership or a sponsorship that I felt

48
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,670
made me feel disingenuous like if it was

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,670
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hurt you guys or if I thought</font>

50
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad for you or</font>

51
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,490
something and that's how I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

52
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,990
bit about sample box at first but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

53
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,990
did a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of research and I heard what</font>

54
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,370
the girl from sample box had to say and

55
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,690
actually went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to high school with her so</font>

56
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,890
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of interesting we were never</font>

57
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,210
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends but we talked about it</font>

58
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,920
and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that makes sense</font>

59
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,720
I've always hated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people smoke and</font>

60
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,770
when I'm around people that vape I'm

61
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,269
kind of like you're a hipster<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

62
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,459
wherever but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it smells so much better</font>

63
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,230
and it's clearly healthier when I did my

64
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">research and all of all the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

65
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,620
people were saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're bad about</font>

66
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,480
them were refuted by actual facts rather

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,120
than just like

68
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,280
awful anecdotal evidence that wasn't

69
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,560
supported by anything and was obviously

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,569
perpetuated by tobacco companies that

71
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,400
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,709
in media are bullshit and just based on

73
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,629
whatever company has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most money to</font>

74
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:35,450
kind of slander market it it's like when

75
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,180
you think about politics like one guy

76
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,980
will say terrible things about one of

77
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,349
his political components are opponents

78
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,329
components and then the other guy will

79
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,860
say awful things about him and you have

80
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,420
to just kind of extrapolate the facts

81
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,940
from the bullshit and make your own like

82
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,860
educated opinion and that's what i did

83
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">was amplivox and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought it is a good</font>

84
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,549
fit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am creating a healthier</font>

85
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,019
lifestyle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am creating an</font>

86
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:59,720
atmosphere that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm happier in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

87
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,400
giving away<font color="#E5E5E5"> free shit every single month</font>

88
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,590
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like yes this is this is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

89
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,030
want to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i decided to take the</font>

90
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,430
sponsorship with kinguin it's just like

91
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,739
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> no-brainer like I've bought a</font>

92
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of fucking games off of kinguin</font>

93
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,310
it's just a middleman to get your games

94
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,629
that makes things<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit cheaper</font>

95
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,790
you can get things<font color="#E5E5E5"> on steam you can get</font>

96
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,470
things directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your computer like</font>

97
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,640
you can get starcraft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like</font>

98
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Blizzard games and for me that just</font>

99
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
made sense i'm going to be giving away

100
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,090
things all the time going to be giving

101
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,650
my games<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get games that i get to try</font>

102
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,620
out on my channel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

103
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of credit so i can spend money on my own</font>

104
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,849
games and it just it was perfect and it

105
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,069
made sense and so the few things i would

106
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i have to require is that um</font>

107
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,799
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hurting my viewers it's giving</font>

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,379
my viewers free shit it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

109
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,000
I actually care about or I'm interested

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,560
in so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be like gaming related</font>

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,349
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> health related or sex related and</font>

112
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,540
that is a great segue to my next

113
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,030
on-again off-again a sponsorship that I

114
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,290
have and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a sponsorship</font>

115
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,579
it's more like Adam and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eve which is the</font>

116
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,650
sex shop like I've done two videos for

117
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,690
them so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they pay me in a mount /</font>

118
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,349
video and I get free sex toys and I get

119
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,209
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toys and they help</font>

120
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,060
fund my sex head project which is like

121
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,339
half the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> age-restricted so I don't</font>

122
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,079
make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> money off of it even like the</font>

123
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,660
shitty revenue that you get in like

124
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,389
behind the scenes type thing and um I

125
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,090
cannot say no to free sex toys free

126
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,650
games free sex toys those are the two

127
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,630
things that I'm just like yes and the

128
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,370
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Adam and Eve allows me okay</font>

129
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">let me tell you</font>

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,530
a little bit about the sponsorship

131
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,330
process with Adam and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eve as much as I</font>

132
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">can possibly tell you they say we'll pay</font>

133
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,730
you this amount per video and we give

134
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,560
you a code that's insane like fifty

135
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,330
percent off and then free shipping

136
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,580
that's like an insane code like I want

137
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,590
to spread that<font color="#E5E5E5"> spread that joy to</font>

138
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking everyone like I will use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

139
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,580
code myself to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> things whenever i buy</font>

140
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,890
something and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get to pick</font>

141
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,720
on the site like what kinds of things i

142
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,460
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show in my video and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I get</font>

143
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to choose the topic and that's a huge</font>

144
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing for me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too if a sponsor tries to</font>

145
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,410
impart their own shit on to me like you

146
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do this this way like oh the</font>

147
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,830
biggest thing the biggest thing for me

148
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,380
is if they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that I have to</font>

149
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,570
give a positive review if they say you

150
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,730
have to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> positively even when you</font>

151
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,860
feel like the opposite I'm like nope

152
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,020
fuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a hard Poisson honest</font>

153
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,970
to my viewers<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm never going to fucking</font>

154
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,440
be like this product is awesome when I

155
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,450
don't feel like it is a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

156
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm gonna be honest and often i do think

157
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,410
things are just awesome I'm like very

158
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,030
easy to please I'm easy to please in bed

159
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,070
and if something vibrates and it looks

160
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,450
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tongue and it goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into my vagina</font>

161
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,060
or it stimulates my clitoris I'm fucking

162
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,070
happy so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best person to do</font>

163
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,830
reviews for things like I find cuteness

164
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,800
and every game i find you know an orgasm

165
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">in any toy like i could just take like a</font>

166
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,370
piece of paper just rub<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clinton</font>

167
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,530
guys yeah good sex toy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm</font>

168
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">never gonna lie if I feel like the game</font>

169
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,919
is bad like core when the game is a

170
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,220
particular game that I actually thought

171
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,840
was bad and I think it has some it's a

172
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,190
good concept and I have to say things

173
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,440
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because I find beauty in a</font>

174
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,479
game that someone worked hard to create

175
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:08,210
so it's like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so cute but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

176
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,280
can't stand playing it like that kind of

177
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing so with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Korra in the game</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I</font>

178
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,140
was honest about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that wasn't one</font>

179
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,610
of the games that a developer actually

180
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,860
sent me to review or whatever but if

181
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,229
they had I would you know talk about it

182
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,240
and upload it and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

183
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,040
i would like fuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it's my medium I'm</font>

184
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,060
allowed to say whatever the fuck I want

185
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,310
and I would never take a sponsorship

186
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,160
where they like require me to say good

187
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,910
things um so Adam and Eve where I was

188
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,470
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Adam and Eve so I I</font>

189
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,810
choose I choose things I get an amount

190
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,060
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money half before the videos up and</font>

191
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,880
half when they preview the video and see

192
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,910
that it's good

193
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give an amazing code and then I</font>

194
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,730
get sex toys for free that I get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

198
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then afterwards they they send me</font>

199
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,920
the guy at Adam and Eve Lee that I

200
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,320
talked to he<font color="#E5E5E5"> always sends me a fucking</font>

201
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,180
what are they called edible arrangements

202
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,070
like chocolate-covered strawberries in

203
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail like the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

204
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,540
just like there is nothing bad about

205
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,610
this sponsorship this is just the most

206
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,800
amazing thing ever and i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

207
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing like maybe like sex toy giveaways</font>

208
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,220
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know the I don't I'm they're</font>

209
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,380
not like a full-on sponsor and I don't

210
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,660
know if I'm good enough for them if that

211
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,860
makes any sense like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I</font>

212
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,170
get enough people buying things because

213
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">of me from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their site so i don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

214
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,130
they ever want to do this but I've

215
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,230
talked with them about doing like an

216
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,780
actual like one sex toy review video and

217
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,000
making it separate from sex head and I'm

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,280
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing like sex toy</font>

219
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,540
giveaways but I don't know the

220
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,910
stipulations legally behind that because

221
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,500
I can't give out like sex toys and

222
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,960
lingerie and porn to people under the

223
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,550
age of 18 if that makes any sense and I

224
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,840
don't know how to screen that when I do

225
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,270
give away so giving away 18 plus items

226
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,930
is kind of hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I want to also want</font>

227
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that next thursday i'm</font>

230
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,419
going to try dress up like laura croft

231
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,680

232
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,450
old laura croft because i have big tits

and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I actually have the</font>

235
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,650

236
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,270
that will actually look good then I'll

237
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,310
just have like one ponytail like this

238
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,260
and then i'll put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the the</font>

239
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,810

240
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,520
sometimes back in the day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

241
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll do like a laura croft type cosplay</font>

242
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,419
what I'm talking about that good

243
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">giveaway but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it it makes me happy</font>

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,150
viewer base my fan base who like do so

246
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,679
much for me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can give back a little</font>

247
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,059
bit to them because not everyone can

248
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,830
fucking afford a sixty-dollar game not

249
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,890
everyone can like has played<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of my</font>

250
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite games so I like giving away</font>

251
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,800
games for my favorite franchise like I

252
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,570
did a couple months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font>

253
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Year's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giveaway and I just think that</font>

254
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">sponsorships makes sense because if we</font>

255
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,279
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the revenue like okay I'm</font>

256
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,569
going to try be as transparent as

257
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,920
possible without getting in trouble all

258
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,470
of the revenue from both my gaming

259
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,170
channel YouTube and my vlog channel and

260
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,889
my twitch stream if we just go based off

261
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:14,660
of revenue i'm making a good amount less

262
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,399
than a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks a month and that</font>

263
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,990
is not something you can live off of and

264
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know someone like pewdiepie who's like</font>

265
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,290
the biggest person on YouTube can live

266
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,540
off of that kind of thing but it is so

267
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">much smaller revenue wise than you think</font>

268
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,620
it is and like every big youtuber you

269
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,809
know that makes so much more than me has

270
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,279
sponsorship so it's kind of weird to me

271
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that just because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm attractive people</font>

272
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,930
immediately insinuate that any kind of

273
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,910
money I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the only reason I'm</font>

274
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,939
into something whereas the only reason I

275
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,339
want money is so I can buy more games

276
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:46,339
than sex toys and just basically be

277
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:47,839
comfortable like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do is be</font>

278
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,160
comfortable like that's my goal I've

279
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,499
never thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Lamborghinis oh my</font>

280
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,680
god<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prada bags that's like not my thing</font>

281
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,970
contrary to how I look I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

282
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,379
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money on plastic surgery or</font>

283
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,529
something but it's not my that's not

284
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,790
what I think of every day I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

285
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">like living my life happily so when</font>

286
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,389
someone insinuate said I would like

287
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,699
sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an old man like Hugh Hefner</font>

288
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:10,069
for money or like even getting a

289
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,629
friendship for a little bit amount of

290
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,550
money like I only do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I am</font>

291
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy and every</font>

292
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,680
content producer who is especially a

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit little or you know in the</font>

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,069
field<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I am I'm not like a huge</font>

295
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:25,040
youtuber I mean I have my 100k youtuber

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,579
decent amount of viewership on my twitch

298
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,470
but I'm not one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the bigger ones that</font>

299
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,540
is just like rolling in dough I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I</font>

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:46,399
understanding that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take</font>

307
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,290
sponsorships because it's a win-win like

308
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,480
you get free shit<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money and free</font>

309
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,790
shit you know I get to promote something

310
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,019
that's awesome that you guys might not

311
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,139
know about and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't I don't see any</font>

312
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,459
downside to that like what kind of like

313
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,470
person who thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their selfless</font>

314
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,800
selfless but is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an idiot</font>

315
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,199
wouldn't take free stuff and then also

316
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:10,730
give free stuff to their viewers like I

317
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,600
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

318
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,130
the thought process there is just like

319
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,139
I'm worried whether people think that's

320
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the only thought process they could</font>

321
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there because there is no</font>

322
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,940
downside it's not like I take this money

323
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,230
and it's good for a month and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

324
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,750
explode and die like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not what's</font>

325
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,660
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so to me it's just people</font>

326
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,610
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that my intentions are</font>

327
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,259
something that they are not by getting

328
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,149
mad that I might have a sponsorship it's

329
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">not selling out for me to want to be</font>

330
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to survive if that makes any sense</font>

331
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,860
it's not selling out for me to want to

332
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,839
make you know things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are flashy</font>

333
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,160
that you might want to click on like

334
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,750
none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shit make sense as long as</font>

335
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,579
my intentions<font color="#E5E5E5"> are good and pure and I</font>

336
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,319
fucking love you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys and it's clear</font>

337
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,670
like if you watch a couple of my videos

338
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,290
it's clear who I am and how I conduct

339
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,019
business it's clear that I am NOT<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

340
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,040
with doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

341
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,269
comfortable with her that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy</font>

342
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:58,819
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> not for money like money is</font>

343
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,470
like on the back burner<font color="#CCCCCC"> money money</font>

344
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't necessary evil but it is not I'm</font>

345
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,970
not thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about green dough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font>

346
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,470
I'm doing something I'm thinking about

347
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to live my life to the fullest</font>

348
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,639
and being happy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

349
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
makes any sense um one sponsorship that

350
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,449
I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font>

351
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,370
endorse any more is Luke<font color="#CCCCCC"> crate so the</font>

352
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,689
reason I stopped making loot crate

353
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,550
videos is because everyone does it and

354
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,449
it felt boring to me and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

355
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:30,110
like it and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just like i don't</font>

356
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">know i'm not giving away loot crates and</font>

357
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:34,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like whatever so I still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

358
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,689
the loot crate code down in my

359
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:39,470
description you can still<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it but for</font>

360
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">me it wasn't giving anything away it</font>

361
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,290
wasn't adding to my channel like every

362
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,819
single youtuber has a partnership with

363
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:48,920
loot crate basically and for me it was

364
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the loot crate sarku like usually</font>

365
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,240
most of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> whew like occasionally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

366
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,519
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a fully Doctor Who one and I'm</font>

367
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,079
like I don't watch Doctor Who so I don't

368
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,910
fucking care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this but most of the</font>

369
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,290
time the shit that I get is really

370
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,610
fucking cool like i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just opened one</font>

371
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,399
today and i got like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a facehugger and</font>

372
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,740
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuckit like a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff from</font>

373
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,819
UM from uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fuck why can't I</font>

374
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember Mulder and Scully shit what the</font>

375
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,639
fuck is wrong with me but<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway I grew</font>

376
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,779
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shit I fucking love that</font>

377
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,699
shit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm watching like</font>

378
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,139
Californication and thinking that's

379
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,120
Mulder and watching hannibal and

380
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,070
thinking that Scully and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing else</font>

381
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,930
also Scully got hotter with age which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

382
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,140
kind of weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> but um yeah sometimes it's</font>

383
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,550
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing and it's awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

384
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,460
that stuff but for me people just

385
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,870
weren't interested in it and a lot of

386
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">people I felt like it's not worth paying</font>

387
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,850
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I'm telling</font>

388
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,650
people to do it then it didn't feel

389
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,170
right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a lot</font>

390
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,640
of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff and a lot of</font>

391
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,470
it is often things that people will

392
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,880
consider it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> junk and I don't want</font>

393
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,140
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to buy</font>

394
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,970
something in order to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> me if you</font>

395
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,890
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so I only want to promote</font>

396
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,570
the things that I'm like this is awesome

397
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,640
like-minded people think this is awesome

398
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,140
as well you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing so</font>

399
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is an information about my</font>

400
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,730
sponsorships trying to think there's

401
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,370
anything else I work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> streamer II</font>

402
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">know but I'm more like beta testing for</font>

403
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,780
them stream<font color="#CCCCCC"> moreno calm as a site that</font>

404
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,420
where I can find matches with my fans

405
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,380
and it's like a randomizer for some like

406
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,300
my fans sign up they want to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

407
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,190
league game with me and then I randomize

408
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,900
it and I choose based on that and that's

409
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,070
kind of cool but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a sponsorship</font>

410
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,600
really like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not promoting on my</font>

411
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,670
page they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of paying me a</font>

412
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,610
very small amount a week to beta test it

413
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,830
and give them ideas back which for me is

414
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,270
amazing because I have so many ideas

415
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,430
about everything like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should see how</font>

416
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,380
I've tried to improve patreon I'm like

417
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,570
constantly talking to like Heather at

418
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,100
support at patreon<font color="#CCCCCC"> river the fucking I'm</font>

419
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,140
like dude you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

420
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,460
that they're like yeah I'm working on it

421
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,900
I'm like this is not working<font color="#CCCCCC"> right what</font>

422
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,190
is wrong with you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

423
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,570
would be a good beta tester or a good

424
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,200
tester<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new platforms in a different</font>

425
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,870
life may I hope you enjoyed this video

426
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">again one hundred percent transparency</font>

427
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,990
if you have any questions to ask me

428
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,410
other than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual like numbers and</font>

429
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,910
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font>

430
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,640
personally don't like when people say oh

431
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,520
I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that or oh it's bad</font>

432
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,350
taste to ask me what my income is I

433
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,310
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have a problem with that</font>

434
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,630
but I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

435
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">like in the contract not to and in a</font>

436
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,530
regular work setting it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

437
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,630
because you don't want to find out that

438
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're equal you're not subordinate is</font>

439
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,610
making more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you because then that</font>

440
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,560
can cause like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company to lose a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

441
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,760
of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they go and complain</font>

442
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,850
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I also but I</font>

443
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,230
just don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why people think</font>

444
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,910
it's so taboo to ask like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much do</font>

445
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you make outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your own work</font>

446
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
like if one of my like if I'm working at

447
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,840
safeway and one of my friends comes up

448
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,310
and says how much do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make annually I</font>

449
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,890
wouldn't be like oh just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like people ask</font>

450
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,120
