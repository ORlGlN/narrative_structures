hey guys I'm gonna do a vlog at<font color="#CCCCCC"> fnm I</font>

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:03,689
have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more comfortable with doing</font>

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,370
blogs out in public where people are

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,960
like what the fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> is she doing I feel</font>

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,910
like I am entitled to it now that i have

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">over 100k subscribers because it makes</font>

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">me like an official youtuber and people</font>

8
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,519
go like oh my god that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that youtuber</font>

9
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,470
so it makes sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i make content</font>

10
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,730
like this and when you're in LA and

11
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,289
you're like friends with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> circle and</font>

12
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,279
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are also</font>

13
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,740
content producers it's like not weird at

14
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,390
all that you see them doing that in

15
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,970
public but like for me it still feels

16
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,519
weird and not like weird isn't like I'm

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,710
insecure about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more like I don't</font>

18
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like explaining what I'm doing</font>

19
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,340
because a lot of people will ask me but

20
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,110
anyway um so yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

21
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,329

22
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,770
was jay's birthday we streamed for like

23

27
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,730
talking and being friends so it's gonna

28
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,989

I promise you as well as I'm really

36
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited about trying to upgrade my</font>

37
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,909
quality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my blogs and I want to know</font>

38
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,439
how you guys feel about this do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

39
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,860
dislike that I use my camera phone and

40
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really have like the</font>

41
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,860
highest<font color="#CCCCCC"> quality blogs and its most of me</font>

42
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,479
just like walking around holding my

43
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,049
camera because um I really liked the

44
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,790
intimacy of law but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time I</font>

45
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,259
could just get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good camera and</font>

46
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,520
do the same thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like really</font>

47
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,080
good production quality or I can just

48
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,909
like sit it on a tripod in front of me

49
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and like not have to worry about holding</font>

50
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,119
it it's like hands-free and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

51
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,590
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to emote with my hands I</font>

52
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,880
like talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my hands occasionally</font>

53
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,650
so um that's something I'm thinking

54
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,780
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what DSLR I</font>

55
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,820
need to buy so if any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are well</font>

56
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,229
versed in photography or anything like

57
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,149
that it would be nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could help</font>

58
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,740
me out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that as well as I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

59
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,270
a ring light<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they're getting a</font>

60
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,009
portable ring light that goes on the

61
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,840
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the DSLR or I'm getting just</font>

62
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,950
like one of the big ring lights with the

63
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,240
stands it cost me like a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks</font>

64
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,780
but I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed the DSLRs or less are</font>

65
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,950
less expensive than camcorders which is

66
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,420
weird so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent a thousand dollars on</font>

67
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the camcorder that i use for zooming</font>

68
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,719
games<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all of my high production</font>

69
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,970
videos and I

70
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,919
like the video that it takes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

71
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,980
the all of the beauty girls and all of

72
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,960
the other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that with really</font>

73
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,130
really nice production quality they're

74
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,320
using DSLRs and they're like recording

75
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,110
1080p video so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a DSLR</font>

76
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,510
camera that does video in 1080p

77
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,690
obviously full HD um and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

78
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,680
need help with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ring line I already</font>

79
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,970
have that on my wish list I have the

80
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,440
portable one on my wish list and I'm

81
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to add a bigger one with</font>

82
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,460
a stand to my wishlist later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so</font>

83
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,080
fucking psyched about this I know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,160
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time but I don't do</font>

85
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,050
anything really that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't involve me</font>

86
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,400
being really really passionate about it

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,980
but occasionally I get amazing ideas

88
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,330
that I'm just so fucking passionate

89
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,290
about and right now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm passionate</font>

90
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,020
about is creating even better quality

91
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,970
content i'm a huge geek when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes to</font>

92
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,650
production quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having the</font>

93
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,850
best quality streams but nice is

94
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,930
overlays and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all that shit</font>

95
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,580
myself because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good at a</font>

96
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,020
graphic design<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff and using</font>

97
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,190
Photoshop edit all of my videos um it's

98
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,200
so funny when people say like oh you

99
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,790
can't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than 10 seconds editing</font>

100
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,140
your videos all you do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

101
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,880
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and upload it but you guys aren't</font>

102
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,730
really seeing then the content that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

103
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,350
produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my gaming channel or you're</font>

104
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">not seeing like the sexes and all the</font>

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,860
videos would take like ours to edit and

106
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm I'm slightly slow and not as

107
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,239
convenient as I should be with video

108
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,090
editing but I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> better and I'm</font>

109
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing more videos like the e3 recap</font>

110
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,920
which I'm going to be highlighting on my

111
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,690
well you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment that I post</font>

112
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,450
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the gaming video that I</font>

113
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,400
promote to you guys but I spent fucking

114
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,440
three hours editing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goddamn video</font>

115
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,840
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was really excited about a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

116
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">things from e3 specifically obviously</font>

117
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,570
the Final Fantasy 7 remake that's the

118
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,040
fucking best but there's also a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

119
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,570
other awesome games there's you know

120
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously we know there's a new metal</font>

121
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,440
gear solid and a bunch of other things

122
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,420
um but anyway so topic I want to talk

123
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">about actually today is I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

124
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,170
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube glitch and it's actually</font>

125
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,900
worrying me about<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I want to</font>

126
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,970
preface this with saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that every</font>

127
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,070
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> person in the world wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

128
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,080
a job and wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make money doing what</font>

129
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
they love<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

130
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,690
like money is not because they're crazy

131
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,519
gold digging whores but because they

132
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:11,810
need to survive and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

133
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,400
comfortable life so for me I don't

134
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,540
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of really expensive</font>

135
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,930
things I just want

136
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,639
have a comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> life or I'm happy</font>

137
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,750
playing video games and doing the things

138
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,570
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love and maybe like a few sets of</font>

139
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,220
abercrombie clothes like every other

140
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,210
month or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

141
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,580
like I don't want like a billion cars

142
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,560
and a mansion and prada purses<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

143
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,850
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that shit I'm not interested</font>

144
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,320
in I don't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to fancy restaurants</font>

145
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,509
it's not my thing so I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

146
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,889
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and happy and I think</font>

147
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,900
everyone does and everyone should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so</font>

148
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,940
lucky as to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow their</font>

149
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,500
dreams and do what they love<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

150
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,090
living and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is create</font>

151
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,729
content be sexy and play<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking video</font>

152
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:45,840
games those are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like a</font>

153
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
lot and such as video games obviously

154
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,990
come here playing fucking magic on

155
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,789
Friday so that's what I do on my Friday

156
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:54,810
nights but anyway um uh I over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

157
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,280
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months this channel has grown</font>

158
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,770
exponentially not<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally it's wrong</font>

159
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,110
just like ridiculously crazy I know

160
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,490
mathematicians and should are gonna be

161
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,380
like that's not the literal term of

162
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,449
exponential it's a colloquial term of

163
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,090
exponential anyway so I got up to being

164
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to pay my rent with this one</font>

165
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,780
channel alone which I was so fucking

166
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,900
grateful for but as at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of May it</font>

167
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,940
dropped almost a hundred percent like

168
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,210
it's fucking crazy like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not under</font>

169
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,090
percent obviously but um it doesn't make

170
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me because nothing has</font>

171
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,360
changed but my analytics are telling me

172
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,580
that I've lost almost seventy percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

173
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,590
my revenue which makes no sense because

174
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,630
I slowly<font color="#E5E5E5"> built it up it was making sense</font>

175
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,099
I was getting more viewers of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

176
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,630
free to fat video went viral and

177
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,849
everything and it made sense that I was

178
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">making more money but now all of a</font>

179
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:42,060
sudden I'm making seventy percent less

180
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,190
on this channel I'm making the same

181
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,789
amount on this channel as I am on my

182
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:49,500
gaming channel my gaming channel each

183
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,360
video gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 maximum of ten thousand</font>

184
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,880
viewers right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> are 10,000 views and</font>

185
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,610
then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have any of the almost</font>

186
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,139
viral<font color="#E5E5E5"> or viral videos on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so it's</font>

187
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,180
really fucking weird that my channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

188
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,860
still producing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at leat like a minimum</font>

189
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of 10,000 views per video no matter what</font>

190
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and upwards of like a hundred thousand</font>

191
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,729
every video why it's making the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact</font>

192
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,320
same amount and I like is this a glitch

193
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,580
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this something that you guys are you</font>

194
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys content producers that have seen a</font>

195
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">huge drop I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> toby turner</font>

196
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,210
tobuscus and he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling me that um</font>

197
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,210
CPM and stuff and money<font color="#CCCCCC"> should go up in</font>

198
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,710
the summer but then I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to zoom and</font>

199
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,910
games and suma games was telling me that

200
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,919
nobody watches videos in the summer so

201
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,720
all the money that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> make on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

202
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,819
will go down and that the holiday season

203
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,020
is the best time in the holiday season

204
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,759
is obviously the best time for CPM it's

205
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">really weird because my gaming channel</font>

206
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,130
has a certainty p.m. and then my blog

207
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,900
channel has a slightly lower CPM and

208
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,340
that does an account<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the money drop</font>

209
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,569
and I'm just like really confused and

210
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:46,860
I'm also a little bit scared like I'm

211
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,419
gonna be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you guys I'm a</font>

212
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit scared that I'm gonna have to</font>

213
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,099
change my lifestyle a little bit because

214
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:54,870
I was so happy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was finally of</font>

215
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,380
making enough on my blog channel and my

216
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,740
gaming channel and streaming to support

217
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,660
myself support<font color="#E5E5E5"> J and like pay my rent</font>

218
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,039
and do all that stuff like I was so

219
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,020
happy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'm feeling I'm feeling a</font>

220
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit sad because not only does</font>

221
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,780
that mean that it might keep going up

222
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> down or radically and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't know</font>

223
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,409
my income but it also means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

224
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:19,229
know I might have to live<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way that is</font>

225
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,020
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideal and I feel like I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

226
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,409
grasp grasped my dreams and now I'm

227
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:26,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">losing it a little bit and it's scary</font>

228
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,409
and it's weird and I don't really know

229
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:29,400
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hoping it's just</font>

230
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">a glitch I reported it the most annoying</font>

231
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,599
thing about YouTube is that YouTube

232
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,060
doesn't have an easy way for content

233
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,180
producers to contact people and get a

234
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,620
real human response and actually get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

235
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,330
response at all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

236
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,530
going on there's no way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> report a bug</font>

237
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,169
there's only a way to like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey you</font>

238
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,240
bought you a towel and blogging<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

239
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a blogs into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> akhtar yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anyway</font>

240
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:54,780
so um there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way for me to actually</font>

241
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,729
contact someone and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it it's</font>

242
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">like weird uh but I can report I can't</font>

243
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,400
like leave feedback and when I leave

244
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,259
feedback it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay report bug say</font>

245
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you want tell us we're doing a</font>

246
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,320
good job and obviously that shit is like

247
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,139
going through just nobody's looking at

248
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that shit and I did it twice but I don't</font>

249
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,610
know what's going on and I wish someone

250
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,870
could shed light on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

251
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">because analytics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

252
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,949
million<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuckin statistics and analytics</font>

253
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,199
it's fucking confusing and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

254
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,699
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> J looked</font>

255
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,800
through it he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't know on a percent</font>

256
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,110
he's just and like okay so my feel free

257
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,240
to fat video was making me hundreds of

258
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,669
dollars and then even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's still</font>

259
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,080
growing in views it's not making

260
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,309
hundreds of dollars and then when I look

261
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,039
at subscribers my subscribers were going

262
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,159
up 30,000 new subscribers a month now

263
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,479
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up less than my gaming</font>

264
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,370
channel only<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 3,000 subscribers a</font>

265
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,480
month and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry if i can't give you</font>

266
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,910
perfect amounts or like there are things

267
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,529
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the analytics and the monetization</font>

268
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,820
and the CPM that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't tell you guys</font>

269
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,040
about but it's a very very confusing

270
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,050
process and i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> very confused so if</font>

271
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,760
you guys can shed light on anything or

272
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,589
tell me which did<font color="#E5E5E5"> allarde buy it would</font>

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">i just wanted to let you guys know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

276
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm concerned about right now what's</font>

277
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,950
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in my life but otherwise I'm</font>

just not gonna let it bother<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm not</font>

282
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,980
gonna worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much because</font>

283
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,060
i'm still doing enough right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and</font>

284
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,709
there are always other ways to do things

285
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,600
i can always like take my modeling jobs

286
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,390
which is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not ideal because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

287
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,040
passion that I have for modeling is like

288
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,750
I get to express my sexuality I get to

289
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,910
have fun I get to meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> people but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

290
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,760
same time if I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my own my own</font>

291
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,070
concepts it's not as interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

292
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it you know what I'm saying so</font>

293
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,339
like if I'm doing the same lingerie

294
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,750
company over and over again and I'm

295
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,370
modeling things that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

296

interested in that aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sexy or</font>

297
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,589
things i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really like and I'm not</font>
