00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,929
hey guys weekly phone vlog is today I

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">just recorded a video that was up</font>

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,429
yesterday called my utopia and I hope

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">people enjoy the video for what it's</font>

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,730
supposed to be which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically my</font>

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,049
opinion on what the world would be like

7
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,100
at the point that I would call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,230
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and um I know I'm gonna have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,699
lot of differing opinions from a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because a lot of people are very</font>

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,180
opposite of me but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,619
everyone's opinions and hopefully I

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,810
don't piss too many people off actually

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,920
I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care if I piss people off</font>

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,590
you guys know this but more that I hope

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,660
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my point without getting</font>

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,950
pissed off at a point that I didn't

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,300
actually make if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense it's</font>

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,340
really like counterproductive to what

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,930
I'm trying to do as a blogger or a

21
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,210
philosopher to have people just

22
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,410
completely mess understand what I'm

23
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to say and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then like get really</font>

24
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,320
mad at something I didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> say and</font>

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I'm like oh that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not what I meant</font>

26
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,379
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop being so stupid and just</font>

27
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,899
understand what I'm saying um and I feel

28
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,670
like this happens on average like at

29
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">least 10 comments that i read a video</font>

30
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,230
and it's kind of weird especially if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

31
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,170
bring up topics that aren't necessarily

32
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,229
the most commonly expressed topics like

33
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,820
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> veganism more talking</font>

34
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,159
about eradication of religion stuff like

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,070
that so um that video has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of it so</font>

36
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,210
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get mad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at me go ahead</font>

37
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch that video ooh I have my hair</font>

38
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,869
up today I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

39
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,670
video but I don't really have my hair up

40
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,280
often because I don't like my ears I

41
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,770
feel like my ears are big and the way I

42
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,400
tan I don't really naturally tan so they

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,430
don't get his tan or whatever but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

44
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,869
boring let's talk about things that are

45
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,750
not boring I will not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> canceling the</font>

46
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,030
fanservice videos I've just decided that

47
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it brings idiots in i will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

48
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,600
filter out more idiots and if it takes

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,670
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer to read the comments of the</font>

50
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,810
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I actually care about it</font>

51
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">will take me longer in the comments and</font>

52
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,049
so be it I don't want to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pay wall</font>

53
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,399
behind it I don't want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

54
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,390
you know feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like uncomfortable that</font>

55
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,310
they're watching it for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

56
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,399
I just I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I appreciate the</font>

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,979
people who understand that although it

58
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,750
might be good fat service like that's

59
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome if you fat to it I very much</font>

also hope and appreciate all the people

63
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,790
who do understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's basically</font>

64
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,069
just meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show like a little bit</font>

65
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,530
of like pointless sexual fun because

66
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,689
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and you know it's okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

67
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,189
like watch this and be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that's</font>

68
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,049
hot it's okay to watch that watch this

69
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,400
and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh I'm a favorite youtuber</font>

70
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,780
doing something completely pointless and

71
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,909
you know the video doesn't actually have

72
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:29,609
much you know to offer other than just

73
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">being sexy like this youtuber I like</font>

74
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,150
being sexy and that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fun and</font>

75
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,230
that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fine and there should be</font>

76
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,659
no you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know people being mad about that</font>

77
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,579
it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm expressing my</font>

78
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,109
sexuality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm having fun with it and</font>

79
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,219
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are having fun with me and</font>

80
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,439
that's something that I really desire to

81
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,730
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you guys are like my family</font>

82
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,430

83
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">off I took a couple days off because</font>

00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,030
it's Christmas which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

85
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">fucking cop out reason because I don't</font>

87
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">said before like I'm not religious and I</font>

88
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:01,769
also don't like buy into the whole like

89
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,060
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just spend a bunch of money right</font>

90
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,969
now on useless<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap for the people and</font>

91
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,290
then like we have to see our family on

92
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,719
this specific day otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're bad</font>

93
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,549
children like I'm seeing my mom tomorrow

<font color="#E5E5E5">which is sunday which is like three days</font>

95

<font color="#E5E5E5">after Christmas but I'm doing it around</font>

96
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christmas because my parents like to</font>

97
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">celebrate Christmas and they go all out</font>

98
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,370
with like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas lights the but</font>

99
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,569
they do the same with like Halloween in

100
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,620
every holiday I think it's just

101
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that they used to pass the</font>

102
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,069
time to make themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to make</font>

103
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,599
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel useful and have fun and</font>

104
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great if that's the reason why</font>

105
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,079
they do it then that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone</font>

106
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,079
else dictated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Halloween the day of</font>

107
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,269
halloween it needs to be this kind of

108
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,430
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know decoration and they just follow</font>

109
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and do their own thing with it that's</font>

110
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,879
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I respect people who have fun</font>

111
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,280
with it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things for</font>

112
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,949
certain holidays but it's kind of silly

113
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:48,930
you know the like mass hysteria that

114
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,060
happens around like Black Friday<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

115
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,129
fact that all the revenue like ad

116
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,079
revenue goes up so much around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time</font>

117
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,790
it's something you don't know I guess if

118
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,620
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Content producer but like</font>

119
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,030
twitch revenue<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube revenue</font>

120
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,199
everything goes up around this time

121
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,239
because people are being such crazy

122
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,979
consumers at this time like everyone is

123
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,540
just buying everything out and fucking

124
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,609
going crazy like maxing their credit

125
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,919
cards and that helps with you know ad

126
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,009
revenue because ad creators are spending

127
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,870
more money like in putting more money

128
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,880
into getting their ads out there so like

129
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,858
the CPM the clicks per minute is higher

130
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,418
because you know more people are paying

131
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,159
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these ads and that all just</font>

132
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense</font>

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,810
and I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it recently but</font>

134
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,310
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting the places like</font>

135
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,320
Dubai in places like Las Vegas have a

136
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,820
really low cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> living</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

137
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">obvious that it's because the economy</font>

138
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,940
there is so great<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they have so</font>

139
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,010
many tourists so like living in a

140
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,770
tourist trap might not seem very you

141
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,360
know comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it might get</font>

142
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,730
annoying and stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> after like a while</font>

143
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,169
of living<font color="#E5E5E5"> there like you get sick of the</font>

144
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:46,790
tourists and stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

145
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">are like oh my god there's fucking slot</font>

146
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,100
machines everywhere we're good but like

147
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,230
living on the outskirts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strip or</font>

148
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,150
something seems really good value

149
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,350
because you're saving so much money

150
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,870
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this tourists and that's why</font>

151
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,970
I'm Jay and I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font>

152
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,360
moving there because like Seattle LA and

153
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,010
places<font color="#CCCCCC"> like New York are really</font>

154
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,600
expensive in their living and it's

155
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,110
because it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big city but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font>

156
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like insane tourist places like</font>

157
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,790
the casinos are all on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reserve here</font>

158
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,800
like we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Native American</font>

159
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,750
reserves and the casinos are all there

160
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,979
so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the profit from that</font>

161
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's like a hundred percent</font>

162
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,650
owned by them which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only you know</font>

163
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,900
caveat that we've given them basically

164
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,580
in the whole slaughtering of them and

165
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,520
terribleness but yeah um as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying</font>

166
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,100
in my other video i really like showing

167
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,510
my neck and that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

168
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,460
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my hair up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

169
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,660
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of girls look really cute with</font>

170
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">their hair up and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like don't I</font>

171
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,310
look weird and elfish and like I have a

172
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">small head but um sometimes I like to do</font>

173
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,000
shit that's just different just for the

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,780
sake of being different it's a part of

175
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,830
perfecting my parents that I like to

176
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,570
enjoy like being a different person or

177
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,669
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different way or like having</font>

178
00:05:58,669 --> 00:05:59,990
different looks and like I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose</font>

179
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">which one's my favorite but I can keep</font>

180
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,570
switching it up that's something I

181
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,680
really like about just like being a

182
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,169
perfectionist is that I can identify the

183
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,700
ones that aren't as perfect but I enjoy

184
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ones that are you know different</font>

185
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically I finished</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so like as you</font>

186
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,100
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see right here when it when it stops</font>

187
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,800
like being too bright you see how my two

188
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,610
front teeth are like slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> darker</font>

189
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,740
than my other teeth so I have my

190
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,200
temporaries on now so that tooth right

191
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,190
here that used to be a little bit

192
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">discolored is like now completely gone</font>

193
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,340
forever which I am super happy about

194
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,070
because I I don't it never really made

195
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,330
me insecure so like the difference

196
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,030
between being insecure to me and being

197
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,580
just like a perfectionist is like

198
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,129
insecurities actually causes you

199
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:48,080
emotional grief we're like you don't

200
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,000
want to show your mouth or you like

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,860
won't take pictures or you don't want to

202
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,300
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in public and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

203
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,009
gets sad maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point of even</font>

204
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,139
crying or just being like stress and

205
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,250
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more than you should</font>

206
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,430
whereas for me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like I don't</font>

207
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture as much but I'm gonna</font>

208
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">post it and it's like I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

209
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,919
like I would smile just as much and I

210
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,800
would do whatever the fuck just as much

211
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,150
and people notice till I everyone

212
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">notices it it's like whatever who cares</font>

213
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,599
and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be like yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a root</font>

214
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,979
canal and my fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> tooth started</font>

215
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,139
discoloring and I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on in to</font>

216
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,750
get my veneers or whatever soon and um

217
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,569
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's a fact</font>

218
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,699
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling me about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not going</font>

219
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,770
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make me sad i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working on</font>

220
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">improving and I'm gonna be really</font>

221
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">excited when it's done so it's halfway</font>

222
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,590
done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty excited no more</font>

223
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,669
weirdo tooth which is awesome ah but

224
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:40,639
they don't have temporaries that are the

225
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,440
bleach color of the rest of my teeth so

226
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,810
for right now my teeth are slightly

227
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,250
darker here and it's kind of weird

228
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,529
because like they shaved the tooth down

229
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,150
really small it's like a stub it was

230
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,430
like really creepy but they made the

231
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,719
tooth that had the root canal much

232
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,699
stronger by putting a post in it that

233
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,129
like reinforces it so I once this is

234
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,389
done not right now but once this is done

235
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,770
I'm going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eat caramel</font>

236
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,509
apples I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to like bite</font>

237
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:04,550
with my two front teeth I've gotten so

238
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,370
used to like biting with like right here

239
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,830
and my vampire teeth and stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

240
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like second nature to me I doesn't</font>

241
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,949
even bother me anymore but I often will

242
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,770
get like food like here like it ruins my

243
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,139
like lip gloss and stuff and so I'm

244
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,699
excited to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a normal human being with</font>

245
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,469
normal teeth because since I've like

246
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:23,479
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight years old or something I</font>

247
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,009

procedure i get done and right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

259
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,190
I'm doing is teeth and trying to get fit

260
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,600
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe I can think about doing</font>

261
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,270
some other things but right now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

262
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,470
pretty much happy with my plastic

263
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,570
surgery and where it's at and just

264
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,700
trying to get my body<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow suit and</font>

265
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,410
that's what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with me right now</font>

266
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,200
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the gym I went tanning</font>

267
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,600
and when I go spray tanning the first

268
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,670
result before i shower is like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

269
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,140
splotchy like it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit splotchy</font>

270
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,120
or whatever and not that dark and then

271
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,340
over the next six hours as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

272
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't sweat a shower get cum all over me</font>

273
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,750
or fucking go swimming it starts like

274
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,090
getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> my skin cells and then</font>

275
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,950
becomes an actual tan and it gets darker

276
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,810
and darker and darker so next time I

277
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,460
shower i'll have an even tan and then

278
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,740
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> i work out the more it like</font>

279
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,390
starts rubbing off in weird places and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

280
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,160
have to scrub it off before i spray tan

281
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,280
again but it's so much darker and better

282
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,020
than actual tanning because actual

283
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,420
tanning you know is more carcinogenic

284
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,900
and it also doesn't get nearly as dark

285
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,400
or nearly as even so yeah that's the

286
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,490
random<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tara video for the week I hope</font>
