2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,830
philosophy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I did the video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,020
time about life and death and the

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,220
meaning of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life and all that shit and</font>

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">also I hope you guys had a happy</font>

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,910
Halloween it's Halloween for me today I

planned<font color="#E5E5E5"> on uploading something else</font>

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,780
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was actually going to be a list</font>

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,250
of all the content creators that I

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally support with my own money but</font>

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,520
that will be up next week probably

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,830
wednesday or thursday or maybe even

13
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,570
sunday because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is more</font>

14
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,529
important today<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to talk</font>

15
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,900
about epistemic<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibilities which</font>

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,910
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watching crest</font>

17
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,890
court crash course philosophy for some

18
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,120
reason I just can't say that very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,730
and I'm in fucking love with it it's

20
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,899
fucking amazing I'm actually supposed to

21
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,640
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stream right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted</font>

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make this video real quick so um</font>

23
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,710
epistemic responsibility i'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

24
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,600
took really<font color="#E5E5E5"> raining out there i would</font>

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,670
try to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused I needed the natural</font>

26
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">light and now I regret it um ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font>

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,680
that is is it's basically saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

28
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,719
you shouldn't morally or you shouldn't

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,550
be allowed to believe something without

30
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,820
actual factual fact backing it up there

31
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,350
should be no beliefs only knowledge

32
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,270
right and if you can't back up your

33
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,188
belief with something factual then you

34
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,630
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be allowed to have it now a</font>

35
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,830
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

36
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,000
should have freedom in your belief<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,590
should be able to do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

38
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,119
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think whatever you</font>

39
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,119
want but um these philosophers believe

40
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,939
that because beliefs can spread so

41
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,369
quickly you would be spreading something

42
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,450
that's non-factual in a very epidemic

43
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,520
way like you know saying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> god is real</font>

44
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,590
for example we can say it he is or he

45
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,299
isn't whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's not</font>

46
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,150
so let's say I go out and spread that he

47
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,920
is because you know in an alternate

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,270
reality I could be a Christian or

49
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,979
something so if i go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and spread that</font>

50
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,869
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> no knowledge and everyone else</font>

51
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,130
starts spreading that then we have a

52
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,420
world full of people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

53
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,549
understand or<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe anything factual</font>

54
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,070
right and we see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot on youtube</font>

55
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot on ugh can I lay</font>

56
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,909
down if I lay down look awful because so

57
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,340
much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess this is</font>

58
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,520
actually more more halloween halloween

59
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,189
ii anyway so whatever um so if we're

60
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,420
spreading these false beliefs and

61
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,060
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on fact then it</font>

62
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,250
sucks right so a lot of philosophers

63
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,869
believe that we shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing that</font>

64
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,758
right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be</font>

65
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:09,568
able to believe whatever you want

66
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,240
because I believe

67
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,040
doing whatever the fuck you want as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

68
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,300
as it makes you happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and isn't hurting</font>

69
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,460
anyone else but these philosophers my

70
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,260
crown fell off but these philosophers

71
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,030
believe that it is hurting other people

72
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,950
to have them believe false or unprovable

73
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,310
beliefs right so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is so</font>

74
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,690
great about the fact that people can

75
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe whatever they want is that I</font>

76
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,480
have a basis to believe the things that

77
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,730
I believe like if I have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

78
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,350
argument if I say really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad argument on</font>

79
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet like if I listen to</font>

80
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,230
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philip DeFranco says I</font>

81
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,180
disagree with him a lot I did I agree

82
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,350
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him walk but I also disagree with</font>

83
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,580
him a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot so let's say he has an opinion</font>

84
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">on something that I fully disagree with</font>

85
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,300
the fact that I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear that opinion</font>

86
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,590
and see that other people hold that

87
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,570
opinion and why and the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I get</font>

88
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,730
to hear these arguments that are based

89
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,670
on these people's morals or ideas the

90
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,110
fact that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to compare them to my</font>

91
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,150
own just strengthens my own beliefs that

92
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,920
much more because I can compare them to

93
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,170
things that I think are bad now the only

94
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">way in philosophy to disprove something</font>

95
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,520
is to try to prove the thing that you

96
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,590
want to disprove I'm sure I'm saying

97
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,670
this wrong and I'm going to link all of

98
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,400
the videos from crash crash course

99
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,540
philosophy because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font>

100
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,820
fucking amazing I love the guy to he's

101
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,760
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna try to explain it</font>

102
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,010
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> innate on my terms and give you guys</font>

103
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,200
my arguments and stuff I don't know I'm

104
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,430
feeling out of it maybe I'll just redo

105
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,530
this video i'm not sure but i thought

106
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,000
this would go a lot better than it is

107
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm all over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place and thinking</font>

108
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the string</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm thinking about</font>

109
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the storm and I don't know you guys</font>

110
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like these kinds of logs though</font>

111
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,830
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I don't know if I should</font>

112
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,480
continue it or not whatever so anyway um

113
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,280
I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the fact that people can</font>

114
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,690
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the fuck they want</font>

115
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,000
because I believe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to do</font>

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,800
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want and I also believe in</font>

117
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">counter arguments to my arguments and</font>

118
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,420
being able to form stronger opinions and

119
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,220
stronger resolve from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideologies</font>

120
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,780
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm comparing them to ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

121
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,850
you know are bad or different you know

122
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,160
and sometimes I change my opinions and

123
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,230
make them better because I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

124
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,390
else's opinions and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> always that</font>

125
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,100
I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm right sometimes I'll</font>

126
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,890
change my opinions all together it'll be

127
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,870
something completely different and I am

128
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,608
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> grateful for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that there</font>

129
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,079
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other individuals in the world who</font>

130
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,608
grew up differently or who have

131
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,430
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas of the world so</font>

132
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,750
I can compare mine to theirs and

133
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,150
strengthen mine it's so facto right and

134
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,440
it's like so much better that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you</font>

135
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,820
know what I'm saying like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like open</font>

136
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,100
discussions because they they either

137
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,289
teach we have another way that's better

138
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,139
than mine or they strengthen my way so

139
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,000
um what I was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say with the</font>

140
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,770
Philosopher's so if a philosopher has an

141
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,520
idea like God doesn't exist the way he

142
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,289
can disprove or the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can prove</font>

143
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,030
the God doesn't exist is by trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

144
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,370
prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he does and if you're just</font>

145
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,870
trying to like beg the question if

146
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,100
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to say that like oh</font>

147
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,889
well you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly believe</font>

148
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,020
like I'm biased as fuck to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that</font>

149
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,340
God exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you're just like</font>

150
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,380
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all of the anecdotal evidence</font>

151
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,729
that God exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not actually</font>

152
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,349
proving or disproving yourself you're

153
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:03,970
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like stroking your own</font>

154
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,930
ego you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually</font>

155
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,030
exploring the world but if someone who

156
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,099
believes in God like looks through all

157
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,889
of the other religions texts and listens

158
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,539
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of the amazing atheist to try</font>

159
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:14,979
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea and then he still</font>

160
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">believes in God then the strength and</font>

161
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,310
God has just strengthened or the belief

162
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,479
in God has just strengthened and it's

163
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,280
like all the much better you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

164
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
I'm saying I sound like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking idiot</font>

165
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now but usually I sound</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

166
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you guys just like try to put</font>

167
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:30,400
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Terra the me right now the</font>

168
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Halloween me next to the normal me that</font>

169
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,229
isn't like a jumbled fucking mess and

170
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,310
listen to what I'm saying I just geeked

171
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,169
out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff so much i have not</font>

172
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:41,169
like read as much about philosophy as i

173
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,150
have about psychology and sometimes they

174
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,500
go hand in hand but it's like it's

175
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,990
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> different like psychology is more</font>

176
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,470
like factual these days and and

177
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,120
philosophy is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like thought</font>

178
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,320
experiments and I love thought

179
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,550
experiments I love all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font>

180
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,169
experiments<font color="#CCCCCC"> in crash crash course</font>

181
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:57,669
philosophy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I literally will not get that</font>

182
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:59,050
right the first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time ever</font>

183
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually to focus on it focus on the</font>

184
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,310
word crash and then course because

185
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,020
otherwise it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like she sells</font>

186
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,520
seashells by the seashore and I can do

187
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the first time what the fuck anyway</font>

188
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,720
um I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with you guys a</font>

189
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,680
really really good video on epistemic

190
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also one on the</font>

191
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,840
existentialism and the stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

192
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,919
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about last time it's so funny</font>

193
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:23,320
because the weather or not life has

194
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,750
meaning video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made that before i watch</font>

195
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,789
that video like a day before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watched</font>

196
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,289
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like oh my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> god it's so</font>

197
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,240
interesting to me when I haven't read

198
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,139
much about philosophy right I've

199
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">read things but from Nietzsche and some</font>

200
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,530
other philosophers like Schopenhauer and

201
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,240
I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> read their works i've</font>

202
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,069
just read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and like articles</font>

203
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">and things and it's been very</font>

204
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,439
interesting to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I've always</font>

205
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,360
straight to psychology like I said but

206
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,889
it's so interesting when I make<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own</font>

207
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,800
opinions and I make<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own ideology is</font>

208
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,479
based on my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought experiments and</font>

209
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,860
then I watched something and I've never

210
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">watched it before and they have the</font>

211
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,430
exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> same ideas or they've refuted the</font>

212
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,169
exact same ideas it's so interesting to

213
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,889
me because I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm my own</font>

214
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,270
interlocutor which means someone who

215
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,279
argues with someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> ana philosophical</font>

216
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,979
way rather than just no arguing and I'm

217
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,080
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about different perspectives</font>

218
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,520
and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> funny that someone said my</font>

219
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,500
mind I'd like I'm closed minded because

220
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,029
i feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like i'm open to so many things</font>

221
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm just so certain about the things</font>

222
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've compared what</font>

223
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,310
I think to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the world and I</font>

224
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,289
know what works for me i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

225
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:23,840
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> insinuate that what works for</font>

226
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,159
me is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or that</font>

227
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,050
I'm better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you in any way and a lot</font>

228
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people take it to be that for</font>

229
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,319
whatever reason I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why but um</font>

230
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,389
what else was I gonna say someone said

231
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay someone had said that if there's no</font>

232
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,629
meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to life or if you don't work for</font>

233
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,729
your legacy they were applying to what I

234
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,860
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> about having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a legacy being stupid</font>

235
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,969
or caring about what happens after

236
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:42,979
you're dead being stupid they said well

237
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,750
then the all the art<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you like</font>

238
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,490
before you were born never<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have</font>

239
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,379
existed or all the art that you saw from

240
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:49,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people those are there those</font>

241
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">people's legacies and I know I'm like</font>

242
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,580
paraphrasing like crazy but I'm trying

243
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to explain his thought process and my</font>

244
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,020
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that is like I don't feel</font>

245
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,550
like you should do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for the</font>

246
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,319
legacy like these people like Pink Floyd

247
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,490
they did it because they loved the music

248
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,289
because they love the lifestyle that

249
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,180
came with being a rock star and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

250
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a successful life based on my</font>

251
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,439
criteria but this is just my criteria

252
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,810
you know I don't feel like people who

253
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,159
don't love the art<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are just in it</font>

254
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,270
for the money I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like they</font>

255
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,379
should do it I feel like someone

256
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,689
everyone should always like okay if

257
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,069
you're stuck in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dead-end job if you're</font>

258
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,289
stuck in a nine-to-five job right let me

259
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:23,029
get my crown if you're stuck in a

260
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,639
nine-to-five job and you hate it it's

261
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,189
it's a means to you making enough money

262
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:30,080
for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> family which is something that</font>

263
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,879
you love or it's a means for making

264
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,110
enough money so you can start your own

265
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,070
business which is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

266
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,870
love and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me like</font>

267
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">working in a dead-end job or working in</font>

268
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,299
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't like to make</font>

269
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,919
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do like</font>

270
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,409
is great but just working so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

271
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,940
can say you've worked your entire life

272
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,829
and like done your duty like that

273
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:46,480
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

274
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,000
to me working just so you can have an

275
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,589
ego<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your legacy that doesn't make</font>

276
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,360
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to me but like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said working</font>

277
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,459
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can feed your family</font>

278
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely is it's something that should</font>

279
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,820
be it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> great you know</font>

280
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,370
something wonderful but to me the best

281
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,199
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> most successful I can be in my life</font>

282
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">is if I'm continuing to do exactly what</font>

283
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,920
I want every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day doing what I</font>

284
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,540
love thinking about the things that

285
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,339
interest me and that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that matters</font>

286
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:10,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me there's no other meaning to life</font>

287
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,990
in my opinion so if I'm enjoying like

288
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,820
Picasso's work or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and Picasso</font>

289
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,500
was just in it for the bitches let's say

290
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,010
he was I would still<font color="#CCCCCC"> be grateful that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

291
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,720
did that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't agree with his</font>

292
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,370
life choices if that makes any sense so

293
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,560
working just for legacy is probably

294
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,110
gonna produce shittier content any way

295
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,730
shittier art should hear whatever the

296
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,100
fuck and I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like it's better to</font>

297
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,810
do what you love because doing what you

298
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,990
love is trust me it's amazing and if

299
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,910
what you love is<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a legacy what</font>

300
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,380
the fuck ever but I see so many people

301
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,510
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> miserable just because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't get</font>

302
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,800
over their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own egos or because they</font>

303
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,839
can't understand their own mortality you

304
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:47,740
know what I'm saying so that's what I

305
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,639
was talking about um what I was talking

306
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,949
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> about youtubers also it seems like</font>

307
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:55,690
on YouTube there is no epistemic

308
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,370
responsibility like someone like

309
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,250
keemstar or someone like a book and

310
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Philip DeFranco can say whatever they</font>

311
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,600
want or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they think and they can</font>

312
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,370
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that some guy is that it was</font>

313
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,199
a rapist and then ruin his stream like

314
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:10,120
him started without<font color="#CCCCCC"> any actual factual</font>

315
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,639
evidence and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part sucks but I feel</font>

316
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,889
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who agree and believe</font>

317
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,959
keemstar just on<font color="#E5E5E5"> his word and go attack</font>

318
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,790
those people that's the separation

319
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">between an intelligent person and not an</font>

320
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,510
intelligent person the not intelligent

321
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,829
person being the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who just like</font>

322
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,360
bandwagons because their favorite

323
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
youtuber says something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am very</font>

324
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">much against I'm very much against my</font>

325
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,880
fans just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and attacking</font>

326
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,829
people that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like but I'm also</font>

327
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:35,139
very much against telling my fans what

328
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,000
to do I believe and when I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> fans I</font>

329
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,769
mean be yours you know

330
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,809
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to be yeah you know I</font>

331
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,059
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like the fruit the fucking</font>

332
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,829
term<font color="#E5E5E5"> fans when it comes to people on</font>

333
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:44,999
YouTube who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just supporting you I</font>

334
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,949
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it separates you in a</font>

335
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:48,300
different dichotomy a different social

336
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,559
structure and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font>

337
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,689
I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are my friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

338
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:53,040
I hate that I said the word so now I

339
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,389
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on a tangent to tell you guys</font>

340
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,779
that but um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

341
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,970
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good indicator of someone who has</font>

342
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,499
their own sense of self and their own

343
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:02,730
intelligence and can<font color="#CCCCCC"> think for</font>

344
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,379
themselves when they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go like</font>

345
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:05,790
Oh Philip DeFranco is my favorite

346
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,649
youtuber he thinks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so-and-so is bad</font>

347
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:09,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">will so do I like you should never be</font>

348
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,699
like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should never take</font>

349
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:13,049
someone's word for it even if it's a

350
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,239
publication that you think has some kind

351
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,279
of clout you know you should actually do

352
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own research you should actually</font>

353
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:19,619
think for yourself and that's very

354
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,839
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and if we enforce</font>

355
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
epistemic<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility there would be</font>

356
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,470
no distinction it would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font>

357
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,790
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people not having opinions because</font>

358
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,739
they're too lazy to actually to actually

359
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,839
like research anything um and it's nice

360
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,100
to have that distinction but at the same

361
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,869
time I'm a bit torn what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

362
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,339
think about epistemic<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibilities</font>

363
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,290
do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people shouldn't spout off</font>

364
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,269
about Christianity unless they have

365
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,799
factual proof do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

366
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,910
shouldn't spout off about things I feel

367
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,679
to be a good person in my opinion based

368
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,899
on my moral standards you should have to

369
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,179
say this is my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is in fact</font>

370
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,420
but it's not really again like it's also

371
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,160
not your responsibility to tell people

372
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,839
how like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they shouldn't believe you</font>

373
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,790
don't saying so people should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

374
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,139
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think for themselves I should be</font>

375
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things as if they're fact</font>

376
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,809
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be able to know that it's</font>

377
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,279
not fact because it's clearly just my

378
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,799
opinion unless I present the perfect

379
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,660
proof for you that actually makes it

380
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,279
makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect you don't have time I'm</font>
