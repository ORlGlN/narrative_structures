43
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,560
know that starcraft is not dallying

44
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,479
obviously I mean brood war was like a

45
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,070
much worse seen in a much smaller seen

46
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,930
it stuck around for what like 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

47
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,150
or some crazy shit like that so I don't

48
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,759
have any like worries about that I'm

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,229
just more worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the na scene</font>

50
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,850
because any scene is pretty small and

51
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,380
there aren't that many<font color="#E5E5E5"> like good players</font>

52
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,329
in the first place but all the marketing
