00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,060
general something they desire rather

110
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,850
than having more time my phone got full

111
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,950
and instead of me just deleting the

112
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,780
previous vlogs actually needed those

113
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,540
vlogs so if I had known when I got this

127
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,840
try um<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't really understand</font>

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,419
why people want to work or they say that

129
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:27,680
they feel unfulfilled if they're not

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,570
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they just like my dad's like</font>

131
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,090
this as well he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> always had to have a</font>

132
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,680
job he's always had to excel in his job

133
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
his jobs never been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important but</font>

134
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,770
he made it important to himself and I

135
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,840
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt like that was because all of</font>

136
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,880
his hobbies or something were not

137
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,470
something he was really passionate about

138
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,780
and he wasn't as passionate about like

139
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,880
coming home and spending time<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home</font>

140
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,460
like just was something that he didn't

141
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,360
like and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people</font>

142
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">have home lives where they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they need the</font>

143
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,310
guys nights out or they need the break

144
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,110
from their family<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

145
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,150
understood if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> child</font>

146
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,110
unfortunately I would never<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a child</font>

147
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,070
and I probably wouldn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font>

148
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,590
home and spend time in my bachelor pad

149
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,910
if it was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer a bachelor pad and</font>

150
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,800
became a fucking prison place I don't

151
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,330
know but I also wanted to talk about

152
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">this because it makes sense to at this</font>

153
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,330
time because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you a</font>

154
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,580
couple of the changes that I made to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

155
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,220
apartment um and how I cleaned up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

156
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,680
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it much nicer and cooler and</font>

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,729
added some cool things and I want to

158
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:23,810

270
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,390
my perspective and I might not know

271
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,430
someone else's perspective and a lot of

272
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">people say that I'm set in my ways and</font>

273
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,940
i'm conceited or pretentious about like

274
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,700
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think and what i say but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

275
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,980
at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm totally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to being wrong</font>

276
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,440
I'm totally open to the fact that things

277
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,670
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me and don't work for other</font>

278
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,070
people and I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear why</font>

279
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,660
someone thinks it's better to go work

280
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,300
than to spend time<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home like I get it</font>

281
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,700
if you're like needing to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

282
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,010
your family or if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

283
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,050
passions that can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> money like being</font>

284
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,700
a writer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really make any</font>

285
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,890
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime anyone majors and that</font>

286
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,320
should I'm like oh god I was gonna major

287
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,810
in that I'm so god I'm so fucking glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

288
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,690
dodged that bullet oh fuck dude I'm like

289
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,480
so hyper because I'm on caffeine pills

290
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,180
and then fucking tired because I've been

291
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">running around the house and not taking</font>

292
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,020
breaths into my sentences but uh yeah um

293
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,030
I feel like those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

294
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,710
happier in life if they got a hobby that

295
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,480
worked towards some kind of goal that

296
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,010
they had for themselves rather than just

297
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,610
being a cog in a very large corporate

298
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,160
wheel or you know just doing some labor

299
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,140
for someone else when it's not really

300
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,520
for you it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like for a paycheck</font>

301
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,110
that doesn't seem like a fulfilling life

302
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,850
and I'm so glad that I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

303
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,740
that and so it doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to me</font>

304
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,020
when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose to do that rather</font>

305
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,700
than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know spending the time doing</font>

306
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,139
what they

307
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:00,609
so please let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think on</font>

308
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,410
