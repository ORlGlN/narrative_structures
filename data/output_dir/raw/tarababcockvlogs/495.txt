20
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,940
anyway um I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

21
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,250
about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> an only child since someone</font>

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,020
recommended that at all remember who it

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,850
was I'm sorry but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can post down</font>

24
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,980
on in the video and say yeah I was the

25
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,210
one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it that would be pretty</font>

26
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool I would appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

27
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,809
hopefully the cropping isn't too fucking

28
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,230
terrible because I'm far away but<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50</font>

29
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,789
millimeter it's a little weird I don't

30
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:00,719
know I'm still trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font>

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,260
to use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kim court so anyway um I</font>

32
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,880
have never I don't feel like I have any

33
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,979
like weird social repercussions from

34
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,080
growing up<font color="#CCCCCC"> an only child it's funny</font>

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,400
because a lot of people say like oh you

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,900
don't learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share you don't learn</font>

37
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know interact with other kids</font>

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,979
it's really lonely and important that

39
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,110
children have brothers and sisters so

40
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,880
that they can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn certain</font>

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,500
social skills that they wouldn't other

42
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,049
otherwise get you know being so isolated

43
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,000
but to me that would make sense if

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,729
you're like Amish and you don't have any

45
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,200
classmates you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go to school you're</font>

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,000
like home school or something I learned

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,159
a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know from my parents</font>

48
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,220
and just I got a lot more attention I

49
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,659
feel like it's better to be an only

50
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,299
child than to be one of like 10 I don't

51
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,740
know I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a lot of viewers</font>

52
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,030
who are one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 and stuff</font>

53
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,979
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear your experiences as</font>

54
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,450
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like if you're an only child or</font>

55
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,979
if you are the opposite of an only child

56
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,080
and you have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 10-person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font>

57
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,729
family I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

58
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,530
sides of the story to kind of get an

59
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of what both is like but for me it</font>

60
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,670
was great I was spoiled yeah but I feel

61
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,440
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just because my parents had</font>

62
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,119
enough income to spoil me I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font>

63
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:07,330
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> family has enough income to spoil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

64
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,649
children they're going to spoil<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

65
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,830
children but um really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what the</font>

66
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,540
what they lack if there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

67
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,640
children in the family is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the emotional</font>

68
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,350
spoiling and sometimes emotional

69
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,489
spoiling can make you may be

70
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,080
narcissistic or a little bit into

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,700
yourself and I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that's</font>

72
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,870
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me maybe the fact that</font>

73
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,519
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents told me that I can do</font>

74
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,870
anything and gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything I wanted</font>

75
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,630
you know made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> strive to get more out</font>

76
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,640
of life when I finally working on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,110
and working for myself hopefully that's

78
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,700
not too loud I should maybe go close the

79
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,880
door I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but um I feel like I</font>

80
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,970
was raised very well my parents set an

81
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,550
example for me but they told me not to

82
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,780
really follow in their footsteps and

83
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,370
just do what I wanted to do and a lot of

84
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">people try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to emulate themselves onto</font>

85
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,880
their kids and try to live vicariously

86
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,650
through their children then I can be

87
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">very detrimental to like a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

88
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,310
like little pageant girls it's not

89
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,530
necessarily bad for you to put your like

90
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,890
toddler into pageantry and stuff but it

91
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,660
can be if you're forcing them to do

92
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,070
something they clearly are not happy

93
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,230
doing and a lot of parents do that like

94
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,910
a lot of the child actors were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

95
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,350
forced into it because their parents are

96
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,239
too old or too washed up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they end up</font>

97
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,519
not really having a childhood I think

98
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,840
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a childhood</font>

99
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,370
and I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> did have a childhood</font>

100
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,980
everything I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did I did when I was ready</font>

101
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,299
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was ready to experiment with</font>

102
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,709
drugs when I was interesting that I did

103
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,690
when I was you know getting horny and

104
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,940
ready to experience my sexuality I did

105
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,739
that and I had the full support of my

106
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,420
family who I didn't always tell

107
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,950
everything to because I didn't want to

108
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,049
get yelled at or scorned but for me it

109
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,519
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> more like my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parents would be like</font>

110
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,010
hey you should be very fucking careful

111
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,760
and then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

112
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,090
to me from doing things that would maybe

113
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,799
promote that kind of behavior like I

114
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,840
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to stay out past 12 I</font>

115
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,269
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed to like take the bus</font>

116
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,829
really far away from home I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

117
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,480
allowed to like skip school or stay home

118
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,099
if it was obvious that i was you know

119
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,440
faking and that kind of thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

120
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,849
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as you said the boundaries and</font>

121
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:57,379
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like I would be really</font>

122
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,940
good parent if I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a parent</font>

123
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,799
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't want to be a parent I would</font>

124
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">teach my kid that you should do whatever</font>

125
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,670
the fuck he wants but that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

126
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,890
health<font color="#E5E5E5"> and safety and the law come first</font>

127
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,989
and I would teach them why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

128
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,370
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would teach them about</font>

129
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,959
sexuality instead of trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide it</font>

130
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so many families try</font>

131
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,358
to just like pie to violence and

132
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,949
sexuality from their kids and then they

133
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,690
end up being curious about it and

134
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,190
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out fighting it out in the wrong</font>

135
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,380
way and experimenting and being clueless

136
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,850
and totally burning everything like you

137
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,830
can become pregnant like imagine a

138
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,090
situation where you're completely

139
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,280
sheltered from anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> sexual and then</font>

140
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,740
your parents aren't helping you out and

141
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,150
the school is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not teaching you correctly</font>

142
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,070
and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would go off and you like</font>

143
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,810
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize you're horny and you feel</font>

144
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,280
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my god</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of thing is</font>

145
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,630
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what to do I feel so</font>

146
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,490
shameful I don't have anyone actually

147
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,050
teaching me what to do so you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font>

148
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do you do you fucking pregnant but</font>

149
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:48,080
you didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're supposed to</font>

150
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,090
use condoms because you didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

151
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,440
sex is a healthy thing you feel ashamed

152
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it and a lot of people are still</font>

153
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,510
shaving children these days so yeah this

wanted once my dad and my mom got better

158
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,699
jobs I when I was really young they had

159
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,260
an Atari which was way before my time

160
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,699
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I played and that was my</font>

161
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,440
first game console and my mom was a very

162
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,690
she had a weird childhood um some would

163
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,060
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very bad childhood so she wanted</font>

164
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,470
to give me everything that she didn't

165
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,300
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was a very strong stance</font>

166
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,340
that she took so I could like walk by

167
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,110
and be like God you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I really</font>

168
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,810
want this<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of action figure or</font>

song details whatever stuffed animal and

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,110
then they would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ends of the</font>

172
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,760

173
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,320
can't have this and then I leave and

174
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,880
then like 10 minutes later<font color="#E5E5E5"> champ come to</font>

175
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,440
my room and be like okay if you clean

177
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,650
not cleaning my room and going to a

178
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,210
friend's house to spend the night and

179
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,380

didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually work out like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

182
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,830
that's often how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like I i learned</font>

183
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,350
to get my way too often and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was one</font>

184
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that kind of sucked because in the</font>

185

real word world you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like realize</font>

186
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,360
there are some things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> factually</font>

187
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,450
cannot get like you make a mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

188

can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that home and back and i had</font>

189
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,810
to realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are things I can't</font>

190
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,540
change and push for and get my way with

191
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,680
and there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I absolutely</font>

192
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't and therefore I need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just let</font>

193
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,130
it go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that was something I needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

194
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,800
learn myself but I it was never really

195
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,560
an issue for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like nothing being alone</font>

196
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,420
was wonderful my mom actually adopted

197
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,960
one of my friends um when I was in

198
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,790
Middle High so i think was high school

199
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,380
when she adopted my friend because<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

200
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,800
friend was being abused by her para ma

201
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">man her stepdad and she had a pretty</font>

202
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,330
shitty life and she was like just taking

203
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,920
care of her little<font color="#E5E5E5"> brother always and</font>

204
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">never really had time for a social life</font>

205
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,580
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else pretty much and she was</font>

206
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,930
one of my best friends but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I realized</font>

207
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,790
living with her that I fucking hated her

208
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,140
after a while she<font color="#E5E5E5"> became a totally</font>

209
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,220
different person to me I don't know if

210
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,200
she changed or if it was just because I

211
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,880
was living with<font color="#E5E5E5"> her and that kind of</font>

212
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,800
like tested our relationship but we

213
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,990
ended up never talking again really

214
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">after she moved out and she became like</font>

215
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">a huge bitch and it was just kind of</font>

216
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,630
awful and I don't know so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

217
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,330
stopped being friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like if</font>

218
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,400
I had grown up all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> with her I</font>

219
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,980
wouldn't like her but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would maybe have</font>

220
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> book</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not paternal that</font>

221
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,030
familial like love that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

222
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,350
about which I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really understand</font>

223
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,110
because like my parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> were great and I</font>

224
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,120
would i like them as people so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

225
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,280
I you know love them but I can't imagine

226
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,009
the way

227
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,749
my friend felt when she was being abused

228
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,330
and sexually assaulted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and being taken</font>

229

00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">had missed her mom when spending time in</font>

my house with my amazing fucking parents

232
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,969
that took care of her like<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy and it</font>

233
