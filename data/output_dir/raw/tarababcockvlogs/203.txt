00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,770
through a century in time besides the

63
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,960
correct 21st century<font color="#E5E5E5"> and its entire a</font>

hundred year span with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a non aging body</font>

65
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,030
or at the very least with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifespan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

66
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,740
vast that a century of time would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

67
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,659
negligible what century would you live

68
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,008
through century of the first millennium

69
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,229
in the 11th century or even as far back

70
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,510
as bc ii era the viewers must know

71
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,640
oh haha<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know overly detailed but it's</font>

76
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,340
would want to go forward in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

77
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,200
I feel like how technology and society

78
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,299
will advance is very interesting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

79
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:29,040
but at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would want to go</font>

80
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,230
back and experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the times when</font>

81
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,810
women weren't is free or when philosophy

82
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,120
or being a philosopher was actually like

83
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,620
a job<font color="#CCCCCC"> description and you could just</font>

84
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,659
like think up the most obvious things

85
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,190
that are obvious to me but still not

86
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,260
obvious to the rest of society and speak

87
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,030
them freely and then like have a job

88
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,489
doing that or like inventors like back

89
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:48,599
in the day when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have</font>

90
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,980
telephones and the means of

91
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,590
communication was so limited or I don't

92
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,970
know maybe I would want to live through

93
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,680
if I was immune to it like the bubonic

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,019
plague or like when there were lepers

95
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,209
running around everywhere or when plague

96
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,159
doctors had the masks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I would</font>

97
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ezio's time zone like the</font>

98
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,139
assassins creed SEO trilogy time zone

99
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,180
back in Italy and I don't know

100
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,040
experience all that I don't know why but

101
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,599
something about that like I've always

102
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,129
wanted to go to Italy I hate traveling

103
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,120
but I've always wanted to go to Italy

104
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,799
just so I could be like I climbed that

105
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,449
Assassin's Creed I don't know what I

106
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,560
would want to do like seriously there

107
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,030
are so many things i would like to

108
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,829
experience just to expand my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own mind</font>

109
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,660
but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be fun to try to live</font>

110
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,829
in a prehistoric time where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to</font>

111
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,260
scavenge for food where I'm one of the

112
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,180
only if not the only current modern

113
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,340
humans<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have no idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't say</font>

114
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,290
definitively because i feel like any era

115
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,970
that you put me in<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would gain</font>

116
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,230
something from that and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

117
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,699
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

118
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,980
one I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would want to live in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would</font>

119
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,329
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know the stipulations like in my</font>

120
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,859
immune to death maybe I would want to go

121
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,269
back to World War<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 or World War to</font>

122
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:46,859
stick me anywhere but here and I would
