00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
hey guys I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,360
do today I'm honestly only doing a

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,540
superfluous video because I like my look

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,610
today I like the red lips I like the

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,290
blonde hair<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue eyes I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,440
glasses and the hair to the side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,509
whole secretary look there's a hair in

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,940
between my boobs and it sucks because

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two days I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been using this</font>

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,430
like scrub that scrubs off my tan and I

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,689
haven't gone tanning for like two days

12
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,789
so if I'm little splotchy I'm sorry it's

13
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,380
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the sex or the titty fucking</font>

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,140
this time but the the topics that I was

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,079
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing today are my family</font>

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and my childhood or the story about the</font>

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">cute guy from college and since I'm</font>

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,309
dressed like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided to go with</font>

19
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,770
the cute guy from college<font color="#E5E5E5"> also because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

20
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,780
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should give more time and</font>

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,510
thought to all of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i want</font>

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you guys from my childhood</font>

23
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,090
because i had an amazing fucking

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,710
childhood and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

25
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,969
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of people will view</font>

26
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,010
because they think that I must have had

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">some terrible traumatic childhood</font>

28
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,390
because you know they were taught a

29
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,640
certain to think a certain way about sex

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,979
and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way so</font>

31
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,450
they're like there must be something

32
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,939
wrong with her because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in a lot</font>

33
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,150
of situations and a lot of instances

34
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,220
that they're right they would be right

35
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,020
there is something that happened to

36
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,580
someone in their childhood to make them

37
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,860
become a<font color="#E5E5E5"> porn star or whatnot but mainly</font>

38
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,020
I really feel like the people who become

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,810
a pornstar become a porn star in this

40
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,700
society because they had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucked up</font>

41
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,590
childhood because of the way people

42
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,540
treat pornstars not because porn is

43
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,000
doing porn but more<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know you</font>

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,979
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be crazy to want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be treated</font>

45
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,720
like a porn star to be treated<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,130
garbage in the society that's how we

47
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,380
view it because you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

76
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,520
went to college when I was a junior and

77
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,320
a senior in high school through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

78
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,580
program called Running Start which is

79
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,830
basically for gifted children who are

80
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,390
bored with the regular curriculum of

81
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,680
high school and want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their high</font>

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,300
school credits and their college courses

83
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,490
simultaneously and I was bored with it

84
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,020
because let's face it fucking college or

85
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,260
public schools in America are so fucking

86
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,240

00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,610
imbeciles and it was the easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the world and I was bored and I was</font>

not like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very popular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but not for</font>

90
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right reasons and it wasn't like a</font>

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,570
sex thing it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't into rap and that was like the</font>

94
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,630
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't into you know I guess you</font>

95
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,250
know weapon called ghetto cultures and I

96
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,080
still to this day can't stand ghetto

97
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,550
culture and I'm not attracted to anyone

98
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,380
who's into that and a lot of people

99
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,000
disliked me because I wasn't like that

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
and then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was another instance with</font>

101
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,959
a guy where I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of beat him up for</font>

102
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">calling me a name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then after that he</font>

103
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,080
started egging my house I just wanted to

104
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away from the negativity I don't</font>

105
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,080
like drama as much as people think that

106
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,220
someone who looks like me might like

107
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,110
drama I liked hearing about other

108
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,950
people's drama because that's

109
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,500
interesting i ey<font color="#E5E5E5"> irie i watch videos</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> shannon roses storytime videos</font>

111
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,739
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're it's entertaining it's</font>

112
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,870
like it's like fiction but in real life

113
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,510
well for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am much more into not</font>

114

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,220
I like you know I like spontaneity but

116
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,900
not like negative spontaneity if that

117
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,220

00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you know power lifters are like as</font>

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,370
big as bodybuilders sometimes they're

150
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,990
often just like really muscle band and

151
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,070
really huge but they also have a layer

152
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,170
of fat over them and that's like I think

153
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,480
my favorite body shape a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,680

<font color="#E5E5E5">care about low body fat at all as long</font>

159
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,200

160
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,850
gigantic pneus that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like and</font>

165
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,700
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> there all the time and he was right</font>

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,740
at home in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the weight training</font>

167
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,520
class but in ceramics he was like so bad

168
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,220
it was so cute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he seemed like a</font>

169
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,570
really nice guy I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never actually talked</font>

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to him but I I watched him for so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

171
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,120
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all I didn't ceramic class I</font>

172
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,060
watched him try to make pots and like he

173
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,160
would like be shaping something and just

174
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,650
just ruin it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks so sad</font>

175
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,000
and it was so cute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was like the</font>

176
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,830
the most attractive sexy thing in the

177
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,380
world that like he was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> big guy who</font>

178
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,750
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know basically just pet an</font>

179
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,000
animal and be and be gentle but he kept

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,530
ruining everything he touches because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

181
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">was so strong and it was like so cute</font>

182
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,120
and he had this like cute cute like a

183
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,830
young face and he was clearly like a

184
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,030
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years older than me at that point</font>

185
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,720
because I was like 17<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 16 and he was</font>

186
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,850
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> college</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aged and it was so</font>

187
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,110
adorable watching Morgan he would be

188
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,490
alone he was always alone he never had

189
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,020
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> like loud annoying friends which is</font>

190
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,880
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i've alway</font>

191
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,770
despise about men who are more alpha<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

192
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,320
like when a guy looks alpha and you know

193
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,090
he is alpha but I like alpha in the

194
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,480
bedroom but like I like an intelligent

195
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,460
smart person who also has different

196
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,230
traits to him other than just keeping up

197
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,790
an appearance of alpha nice you know

198
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,440
like that fake appearance of alpha pneus

199
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,990
isn't attractive to me like real alpha

200
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,940
pneus or like working toward a physique

201
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,620
that just screams alpha like that's what

202
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,970
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tribe that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's attractive to me</font>

203
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,790
and having like insecurities like he

204
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,410
clearly did and having you know things

205
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he's bad at and it's just so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Karen</font>

206
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think he knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was</font>

207
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,770
watching him but um he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so bad it was</font>

208
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,090
so cute I would always tell Jay<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

209
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,790
because Jay was um he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

210
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,110
college<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well at that time because</font>

211
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,310
he's two years older than me she was

212
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,620
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like actual University and he</font>

213
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,680

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,540
like hang out and play diablo on laptop

215
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,040
and I would see him and play with him in

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">between classes and we would hang out</font>

217
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,910
there and that was a pretty cool

218
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience and a fun experience was</font>

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,670
really like coding I've been HTML and

360
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,980
CSS coding my self taught obviously

361
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,500
since I was like 14 because of my space

362
