00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
hey guys today I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">you advice on how not to be shy and how</font>

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,670
to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> up confidence so that you're</font>

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,069
not shy I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this video a</font>

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,750
while back and then it turned<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,670
video ranting about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Li like</font>

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,049
interacting with the general public

8
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,289
because a lot of them are I feel

9
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">unintelligent or boring and so I don't</font>

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,350
like engaging conversations with random

11
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,060
people that I meet out in the public

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,189
unless you know they have

13
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,769
like-mindedness so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

14
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:26,970
comes up to me and they're like oh I

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">like your work or something then I'm</font>

16
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,849
definitely giving them hugs and I love

17
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,740
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I generally like those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

18
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,120
because I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we already have</font>

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,110
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in common and we're like</font>

20
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,280
minded but if I'm like at a magic

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">tournament or at a grocery store and I</font>

22
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,960
just kind of avoid those conversations

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,300
so anyway you can find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> video if</font>

24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,460
you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but before I</font>

25
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,200
go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

26
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,270
don't claim<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have any kind of like</font>

27
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,210
amazing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice on this topic I</font>

28
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,890
just feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like with a lot of other</font>

29
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,010
topics I give a differing perspective

30
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,969
than most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and therefore</font>

31
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:01,020
giving you a different perspective might

32
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,640
actually help you see things differently

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of combat your shyness so</font>

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,689
that's what I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be offering</font>

35
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,570
here today is my philosophy<font color="#CCCCCC"> on why some</font>

36
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,250
people are shy and what you can maybe do

37
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,799
to negate that a little bit hopefully

38
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,090
this is interesting and hopefully this

39
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,799
is a better video than my other attempt

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,659
because the last time I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I did</font>

41
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,210
you guys dirty first I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say if</font>

42
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">you feel like you have debilitating</font>

43
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,710
agoraphobia or something where you're

44
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,240
afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go outside or you can't be in</font>

45
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,799
crowds and it's like something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

46
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,409
can't use logic and rationale to

47
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,180
overcome at all then you should

48
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,430
definitely see a doctor I feel like if

49
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,530
you live in any of the first world's you

50
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,650
have the luxury of being able to go and

51
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,549
have the healthcare provider assess you

52
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,380
and give you whatever medication or

53
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,310
consultation with a counselor you might

54
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,290
need because I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

55
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,880
are just acting oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a first world</font>

56
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,560
problem or oh it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that big of a</font>

57
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,240
deal but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> owe it to yourself to be as</font>

58
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,250
psychologically and mentally and

59
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,619
physically healthy as you possibly can

60
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,210
you know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and you have</font>

61
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,649
insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

62
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,270
doctors who can help you with that and I

63
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,830
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that bettering yourself</font>

64
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,480
and feeling

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,909
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself in general is worth it</font>

66
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,470
it's worth the extra money if you have

67
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,390
it it's worth you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time spent</font>

68
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,340
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to doctors and trying out</font>

69
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,540
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a hundred</font>

70
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent into medicating in order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

71
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,849
know overcome certain psychological

72
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,530
issues i don't know how effective that

73
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,480
is but it's worth a shot<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my opinion</font>

74
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,950
if you're living<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some kind of fear</font>

75
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,349
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of anxiety that isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

76
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,620
your run-of-the-mill shyness or you know

77
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">interpersonal skills or something you</font>

78
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,569
should definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> check that out so</font>

79
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">today we're going to talk about shyness</font>

80
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,920
why do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are generally shy</font>

81
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,590
I think it's often a preoccupied idea of

82
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,040
the bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that might happen if you</font>

83
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,959
are to be more outgoing like for

84
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,190
instance if you want to go talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

85
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,379
girl that you find attractive or a girl

86
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,060
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to date maybe you think</font>

87
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,849
that that conversation might go horribly

88
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,230
wrong and then you end up you know

89
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,519
making the fool of yourself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

90
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are just afraid of making fools</font>

91
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,849
of themselves and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

92
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">just so not something that you should</font>

93
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,840
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all I mean like first of</font>

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,419
all if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidence or if you can</font>

95
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,310
fake confidence usually faking things

96
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,060
makes you obtain those things eventually

97
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,200
especially in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of like what kind of</font>

98
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,519
personality traits<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would like to</font>

99
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">change or enhance so if you don't feel</font>

100
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,139
confident just learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good actor</font>

101
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,489
for a while and eventually you'll

102
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,530
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

103
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,299
weren't confident about your now

104
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,040
confident about because you got good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

105
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,169
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the acting so like learning</font>

106
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,200
how to like take defeat and to take

107
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,230
awkward social situations and handle

108
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,120
them gracefully it's like an art and

109
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can learn and</font>

110
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,519
therefore you'll negate your shyness so

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,260
like for instance of you go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a girl</font>

112
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,870
and you ask her out I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've talked</font>

113
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,950
about this a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> before in a</font>

114
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,000
different video I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember which</font>

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
but if you talk to a girl new ask her

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,849
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes horribly wrong with</font>

117
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,680
let's say she's like you smelled that

118
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,480
you're gross and you're awful well the

119
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">first thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should go through your</font>

120
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind is this person didn't treat you</font>

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,060
fairly this person didn't treat you like

122
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,560
a human being like you should be treated

123
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">she didn't she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't genial to you she</font>

124
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,728
wasn't how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be treated and</font>

125
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,769
therefore fuck that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitch she's a bitch</font>

126
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,959
you don't like she doesn't deserve your

127
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,630
time basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's just stupid</font>

128
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,820
thinking that way and having self-worth

129
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,410
and having confidence will make you feel

130
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better after that the way you</font>

131
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,830
react<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and how like your let's say</font>

132
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,080
classmates or coworkers you know how

133
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">they perceive you is all on you like if</font>

134
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,830
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like take it gracefully</font>

135
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,020
take it gracefully and be like whoa how

136
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,200
to grow your problem is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay instead</font>

137
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there there are a few things</font>

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people do in that situation that</font>

139
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,870
are completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong one of them is</font>

140
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,160
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to be like okay bitch I</font>

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,510
wasn't into you anyway and that's like a

142
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,520
defense mechanism for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ego basically</font>

143
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,960
like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people will act that way</font>

144
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,810
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will like you know implode</font>

145
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,080
into a ball of like sadness and allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

146
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually affect their mood and like</font>

147
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,550
hurt their you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know social status</font>

148
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,380
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they tucked their tail</font>

149
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,820
between their legs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> walked away but</font>

150
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,050
really what you have to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just act</font>

151
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,540
with confidence be like okay sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> geez</font>

152
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,580
and then really I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what her</font>

153
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,190
problem is or like oh it's okay more

154
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,320
fish in the sea and just be happy and be

155
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,050
generally positive and confident and

156
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,400
like if you react that way a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

157
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">people will see that and they'll see</font>

158
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,710
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> positivity and they'll be drawn</font>

159
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,140
into you so whether or not you can do

160
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,120
that like confidently naturally or

161
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,350
whether or not you're faking it either

162
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,670
way it's going to go better for you in

163
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,520
the long run another thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

164
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">really understand is a lot of the</font>

165
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,940
shyness like sometimes shyness is ok

166
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,340
sometimes shyness is you know purposeful

167
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,390
like they just don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk right</font>

168
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,160
now they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to you know interact</font>

169
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,300
with people a lot or they just don't

170
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,360
find social<font color="#E5E5E5"> situations fun I can kind of</font>

171
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,280
empathize with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a bunch of</font>

172
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways as I stated in the other</font>

173
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,950
video that was supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be this video</font>

174
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,130
but really like shyness can hold you

175
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,380
back so much and if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with</font>

176
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,600
thinking what if rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than being like</font>

177
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
oh that was kind of awkward for a minute

178
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,180
then yeah be shy but if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

179
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,620
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend the rest of your life</font>

180
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,000
with some girl<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you like if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

181
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a conversation with her or it's</font>

182
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,380
possible you could get your dream job if

183
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,000
you just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know become more outgoing</font>

184
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,700
to like Network a little bit more it's

185
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,530
so worth it for you to overcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

186
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,930
fears and anxieties you have and often

187
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,250
times especially if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still in</font>

188
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,040
school you can feel like the universe is

189
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,780
a bubble<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything that's happening</font>

190
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,220
to you right there right now like your

191
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,480
social status what your friends think of

192
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you what you're not friends think of you</font>

193
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,930
all the frenemies you have and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

194
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,010
shit if you actually think that that

195
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,260
social crap matters

196
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,690
it really doesn't like we're you are

197
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,550
only in this situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a few years</font>

198
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,720
and they can move on if you're in a in a

199
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,000
like work situation you can always move

200
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,380
on from that or you can just you know

201
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,000
mind your own business ladies there's

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> socially that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can that you</font>

203
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,810
can't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back from you know what I'm</font>

204
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,880
saying like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that big of a deal</font>

205
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,740
and so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think that like these</font>

206
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,930
little you know bad interactions are a

207
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,070
big deal and another thing you need to

208
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,750
remember is that when you have a bad

209
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,080
interaction with someone socially and

210
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,460
you think that oh my god that went so

211
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,350
terrible you are your own worst critic

212
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,610
and it didn't go as terrible as you

213
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,920
think it did trust me it's not as bad as

214
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,040
you think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it never is and if you</font>

215
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,890
can just be confident and be like I made

216
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,440
a mistake or oh you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

217
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,820
just be like shrug it off and just be a

218
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,520
happy-go-lucky person in general then it

219
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,430
doesn't affect you as much as it would

220
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,990
if you like tuck your tail between your

221
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,080
legs or reacted hostile like oh my god

222
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,820
you fucking bitch will fuck you then and

223
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,350
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't I don't really know if I'm</font>

224
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,490
covering everything that I wanted to

225
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover it's really hard to do these one</font>

226
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,210
take videos I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> liked want to make</font>

227
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,340
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm in the best mood you know</font>

228
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always want to make sure that I've</font>

229
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,160
been thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the topic all day</font>

230
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,080
and then that makes me preoccupied<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

231
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,460
the topic because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in the shower</font>

232
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,020
thinking about it I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sleep some</font>

233
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,220
thinking about it and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

234
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,860
formulate in what way I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

235
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,510
talking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video but then I</font>

236
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,550
end up like missing things or leaving

237
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,630
things out because I didn't write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

238
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,400
script I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> write anything down and</font>

239
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
I'm not doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this like with cuts and</font>

240
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,110
stuff so um if I miss anything please

241
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,750
post it in the comments but it's all

242
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,370
just a mind trick it's all just mind

243
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,690
games and if you can be more strategic

244
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,360
about it you'll eventually gain that

245
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,890
confidence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn what you need to</font>

246
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,810
learn and as for gaining confidence in

247
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,820
the first place for like body image or

248
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,160
social image or anything like that in my

249
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,830
opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will feel so much better if</font>

250
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,410
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a game plan and</font>

251
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're on a path to improving yourself</font>

252
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,530
like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people think that they</font>

253
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be exactly as God created them</font>

254
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,400
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to me is baloney but if that</font>

255
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,599
makes you happy then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should do it</font>

256
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you are like preoccupied with</font>

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,789
your body not being perfect or you don't

260
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,459
in a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> way first of all do</font>

261
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,779
everything for yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> like who cares</font>

262
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,040
what other people think do what makes

certain way or acting a certain way then

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,629
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like some people can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that and</font>

305
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,129
try them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on themselves to have a</font>

306
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,870
hobby<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have improvement like that</font>

307
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,850
takes your mind off of anything bad and

308
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,189
it can alleviate anybody feeling is you

309
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,279
have of anxiety and really you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

310
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,990
to find yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so many shy people</font>

311
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,120
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know who they are and a lot</font>

312
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in general don't really know</font>

313
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,899
who they are and they're so worried

314
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,459
about like what how other people

315
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,050
perceive them that they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

316
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,629
find out who they are on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside and</font>

317
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,819
who they want to be and it shouldn't be

318
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,170
a reflection of anyone else and it

319
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,819
shouldn't be a reflection of what

320
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">society tells you that you should be or</font>

321
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,329
you know if someone calls you ugly or

322
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,649
someone calls you fat or someone calls

323
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,970
you stupid or someone says your

324
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,430
interests are like dumb or a waste of

325
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">time like all this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff shouldn't</font>

326
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,459
matter it should matter what makes you

327
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,819
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> what excites</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you what makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

328
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,559
feel like you are living your life to

the fullest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once you're doing all of</font>

330
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,839
that I I really feel like anyone who's

331
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,209
shy will come out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their shell because</font>

332
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,309
they understand who they are and they

333
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,799
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know all of their flaws and</font>

334
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,539
no one else can<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring them down so there</font>

335
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,519
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many times that I have felt like</font>

336
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation could have gone better or</font>

337
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,749
I have felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all white and I just</font>

338
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,970
say that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens often and you</font>

339
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,889
can't just be like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent on</font>

340
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,959
your game<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick-witted every time but</font>

341
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,249
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is you can take your</font>

342
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:30,319
failures and turn them into<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

343
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't really a failure it's just</font>

344
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:35,209
kind of like whatever we'll get them

345
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,859
next time and if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't like</font>

346
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,989
you for you or someone doesn't want to

347
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,609
date you who you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to date just move</font>

348
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:42,439
on it's their fucking loss like you're

349
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,389
awesome you're unique there's no one

350
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:48,079
like you so hopefully that has given<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

351
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,279
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of perspective I've never</font>

352
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,489
been a shy person so it's hard for me I

353
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:53,720
can see it from a different perspective

354
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,350
and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm telling you the</font>

355
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,239
things that I have done my entire life

356
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,559
in order to not be shy I've always just

357
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,899
been confident in myself and then the

358
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:05,869
way I handle like perceived

359
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:07,369
embarrassment<font color="#CCCCCC"> or perceived bad</font>

360
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:10,970
situations is just like it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

361
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,129
just like just happens and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't feel</font>

362
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:15,229
anything about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't worry</font>

363
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:17,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">about something that might happen that's</font>

364
