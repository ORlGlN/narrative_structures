00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,000

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,069

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,990
car vlog well I get ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go grocery</font>

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,000

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,780
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff for tomato soup and grilled</font>

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,250
cheese and I also need some yogurts for

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,949
my roommates lunch and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> else was it</font>

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,869
oh yeah coffee shakes which are the

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,430
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use in the morning to wake</font>

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,119
up and feel more awake throughout the

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,859
day it's also a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protein like a</font>

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,380
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> protein so it's good but um I</font>

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't done a vlog for a while and it's</font>

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,340
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because on the weekends when</font>

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm with my roommate I sometimes just

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,450
don't do any work and we have fun and we

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,829
just play games all day and it's awesome

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's one of the reasons one of the</font>

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,760
other reasons is that I've been kind of

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,860
busy the last two days<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's like</font>

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,199
I ok so it's weird my roommate got a

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,309
supervisor position at his job which

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,750
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not working graveyard</font>

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,699
shift anymore which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our whole</font>

25
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,440
schedule is shifted so that it's not

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,270
where we're staying up all night<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,829
then I take a small nap in the morning

28
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,510
have to do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the day and</font>

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,610
then take a small nap at night and then

30
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,740
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> up again all day or all night that</font>

31
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,229
kind of like vampiric<font color="#E5E5E5"> goodnight i will</font>

32
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,020
type life now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just regular wake up</font>

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,170
at 4am go to bed it like 11pm something

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,270
like that and it's kind of sad because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

35
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,909
liked being on like Korea and the leg

36
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,070
Germany time we're like by the time I'm

37
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,290
ready to stream Germany's just waking up

38
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,250
or it's like the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day for</font>

39
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">Germany and I'm on like exact like korea</font>

40
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,770
times so it's kind of funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can be</font>

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">like international because I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> living in</font>

42
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,060
the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on korea time and I stream in</font>

43
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,520
time to alert the Germans which is

44
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,960
awesome but I just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you</font>

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,210
guys know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I am so fucking happy</font>

46
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,619
right now let you don't understand like

47
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,850
everything is just falling into place

48
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,329
for me I finally figured things out with

49
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,920
the the relationship I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">who I felt like it was becoming</font>

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,460
unhealthy etc and I not not not

52
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,939
unhealthy between us but he lives Lily's

53
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,170
an unhealthy lifestyle and I just

54
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't you know allow myself to get</font>

55
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,430
more involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that because it's just</font>

56
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">not me and now I'm back going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gym</font>

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
every day I've lost I think like six

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
pounds in the last week which is amazing

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">and like trust me I'm much happier about</font>

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,920
myself

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,870

63
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,230
badly because you're traveling or

64
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,610
something or because you just don't have

65
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time to bother I guess so you end up</font>

66
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,010
kind of like being like oh I love bad

relationships with people who don't

118
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,108
deserve to have me in their life because

119
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't treat me the way that I</font>

120

should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be treated and it's just</font>

121
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,849
everything is so clear now you know when

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into a relationship and it's</font>

123
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,630
like you don't really know

124
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,670
specifics about the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're</font>

125
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,990
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a hundred percent sure whether</font>

126
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,220
or not they're good or bad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

127
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,720
they're telling the truth but they could

128
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily be lying and then you find out</font>

129
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,290
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure about the person because you</font>

130
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,550
know you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out they're lying and you</font>

131
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,690

132
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,580
thought they were and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

133
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,590
time you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to step away and then</font>

134
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,730
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes clear and it's like</font>

135
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,380
an epiphany it's like why didn't I see

136
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,390
all these things before but you know you

137
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,950
got also at the same time give people

138
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,240
the benefit of the doubt and that's what

139
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was trying to do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of a</font>

140
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,200
weird situation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I realized that</font>

141
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,790

152
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,890
advantage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but at the same time</font>

173
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,530
don't think he'll ever see this video so

174
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,720
i could think i can talk about it it's

175
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,340
so funny you know like i was talking

176
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">about before and like my last video or</font>

177
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,100
the video before it's like I have to

178
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,350
watch out for who my audience is and

179
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,140
kind of always think about that but I

180
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,490
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> over watch it so like the</font>

181
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,830
reason I'm most happy about this big job

182
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,030
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting like obviously this is</font>

183
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,520
like a dream job and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it was any other</font>

184
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,320
circumstance that would be what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

185
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,550
me the happiest the fact that I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

186
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,230
job the fact that I have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to</font>

187
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,450
prove myself in this field that I wanted

188
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work in for so long and I just feel</font>

189
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's a dream come true but the</font>

190
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,120
happiest thing about it

191
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,970
is that I get to spend time<font color="#CCCCCC"> with someone</font>

192
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,800
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen in a long time and I miss</font>

193
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,139
him a lot and he's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he's always</font>

194
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,060
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for me through all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

195
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,919
like stupid shit with like this other

196
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,070
guy and everything it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the only</font>

197
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,229
person that's real you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

198
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">went for other guys that were bad for me</font>

199
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,010
because they would tell me what I want

200
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,110
to hear and what I wanted to hear was

201
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,870
like really sweet things but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

202
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,490
sometimes have to choose between<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

203
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,210
sweet things being told to or the truth

204
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,770
being there but the persons not

205
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,660
necessarily as forthcoming with it you

206
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I'm saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like for instance my</font>

207
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:13,840
roommate he like he's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

208
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,810
emotional guy he doesn't like gush about

209
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,940
how like beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am and how I'm like</font>

210
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,060
the Sun I'm a kid into the Sun and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

211
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,010
stars and the moon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that like</font>

212
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,199
sweet stuff he's not like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but he</font>

213
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,610
does care about me you know and then

214
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,470
there's this other guy who's been

215
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,150
leading in a healthy lifestyle and he is

216
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,130
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> forthcoming with telling me like</font>

217
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,150
I'm the most beautiful girl in the world

218
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,910
and all of the stuff like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

221
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,360
wants like amazing in bed which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

222
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,010
probably not lying about because I am

223
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,889
pretty fucking amazing in bed I I do men

224
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,770
justice like people are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh hot</font>

225
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,090
girls are probably gonna be starfish

226
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,990
isn't their problem not gonna do

227
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,360
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but no dude I definitely</font>

228
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,570
put in work like I'm an ugly<font color="#E5E5E5"> chick</font>

229
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,380
because I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like</font>

230
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,150
legitimately loves sex so it's like I

231
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,590
really want to please the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy and that's</font>

232
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,599
like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns me on the most is</font>

233
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,479
pleasing a guy but anyway um so

234
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,349
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard for me to stick by</font>

235
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:12,820
the people who really do care about me

236
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,849
because they don't necessarily tell me

237
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,860
all the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they don't like make me</font>

238
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,199
feel good about myself and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way even</font>

239
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,639
though I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need that it's just like</font>

240
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,199
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you would gravitate to you</font>

241
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,820
know someone who's more like you're

242
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,530
amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they say it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

243
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,849
makes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel amazing and you're like</font>

244
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:28,930
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to be around this person</font>

245
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,400
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me feel amazing rather than</font>

246
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,229
the person who's just you know behind

247
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">the scenes always there for me in like a</font>

248
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,669
very vague way so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what</font>

249
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,860
I'm realizing that I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop going</font>

250
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,830
for fairy tales and start going for the

251
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,080
fairy tales that are there they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

252
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,570
written a different way I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

253
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,370
how it would put it I was so happy like

254
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,070
