00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
hey guys I am so fucking happy to be

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,370
back and I have my new mic setup but

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,890
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been having huge problems with it</font>

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,450
making a lot of hissing when I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,210
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the editing software and I've</font>

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,469
talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people who use this mic</font>

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,759
as well and they're thinking that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,710
either the phantom power supply<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,119
have to use which I didn't know I had to

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,470
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I took a couple more days</font>

11
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,240
for me to get it set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because I had to</font>

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,180
actually buy phantom power or it's the

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,730
fact that i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> using my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> t5 I and the t5 I</font>

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,320
might have some frequency that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
his which sucks so let me know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font>

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,149
feel about the audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also don't like</font>

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,770
the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in the</font>

18
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,200
picture I'm hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's still</font>

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,550
focusing on me and not on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because</font>

20
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,649
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in front of me and I'm</font>

21
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:41,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">hoping that everything's still lit up</font>

46
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,110
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I chose a topic that I've</font>

47
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,100
been wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about for a while</font>

48
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,900
it's just a random topic I don't really

49
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,689
understand dating to me dating the way

50
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,579
most people do it is kind of weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

51
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,850
doesn't make any sense um it's kind of

52
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,079
like I'm still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit sick so</font>

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,439
sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird that</font>

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,110
people enjoy especially blind dating or

55
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,880
online dating<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like that I've</font>

56
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">never wanted someone in my life so badly</font>

57
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,130
that i would feel okay spending time

58
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,930
with someone that I don't like every

59
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,170
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've dated someone it's been dating</font>

60
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,610
while I already knew the person like if

61
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,810
I've already slept with him or I'm

62
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,669
already dating him or we're already

63
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,619
really good friends then dates can be

64
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,239
fun like you go out and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to know</font>

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,350
the person even better

66
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,760
you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a good time with that</font>

67
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,640
person but finding out what sub persons

68
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,350
like through spending a lot of time with

69
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,760
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> just seems like a huge waste of</font>

70
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,320
time in my opinion because most dates

71
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,760
are going to be like pieces of shit

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,590
you're gonna wish you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had those hours</font>

73
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,390
back and then it's really awkward and

74
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,040
you have to end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up like spending a lot</font>

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,360
of time with a person when you really

76
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,190
didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

77
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,020
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why people do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

78
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">me it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I find people that I like</font>

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,180
through my modeling career or through

80
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know events or through like</font>

81
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,230
let's say work if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a like a</font>

82
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,460
regular nine-to-five job where you have

83
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,410
to actually leave the<font color="#E5E5E5"> house often and</font>

84
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,120
you're in like a office setting where

85
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,200
you meet people like those are the

86
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,610
people you spend the most time with and

87
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,660
you're gonna develop crushes you're

88
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,520
going to develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> attractions and then</font>

89
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,560
through that you can start like dating

90
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,660
or whatever but for me I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

91
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,700
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> upfront I've actually never dated a</font>

92
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,920
guy who asked me<font color="#E5E5E5"> out usually the guys</font>

93
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,180
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask me out or either like</font>

94
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,950
overconfident kind of ghetto guys it's

95
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,240
something that comes with being ghetto

96
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">um not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh not that I've like I oh</font>

97
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,000
yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I just really hate it</font>

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,030
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you guys the worst they the</font>

99
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,130
worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I ever got hit on was when a</font>

100
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,140
guy came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to me and started telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

101
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,610
that gaming is a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and it's</font>

102
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,990
boring<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm like okay yeah you're</font>

103
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">really gonna get my pants if you do that</font>

104
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,470
like I can't imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

105
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,720
to me and asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> me out and me being</font>

106
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">like yes I've always wanted that if I</font>

107
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,660
want something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just come up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

108
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,100
and I'll fucking tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey I like you</font>

109
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,660
you're hot I would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> either have</font>

110
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,850
sex with you or date you or I find you

111
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,590
like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun and stuff but I'm not</font>

112
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,700
attracted to you in that way so I'd like

113
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to spend more time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very</font>

114
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">open about that stuff and I feel like it</font>

115
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,520
makes no sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just hide ones</font>

116
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,200
feelings and not tell people what you're

117
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,720
feeling or play games or like go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

118
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,550
dates that just because you're looking

119
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,530
for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to love you really basically</font>

120
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,080
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand why someone would</font>

121
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,890
desire a mate so like much that they

122
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,060
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do that and obviously for</font>

123
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,380
me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like a difference in</font>

124
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,090
opinion it's a difference in in

125
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,220
lifestyle I guess like if I just don't

126
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,450
like doing that I don't like doing that

127
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,100
if you guys love doing that you guys can

128
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,960
do that and obviously it's a it's a

129
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,720
huger like pool of a fish in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea or</font>

130
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,590
whatever so you're going to have a

131
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">better chance of actually finding</font>

132
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,470
someone but for me it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like</font>

133
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,350
you have to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time around a</font>

134
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,478
<font color="#CCCCCC">person to see what they're like rather</font>

135
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,040
than going out on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> date where the date</font>

136
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,900
is probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be acting the way</font>

137
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,139
you want him<font color="#E5E5E5"> to act</font>

138
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it takes like fucking three months</font>

139
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,159
of these like one day dates where you

140
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually finally find out the character</font>

141
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">flaws in this person because this</font>

142
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">person's covering up so much so to me it</font>

143
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,060
just kind of makes no sense because if

144
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,620
you're going on something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

145
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,779
consider to be like this is a date it's

146
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,580
basically like this is an interview and

147
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,319
during this interview you have to act a

148
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,550
certain way if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get this job</font>

149

with that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's no</font>

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,599
with someone I would want to know the

158
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,389
person if I was alone and lonely I would

159
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,800
focus on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> life and I would you know</font>

160
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,139
that keep my eyes open for someone that

161
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,270
I find attractive or interesting but I

162
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,580
just don't understand the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

163
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,990
lifestyle that a lot of people have now

164

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the culture that's going on today</font>

165
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,050
where you just like try your hardest to

166
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,000
find a mate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you end up going through</font>

167
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,710
thousands of like idiots and thousands

168
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people you don't like or spending</font>

169
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,469
like months on a person because you're

170
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on all these dates until you</font>

171
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,889
finally find out what that person's like

172
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,860
I just can't imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> being that lonely</font>

173
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,560
or that like feeling like I need someone

174
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">in my life and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never really been alone for</font>

178
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,870
very long so it kind of makes sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

179
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,789
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hypocritical in a way for</font>

180
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,889
me to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be more</font>

181
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,080
independent but for me if I was in a

182
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,149
relationship I didn't like I would leave

183
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,889
that relationship if I was with a person

184
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,629
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't make things right for me I</font>

185
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:55,719
would you know like in all honesty I'm

186
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:57,159
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave that person and not</font>

187
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,960
keep just like stringing it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

188
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,250
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with someone and</font>

189
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,139
you know you have plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of friends like</font>

190
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,210
people have friends to kind of feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

191
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,610
gap of you know of the lover when you

192
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,529
don't have one and people don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

193
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,539
like differentiate if they see a hot guy

194
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,039
and they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sex with them they</font>

195
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,219
also try to lump in this like emotional

196
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,789
connection with them when there

197
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,349
shouldn't be one because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that person is</font>

198
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,610
just hot you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sleep with</font>

199
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person that person isn't good</font>

200
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,550
enough for you emotionally or isn't on

201
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">your you know level of personality and</font>

202
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you shouldn't be spending your time or</font>

203
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,669
wasting your time like lying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yourself</font>

204
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,080
and then on the flip side if you're

205
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,759
spending a lot of time and just trying

206
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,560
to fall in<font color="#E5E5E5"> love with this friend because</font>

207
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such a good friend and he's so</font>

208
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,589
there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but he just doesn't you</font>

209
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,500
know get you going sexually to stop you

210
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:38,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font>

211
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,729
just trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lump the two and settling</font>

212
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:41,929
because that's just settling you know

213
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,519
and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people kind of have to</font>

214
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,289
settle or want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to settle and that's fine</font>

215
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's fine if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

216
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,439
happy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people get into</font>

217
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,699
relationships where they're not happy

218
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:51,860
because they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to find</font>

219
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,149
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they feel like it's wrong to</font>

220
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,129
only want something someone sexually or

221
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,019
it's wrong to only do this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

222
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,179
that kind of thing just doesn't make any

223
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:00,949
sense to me so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from you</font>

226
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:06,379
through a dating site or wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> date</font>

227
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,899
someone just because like they looked

228
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,669
interesting and then you like spent a

229
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,229
lot of time and felt like you wasted a

230
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,099
lot of time where you could have been

231
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,659
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like you know further in</font>

232
