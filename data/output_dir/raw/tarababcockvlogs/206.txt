00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,620
with this and another half hour rolls by

104
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,269
and it's been like over an hour that has

105
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:20,400
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going off and it stops like for a</font>

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute like literally a minute and then</font>

107
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,760
goes back on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it starts again and it's</font>

108

114
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,389

161
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,210
our carbon monoxide I forget which one

302
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,230
been like an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that</font>

303
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,329

304
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,069
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

305
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,870
seemed like more hassle than not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

306
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,980
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get this fucking video</font>

307
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,040
done so whatever but yeah so next time

308
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,750
I'm probably gonna call because you know

309
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,769
it's not probably um it's probably not a

310
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,480
good idea to just let it go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and on</font>

311
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,949
and on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you don't I</font>

312
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:07,449
didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> check to see if anyone was</font>

313
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:09,040
outside like you know they usually line

314
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,809
up outside like I said or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in</font>

315
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,040
their cars and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they drive out because</font>

316
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,839
it's like either a drill or someone

317
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,189
who's actually started a fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

318
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,230
apartment and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening for</font>

319
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,279
everyone but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there was</font>

320
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,230
anyone outside ever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just you know</font>

321
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,350
it was weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like people didn't</font>

322
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,610
hear it and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really realize</font>

323
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,730
because I wasn't paying attention also I

324
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a gas stove and I haven't</font>

325
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">used the heater for quite a while so I</font>

326
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,149
can't imagine it being carbon dioxide /

327
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:37,179
monoxide but like it's really weird that

328
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,990
like what they just the fire alarm just

329
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,089
got so old that it decided to

330
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,679
malfunction in such a serious way and

331
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,749
now I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the alarm going</font>

332
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:49,059
off off and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> during my drunk stream</font>

333
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,470
like a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago I'm thinking that</font>

334
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,910
that was the same malfunction or

335
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,129
whatever and I didn't die then so you

336
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I'll just air out the place and</font>

337
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,579
