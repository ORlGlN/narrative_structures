17
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,510
taking down this time because i'm going

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,270
to make sure it is PG enough and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to push the boundaries of</font>

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,700
what youtube will allow i did not think

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,110
that the banana thing would be an issue

22
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">i thought maybe the like ass jiggling</font>

23
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,530
thing would be an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like the boob</font>

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,989
pasties dancing around but apparently

25
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,140
they like to show off your body as a

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,359
woman rather than just you know have

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,100
some sexual themes that are kind of fun

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and harmless I don't know it's fucking</font>

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,850
weird anyway so the reason I've been

30
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone for so long is because I've been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty sick I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my birthday and I</font>

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,680
planned on taking like two to three days

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,930
off from streaming but i still had

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,180
content backed up during my birthday

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,439
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the couch and</font>

36
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,430
played video games cuz that's my

37
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">all-time favorite thing to do is just be</font>

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,040
lazy and sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the couch and play video</font>

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,370
like I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be creating content</font>

105
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,660
answering emails doing everything I

106
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,450
possibly can and I never liked doing

107
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,510
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I that I loved as like a</font>

108
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,850
team sport or something that became a

109
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,530
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when something becomes a job</font>

110
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a little bit of the fun in it you</font>

111
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,090
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I haven't lost any of the fun</font>

112
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,370
and making you know videos or doing

113
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,500
video game related stuff we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

114
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,640
about philosophy because I love it so

115
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,860
much but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time I feel</font>

116
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,360
obligated to do it and that stresses me

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,850
out anyway enough rambling so what I did

118
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,560
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sick is i watch the entire</font>

119

saw saga and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire star wars saga</font>

120
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,750

123
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,769

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,630
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year we would go down to Seaside</font>

126
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,640
Oregon which used to be like my favorite

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,738
city because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so like cozy but it's</font>

128
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,320
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a seaside resort type area my</font>

129
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,430
whole family would go down there and

130
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,440
meet and see my grandma and like one of

131
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,479
my favorite memories of my childhood is

132
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:24,920
my dad

133
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,110
rent four five and six and we would

134
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,700
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would watch other older</font>

135
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,560
movies and stuff and like horror flicks

136
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,150
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like a cool family</font>

137
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,440
experience my mama always fall asleep

138
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
way too early and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never really</font>

139
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,800
into those kinds of movies but my dad

140
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,820
and I would watch them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is really</font>

141
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,410
cool to rewatch them and remember all

142
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,580
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I had never watched</font>

143
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,350
one two and three so I watched this and

144
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,430
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually pretty good and know</font>

145
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,630
a lot of people hate on them and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

146
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,890
see why people hate on them at the same

147
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,660
time I really like them and I like the

148
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">improved production quality and approved</font>

149
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,850
acting quality if that makes any sense

150
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,640
and then after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we re-watched like</font>

153
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,900
versions and I was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of disappointed</font>

154
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,730
in those because i like them the first

155
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,020
time i watched them having not

156
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,850
remembered a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Star Wars but then</font>

157
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,350
the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I was like there are so</font>

158
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,820
many more things you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of in</font>

159
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,460
such a better way it made<font color="#CCCCCC"> me want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

160
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,010
Seth MacFarlane so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can like redo it</font>

161
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and better because there were some parts</font>

162
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were funny but there were a lot of</font>

163
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,500
parts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of ignored and</font>

164
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,310
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could have been a lot</font>

165
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,530
better but this is not a review for the

166
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,140
Star Wars<font color="#CCCCCC"> trilogy by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> family guy</font>

167
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,210

176
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,020
my favorite thing in the entire world is

177
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,280
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the couch switching off</font>

178
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,290
playing with jay like a single player

179
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,880
campaign or you know if there's

180
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,590
something that's two player that's

181
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,790
actually as deep as a single player

182
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,470
campaign like that's fucking awesome

183
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,120
that's pretty rare so like we switch off

184
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,020
playing and I'll watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and he'll</font>

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,590
other or whatever and I love going

187
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,660
through a story like just chillin on the

188
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,310
couch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then ordering pizza or some</font>

clothes are gay and back he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

238
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,320
bit more buff and he actually didn't fit

239
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,880
into like even an<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra-large and when</font>

240
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,530
he did it was like baggy on his waist

243
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,840
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gym so he lost a little bit of</font>

244
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,370
muscle and fat which is interesting but

245
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,830
