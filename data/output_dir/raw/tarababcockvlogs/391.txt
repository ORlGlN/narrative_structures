1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
hey guys you're an unfortunate witness

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,049
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rare tara has her hair up</font>

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,390
day and that just basically means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,039
didn't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like blow drying it and I</font>

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,630
showered and it's still wet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,880
like black because blow drying it kind

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,219
of like ruins it or whatever also I have

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,020
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite phone case again for my new</font>

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,300
phone so awesome it's much more snug

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,570
than the iphone 5s version so this is

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,970
awesome but today's vlog is going to be

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,279
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little impromptu will not as impromptu</font>

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,510
as usual actually because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,400
have a list of things that I want to

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about but I'm going to talk about</font>

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,640
what the world would look like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,579
were my utopia so I have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

18
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things on here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

19
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,050
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to read off the the</font>

20
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,430
points that I wrote down<font color="#E5E5E5"> which are much</font>

21
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,050
more succinct than what I actually say

22
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,180
when I talk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like verbal vomit</font>

23
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,850
rather than nicely constructed sentences

24
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,410
and things I've always wanted to be a

25
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,640
writer because I thought I just I show

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,829
myself more as a writer I'm just better

27
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,079
at being more eloquent and thoughtful

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,820
when I'm writing rather than 1 i'm

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,890
speaking so i get to add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font>

30
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,159
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video today the reason i</font>

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,900
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my hair up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> often ok this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,030
tangent i know i will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back on topic</font>

33
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,799
soon the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't like my hair up</font>

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have big ears and it looks</font>

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> dumb second of all it's just not</font>

36
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,780
like the best look I have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

37
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,330
small head and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks kind of funny</font>

38
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,560
maybe that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think I'm really</font>

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,900
tall because even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like five</font>

40
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,970
foot four my head is still kind of small

41
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,520
I feel like my parents put some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,070
gigantic like way too snug beanie on my

43
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,270
head when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> younger and I just kind</font>

44
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,619
of compressed everything and it's like

45
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,290
black but um one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do like</font>

46
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">about my hair being up as you can see my</font>

47
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,420
neck and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a woman showing her</font>

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,579
neck and a woman having a small neck is

49
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,920
very it shows vulnerability which is

50
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,630
really sexy so like you can like think

51
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,040
about grabbing my neck biting my neck

52
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,710
blah blah when I was at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dentist</font>

53
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,610
hopefully the chick doesn't watch this

54
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> na so the dentist you know how you</font>

55
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,460
wear<font color="#E5E5E5"> those glasses where they can't see</font>

56
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,840
your eyes or maybe they can I don't know

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,340
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're looking at your teeth so you</font>

58
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,750
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look directly at them and they're</font>

59
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,369
like really close to your face I was

60
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,750
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her neck and thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

61
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,829
like biting it and stuff it was

62
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,270
hilarious anyway we're going to talk

63
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,699
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my utopia so the first thing on my</font>

64
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,459
list is education would be more vocation

65
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,210
centered and

66
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,130
more emphasis on proper English wouldn't

67
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,350
be graded on a curve so something I hate

68
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,460
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this world that I live in is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

69
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,290
public schools are incredibly easy

70
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,670
they're graded on a curve like the

71
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,990
stupidest person which is a lot of

72
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in random areas like just it's</font>

73
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,300
just fucking awful it's the easiest

74
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing in the world I skipped most of my</font>

75
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,440
high school and I was still getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

76
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,080
A's and stuff but I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even try and</font>

77
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,130
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the easiest thing ever and</font>

78
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,140
then I was doing high school and college

79
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,570
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time and you know fucking</font>

80
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Community College was the easiest thing</font>

81
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,370
ever as well and I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

82
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,590
huge lack of proper grammar there's a

83
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,180
huge lack of knowing anything about the

84
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,650
English English language even though

85
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,810
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> their mother tongue that's just</font>

86
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,130
like ridiculous to me and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

87
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,440
having conversations with people like I

88
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like reading facebook posts it's</font>

89
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,370
all just bad english and it's like

90
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,100
really popular these days to just like

91
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,900
fuck up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> English language and be like</font>

92
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,200
dough and day and like instead of though

93
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,170
and they and it's just fucking awful so

94
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,690
I hate it and I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little list of my</font>

95
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,130
hope for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

96
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,860
smarter overall scientific education for

97
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,900
specific education for<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone who wants</font>

98
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,190
it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool because</font>

99
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,380
there are vocational colleges and there

100
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,500
are like vocational like programs you

101
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,870
can do in high school and stuff but I

102
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,850
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> as with other countries or</font>

103
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,560
have already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing you should be</font>

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,900
like studying for your specific vocation

105
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,280
a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should have</font>

106
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">an idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to do and then</font>

107
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,660
go to a specific type of like classes

108
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,710
basically you shouldn't have to take

109
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,630
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> four-year degree you should be</font>

110
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,550
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of vocational school</font>

111
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,170
that allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually have</font>

112
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience like hands-on experience and</font>

113
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something that um we were offered</font>

114
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,720
in high school but it wasn't like as

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,270
good as I'm imagining in my head the

116
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">next hope for all of this is um no</font>

117
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,830
insane college debt I think that is a

118
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,920
huge problem that higher education isn't

119
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,030
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the freest thing in the world</font>

120
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,390
and easy for anyone to procure and it's

121
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,460
kind of sad<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know if I wanted</font>

122
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like not viable for me to do</font>

123
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,140
because I'm already<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a living off</font>

124
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know either modeling or youtubing</font>

125
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,880
or streaming so for me there's no real

126
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,650
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to go spend a lot of that</font>

127
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">money or get into debt that I've made</font>

128
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,160
to learn more but I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

129
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,120
more I'd love to learn different

130
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,979
languages and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to school more</font>

131
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">for writing and all that so it's kind of</font>

132
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,250
annoying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to like shell out</font>

133
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,650
a fortune<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you don't even get</font>

134
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,259
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average amount that people are</font>

135
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,910
paying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> college is just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up each</font>

136
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">year in each year and everyone's in debt</font>

137
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and there's like not</font>

138
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,030
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> any relief for it yet um the next</font>

139
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is obviously sexuality would be</font>

140
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,310
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> as natural and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful and the</font>

141
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,960
norm<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be open-mindedness and not</font>

142
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,720
ignorance I don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> why anyone like</font>

143
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,069
we're all sexual beings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see why</font>

144
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone is hating on someone who's sexual</font>

145
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,069
i don't see why anyone see it sees

146
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,229
someone who is open sexually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is someone</font>

147
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,840
who's like a deviant or you know has no

148
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,009
other redeeming qualities that's

149
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,990
absolutely ridiculous and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love I</font>

150
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,819
would love a society where it just shows

151
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,009
you know power and intelligence and

152
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,020
beauty and you know it's like the

153
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,590
epitome of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the natural form of a woman</font>

154
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,330
or man because it really is and that's

155
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,090
how we create more people that's how we

156
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,560
procreate so it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any sense</font>

157
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,870
that that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be such a taboo thing</font>

158
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,720
and um the open-mindedness not ignorance

159
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,370
thing kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of comes from people's</font>

160
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,949
perception<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people usually rules what</font>

161
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,509
they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them rather than being</font>

162
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,039
like wow this person really looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

163
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,320
slut but you know she has her<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons</font>

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,210
she has her own moral compass instead of

165
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,669
like devising stupidity off of the

166
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:43,750
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they think because they're</font>

167
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">in their own bubble I would prefer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it if</font>

168
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone just kind of you know it's it's</font>

169
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:48,729
natural that you have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

170
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,650
preconceived notions but<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

171
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">overcome those consciously on your own</font>

172
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,130
is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's really it's a</font>

173
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,770
huge show of intelligence to me my phone

174
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,150
is shutting off all the time because i

175
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,080
have it on fucking safety vagina mode

176
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,130
eliminating stereotyping and ignorance

177
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,240
would eliminate a lot of stereotypes

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,039
ringing true because people wouldn't

179
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:07,389
feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> act a certain way</font>

180
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:08,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fit in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very an</font>

181
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,650
important part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because when you</font>

182
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if you have a daughter you raise</font>

183
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,650
her a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain way if you have a son you</font>

184
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,880
raise him a certain way and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> he goes</font>

185
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,349
to school and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he thinks that if he's</font>

186
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,940
this color or this race he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to listen</font>

187
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,979
to this kind of music and if in turn he

188
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,300
listens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of music</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he has to</font>

189
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,039
dress a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

190
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,479
start stereotyping people because they

191
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,330
ring true so often but if you don't get

192
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,039
judged based on your race your Creed

193
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,289
your your gender and all that stuff then

194
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,969
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to like whatever the fuck</font>

195
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,139
you want and have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of different</font>

196
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">diverse like you know opinions</font>

197
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
diverse things that you like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

198
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,170
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like metal I like video games i</font>

199
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,850
like looking pretty those things don't

200
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,370
usually come together and that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

201
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,810
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stereotype and if more people were</font>

202
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,430
raised the way I was where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just you</font>

203
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">know should like what you like and find</font>

204
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,220
out what you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

205
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,110
people dictate that for you then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

206
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a more free country and less</font>

207
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,830
stereotypes basically because everyone

208
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,570
is different they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not allowed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

209
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">be different because they're not pushed</font>

210
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,960
to be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> because being different</font>

211
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,490
is something that causes you a lot of

212
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,390
social grief in your life so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um what</font>

213
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,340
else more importance would be put on

214
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,800
physical fitness on the pursuit and the

215
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,360
pursuit of beauty would not be seen as

216
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">only vain vapid and a cop-out for hard</font>

217
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,930
work for the stupid so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also kind</font>

218
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of bad at reading out loud obviously but</font>

219
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,430
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everyone should be physically</font>

220
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,870
fit I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should be something</font>

221
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's very important I think that not</font>

222
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,860
only is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the look but it's also</font>

223
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">for just like the feeling healthy and</font>

224
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,150
being healthy overall and you know not

225
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,730
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a pig and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

226
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,950
perpetrating factory farming with how

227
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">much food we consume that's really bad</font>

228
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,910
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and you know how much money we</font>

229
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,000
give to companies that are less than

230
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,010
genuine and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that stuff so but</font>

231
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,470
like a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people see like me being</font>

232
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,390
pretty or whatever as oh I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

233
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,220
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have to be like copping out</font>

234
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,070
of hard work by being pretty in order to

235
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,970
get what I want and that's not

236
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,860
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case at all definitely</font>

237
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,620
because you can like being pretty that's

238
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,110
your own personal thing and that's your

239
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,790
own personal idea of beauty and if

240
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,660
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't think you're beautiful</font>

241
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,400
or if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> does think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

242
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,020
beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's irrelevant what really</font>

243
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,100
matters that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with yourself</font>

244
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,090
and that should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

245
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,800
completely accepted and doesn't

246
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,360
necessarily mean that I'm stupid and

247
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,950
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to work hard in my life and</font>

248
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,030
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this would be easier</font>

249
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,590
because really this is a lot of hard

250
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,870
work and especially to get where I am

251
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,280
now and especially to stay fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

252
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,380
especially to do all the certain things

253
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,419
it's a hobby for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an art</font>

254
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,220
for me and it's a science for me like

255
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,500
symmetry in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the face and symmetry and</font>

256
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,330
what you do and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> makeup is like an</font>

257
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,979
art and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this stuff is fun to me if</font>

258
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,210
it wasn't fun to me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't do it</font>

259
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no like weird you know like me</font>

260
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,190
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do manual labor throughout</font>

261
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,500
my life or me trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not have like a</font>

262
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,870
real job or anything it's just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

263
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,140
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I like to do and share</font>

264
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,490
it helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> me out in certain different</font>

265
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,710
situations like modeling or for people

266
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">to click my videos initially or whatever</font>

267
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,190
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> who I am and that's how I</font>

268
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,390
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> most comfortable and that's what</font>

269
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,560
makes me happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font>

270
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually matters so that shouldn't be</font>

271
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,120
seen initially as something that's so

272
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,710
terrible like obviously if you talk to

273
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,600
someone and that rings true then that's

274
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on but you have to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

275
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't just think that you can't</font>

276
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that everyone is exactly the same</font>

277
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,950
gaming mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> basing normal for all and</font>

278
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,750
used heavily<font color="#CCCCCC"> in education of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all ages as</font>

279
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,850
well as for recreation this is important

280
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,200
there are a lot of places that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

281
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,180
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using video games as a learning</font>

282
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,000
tool for like simulation type stuff like

283
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,860
learning how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fly a plane or things in</font>

284
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,690
the army<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's extremely cool i</font>

285
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,980
have a friend who<font color="#E5E5E5"> gordon actually who</font>

286
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,900
works with i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the australian air</font>

287
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,820
force and he does a lot of simulation

288
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,220
type stuff and teaches people how to fly

289
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,080
that way or people how to do like

290
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,730
teaches people how to do like certain

291
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,810
missions or whatever and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's</font>

292
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">really cool and gaming can be seen as</font>

293
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,990
something that's actually like a tool

294
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,360
and not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for recreation and people</font>

295
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,820
would be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepting of gamers as</font>

296
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,230
like a mainstream thing that everyone

297
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,730
does if that was the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

298
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> children who play a lot of video</font>

299
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,030
games<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's been proven the</font>

300
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,770
children play<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> games from</font>

301
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,990
the really young age up until like

302
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,660
forever are smarter more dexterous they

303
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,030
have their more self-aware more

304
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,190
confident let off more steam there are a

305
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,020
million reasons why playing video games

306
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,520
is fucking amazing and great for you and

307
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,340
makes you smarter and better and it's

308
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,170
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best thing ever so I really</font>

309
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,370
feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it shouldn't be something that</font>

310
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">only nerds do or when you look at</font>

311
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,370
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can tell they're a gamer</font>

312
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,960
because they don't shower like that kind

313
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,890
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing just doesn't make any sense</font>

314
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,500
gaming can be useful to everyone and it

315
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,330
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just make a better smarter and</font>

316
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,240
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-minded society if we use it</font>

317
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,420
more often<font color="#E5E5E5"> um logic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would prevail over</font>

318
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,070
emotion therefore um what is it

319
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,890
autocorrect<font color="#CCCCCC"> ism shit I wanted to say um</font>

320
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,170
we would save her positive emotion and

321
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,620
nearly eradicate negative / useless

322
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,470
emotion so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

323
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,990
use like if an emotion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm having</font>

324
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,060
is negative and not productive I try to

325
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">just eradicate it and I've been pretty</font>

326
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">good at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um excuse me and what</font>

327
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,410
emotion is good like love happiness lust

328
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,800
um content fulness whatever the fuck any

329
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,629
good emotion like just let<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shit</font>

330
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:08,980
flow through you and enjoy it and have

331
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">fun with it but I really feel like logic</font>

332
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,610
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevail over emotion a lot of</font>

333
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,220
people get really amped up about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

334
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,569
in the news and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't think with</font>

335
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:17,620
their heads they just think with their

336
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,970
hearts like this is something cute like

337
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby and they can't like use logic</font>

338
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,009
in their computing skills after that and

339
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:26,199
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's a huge flaw in society</font>

340
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,759
like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people will just lash out</font>

341
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,490
emotionally or they'll start fights or

342
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,930
they'll do things out of anger and it's

343
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,040
not really out of logic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

344
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,660
something that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge flaw in</font>

345
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,430
most humans and I can't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> get along</font>

346
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,379
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> humans who are more</font>

347
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,089
emotion driven than logic driven because

348
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:41,560
they can't see my point of view at all

349
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,540
because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a blinding</font>

350
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,759
rose-colored glasses for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

351
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,699
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sucks um people children to</font>

352
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,579
come parents if they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should that</font>

353
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,470
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool and this will control the</font>

354
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,420
population and eliminate welfare parents

355
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,740
and all that crap and I don't really

356
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the whole like you have to get</font>

357
00:11:58,089 --> 00:11:59,639
married<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to have a kid type of</font>

358
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,500
idea would fit at all into my society

359
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,699
because it doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any sense that</font>

360
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,110
everyone should have a kid first of all

361
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,670
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> populations second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

362
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">people aren't fit to be parents they</font>

363
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,060
don't have the mindset for it they don't

364
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the income for it and they don't</font>

365
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the you know ability to love and</font>

366
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,269
nurture for it and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of kids turn up</font>

367
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,139
fucking retarded because of it parents

368
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">would raise their children to think for</font>

369
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,389
themselves gather knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

370
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:23,949
confident not to shelter and protect

371
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">them a huge problem with parenting and</font>

372
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,649
it's very obvious to me is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

373
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,480
fucking shelter their kids instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

374
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,889
actually teaching them how to process

375
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,269
certain things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to see</font>

376
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:35,290
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sheltered</font>

377
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,480
forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> from pornography from people</font>

378
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,670
being mean to them from bad things

379
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,069
happening from you know a bunch of

380
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:44,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">different like types of fucking violence</font>

381
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,329
all that stuff is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to</font>

382
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:47,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in their lives and if they're not</font>

383
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:48,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">prepared for it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if they haven't been</font>

384
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,410
taught tatted like deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if</font>

385
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,459
they've just been sheltered<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

386
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,529
are pretty much gimped emotionally and

387
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,170
you know psychologically and

388
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,680
intellectually because they don't know

389
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,970
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that shit and because</font>

390
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,589
they're like oh well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm just</font>

391
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">not supposed to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I don't</font>

392
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,500
know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just so retarded to</font>

393
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,009
shelter our kids from set excuse me sex

394
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,389
drugs and rock and roll is just like not

395
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,980
the way to go obviously and if I had a

396
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,300
kid I definitely wouldn't be sheltering

397
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,680
them as just as soon as they saw

398
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,029
something sexual I would explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

399
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,470
them I would explain what you're

400
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,840
supposed to

401
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,160
do with it and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain that they</font>

402
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,100
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know understand those things</font>

403
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,900
rather than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know starting to abuse</font>

404
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,210
it or something other living beings

405
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,530
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated with the same respect</font>

406
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,690
and rights we give humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>

407
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,460
an obvious for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me as a vegan and I also</font>

408
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,800
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone will be vegan the</font>

409
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,050
only meat<font color="#E5E5E5"> eaten of any species would be</font>

410
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,600
those that died of natural causes I just

411
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's very obvious to me it's</font>

412
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,270
good for the environment it's good for

413
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,920
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many misconceptions</font>

414
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,040
through veganism and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many like humans</font>

415
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,900
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being like oh we're more important</font>

416
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,460
because we're humans and we're smarter

417
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,500
so we should be new yeah well babies are

418
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,080
less smart than like a lot of fucking

419
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,460
animals so why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

420
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,320
randomly kill babies willy-nilly<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh-ho</font>

421
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,050
because it's a human and we're

422
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,580
emotionally attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these humans and</font>

423
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,930
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so like illogical and stupid</font>

424
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,240
to me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font>

425
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,190
of mindset that like most of society has

426
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,320
where something happens to a baby and

427
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,600
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh my god the sort of future</font>

428
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,760
our future is overpopulation and a bunch

429
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,260
of idiots that were raised in properly

430
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,540
like that's what's going on that's my

431
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,430
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our poor poor future anyway work</font>

432
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,570
would be put on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backburner to</font>

433
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,700
relaxing personal improvement and family

434
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,350
many other countries already do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

435
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,460
we're like America and<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. and North</font>

436
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">America and like all around over here</font>

437
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,390
like Canada and South America we work a

438
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot harder than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone in like Europe</font>

439
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,580
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't put a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font>

440
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,500
necessity we take less days off we don't

441
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,940
put a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of necessity on spending time</font>

442
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,650
with family it's all about just<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

443
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard or working harder and that's</font>

444
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,680
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like not good for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

445
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,900
psyche and it's not good for you know

446
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,420
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy in life everyone spends all</font>

447
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,760
their times being workaholics and then

448
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,380
realized at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of their lives</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

449
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,670
it kind of sucked and they didn't savor

450
