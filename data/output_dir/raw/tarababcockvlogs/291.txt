00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
hey guys I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even have a video to do</font>

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,510
today I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna do an extra one</font>

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,330
because I finally got my nd4 filter for

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,580
my camera which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can up the</font>

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,219
shit like crazy and buy up the shit I

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,410
mean create some blurring effects in the

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,690
background more efficiently and

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,190
everything is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just perfect in the way I</font>

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,630
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so all the settings are</font>

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,619
exactly the way they're going to be

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,840
hopefully a really long time the the

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,070
lenses new the lens is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I'm</font>

13
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,080
keeping and now all I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to complete</font>

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,099
everything to complete the trifecta of

15
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:30,480
everything I have the ND filter the lens

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,890
and now i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get my laptop on</font>

17
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,630
friday and i'm super excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

18
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,290
and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would be possible</font>

19
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,899
without my patrons on patreon so thank

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,250
you so much today we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

21
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,520
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got hacked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on my</font>

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,530
origin account specifically got hacked

23
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,510
which is kind of silly because nobody

24
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,070
gives a shit about origin right origin

25
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,629
is like the Electronic Arts fanboy steam

26
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,210
you know and I fucking hate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate</font>

27
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,890
the fact that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything other</font>

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,199
than steam I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of my</font>

29
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,510
games that are on PC condensed onto my

30
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,760
steam account I have like three hundred

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,739
and fifty five or something games on

32
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,420
Steam and 33 fucking games on origin the

33
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,250
reason I'm even using using origin right

34
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,409
now is because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am playing unravel on</font>

35
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,450
my gaming channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in like 10</font>

36
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">episodes in or something i fucking love</font>

37
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,750
that game<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really wish i could have it</font>

38
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,090
on steam but since it's an EA published

39
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,490
game you can get it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steam you get it</font>

40
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,330
on fucking origin which was like oh dude

41
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,909
it's so fucking stupid so anyway like

42
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,729
three days ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wake up and I go to my</font>

43
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:33,930
computer the first thing I do in the

44
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,759
morning usually is just check my email

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,170
and I'll just scroll through it I want

46
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually like click on things unless</font>

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like something I'm really excited</font>

48
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,790
about like right now I'm working on my

49
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">own merchandise line and I was in bed</font>

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,149
this morning I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh shit the stores</font>

51
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,710
up and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like a hundred percent</font>

52
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,210
up because I made some changes but

53
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,500
that's neither here nor there i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

54
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,700
didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking around for</font>

55
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,500
a link for merchandise when it's not yet

56
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,390
available to the public my patrons have

57
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,070
seen a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> preview of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm really</font>

58
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">excited but anyway so I was looking</font>

59
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">through my email and I see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

60
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,950
about origin thank you you've reset your

61
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,329
password or some shit I'm like what the

62
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,880
fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have not so I go to my computer</font>

63
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,729
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I log into origin and lo and behold</font>

64
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,790
I can still log in right so I go into my

65
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,710
settings to

66
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,390
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> change my password and I changed</font>

67
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">my password but then I go down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

68
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,020
want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two-step authentication</font>

69
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,210
happen because any time I'm using a

70
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,250
password that I will ever use anywhere

71
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,630
else I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like</font>

72
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,100
safe and that no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one has it and then no</font>

73
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,110
one can access any of the accounts just

74
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,580
in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> another account gets compromised</font>

75
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,500
I don't want an account with like a

76
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar password of the same password to</font>

77
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,980
get hacks because it doesn't have to

78
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,240
step with indication if that makes any

79
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense people have tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hack my</font>

80
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Instagram quite a few times people have</font>

81
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,230
like you know what's the thing where you

82
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,640
can request a new password people have

83
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">done that but they can't get through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

84
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
because you have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> my fucking</font>

85
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,590
phone and my phone number in order to

86
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,390
get into anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i own and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

87
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,130
how I keep my shit safe because if you

88
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,900
guys haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> my scary hacker story</font>

89
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,520
which i'll post in the description i'm

90
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,230
pretty crazy about keeping my social

91
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,610
networks and all my important things

92
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,660
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> paypal and my gmail account very</font>

93
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,770
secure with two step authentication

94
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,480
which is basically like any time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font>

95
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">in you get the code on your phone and</font>

96
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,930
you type it in I hope for steam<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and</font>

97
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,900
um so I go to set that up and what I

98
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,430
need to do to set that up is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

99
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,470
answer a security question the security

100
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,100
question is in fucking Russian like what

101
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,170
how why was this in Russian I don't

102
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,850

103
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,430
a stupid whatever number thing I've

104
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,500
never even done this right so like why

105
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,030
the fuck is that in Russian<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why does</font>

106
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,220

107
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,530
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I put in a ticket but you</font>

108
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't put in a ticket until you prove</font>

109
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,070
that you own the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking account so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

110
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,050
decide to call or I had them call

111
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually and they called me and I was</font>

112
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,140
like what the hell is going on with my

113
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,150
account why the fuck is there some

114
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,800
fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian shit in my account and</font>

115
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,630
why if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some Russian shit on my</font>

116
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,130
account do they not change the password

117
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,170
why did they allow me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get back in and</font>

118
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,520
see that Russian shenanigans were

119
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,040
happening on my fucking account and he's

120
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,990
like oh well we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just set it to</font>

121
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,240
whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuck you want it to be set</font>

122
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,010
to and I'm like oh cool you just trust

123
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,420
me that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the person that owns the</font>

124
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,310
account whatever at least thankfully i

125
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,050
am so I tell him<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I want it to be</font>

126
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,240
something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know my school or my</font>

127
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,740
family or my mom's maiden name or some

128
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,050
stupid shit and I add like three more

129
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,070
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is fucking</font>

130
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,260
ridiculous and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I set up two step</font>

131
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,700
authentication which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

132
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">really annoying because i only play</font>

133
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,988
unravel like once a<font color="#CCCCCC"> week for the videos</font>

134
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've already finished it on on my own</font>

135
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,620
time so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

136
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,300
hurrying to play so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not playing it</font>

137
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,770
day and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a huge game so it's not</font>

138
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be something that I'm logging into</font>

139
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,530
all the time but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to log</font>

140
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,789
into it once a week I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to</font>

141
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:33,710
use this fucking phone two-step

142
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,970
authentication which is really annoying

143
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I asked the guy is there any</font>

144
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,599
reason like why this would be happening

145
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me is there like what could like</font>

146
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,220
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> have happened is there like</font>

147
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,990
some kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> site-wide compromise</font>

148
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,060
or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've done and he said</font>

149
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,460
no it's usually people who play

150
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,289
first-person shooters or shooter games

151
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,990
and the people hacking in order to like

152
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,699
reset your fucking kdr right and I'm

153
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">like what why would anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to like</font>

154
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,810
