00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
hey guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know what video I was</font>

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,259
gonna do<font color="#E5E5E5"> there what topic I hadn't</font>

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,850
really looked at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but today I'm going</font>

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,970
to talk about my<font color="#E5E5E5"> kitty climber who my</font>

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,820
mom informed me last night that he had

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,070
passed<font color="#E5E5E5"> away and I cried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a little bit</font>

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I realized that he was in a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,940
pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably better for</font>

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,220
him that he's gone now but I always get

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,529
more worked up for animal deaths in

11
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,539
human deaths and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,010
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about why and I wanted to talk</font>

13
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,480
about climbers life and kind of honor

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,830
him a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i also want to</font>

15
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,890
dedicate my upcoming video about vegan

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,590
alternatives to him because he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font>

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,600
the animals in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life that have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made me</font>

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,920
just fucking fall in love the animals

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,129
animals are so instinctual and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

20
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">people will say that that's why humans</font>

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,390
have ascended<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're better because</font>

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,129
humans are more intellectual they can

23
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,629
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know have more technological</font>

24
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,940
advances but animals do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> too just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

25
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,020
a different scale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've always</font>

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,449
thought that it was so nice that animals

27
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,180
they just live on instinct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

28
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,859
they love<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the obvious reasons that</font>

29
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,899
are biological and they you know protect

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:01,980
for the obvious reasons that are

31
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,409
biological whereas when you look at how

32
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,150
humans do things it's all based on greed

33
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,860
and selfishness in it sometimes feels

34
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,070
like it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better to go back to an</font>

35
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,020
archaic version of a barbarian because

36
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,150
then we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like ruining the</font>

37
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,650
beautiful nature of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

38
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">how I feel and I know a lot of people</font>

39
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,909
are kind of going to hate on me<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

40
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something I'm very</font>

41
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,189
passionate<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I don't talk about</font>

42
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,710
being a vegan or vegetarian very often

43
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,970
and I don't talk about animals very

44
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,229
often but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much in love with</font>

45
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,780
every creature on this planet and I feel

46
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,030
like humans are detrimental to the

47
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,670
prosperity of this planet and its I do

48
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,259
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep a low carbon</font>

49
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,479
footprint I don't wear<font color="#CCCCCC"> any clothes or</font>

50
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,970
makeup like I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> never imagine</font>

51
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,689
wearing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the result of</font>

52
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,909
some some being losing its life like for

53
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,920
fucking fashion like I understand that a

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,329
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who eat meat hide behind</font>

55
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,460
like oh well let's say you don't get

56
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough protein or it's less healthy for</font>

58
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,810
know are proven to be untrue but if you

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that you are actually you</font>

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,520
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I want a fur coat because I'm a</font>

63
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,930
fucking gluttonous piece of shit like

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how I feel why the fuck are you</font>

65
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,410
wearing leather you go outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

66
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,770
rain and fucking smells like

<font color="#E5E5E5">as shit because it's fucking dead animal</font>

68

69
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,870
make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to me so that's all I'm</font>

70
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna say on being a vegan / vegetarian</font>

71
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,930
consumer I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

72
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,750
climber and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much I love animals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

73
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,480
how I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no ill intent</font>

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,150
with animals it's just like they love

75
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,310
you because you protect them they love

76
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,630
you because they feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're part</font>

77
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the family and there's no ill-will</font>

78
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,820
behind that there's no anyone trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

79
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,310
get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> money there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no like someone</font>

80
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,990
going and talking shit behind your back

81
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just people like someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

82
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,460
humans are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important animal on</font>

83
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,380
the earth it's like no we're actually

84
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,300
the biggest detriment we're just like

85
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,040
overpopulated like crazy because we're

86
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">not on the fucking food chain so we just</font>

87
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of transcended that and now our</font>

88
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,520
population control there's none because

89
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,200
we're so important we you know don't

90
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">want anyone to die we just want to let</font>

91
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,380
everyone just produce as much as

92
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,940
possible and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are</font>

93
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,250
producing too much like too many new

94
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,430
babies they're the people that you know

95
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,720
are on welfare and that's the only

96
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason they're doing it is so fucking</font>

97
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,760
awful that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no there's no purity</font>

98
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,360
of the instinct like there isn't animals

99
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,390
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> animals are most often more</font>

100
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,830
afraid of us than them same with you

101
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,120
know insects arachnids and all that

102
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,410
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've always been one to</font>

103
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect them my parents are not</font>

104
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">vegetarian but they raised me to you</font>

105
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">know take if a you know an insect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cook</font>

106
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,700
goes in the house lets you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

107
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,990
in a fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> cup and take it out and I</font>

108
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,820
actually put a video up on Instagram

109
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me taking out a little moth that</font>

110
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,000
got into the house because it's so

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,970
fucking hot here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read up but uh yeah</font>

112
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,250
said to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the balcony doors open um</font>

113
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,430
and then I stuck to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

114
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,780
believed in that more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> my parents do</font>

115
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,580
so sometimes my parents would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like oh</font>

116
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,160
like there was this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> time where a</font>

117
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,470
bunch of baby spiders like literally

118
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,340
started descending from the the fucking

119
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,370
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like fan area with the lights</font>

120
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in the kitchen and I was like</font>

121
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">no you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kill him know we can't</font>

122
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,830
exterminate them and so my dad's like

123
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,329
fucking catching them in cups and like

124
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,100
it was like a full-time job for a little

125
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,019
bit and we had to like keep getting the

126
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,240
residual babies out but we ended up not

127
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,500
killing any of them knowingly and some

128
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it can be hard because when something so</font>

129
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,270
small like I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we finally</font>

130
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,650
found something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like as big as</font>

131
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,520
like a Titan in attack on titan those

132
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,170
things wouldn't even notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

133
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,460
stepping on us and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh</font>

134
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,990
we can't fault them for that because

135
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,360
they don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> see us but for them to</font>

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">just kind of be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh fucking pests</font>

137
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,960
when we're beings ourselves is like kind

138
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of fucked up you know like I don't ever</font>

139
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,160
I don't feel holier-than-thou as a human

140
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,720
we're like oh we're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important</font>

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know like everything else is</font>

142
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,980
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dumber like if we're going on the</font>

143
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,400
dumb scale why am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I not hunting babies</font>

144
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
like human babies are stupider than a

145
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,810
lot of fucking animals factually and

146
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,360
it's just like us being selfish once

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,400
again and us preserving us and it's just

148
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,440
like it's kind of disgusting to me and

149
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,900
that's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasons why as a whole</font>

150
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,270
I don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much empathy for other</font>

a while and I grade for a while then she

211
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,080

to UM the cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pet store and we saw</font>

214
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,150
two little black kittens that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

215
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like lazy and lethargic and you</font>

216
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,630
know we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like separate</font>

217
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,130
them from each other and then we saw

218
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,260
climber and he's like a half pixie bob

219
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,910
mix so he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like super energetic he's</font>

220
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,710
like me he wanted love it was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font>

221
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,639
cute and we're like okay we're getting

222
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,169
this one then we took him home and he

223
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,520
ran all around the house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he started</font>

224
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,169
climbing up the curtains all the way up

225
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:44,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the like rod and sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of</font>

226
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rod and he did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that until he got so</font>

227
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,710
fat because my mom feeds and pancakes

228
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,780
that he actually started ripping off the

229
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,729
curtains in the rod and stuff and that's

230
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,229
why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> named him climber pretty quickly</font>

231
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:55,850
because he was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the start</font>

232
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,860
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fucking cute and um</font>

233
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,390
then he started<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting like a temper</font>

234
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,070
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was like I couldn't walk down the</font>

235
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,600
hallway<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember i would like run down</font>

236
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,070
the hallway because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i walk he would</font>

237
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,900
come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of nowhere and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scratch the shit</font>

247
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,270

<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't very active like he used to be</font>

254
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,029
and it kind of broke my heart but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>
