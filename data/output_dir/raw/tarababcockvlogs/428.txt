00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,900

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,269
the random topics I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here</font>

14
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,680
and post it as the the title many way

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,080
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some teacher who was a white</font>

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,930
teacher and he went as a Kanye West so

17
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,200
he warpaint to be the color of a black

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,390
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and his wife went as a Kim</font>

19
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,860
Kardashian and she kind of already looks

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Kim Kardashian so it was basically</font>

21
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">just doing an outfit type thing and</font>

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,690
stuffing her butt or something and

23
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,760
people were outraged and he had to

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
apologize and I think that's absolutely

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,050
fucking retarded first full blackface

26
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,789
there's intent behind blackface it's

27
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,949
just your face it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not Halloween it's</font>

28
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know commemorate a person and</font>

29
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,410
to say that I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this person</font>

30
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,640
this person is really cool it he was

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,170
even holding a sign that says kanye for

32
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,339
president and<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were getting</font>

33
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,869
offended at that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

34
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,220
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stupidest fucking thing in</font>

35
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,750
the world like first of all a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

36
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">people get offended at words like when i</font>

37
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,650
say oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bitch I mean like like the</font>

38
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,299
bitch from Gotham<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whatever later just</font>

39
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,630
a random random you know fucking thing

40
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,159
that I would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people are like oh</font>

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,170
you said they were a bitch you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

42
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,759
the only reason that those things are

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,979
offensive is because i have a

44
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,530
connotation behind it and an intention

45
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,420
to hurt someone if I'm saying it that

46
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">way but I'm not so it doesn't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

47
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,689
fucking sense also black<font color="#CCCCCC"> face is</font>

48
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,299
something completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different and</font>

49
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,890
people are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking stupid if I was</font>

50
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,460
like imagine the stupidity of wearing a

51
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,270
costume or doing a cosplay of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font>

52
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,299
character not of your race and not

53
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,189
changing your color like you're playing

54
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,649

fucking stupid that someone will get

66
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,710
offended over that it's basically just

67
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,440
an image to Kanye West someone who likes

68
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,570
Kanye West and like even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they were</font>

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,010
whatever or like doing really bad rap

<font color="#CCCCCC">believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are so sensitive like</font>

76
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,030
really stop censoring things and stop

77
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,950
like teaching people that there are

78
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,570
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't do or say and you</font>

79
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,770
have to watch yourself you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

80
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,300
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake in society because</font>

81
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,120
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do might offend someone</font>

82
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,709
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> teacher fucking kids how to not</font>

83
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,239
be offended at things that people don't

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,400
matter say like if people don't matter

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,470
they shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to affect you and</font>

86
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,000
that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's so logical</font>

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,620
and it's so ingrained in me that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

88
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">cycie comments on the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

89
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,250
being mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me or saying mean things</font>

90
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,020
are saying like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh fucking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slut whore</font>

91
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,060
how could that ever offend me it's just

92
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">some fucking person on the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

93
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,970
don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't see being a</font>

94
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,830
keyboard warrior behind a fucking screen

95
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,200
so like the fact that almost anything

96
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,290
can offend people is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fucking</font>

97
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,310
imbecilic to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I can't even</font>

98
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,320
understand why the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuck like we're still</font>

99
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,269
like harping on these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

100
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh I can't see color or you</font>

101
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,620
know blah blah blah like they're just a

102
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,030
part of the problem in my opinion

103
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,850
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're bye-bye like illogically</font>

104
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,350
avoiding it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course we see</font>

105
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,750
color we like to describe someone we

106
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,070
would be like the black guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

107
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,049
blue hat and then you know fucking

108
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,450
whatever the fuck and like it's it's

109
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,980
retarded to act<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't see color</font>

110
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,290
and that just<font color="#CCCCCC"> brings more like problems</font>

111
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,560
because you're being conscious of the

112
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,630
fact that you're trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so not</font>

113
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,400
racist<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you are actually in turn</font>

114
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,739
races it's like reverse racism and it

115
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,269
really is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's so fucking</font>

116
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,730
stupid to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say like oh you know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

117
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,350
to like focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these kinds of issues</font>

118
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,540
like yeah racism exists just like

119
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,220
assholes on the internet exists toward

120
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,380
anyone like a male youtuber female

121
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,390
youtuber random person on the internet

122
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,519
like people talking behind people's

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,780
backs because they have some

124
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,400
preconceived notion about some person in

125
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
school<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all that's just going to</font>

126
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,358
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the better way to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

127
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,519
is to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to fucking deal with it</font>

128
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,979
within yourself and not let<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shit</font>

129
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,780
bother you i don't like censorship<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

want there too

131
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,010
like even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like something I</font>

132
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,900
want it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to exist because</font>

133
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,870
as long as it's not physically harming

134
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,750
or deterring a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> from living their</font>

135
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,550
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know the pursuit of</font>

136
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,770
happiness and all that shit like if it's

137
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,840
just some fucking idiot on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

138

140
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm concerned with like you know be</font>

141

securing yourself be confident in

142
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,050
yourself and learn even if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

143
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,150
that people saying random shit about you

144
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,190
should not affect you it's like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

145
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,240
matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how you feel about yourself</font>

and all that matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what you're</font>

147

doing for yourself and who you actually

148

true just fucking ignored who cares

155
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,890
these people don't fucking matter anyway

156
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only people that matter are yourself</font>

157
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,610
your closest friends unless they fuck

158
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,810
you over<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's definitely</font>

159
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,570
possible you're you know lover or

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,880
boyfriend or you know husband or wife

161
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,100
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fuck and your family and</font>

162
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,390
like even if your family fucks you over

163
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,820
like people say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> blood is</font>

164
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,960
thicker than water which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like really</font>

168
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,220
between family and friends in my opinion

169
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ties that you create in life are</font>

170
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,950
stronger than the ones that you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

171
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,260
like haphazardly put into because you

172
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,460
were birthed into this family you don't

173
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,570
know if these are good people you don't

174
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,500
know if you love them and your mom

175
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't know she loves you yet it's just</font>

176
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,580
a like paternal feeling that she has so

177
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,500
all that just fucking stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuck that's pretty much all I bring</font>

243
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,079
sometimes I bring my contact case for my

244
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,759
circle lenses because occasionally I'll

245
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,219
get irritated after wearing them for a

246
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:15,419
long time and occasionally I'll bring

247
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,799
lip gloss<font color="#E5E5E5"> because why not but I haven't</font>

248
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:20,689
for awhile in here i'm putting my<font color="#E5E5E5"> manga</font>

249
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:25,019

252
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">um and it's kind of a shallow top here</font>

253
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:33,929
so it fits my manga really perfectly

254
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,078
because down here is you know my deck

255
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:39,659
box pushed back deck box / camera stuff

256
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,188
and then in the top it's actually a

257
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,620
laptop case so this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> like has its</font>

258
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,750
own shockproof area and I don't have a

259
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,189
good laptop that I bring around anywhere

260
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:49,410
but if I ever want to put like a trade

261
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,639
binder in there something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

262
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,450
good it's

263
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,130
cool and then it can double it something

264
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I bring to a modeling shoot because</font>

265
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,480
often I like to bring my<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop and then</font>

266
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,340
just put all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the proofs all of the</font>

267
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,410
like raw images directly onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the laptop</font>

268
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,000
so I can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them later but i</font>

269
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,110
thought i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you guys that and</font>

270
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,760
