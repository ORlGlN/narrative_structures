189
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,380
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rock music and bisexuals</font>

190
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,669
but I've never had a relationship with a

191
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,200
woman I'll be honest I never wanted to

192
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,400
date a woman but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've always been</font>

193
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,289
attracted to them same way I feel what

194
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:44,760
the fuck we should be friends like

195
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,990
seriously I know how you feel about

196
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,310
monogamy but I have to disagree

197
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,620
respectfully of course I am married to a

198
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,360
wonderful man<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's my life partner in</font>

199
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,010
soul mate I've known in my whole adult

200
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,690
life he's helped me to be the awesome

201
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,400
person that I am today he's helped me to

202
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,860
be comfortable with my sexuality and

203
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,539
views on such topics thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him i</font>

204
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,010
realized that i am not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a demon for</font>

205
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,510
feeling the way that I do I just wish

206
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,860
that your videos existed years ago

207
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,240
because hearing your thoughts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> views</font>

208
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,099
has helped me even more because well

209
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,570
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> different hearing it from a</font>

210
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,010
woman versus a man if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes any</font>

211
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,169
sense it does my husband and I are very

212
