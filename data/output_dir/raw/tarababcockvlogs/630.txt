00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,350
wondering where the hell I've been for

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,990
the past at least like three days and

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,550
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only answer I have to that is that</font>

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,050
I've been pretty sick and I've actually

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,769
been able to literally sleep almost 24

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,150
hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day like I would wake up</font>

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,400
for like three hours when my roommate

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,520

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,710
rest of it would just be literally

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,510
sleeping I don't know what has been

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,000
wrong with me but um I think it has to

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,699
do with a certain morning after pill I

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">had to take a couple days ago which um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>
