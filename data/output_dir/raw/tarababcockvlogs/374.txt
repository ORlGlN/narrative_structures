27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,549
longer fucking summarization of what

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,460
happened I went in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they had my my</font>

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,250
permanent crowns created and they looked

30
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,080
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap they were even worse these are</font>

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,030
these are my temporaries again they

32
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,979
looked worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> than my temporaries even</font>

33
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,420
though this temporary is a little bit

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,830
longer and you can't tell in this light

35
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,170
but these two are like three shades

36
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,150
darker than my actual teeth can I actual

37
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,130
teeth are like the lightest bleach color

38
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,630
and these are like the lightest natural

39
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,979
color which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like four colors under</font>

40
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,759
that but anyway um so the Crown's were

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,290
noticeably a different color and my

42
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,020
dentist agreed and they were one of them

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,549
was a lot longer than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other and they</font>

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,310
just were not at all like I want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

45
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,590
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> symmetrical so like the way I gauge</font>

46
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,970
whether or not I'm just being a crazy

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">ass crazy fuck perfect for that</font>

pretty and perfect and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

52
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,040
would be okay with if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was in my mouth</font>

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not crazy because</font>

54
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,780
when I look up<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like a breast</font>

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,729
augmentation or lip augmentation or

56
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,619
something half the pictures that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

57
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:05,670
I'm like oh I would not be okay with

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would need like a lot more or a</font>

59
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,459
lot less or a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better a lot more</font>

60
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,220
perfect and then i can finally be like

61
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,810
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe they're right maybe i'm being</font>

62
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,800
a huge perfectionist

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,050
but in this case I wasn't and I really

64
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,580
feel like if I'm paying this much money

65
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,470
if I'm paying three thousand dollars to

66
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,630
get my fucking teeth done in a certain

67
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,070
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking done in a</font>

68
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,070
certain way and it's funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

69
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,450
wanted something<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than my original</font>

70
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,420
teeth shape my original<font color="#CCCCCC"> like t-shape</font>

71
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,060
here but I ended up just wanting those

72
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,620
back because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how bad the new shape</font>

73
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,480
was and like I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get it done</font>

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,950
because i had the root canal in the

75
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,240
tooth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tooth is very brittle and</font>

76
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,680
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also just discoloring it looked</font>

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,750
really retarded and I had to be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

78
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,150
no I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> drink</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coffee or smoke or just</font>

79
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,100
like sip through a straw into that one

80
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,580
tooth some kind of terrible concoction

81
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,990
that makes everything a terrible color

82
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,290
um I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want perfect teeth and</font>

83

90
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,010
because I had cavities and like I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

91
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,720
teeth problems forever I've had the root

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,030
so safeway grocery delivery which is

110
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,290
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best thing ever it makes me so</font>

111
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,640
happy because I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out and</font>

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> groceries but that service is</font>

113
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,270
amazing even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though they often don't</font>

114
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in stock and it's like</font>

116
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,070
or whatever to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the shit</font>

117
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,950
but like I have recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> been using this</font>

118
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,860
company that delivers food from

119
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,870
non-delivery fast food places or like

120
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,519
not even fast food like red robin or

121
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,370
places where you would sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and eat</font>

122
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,519
like they deliver McDonald's and I have

123
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,729
two stories relating to mcdonalds so

124
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,680
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost that i order food from</font>

125
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,389
this place they cannot get into my play

126
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,659
and I have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a detailed like list of</font>

127
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,520
how to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking apartment and</font>

128
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,900
my apartment<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly</font>

129
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,669
confusing but I have like the perfect

130
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,800
like if you if you follow it word for

131
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,629
word you will not get lost you will just

132
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,569
make it and everything will be great and

133
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,340
these fucking people are like literally

134
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,749
the stupidest goddamn<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I've ever</font>

135
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:48,330
met in service in the world and you know

136
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,979
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate service people and like</font>

137
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,479
how incompetent I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there are</font>

138
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,849
their jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want like what I don't</font>

139
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:54,900
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people should do for</font>

140
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">their jobs like maybe they should just</font>

141
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,509
be euthanized or something but and we

142
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,770
should have like a higher level of

143
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,819
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the people who are like</font>

144
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,740
receptionist's at like wealthy places

145
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,419
like plastic surgeons and stuff should

146
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,830
probably go down and work it like

147
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,349
Safeway and be like those receptionist's

148
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:11,490
because they're at least halfway

149
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,620
competent and will be confident enough

150
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,419
do their jobs but um yeah that's just

151
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a very evil rant that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of guys</font>

152
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,439
would that she's such a bitch but

153
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,000
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> dude I'm fucking frustrated at</font>

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,969
it anyway and um so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

155
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,919
just so fucking stupid and almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

156
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">time they get my order wrong like I</font>

157
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,729
really love McDonald's breakfast foods

158
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,370
and I get the egg mcmuffin without any

159
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,659
Canadian bacon because literally

160
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,279
Canadian bacon is disgusting to me and

161
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,379
I'm a vegetarian and I get the hash

162
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,409
browns or whatever so um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

163
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,349
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they either forget a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hashbrown</font>

164
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:45,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget to you know bring a drink or</font>

165
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:47,250
don't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Canadian bacon off and</font>

166
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,300
one guy was like can you just pick it

167
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,129
off and it's like oh my god dude like

168
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:53,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're no I can't just fuck it I like I</font>

169
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,389
will but it's like a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> inconvenience</font>

170
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:55,770
to me and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to eat</font>

171
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meat but I don't want to throw it</font>

172
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I'm one of those people</font>

173
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,919
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to fucking throw away</font>

174
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,719
meet and if an animal had to die for the

175
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,310
shit I don't want to just fucking throw

176
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,990
it away<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm not you know grateful</font>

177
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,000
for that so I fucking eat it unhappily

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,180
like close fucking gross well it's all

179
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,389
vain Ian's got like sinewy parts and

180
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,460
that's the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's how I</font>

181
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,870
fucking feel about it and I fucking hate

182
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">it okay I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even better lighting now</font>

183
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,529
it's I need progressively better

184
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,599
lighting see I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh just</font>

185
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">lighting up anyway so it's really</font>

186
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,099
frustrating to me and I'm also paying

187
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:27,419
more because they're forgetting a lot of

188
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and it's the most annoying shit</font>

189
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,680
in the entire universe and I hated the

190
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,500
most forever ever and ever now I'm like

191
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,019
relaxing my arm on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sofa that I</font>

192
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,630
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit and record on and feel</font>

193
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,210
nice so anyway um the next thing I

194
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,820
wanted to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about with this</font>

195
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,020
McDonald's thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

196
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,840
mcdonalds like every third day in the

197
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">morning for breakfast and when I don't</font>

198
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,800
have it I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started getting</font>

199
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,410
headaches and I feel like McDonald's

200
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,490
actually does have something addictive

201
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,340
in it or maybe it's just so bad for you

202
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:06,000
that you end up like you end up like

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,710
needing it it's kind of like it has

204
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,740
something in it that mimics addiction

205
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,840
and I don't know what the fuck is going

206
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,520
on but like I get headaches when I don't

207
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,870
have it now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like okay well I'm</font>

208
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,340
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna stop having this as much at</font>

209
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,440
all and weaned myself off because that's

210
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,020
fucking gay that when I eat healthier

211
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">and don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work out as much I'm</font>

212
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,500
gonna feel worse and that just doesn't

213
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,390
make any sense to me on the topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

214
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,530
working out I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

215
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,810
lately and I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing improvements</font>

216
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,430
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feel so great when I work out</font>

217
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,220
like it feels good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just relax on the</font>

218
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,750
couch and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lazy day and like order</font>

219
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,340
pizza or something or order fast food

220
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,700
but like it feels so much better like I

221
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,980
feel just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like less bloated and less</font>

222
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,930
full of air and less anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

223
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,060
like work out and eat right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eat less</font>

224
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,090
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I also have like the the</font>

225
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,950
stomach and the headache pains that I

226
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,350
have when I don't eat as much it feels

227
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I'm not really that hungry so i</font>

228
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,500
starved myself and then I have something

229
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I get hungry because of that</font>

230
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,560
because it's like an appetizer type of

231
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,150
thing and it doesn't actually fill me up

232
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,340
because I'm used to a higher amount of

233
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,260
calories so like that's been my struggle

234
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,210
with fitness is just trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

235
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,190
indulge because i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel better</font>

236
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,220
type of thing and right now my my guilty

237
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,050
pleasure is either mcdonalds breakfast

238
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,300
or or just a diet diet 7-up<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love diet</font>

239
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,190
7up and like Susan my stomach could feel

240
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,650
so good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so tasty and like I have</font>

241
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,810

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,760

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,620
whenever I have a like bigger meal or

244
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,969

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">eating the the morning star vegetarian</font>

permanent ones with Vaseline which

271
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,870
doesn't make them stick at all it's just

272
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,399

<font color="#E5E5E5">redo them but they want to look at it</font>

286
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,110
bigger than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other so that one needs</font>

287
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,370
to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit smaller and the other</font>

288
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,319
one you know obviously needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

289
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bigger to make them even um and</font>

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,050
touches on but they're not going to

294
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">because after we do them and then after</font>

295

<font color="#CCCCCC">that I have to wait another two weeks</font>

298
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,920
the most clusterfuck of bullshit like I

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,630
queen and a diva<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want everything</font>

00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,069
but like jay even thinks that this is

304
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:33,730
ridiculous that i have to walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

305
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,860
