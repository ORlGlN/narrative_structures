00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
hey guys today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,400
misleading facts in the media and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,779
talked about this a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:07,890
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone in depth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and I</font>

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,860
actually have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of anecdotes and</font>

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,019
actual statistics that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use as</font>

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,519
example so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be a little bit</font>

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,529
better I parted my hair to the side

9
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,930
today to show the difference since a lot

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,789
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really know and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

11
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it very much because</font>

12
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,910
unless I poop this part up and like do a

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,250
little back<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming here from one side it</font>

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,660
looks like i'm almost balding because

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,010
most of my hairs on the other side and

16
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got kind of sick of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

17
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,700
yeah i agree usually when i wear my hair

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,320
my part in the middle i don't really

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,850
like it that much after a while but once

20
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">i do it after having my hair part to the</font>

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,930
side for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it becomes kind of</font>

22
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a refreshing look for me and I kind</font>

23
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,149
of like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no most models part in</font>

24
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,469
the middle and then curl their hair and

25
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff but curling my hair takes so much</font>

26
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,760
time and effort and it ruins my hair a

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,620
little bit i'm trying to grow it longer

28
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">so yeah i have naturally straight hair</font>

29
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,059
most girls don't which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also another</font>

30
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,469
aspect but anyway let's not talk about

31
00:00:58,469 --> 00:00:59,579
my hair let's talk about these

32
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,710
misleading facts first<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm wearing my</font>

33
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,438
blazer this is my my casual school

34
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,830
blazer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i bought it at first when i</font>

35
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,979
was doing on on-site interviews like

36
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,180
professional interviews for zooming

37
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,040
games and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also bought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for casting</font>

38
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,450
my mom actually bought it for me because

39
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">i told her i was getting into casting</font>

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,330
and she was super happy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

41
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,909
following my dreams of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a starcraft</font>

42
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,350
caster so she<font color="#CCCCCC"> bought this for me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

43
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,439
casted on my my twitch channel once or

44
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,290
twice and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i used it at e3 when I</font>

45
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,180
was with<font color="#E5E5E5"> zoom and games but anyway um I</font>

46
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,040
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worn in a while I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the way</font>

47
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,180
it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like kind of like the square</font>

48
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,850
shoulder look occasionally even though

49
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,960
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of make me look a little bit</font>

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,970
broader than I am it looks fine on a

51
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,710
girl who isn't already brought I'm not

52
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,680
so it looks good so what I'm talking

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really hate how Mia misleads</font>

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,460
you or gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a very condensed just</font>

55
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,670
really quick idea of a certain topic and

56
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">then just lets you interpret it your own</font>

57
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,909
way and I hate the fact that so many

58
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,950
people when they watch something in the

59
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,960
media they take it like wholeheartedly

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,850
as fact like even when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

61
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,530
that is a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> reputable like let's</font>

62
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,689
say CNN or something you shouldn't take

63
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,008
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they say is fact and you</font>

64
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,690
shouldn't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss read it basically</font>

65
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,800
all you should learn about from news

66
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,750
is what you're more interested in

67
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,040
learning more about if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes any</font>

68
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,780
sense like if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear for instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

69
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,670
statistic i'm going to use now I heard

70
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,230
something like this I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

71
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact exact statistic or the</font>

72
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,980
exact percentage on the statistic this

73
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,510
is just paraphrasing on my part<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

74
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,600
there was something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 75 or more</font>

75
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,000
percent of accidents happen within five

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
miles of your home now you can you can

77
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
like take this a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred different ways</font>

78
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,840
right you can say oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god around my</font>

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,870
home I must drive worse oh my god around

80
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">my home it must be more dangerous or oh</font>

81
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,870
my god I spend more time around my home

82
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,310
so of course most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the accidents are</font>

83
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,230
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around my home most people</font>

84
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,600
don't stray like 50 miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from</font>

85
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,280
their houses<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people will</font>

86
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,160
just take that as meaning one specific

87
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,800
thing they'll be like oh well going this

88
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,720
80-mile journey is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

89
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">dangerous to me because it's farther</font>

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,840
than five miles away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my house and</font>

91
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,560
that might be a shallower view and just

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,390
kind of a simpler view of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

93
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,010
happens in society<font color="#CCCCCC"> but society</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

94
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,840
takes every single thing that they hear

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,370
on the news this fact and it drives me

96
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,830
fucking insane and like even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that was</font>

97
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,770
a solid fact what they're saying like

98
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">what are the variables I want to know</font>

99
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,160
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this was researched who</font>

100
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,750
researched it how much money was put

101
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,330
into it are there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

102
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,980
constants<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there that make it so that</font>

103
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> variables when they change it makes</font>

104
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,270
sense scientifically it's just like I

105
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,970
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the statistics out</font>

106
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,230
there and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the facts out there</font>

107
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,810
in the news are either biased by

108
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,090
whatever company is promoting them or

109
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,180
they the science behind it is biased and

110
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,550
basically news is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to catch</font>

111
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">you in and get ratings and stuff anyway</font>

112
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,430
so it's not like it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

113
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually true now I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hate news for doing</font>

114
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,170
that but what I hate more is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

115
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,730
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and how stupid it seems like</font>

116
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are I'm sorry to say it but it</font>

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,180
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the majority of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

118
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,980
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> today are really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stupid because</font>

119
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,360
they don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside the box they</font>

120
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,770
don't keep an open mind they just hear

121
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,540
something then they relay it and if you

122
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,610
have ever in grade school played the

123
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,440
game telephone i think in other

124
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,820
countries it has a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> name but</font>

125
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,829
basically you sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a circle with a</font>

126
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,260
bunch of kids and you whisper something

127
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,540
to the next kid and they whisper that to

128
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,919
the next kid in the next connect skin

129
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,120
the next skin by the time you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

130
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,490
end of the line it comes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> as some</font>

131
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,240
completely

132
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,590
different thing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was relayed</font>

133
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,789
and people misheard it or people

134
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,349
embellished it or people changed it a

135
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,270
little bit or paraphrased and that

136
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,220
happens a lot of society to like you

137
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">here you know Osama bin Laden is still</font>

138
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,289
alive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the next person is like</font>

139
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,449
Osama bin Laden killed 50 people and

140
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,740
he's still alive and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one was</font>

141
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,479
like Osama bin Laden killed five

142
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,979
thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and then shot himself</font>

143
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">dead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now he's dead it's like what the</font>

144
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">fuck you that's not fact at all and it's</font>

145
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,430
so brief it's too brief to actually hold

146
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,710
any truth and it's so easily

147
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,840
misconstrued as something else it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

148
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
ridiculous and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people will just</font>

149
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
take things as fact and spread them

150
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,210
around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're spreading idiocy</font>

151
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,039
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ignorance and it's just</font>

152
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,289
awful and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something that has</font>

153
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,030
always bothered me that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

154
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,069
apparent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that I shouldn't take any</font>

155
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,259
statistic as a fact just by hearing the

156
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,419
statistic I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> think oh that's an</font>

157
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,400
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept now let me you know</font>

158
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,380
apply logic to that and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know my</font>

159
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,240
rationale and then let's like do more

160
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,130
research into this actual statistic

161
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,870
where did they get it from what

162
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,449
foundation did this if like something

163
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,240
like the meat industry makes a statistic

164
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's better for the world</font>

165
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,949
that we eat meat because<font color="#CCCCCC"> yada yada that</font>

166
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,169
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely false and looked at</font>

167
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,690
in a specific targeted way to make it

168
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem that way and in the same wrong of</font>

169
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,259
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> media kind of betrayal i guess</font>

170
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,509
i would say you can take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> statement</font>

171
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:51,300
that is one hundred percent true and and

172
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,240
say use words and phrases such a way

173
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,159
that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think a certain way</font>

174
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,860
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actually being unbiased about</font>

175
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,380
it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's</font>

176
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,440
take a fact any fact um this soft box is

177
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,990
very bright ok so the soft box is bright

178
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">i guess that's kind of a like an opinion</font>

179
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,219
because Jay would say this soft box is

180
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,719
like burning his eyes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like</font>

181
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,969
completely used to it so let's say this

182
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">soft box is rectangular some people will</font>

183
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">say like it is an appealing shape other</font>

184
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,460
people will say it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the shape of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

185
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,169
devil let's say it's a pentagram or

186
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,580
something and you just like the way it's

187
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,780
a bad example I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a good</font>

188
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,069
example right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to keep</font>

189
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,599
my videos a little bit more brief

190
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,710
because I've heard people are having

191
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,750
problems with listening to the whole

192
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,150
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or me getting sidetrack and stuff</font>

193
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:39,870
and I don't know

194
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,700
how true that is I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a majority</font>

195
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,830
of people do do other things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

196
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,780
listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me or they're watching and</font>

197
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,370
they're fine with listening to you know

198
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,990
15<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes of boobs rather than seven</font>

199
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,940
minutes of boobs or you know other

200
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,980
people have a time allotted to watch

201
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube or other people on their</font>

202
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,350
favorite youtubers so it doesn't take up

203
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,550
that much time I don't know what's going

204
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,650
on but um if I had more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to actually</font>

205
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,890
think of a better instance I would but

206
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,900
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can just manipulate words</font>

207
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,510
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> things with such intention that</font>

208
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,130
it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think a certain thing</font>

209
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,780
and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like everyone needs to keep</font>

210
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,850
an open mind and actually analyze the

211
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,070
words that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they here rather than just</font>

212
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking everything at the way the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

213
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,720
that's giving to them you know wants you

214
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,490
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and I learned that from</font>

215
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,430
a really young age like my<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents</font>

216
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,260
taught me not to just listen to anything

217
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,490
that everyone says and to question

218
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything and to actually make my own</font>

219
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,720
decisions based on my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> rationale my</font>

220
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,100
own moral compass and everything like

221
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,350
that so it's helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a lot to grow up</font>

222
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that mindset where it's not just like</font>

223
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was told to follow this religion and</font>

224
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,270
this is a fact and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I never was allowed</font>

225
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,180
to question it or think about it or

226
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,670
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is more into just watching</font>

227
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,870
the news all the time and then like

228
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,490
relaying it to their friends and being

229
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,050
like oh this is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that oh my</font>

230
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">god the state</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of affairs oh my god we</font>

231
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,870
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly about everything and then</font>

232
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,940
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who do that people who relay the</font>

233
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,010
information are often people who act

234
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">like they're know-it-alls and I think</font>

235
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,590
they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something when really they're</font>

236
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,940
just hearing it from like a third party

237
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,970
or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> middleman and it just it's not</font>

238
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,580
based in fact it's based in whatever

239
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,650
sells at the time and however it was

240
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,080
constructed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sound and that just kind</font>

241
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,390
of sucks so I appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

242
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,310
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things analytically and</font>

243
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,260
delve deeper into things rather than

244
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,240
just you know filling their head with

245
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,250
useless nonsense and that's why I opted

246
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,080
out of even listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news like I</font>

247
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,700
know some of the topical situations that

248
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,370
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on so that you know because</font>

249
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,660
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over Facebook and social</font>

250
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,070
networking is just that kind of thing

251
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,680
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never been one to post like</font>

252
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,970
links and then have like a strong

253
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,190
opinion on you know social networks or

254
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">posts like I think it's also a little</font>

255
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">silly but likes their post quotes I see</font>

256
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,580
like most hot girls when they post a

257
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,659
picture of themselves it's just like a

258
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,910
hot sexy picture they post like a quote

259
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,110
that they think is a romantic<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

260
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,190
something and I've always thought that

261
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind of silly I myself don't just</font>

262
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,150
say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like here is my tits or</font>

263
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,980
I like this new shirt and then just like

264
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,320
blatantly you know gratuitously show my

265
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,140
tits or whatever I make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear that</font>

266
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,490
that's what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do but i also</font>

267
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to talk about other things like</font>

nothing wrong with that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like</font>

272
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a little funny the ways that people</font>

273
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,060
think they're deep in society today like

274
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,510
I will if I'm quoting something I will

275
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,010
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> say where it's quoted from and</font>

276
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,330
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I liked it and say why I like</font>

277
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,620
it or something like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm quoting like</font>

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,850
