00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
hey guys today I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,620
tackle a very serious topic that was

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,810
suggested by viewer and that is a

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,540
suicide<font color="#CCCCCC"> and depression and I'm going to</font>

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">preface this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by saying that I have never</font>

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">been so depressed that I have actually</font>

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,849
thought about suicide I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had my</font>

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,150
teenage angst<font color="#E5E5E5"> II periods where I you</font>

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,340
know was like oh and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really</font>

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,199
really really sad like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've like cried</font>

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,359
myself to sleep any times over certain

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,580
things most live it most of it was in

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past it's been a very very long time</font>

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,480
since I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had any I can't even remember</font>

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,920
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it feels like but I know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,149
happened I know there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been times</font>

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,890
where I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> so happy where I was</font>

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even possibly imagine being</font>

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,070
this sad like there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing in my life</font>

20
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could ever happen that would make</font>

21
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">me this sad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then there have been</font>

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,809
times where I actually became that sad

23
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,270
and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> just happened that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

24
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,280
that so and I've always just

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,170
rationalized that it will get better and

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,300
it always does you know like if you're

27
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,760
just feeling a bit under the weather or

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,469
a bit of malaise where you just don't

29
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,879
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's wrong but you're just</font>

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,260
kind of sad or depressed for whatever

31
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,660
reason maybe it's you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> raining</font>

32
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,770
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's making you depressed but</font>

33
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,390
you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really pinpoint why you're sad</font>

34
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,700
you just feel kind of down a really good

35
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,260
way to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that is to just take a</font>

36
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,150
nap<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sleep it off it actually you'll</font>

37
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,340
wake<font color="#CCCCCC"> up feeling so much better but</font>

38
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">depression is not something that to be</font>

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,210
taking lightly it's pretty different

40
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,189
than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being sad it's actually a</font>

41
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,750
chemical imbalance in the brain most of

42
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,100
the time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not it doesn't really</font>

43
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,710
necessarily have to do with any specific

44
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,990
life event it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an issue that</font>

45
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,659
you should go seek help for and you

46
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,189
should talk to someone and you should

47
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely check it out I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

48
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,159
most insurance providers will work with

49
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,170
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have who need to see a</font>

50
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,970
psychologist or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a psychiatrist it's it's</font>

51
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,619
definitely a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's considered a</font>

52
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,170
real issue and if you don't change it no

53
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,820
amount of good things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life can</font>

54
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually make you feel better it's</font>

55
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,670
actually a chemical imbalance in your

56
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,649
brain where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really can't</font>

57
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,299
really pinpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh my wife is</font>

58
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,130
leaving me certain types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

59
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,630
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just makes you so sad that you could</font>

60
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,310
end up committing suicide or having

61
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,560
suicidal tendencies or thoughts and I

62
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,060
think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge problem so if</font>

63
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,500
you're experiencing this right now you

64
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,140
should definitely talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone I have</font>

65
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,630
had two instances two possible instances

66
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,780
of suicide from like a person I know in

67
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,629
my life one of them was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fan of my work</font>

68
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,880
a fan of my modeling

69
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,380
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> met him at an event called</font>

70
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,950
glamourcon he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like tall cute</font>

71
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,160
redheaded guy and he came from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Britain i</font>

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,450
think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> their wales i'm not quite</font>

73
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,760
sure with a group of guys to go to

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,110
glamourcon to see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Playboy</font>

75
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,480
models and porn stars and myself and we

76
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,860
took pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we talked and he</font>

77
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,630
bought some of my merchandise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I gave</font>

78
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,740
him some autographs and stuff and he was

79
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,240
like the sweetest guy ever and then a

80
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,250
couple months later someone messaged me

81
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,410
on Facebook and said that he had

82
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,820
committed suicide and taken his own life

83
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,020
and everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was just like</font>

84
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sad to me because there was no</font>

85
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,160
indication of there was anything wrong

86
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes that can be the case</font>

87
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,030
another issue that happened to me if you

88
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys watched my draw my life you know a</font>

89
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,660
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this but um supposedly</font>

90
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,540
my friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrews death was ruled a</font>

91
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,370
suicide or an accidental death i'm not

92
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,630
quite sure which I was pretty young at

93
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,650
the time so I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to delve too</font>

94
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,660
much into the logistics I was just kind

95
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,010
of mad<font color="#CCCCCC"> and pissed off at the same time</font>

96
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,920
he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having issues with drugs and he</font>

97
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,180
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also having issues with a drug</font>

98
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,610
dealer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was dealing drugs to him and</font>

99
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,360
he was kind of in too deep and needed

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,340
money and needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> help and needed some</font>

101
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,260
guidance and he came to me the night

102
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,900
before he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was found dead and I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

103
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">busy with my stupid boyfriend to deal</font>

104
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,860
with him and for a while I felt guilty

105
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's hard for me to feel guilty when</font>

106
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,480
i rationalize it because you know there

107
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,490
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of different instances and</font>

108
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,930
times when you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something slightly</font>

109
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,310
different and something doesn't seem

110
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,110
like a big deal at the time and then it

111
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,910
ends up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being a huge life-altering deal</font>

112
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,640
and you can't always predict that if one

113
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your friends says that they need you</font>

114
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,990
I think it's best to just help them but

115
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you don't help them or if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

116
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,720
busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you find yourself caught</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up in</font>

117
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,760
your own issues or you just didn't

118
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,670
answer the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

119
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">can change it it's not your own fault</font>

120
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,730
they made their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions and that's</font>

121
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,840
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to understand you</font>

122
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,010
can't blame yourself and blaming

123
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,890
yourself doesn't do anything because

124
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,090
rationally and honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't go</font>

125
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,440
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and you can't change</font>

126
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,180
anything it's just it's something that

127
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,800
happened and what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

128
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from it and keep the good memories</font>

129
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,209
stored away and remember that person and

130
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,220
order that person by whatever mistake

131
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,500
you make don't make it again or whenever

132
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,959
you're sad remember that there's no real

133
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason to be sad in life like I have a</font>

134
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,690
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different opinion</font>

135
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,840
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> suicides and a lot of other people I</font>

136
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it should be your right to</font>

137
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,490
commit suicide<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you feel honestly like</font>

138
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,230
you don't want to live anymore it's your

139
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,940
body it's your life if you want to end

140
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,400
it go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and do it but at the same</font>

141
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,070
time there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really any reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

142
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,440
that I so it's kind of I'm conflicted in

143
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,700
my mind because it's like I don't really

144
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">like having someone be on suicide watch</font>

145
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,370
or someone being told that they can't

146
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,810
end their own life under the perfect

147
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,340
circumstances like for instance there a

148
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,110
paraplegic that can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even move their</font>

149
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,030
eyes or whatever and they can only think

150
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,840
and they're trapped in their own

151
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,670
personal hell like that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font>

152
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,830
understand end in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life but a lot of</font>

153
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,330
times people in their lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because</font>

154

171
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,040
living and I mean physically able to

172
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,930
live if you can't like move around on

173
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,610
your own and you had a terrible accident

174
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now your quality of life is you know</font>

175
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,350
below anything else like even if you're

176
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,820
homeless you can come back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

177
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,040
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make something of your life and you</font>

178
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,470
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know create a life that's worth</font>

179
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,270
living so it's very important to

180
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,890
treasure<font color="#CCCCCC"> your life over anything else</font>

181
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,140
and to not give<font color="#CCCCCC"> up but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time</font>

182
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,330
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am not religious so I don't see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font>

183
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,800
something if you do it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

184
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,230
hell but i also<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see it as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

185
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,390
way out of just having a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard time in</font>

186
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,160
life if you've ever been happy before or

187
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,870
if you can ever see yourself being happy

188
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,610
again you should just strive for

189
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,340
happiness and not let any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

190
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,470
depression or issues deal with it like

191
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,600
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life in a way where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

192
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,730
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end it that's it's so sad</font>

193
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,230
and it's so tragic when that happens and

194
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,140
I I can't imagine like I've actually had

195
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,660
a friend recently it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

217
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,100
get into coping mechanisms for their

218
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,660
sadness that can be destructive in

219
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,580
themselves like drinking too much or

220
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and having like casual sex</font>

221
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,400
where you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no actual moral compass</font>

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,500
anymore and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you just need to</font>

is making you sad if there actually is

262
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,250
an entity that's making you sad if you

263
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,049
can't pinpoint why you're sad but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
