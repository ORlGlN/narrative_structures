00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
hey guys so today I wanted to talk about

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,589
a jealousy and how to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it i was</font>

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:05,759
going to initially talked about the

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,230
healing properties of sex because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's really cool topic but</font>

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,620
someone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments gave me a great</font>

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,210
suggestion about how does your jealousy

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i am a good teacher so to</font>

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,590
speak of this kind of thing because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,060
so logical and because i have a

11
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,650
relationship that in most cultures would

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,330
require you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be jealous very often</font>

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,060
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't go with the whole normal</font>

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,369
conventions of relationships but first<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

15
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,929
wanted to really quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> promised</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

16
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,090
refer back to my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> vlog so there's</font>

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a Terry's comments in</font>

18
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,180
between the last vlog in this video but

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last actual vlog that I did I talked</font>

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">about I hate hating misleading media and</font>

21
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,489
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were kind of saying that</font>

22
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,079
it's hypocritical and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain</font>

23
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,270
how it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even possible that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

24
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,520
hypocritical first of all you can't

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,739
compare me at all like I'm an

26
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,239
entertainment entity entity to an actual

27
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,660
reputable news broadcasting corporation

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,120
that you know is supposed to have some

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,539
kind of you know it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

30
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,309
some kind of truth in it because people

31
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,229
base their whole like fiscal projections

32
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,479
on it and how the economy is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

33
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that might actually change</font>

34
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,150
their lives like you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what's</font>

35
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,470
actually going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world and</font>

36
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,509
these people are meant to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious and</font>

37
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,479
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the facts and they sway you in</font>

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,820
a direction that is very important in

39
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,780
your life like you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what's</font>

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,750
how he is you know conducting his

slandering him or have an ulterior

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,409
motive or you know different objective

46
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,700
to try to get you to think a certain way

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is completely corrupt and</font>

48
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,579
absolutely fucked up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and has nothing to</font>

49
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,579
do with misleading titles or thumbnails

happen in the video no that didn't

86
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,599

87
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,940
instance of people reading the title and

88
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,950
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> going in and immediately having an</font>

89
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,209
opinion on the video before even

90
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,530
watching and that's exactly what I'm

91
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,049
talking about guys you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hear like a</font>

92
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,940
second of something and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have an</font>

93
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,200
opinion and then you write<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and</font>

94
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you have a strong opinion about it</font>

95
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with people on the</font>

96
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,069
internet what the fuck you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

97
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:11,239
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I talked about in the video if</font>

98
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,430
you're saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can be equated to</font>

99
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,099
misleading media in the capacity that

100
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,750
I'm talking about it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual video</font>

101
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,579
fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> retarded and then someone also</font>

102
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,730
brought up that I say cum tribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tara</font>

103
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,700
Reid's comments number blah blah now

104
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,600
everyone knows the terriots comments

105
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,639
it's just me reading comments so the

106
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,170
title is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the most ridiculous</font>

107
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,340
comment that I read and the most

108
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,690
ridiculous comment that I read was the

109
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,859
cum tribute video I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pretty</font>

110
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,989
fucking stupid that people would say

111
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,910
that anyway rant over let's talk about

112
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,950
jealousy now as a lot of you know I'm

113
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,630
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> into monogamy I don't have a</font>

114
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">boyfriend I don't do the swingers party</font>

115
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,130
stuff so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to try</font>

116
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,859
to put a label on what I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay</font>

117
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,630
and what I have with other men and women

118
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,060
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel like I can jay</font>

119
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,599
is beyond soulmate to me and everything

120
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,910
else is just fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> and having sex because</font>

121
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,609
sex is physical to me now usually people

122
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,530
don't do this in society because of the

123
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,150
jealousy aspects like obviously there's

124
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,980
the tradition and<font color="#E5E5E5"> being raised to think</font>

125
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,230
a certain way but there's also the

126
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,359
aspect of just oh my god<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would be so</font>

127
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,130
angry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> jealous if some guy slept with</font>

128
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,470
my girlfriend and that's just how people

129
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,539
react it's very selfish way to feel i

130
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,190
believe because you're holding someone

131
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,180
back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something that they</font>

132
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,650
carnally want to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would excite</font>

133
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,120
them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for them that</font>

134
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,330
would

135
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,590
let them explore<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world it's</font>

136
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,849
basically like holding them back from

137
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,379
experiences that they could be having

138
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and let's say that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is another soul</font>

139
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,379
mate out there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be better for</font>

140
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,879
them if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> love them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would want</font>

141
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,590
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that person not that that</font>

142
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,719
and it's like it's like putting more

143
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,060
trust into the person when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

144
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,560
monogamous because you're trusting that

145
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,849
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you exactly what's</font>

146
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,289
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

147
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,699
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about their fantasies and</font>

148
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:47,960
that you're let in on everything that's

149
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,400
going on so you know that you're safe

150
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,349
and protected and it feels so much

151
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">closer when you don't have to hide that</font>

152
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,469
kind of thing so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people these days</font>

153
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,479
are hiding that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> even like look at</font>

154
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,069
other girls asses and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font>

155
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,780
stupid and ridiculous and to me I just

156
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at it and it's so immature it's</font>

157
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know some kid is playing with</font>

158
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">your toy in the playground and you get</font>

159
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,110
super mad and you walk over then you

160
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,430
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now you want to bully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him and</font>

161
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,389
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and that's just</font>

162
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,879
ridiculous I full I wholeheartedly

163
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,419
believe that the emotion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of jealousy is</font>

164
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,120
a negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in all circumstances and</font>

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
should be eradicated as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

166
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,669
possibly can with a rationale and logic

167
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,860
but let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me differentiate between</font>

168
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,610
jealousy and envy ok so the Webster's

169
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,419
dictionary in a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

170
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:30,620
dictionaries might just kind of lump

171
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,990
them together as synonyms but for me and

172
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,150
all intents and purposes of this video

173
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,069
I'm having a hard time talking it

174
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,599
happens a lot when I just took caffeine

175
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,909
I start stuttering and stuff and my mind

176
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,759
is going faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than my talking my mouth</font>

177
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,460
so I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stutter anyway um so</font>

178
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,129
jealousy to me and for the purposes of

179
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">this video is a when you are having a</font>

180
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,979
negative emotion based on the feelings

181
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,690
that someone is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take something</font>

182
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,339
that belongs to you so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you</font>

183
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,190
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a best friend and that</font>

184
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,569
best friend starts spending more time

185
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,120
with someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else or you feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like your</font>

186
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">boyfriend is giving affection to some</font>

187
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,419
other girl or is you know checking out

188
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:09,770
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other girl in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're worried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

189
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,629
you're gonna lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> your station as his</font>

190
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,159
girlfriend like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

191
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:15,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">jealousy and it's just unnecessary and</font>

192
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,770
can be mitigated with you know rational

193
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,389
thinking conversations with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

194
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,659
boyfriend and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust basically so and</font>

195
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,339
then on the other end of the spectrum is

196
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,620
envy and envy is like how I feel when

197
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm watching the office yes I'm still

198
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,940
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> the office and I see Angela so</font>

199
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,440
fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> short and tiny and I'm like oh</font>

200
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,289
she's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> cute I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally wish I had that</font>

201
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:37,849
height and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally wish I was that</font>

202
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,420
tiny and cute

203
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm only three inches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taller than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her I</font>

204
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,990
really would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that short I</font>

205
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's adorable and I think it's</font>

206
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,720
sexy and I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can throw people</font>

207
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,920
around in bed and I think if you have

208
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,750
big tits on that frame it's so hot<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

209
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,160
she definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> has implants by the way</font>

210
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">she just hides them pretty well you</font>

211
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,430
should check<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the episode where she's</font>

212
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,140
wearing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nurse's outfit she totally</font>

213
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,550
has fake boobs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're little and</font>

214
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,340
they're cute it's adorable anyway but um

215
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,680
some people will do negative things with

216
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,260
envy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Envy can be it can be something</font>

217
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know gives you gives you</font>

218
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,700
motivation in the gym like when I go to

219
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,930
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gym and I see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these like really</font>

220
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,760
fit hot girls or these really fit

221
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,140
Hawkeyes that gives me and Jay

222
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,420
motivation to just you know work harder

223
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,220
and reach the goals that you've set for

224
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,660
yourself because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you see someone</font>

225
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,730
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has reached your personal goals</font>

226
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're like I want to get there on it</font>

227
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,510
can strengthen you but of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> envy if</font>

228
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,670
you're in a bad state emotionally and

229
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,110
you have some insecurity issues or

230
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,000
whatever what have you it can be

231
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,320
negative like you can start treating the

232
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,110
person worse you can react negatively

233
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,000
you can be put in a bad mood but it

234
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,260
doesn't necessarily have to be negative

235
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion jealousy and the way I</font>

236
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,250
define jealousy does have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative</font>

237
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,800
because it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be mitigated with you</font>

238
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,590
know certain you know mature steps where

239
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,820
you just like talk to your boyfriend i

240
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,960
don't really like how you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this</font>

241
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,490
it's making me insecure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say well</font>

242
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this for blahdy blahdy</font>

243
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,250
blah reasons you don't have to worry

244
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,570
about it or if he's honest you can be

245
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,830
like well yeah I kind of do have

246
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,420
feelings for<font color="#E5E5E5"> her and then you can either</font>

247
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,980
end the relationship or deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it or</font>

248
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,540
have counseling and talk it out it's all

249
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,070
about talking it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about being</font>

250
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,540
secure with yourself and if you're not

251
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,680
secure with yourself you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

252
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,730
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your boyfriend cheating on</font>

253
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,590
every fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> person or with every</font>

254
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,750
fucking person because you don't feel

255
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,640
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deserve someone who doesn't</font>

256
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,750
treat<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like that and then you end up</font>

257
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,730
getting in bad relationships because you

258
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,740
don't see your own self-worth and that

259
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,030
kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a slippery slope</font>

260
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,400
that is just awful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're doing</font>

261
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,020
anything negative to someone else

262
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,400
because you're jealous or envious of

263
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,610
them is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not okay so i used to be a</font>

264
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,440
very jealous girl I used to subscribe to

265
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,540
the notion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there was like</font>

266
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,400
this ridiculous romance where a guy

267
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,240
would just fall in love<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me and</font>

268
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,770
never ever again look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at another woman</font>

269
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,750
and you know he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like not have</font>

270
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,100
any balls or testosterone it would just

271
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,840
be gone and everything would be perfect

272
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,380
and I you know that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> silly because</font>

273
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,200
sex is physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are biologically</font>

274
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,460
going to be attracted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other people</font>

275
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you act on it sure if you have</font>

276
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,290
some contract with someone basically

277
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,190
where you're like

278
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah we're monogamous and then they</font>

279
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,190
break that trust that's breaking trust

280
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,260
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily breaking trust</font>

281
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,760
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contract and</font>

282
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,020
you're like yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to</font>

283
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience life I want you to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun I</font>

284
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,750
want you to enjoy things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want you to</font>

285
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,890
bring girls over let's have a threesome

286
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,110
that kind of thing so what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

287
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,030
really just understand is that when you

288
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,830
feel that pang of jealousy which I still

289
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">do occasionally I still feel the</font>

290
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,760
negative pangs of jealousy you just kind

291
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,360
of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just think about why you feel</font>

292
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,010
that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk with your partner about it</font>

293
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,300
talk with whatever's making you jealous

294
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,910
about it and just kind of be happy with

295
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,620
yourself and know that if something

296
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens that is unfavorable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you like</font>

297
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,830
he starts cheating on you or he leaves

298
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,780
you or your best friend isn't hanging

299
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,250
out with you as much anymore that you

300
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,810
are worth better and that if someone's

301
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,910
doing you wrong or doing you harm that

302
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,980
they don't deserve you and that it hurts

303
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,390
and it sucks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just have to move</font>

304
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,060
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just get over it basically</font>

305
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,980

own relationship over the jealousy

323

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just called insecurity and it's</font>

324
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,120
immature and it shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

325
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,370
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should either be happy for</font>

talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him about it him or her I guess</font>

328
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,070
I'm just like this is like random<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

329
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,990
random perspectives so don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

330
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't go both ways it goes every</font>

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,520
which way male female female female male

332
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,460
male does matter it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just has</font>

333
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,320
to do with when you feel those pangs of

334
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,089
jealousy and you can you can learn to

335
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,440
logic yourself out of that kind of thing

336
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,839
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have and i can because it's</font>

337
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,580
like that's silly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i'm happy</font>

338
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,720
with myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy with this</font>

339
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,890
relationship but know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not i'm</font>

340
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to this person about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

341
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,060
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just simple as that now it's kind</font>

342
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,830
of hard for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to empathize a lot with</font>

343
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,650
very very deep-seated jealousy and

344
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,960
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues because the things that</font>

345
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,089
make me jealous have always<font color="#E5E5E5"> also turned</font>

346
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,510
me on which is kind of funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like I</font>

347
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,610
sometimes get jealous like Jays fucking

348
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,990
hot chick but it's also really

349
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,760
fucking hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like the jealousy kind</font>

350
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,320
of fuels the sexuality and if I just

351
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,910
don't focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jealousy just becomes</font>

352
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,740
like a really erotic sexual experience I

353
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,600
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole peeping tom thing</font>

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've told you guys before one of my</font>

355
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,630
fetishes is like watching a guy

371
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,830
require certain ridiculous amounts of

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,110
you know someone trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you feel</font>

373
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">better you should work on yourself and</font>

make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're in a happy place</font>

375
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,640
with yourself before you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,720
relationship if you don't love yourself

377
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,880
no one can truly love you because

378
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,160
they're loving this side of you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

379
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,920
just flawed and hurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> and needs to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

380
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,200
nursed and when you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font>

381
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,730
relationship it's kind of a bad place to

382
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,440
build a relationship on you should build

383
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">a relationship in your life when you</font>

384

<font color="#CCCCCC">have a stable job when you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with</font>

385
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,000
yourself and when this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">stable job and they're happy with</font>

387
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves and then the stars align and</font>

388
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,260
you're together and you're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun if</font>

389
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't work out it's not necessarily</font>

390
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,000
your fault or their fault it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you</font>

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be or the lifestyle you chose isn't</font>

393
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,829
meant for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you should try other</font>

394
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:30,120
things in experiment and keep an open

395
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,860
mind so that's all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to say about</font>

396
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and hopefully that was articulate I</font>
