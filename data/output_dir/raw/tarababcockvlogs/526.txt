my fucking computer oh just emanates so

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,469
much heat and it's already over 100

22
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,879
degrees inside the house because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,559
don't have central air<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's just</font>

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,829
like it makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to move to fucking</font>

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">antarctica Greenland or Iceland I heard</font>

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,270
that Iceland is greener and Greenland is

<font color="#E5E5E5">know but it's so fucking awful so I have</font>

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,799
this headache and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if I don't</font>

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,840
drink like ice cold water every five

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,310
seconds I start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a heat stroke</font>

33
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,979
which feels awful it's like nausea and

34
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,259
lightheadedness and I just always feel

35
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,680
darja canned have an overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling of</font>

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,350
malaise all the time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worst but</font>

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,280
anyway um I also did so I slept wrong I

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,470
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> my neck hurts like crazy or so like</font>

39
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,850
when I was blow-drying my hair which is

40
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,250
awful in this heat by the way but I have

41
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,900
to do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I don't I'm waiting</font>

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,820
like fucking four hours to do anything

43
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">like do streaming and then if I leave my</font>

44
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,479
hair wet and I put a headset over the

45
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,310
headset feels gross because it's all wet

46
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,259
and yeah so I like pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much have to</font>

47
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,430
do it it's like necessary um but yeah my

48
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,100
neck<font color="#CCCCCC"> is hurting and I'm sweaty and it's</font>

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,570
impossible to get motivation for the gym

50
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,060
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it anyway and feeling just</font>

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,670
like I'm carrying like third 300 extra

52
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,340
pounds what is this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a weird</font>

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,619
darkness whatever who cares so today I

54
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:02,850
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something stupid and</font>

55
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,439
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be me rambling and</font>

56
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,759
hopefully I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> offend anyone I'm not</font>

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,200
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offend anyone it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,568
observation that will either be obvious

59
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,610
or not obvious to you guys depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

60
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,160
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not you've just this is</font>

61
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,480
popped<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your head randomly i get</font>

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,810
like stupid epiphanies as to why i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

63
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,390
the way things are are the way they are

64
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,070
if that makes any fucking sense oh my

65
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,250
god I feel so retarded today but um is

66
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,710
so this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be about why it</font>

67
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,140
seems like the stereotype of a nerd

68
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,090
having like asthma or acne or like some

69
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,020
kind of weird semi disability disability

70
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,410
why that's so prevalent and why it is a

71
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,240
fucking stereotype that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rings</font>

72
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,430
true it's like you know anytime<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

73
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,870
a nerd you imagine his glasses and

74
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,390
asthma<font color="#CCCCCC"> he can't do sports or you know</font>

75
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,850
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lot of acne or he's got like</font>

76
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,580
the redheaded complexion where<font color="#E5E5E5"> he can't</font>

77
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">really go out in the Sun and it's like</font>

78
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,230
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it that ailments on people that</font>

79
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">are like biological hereditary um end up</font>

80
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,850
happening to people that end up being

81
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">nerdy or outcast or dorks or geeks and</font>

82
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,490
um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be kind of obvious</font>

83
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,550
to to correlate the two because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

84
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,740
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it like why like what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

85
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,770
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are hard in life</font>

86
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,500
if you let's say have asthma well you

87
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,870
can't do sports it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to keep</font>

88
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,160
up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other kids so of course</font>

89
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,920
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be you know a or an</font>

90
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,570
outcast in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the derogatory way where you</font>

91
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,040
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have made many friends or</font>

92
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,310
you know you're not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> um socially</font>

93
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,860
apt right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it makes sense</font>

94
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,170
because all of these ailments will often

95
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,940
lead to either being teased or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

96
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,350
able to keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other kids or not</font>

97
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">being able to hang out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with other kids</font>

98
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,890
and do the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that other kids you</font>

99
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,870
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy doing and I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

100
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">was so funny that like when I find a</font>

101
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,430
nerd I'm always like you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

102
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,560
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird allergies or asthma</font>

103
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,860
or like hay fever type stuff all the

104
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,290
time it's got to be something and there

105
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,020
always is and for me it's kind of funny

106
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,860
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not allergic to anything</font>

107
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,660
I've never<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a problem with any of</font>

108
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,810
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and I thought that correlation</font>

109
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,890
was kind of funny um but yeah I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

110
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,390
makes sense that having certain like

111
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,108
flaws

112
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,240
makes it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's hard for you to</font>

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,439
make friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's kind of sad</font>

114
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,240
because people like when you're growing

115
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,620
up if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> asthma and you can't play</font>

116
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,330
sports people are like oh well you know

117
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,710
fuck you you can't hang out in my social

118
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,509
groups because you know you have some

119
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of weird disability that makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

120
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,840
that so that you can't keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

121
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,669
in football or flag football or soccer

122
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,009
where the fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> is popular there and that</font>

123
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,210
makes you not a jock and that makes you

124
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,520
a nerd you know by proxy which is kind

125
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,169
of fucking weird right it's not just

126
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,849
weird i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really have</font>

127
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:48,990
a topic today well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

128
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,639
really intense topics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been</font>

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,969
feeling like kind of not very well

130
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:57,330
obviously look at me i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh i mean</font>

131
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,129
i feei look normal because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm really</font>

132
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,750
good at looking normal I've you know

133
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,909
many days I felt like shit and had to

00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:06,360
you know fucking go to a photo shoot or

135
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,340
something but the clarity of my thought

136
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,490
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is not very it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>
