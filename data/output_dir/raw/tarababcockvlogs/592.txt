next thing which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of related but</font>

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,210

32
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,869
called sexy story time for my vlog

33
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Channel and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

34
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to write a short story like an</font>

35
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,869
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> like creative writing short story</font>

36
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,479
based on a sex experience and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

37
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,979
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide whether or not it's non</font>

38
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,049
fiction fiction or just fantasy of mine

39
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,670
and you get to guess and then the next

40
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">episode I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you guys this</font>

41
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,090
is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool and I'm</font>

42
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,360
always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wear my my fake reading</font>

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,369
glasses and I'm going to read from my

44
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,700
zelda / sexy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tara book so it's gonna be</font>

45
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun and the first one is about an</font>

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,350
encounter with someone who plays magic

47
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,880
the gathering because it's all I can

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,200
think about right now so might as well

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,720
combine the two interests right and I

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,590
think it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be really</font>

51
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,020
interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also going to</font>

52
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,240
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an outlet for me sexually because I</font>

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,130
sometimes get caught up in like fantasy

54
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,299
type stuff and I'm just like oh I want

55
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">to write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

56
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,030
and I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really overactive</font>

57
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,520
imagination with everything which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why</font>

58
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm always thinking about new content</font>

59
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,049
and I actually have this on my iPhone I

60
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,300
have a notepad with like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

61
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,560
ideas that I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,879
eventually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write about like our</font>

63
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,900
TVs

64
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,819
and just cool segments that I could do

65
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,200
things that I can't do right now because

66
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,329
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the manpower like actual</font>

67
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,579
skits and stuff I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be really</font>

68
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:23,730
cool and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even filming like a hole</font>

69
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,280
Magic the Gathering tournament where my

70
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,980
station or something is always the

71
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,650
station that has the camera or something

72
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,079
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like my very</font>

73
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,329
own um tournament or something I think

74
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be cool to run my own</font>

75
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,579
tournament I always wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run my own</font>

76
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,859
Starcraft tournament and I think it

77
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,480
would be cooler to run a magic one

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,060
because magic is more of a something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

79
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,590
play in real life and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

80
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,359
bunch of computers set up or like to

81
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,769
rent a LAN or anything like that you

82
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need tables you know so I could do</font>

83
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,470
it anywhere and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be much easier</font>

84
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,170
to do I'm just really excited about that

85
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really sad and I'm</font>

86
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pissed off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and I haven't</font>

87
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,989
told you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys yet because i'm just so</font>

88
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:03,540
frustrated as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going to China can</font>

89
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,829
you fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm not going</font>

90
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,569
to get to do my dream job thing which is

91
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">ridiculous and you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know why I</font>

92
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,500
said okay as<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

93
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,349
job position i applied for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my my</font>

94
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,060
passport and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worried that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

95
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,900
wouldn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passport in time</font>

96
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,910
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole United States</font>

97
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,620
government shutdown thing but they were

98
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,209
still doing the passports so I got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

99
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,400
time and as soon as I got the passport I

100
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,019
sent it off to a passport agency in

101
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,510
order to get my visa so you can send it

102
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,889
off to an agency or you can go to the

103
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,510
embassy on your own but the embassy the

104
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,459
closest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is in san francisco</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

105
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,409
that's in California and I'm here in

106
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:37,680
Seattle so in if I didn't go down to LA

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,180
or San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco i would have to send</font>

108
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,470
off the passport so that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

109
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,930
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess they never called me back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

110
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,849
tell me its hold on me because I my

111
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,069
fuckin phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is full so anyway they</font>

112
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,659
never contacted me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let me know that</font>

113
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,069
they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more about my my</font>

114
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,489
profession in order to get the visa so

115
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,470
they're like when I called down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

116
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,970
realizing that I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten it yet</font>

117
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,519
they were like oh well didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we give</font>

118
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,650
you a call Mike no you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me a</font>

119
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,989
call about anything so the visa never

120
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,010
came back in time and I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

121
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,669
stupidest fucking reason in the world

122
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:09,989
they couldn't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else to</font>

123
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,180
expedite it it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> awful for me so</font>

124
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,930
I'm here so no vlogs from China or Korea

125
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,380
no event vlogs for a while at least but

126
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,539
I'm a little bit happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it because</font>

127
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,340
I get really homesick when I travel I

128
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,570
like to just stay home and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font>
