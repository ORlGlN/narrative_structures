8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,199
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my videos and i always attributed it</font>

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,789
to the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i work too hard and</font>

10
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,439
stared fucking bright lights all day<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

walking to the gym with<font color="#CCCCCC"> jay and i walked</font>

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,550
past this fucking I place and I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

18
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,750
it was like the same thing in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,670
it said like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I exam right and I was</font>

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking okay so I talked to people</font>

21
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,989
about getting an eye exam just to make

22
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,670
sure everything was fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything</font>

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,140
is okay and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not having some kind of</font>

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,300
serious problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> my eyes that might</font>

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,800
have stemmed from the circle lenses that

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,969
I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wear about six months ago</font>

27
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,590
because that's when it started happening

28
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,180
and if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember about six</font>

29
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,010
months ago I got a terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of</font>

30
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,629
pinkeye and I actually put a couple

31
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">pictures up on my Instagram of it it was</font>

32
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,159
not pretty and I was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> sick at the</font>

33
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,350
time and it just kind of progressed into

34
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,409
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that became pink eye as well</font>

35
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,450
and I read about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't</font>

36
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,280
necessarily have to be the circle lenses

37
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,930
that gave me the pink eye it could have

38
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,369
just been the fact that I was sick and

39
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,840
then it kind of escalated from there or

40
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,220
I was sick and I got something in my eye

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,360
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like more sensitive to it but</font>

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I went to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor and I</font>

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,450
got this like gel that I had to put in

44
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,460
my eyes and it got<font color="#CCCCCC"> better but I never</font>

45
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,350
really got like those crystal clear

46
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,970
white eyes that a lot of people have and

47
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,400
so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking I work really hard but</font>

48
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,780
I'm sure there's a lot of youtubers that

49
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,180
also work equally as hard and you know

50
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,619
maybe they don't play as many games as I

51
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,909
do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they sit in front of a camera</font>

52
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,590
just as much as I do in the edit<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos</font>

53
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,479
just as much as I do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do they have</font>

54
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">these like crystal fucking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes when</font>

55
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,299
they're doing their makeup videos and

56
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,310
i'm sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here with fucking bloodshot</font>

57
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,409
eyes that progressively get worse over

58
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,470
the day so I exam<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense I've never</font>

59
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,909
worn glasses I've never worn

60
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,130
prescription contacts and my Gunners are

61
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,570
not prescription and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped a</font>

62
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,829
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> I where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gunners if you guys</font>

63
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:02,880
don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is it's like those</font>

64
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,070
those yellow tinted glasses that are

65
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,950
marketed toward gamers and gamers wear

66
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,989
them when they like play games for a

67
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,370
long period of time and what's funny

68
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,480
Gunners is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people go like</font>

69
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,330
Gunners for<font color="#E5E5E5"> loll or Gunners for dark</font>

70
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,310
souls or Gunners for binding of isaac

71
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,860
and they're only parroting that because

72
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,959
the people who they chose to sponsor

73
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,390
gunners were like FPS players so they

74
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,310
think for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that only FPS</font>

75
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,750
players can benefit from a pair of

76
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,150
Gunners which is like ridiculous but I

77
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,129
am usually very skeptical and I don't

78
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:33,450
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things work but I can attest</font>

79
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,329
to at least feeling that I have some

80
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,769
kind of placebo effect when I put them

81
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,030
on because I can literally put them on

82
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,010
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like my eyesight is just</font>

83
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,410
better and it makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> J dizzy to wear them</font>

84
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,250
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wear them because</font>

85
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,540
they make him dizzy so that must mean

86
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,940
that whatever is focusing my eyes and

87
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,470
making my eyes feel better is actually

88
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,420
affecting J in some way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

89
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,879
getting dizzy from it but anyway I am

90
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">NOT sponsored by Gunners by the way so</font>

91
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,349
um I decided to go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

92
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,579
eye doctor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eye doctor was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

93
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,989
oh you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for your appointment and</font>

94
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:03,450
I'm like no and he was this like asian

95
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,879
dude this<font color="#E5E5E5"> youngish asian dude he was the</font>

96
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,769
doctor and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like super like</font>

97
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,269
nervous at first like he had like

98
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,159
slurring his words and like stuttering a

99
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,420
little bit and like saying weird things

100
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,430
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking I don't know if you</font>

101
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,780
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ever experienced this but</font>

102
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,730
people who are like shy around you or

103
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,709
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are just like have anxiety in</font>

104
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,260
general they kind of like have a hard

105
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,639
time keeping eye contact with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

106
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,530
they're like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like like this or</font>

107
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,459
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't even know how to do it</font>

108
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,200
but um I was like oh no I was just

109
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,370
coming in to see if I could come in for

110
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,590
a walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and he's like generally no but</font>

111
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,230
it's you know 5 45 in this chick who I

112
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,329
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 45 or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

113
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,799
chick who signed up for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> appointment</font>

114
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,959
today she didn't show up so sure I'll

115
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,699
take you in so I feel the stuff out I

116
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,260
tell them that my insurance probably

117
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,699
isn't going to cover except really shit

118
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,549
insurance and he takes me back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

119
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,590
room and he does a like first he does

120
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,180
this like preliminary I test where I

121
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,160
look into I'd stick my chin on the thing

122
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,269
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've never had an eye exam before</font>

123
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,250
because I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never felt the need to</font>

124
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,290
because you know other than like the

125
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,370
thing that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to do at elementary</font>

126
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,049
school where like they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

127
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,760
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kids out of class and then take</font>

128
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,470
them down and just like examine their

129
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,579
eyes and examine their backs for

130
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,500
scoliosis and stuff and then like send

131
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,489
them back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to class and I would say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

132
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,660
your eyes with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

133
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,579
like go to that it did it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

134
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,629
that kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never had like</font>

135
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,549
an actual with a bunch of like equipment

136
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,970
I exam you know so he puts me on this

137
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,168
thing with my chin in my head to the

138
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,690
thing and he like shines bright lights

139
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,729
into my eyes using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

140
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,000
move

141
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
over to the next equipment and the

142
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,460
equipment blows like fucking like an air

143
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">puff into my eyes and I'm like oh and</font>

148
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,450
you expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to be a fucking robot in</font>

149
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,610
like oh that feels fucking good so by

150
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,870
then my eyes are already fucking

151
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,320
watering and I go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual place</font>

152
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,720
where the the checking of the eyes is

153
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,040
going to happen and I sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

154
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,350
chair and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like pulls my eyes</font>

155
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,760
back and he's like shining a bright

156
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,280
light into my eyes and it's the craziest

157
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,540
fucking thing if you've ever had this

158
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,910
done to you it actually allows you to

159
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,770
see like blood vessels in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your eye</font>

160
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,680
through your own vision because

161
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,850
something about the cornea being behind

162
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,580
the eyeball and it's like he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it he</font>

163
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,470
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like shining like a light</font>

164
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,970
through your hand and being able to see

165
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,110
all the blood and the blood vessels and

166
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,970
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was like the most insane</font>

167
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,380
trippy thing I'm like how are you making

168
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">me see an image of a bunch of fucking</font>

169
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,150
veins in my eye that's crazy it was a

170
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool experience and i wish i was</font>

171
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,210
high for it which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't smoke weed if</font>

172
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,620
you watch my<font color="#CCCCCC"> other video you'll know why</font>

173
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,140
I'm that's also another video kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

174
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,020
refuting the reasoning behind everyone

175
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,400
thinking that I have red eyes which is

176
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,720
the fact that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> smoke a lot of pot which</font>

177
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,210
isn't the case at all I have never done

178
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">a video hi actually I have done one</font>

179
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:43,560
stream drunk but I've never done a video

180
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">hire drunk which would actually be kind</font>

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,770
of fun if you know I liked smoking pot

182
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,620
and alcohol wasn't calories basically so

183
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,050
anyway he's doing all these tests to me

184
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,880
and he's keeping completely silent the

185
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,770
entire time like I was expecting him to

186
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,380
after each test tell me well that looks

187
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,880
good or well that looks bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he</font>

188
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,250
wasn't saying anything right so he does

189
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,780
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> test and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next test is like</font>

190
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,120
just shining more lights and he had to

191
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,540
flip my top eyelids up right and then

192
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,130
like hold them up with like this q-tip

193
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,870
looking thing and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was like</font>

194
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,669
poking at them and stuff and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like</font>

195
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,169
okay that doesn't really feel great but

196
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,000
whatever a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people get my</font>

197
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,470
elementary<font color="#CCCCCC"> school when I was younger he</font>

198
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,669
used to flip their eyelids up to freak

199
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,680
me out or whatever and I would never do

200
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,900
it cuz it feels so gross you know like

201
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm like ah so I'm like not enjoying</font>

202
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,490
that part and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he did a couple other</font>

203
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,630
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just very similar to</font>

204
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sitting there</font>

205
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,860
waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's like writing on the paper</font>

206
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,860
writing and then he goes you're not

207
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,509
gonna like<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you I'm</font>

208
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,810
like what do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have AIDS what is going</font>

209
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,219
on like what's gonna happen to me I

210
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:49,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">might fucking gonna go blind eye and I</font>

211
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:50,580
don't understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> he would fucking</font>

212
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,159
introduce it like that when literally

213
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,960
all he had to say well it's actually

214
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of gross so bear with me but this</font>

215
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,439
is like I actually do have something

216
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with my eyes apparently which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

217
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,409
actually kind of happy to hear because

218
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:05,699
now I actually know and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix</font>

219
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,879
it so he says that I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an</font>

220
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,860
extreme allergic reaction in my eyes

221
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he thinks is from my foundation and</font>

222
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,060
the reason he thinks it's from my

223
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,879
foundation is because underneath the top

224
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,669
eyelid on the eyelid I have a bunch of

225
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,300
bumps that are caused from like it's

226
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,979
like I don't know calcium deposit type

227
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,439
bumps or something that are caused by

228
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,990
the allergic reaction and on top of

229
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">those bumps is like crusted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foundation</font>

230
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,110
and I'm like what first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all I don't</font>

231
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">even get like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation or concealer or</font>

232
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,949
anything really close to my eyes I like

233
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,250
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> let go like here and why are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you why</font>

234
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,500
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> not like eyelash glue or false</font>

235
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,710
eyelash pieces or mascara or you know

236
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,199
eyeliner I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a shadow</font>

237
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,969
that much but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to now why</font>

238
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,319
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be any of those things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

239
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,819
actually put like<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly on my eye</font>

240
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,250
like what why would it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> foundation and</font>

241
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,229
so he's telling me like a bunch of

242
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:02,520
things that to me don't make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

243
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,339
like he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the stuff on the</font>

244
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,069
bumps was pink but you know obviously

245
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,339
I'm a more like yellow darker tone

246
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,870
person so I'm wearing this like tan

247
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,360
colored fucking foundation so why would

248
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,099
it be pink and at this time I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

249
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,779
completely makeup list so maybe he

250
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,099
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and he was just</font>

251
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,599
assuming that my makeup had a pink

252
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,400
undertone because you know my untanned

253
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,469
face does or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know but</font>

254
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm I also apparently have like this</font>

255
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:31,379
thing underneath here he like pushed on

256
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,448
it and apparently there's like an extra

257
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:36,779
pink like bumpiness to it because it's

258
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,610
inflamed and he says it's about five

259
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,469
times the size it's supposed to be so

260
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,360
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last fucking six</font>

261
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,370
months I've been like walking around

262
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,800
with fucking disease ridden eyes well

263
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> not disease or than they don't</font>

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,589
even have bacteria in them he says he

265
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:51,300
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an allergic reaction and he</font>

266
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,500
gay

267
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,680
me this little pink bottle of

268
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,330
prednisolone which is a steroid that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

269
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,030
have to put my<font color="#E5E5E5"> I six fucking times a day</font>

270
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,520
like bite oh I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> please don't fuck</font>

271
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,990
up my shit every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I bump this</font>

272
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,340
there's a chance that I might actually

273
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,430
just like fuck the shit out of my mic

274
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,020
sound so if the rest of the video sucks

275
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm very very sorry or if it sucked</font>

276
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,550
before and now it's better good but

277
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,680
anyway so I have to put steroids in my

278
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,870
eyes six fucking times a day by the time

279
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,280
I'm done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video by the time I'm</font>

280
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,630
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these videos and before I even</font>

281
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,980
edit I have to go fucking put more

282
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,980
steroids in my eyes which he told me it

283
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,660
would be fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I wouldn't have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

284
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,120
the the mail you know masculine side

285
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
effects to steroids as long as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

286
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,210
drink it but then when I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in my</font>

287
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">eyes I have this like nasty disgusting</font>

288
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,660
fucking taste in the back of my mouth

289
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,550
which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this stuff is</font>

290
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">like all the canals are like you know</font>

291
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,750
together that that makes sense but it

292
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,460
also sucks because i feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like i have a</font>

293
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,870
sore throat all the time because i have

basically what he was saying what was

308
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,450
happening so I was like wondering why

309
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,670
the longer I edit videos are the longer

310
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I stream or the longer i play video</font>

311
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">games or the longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do things on the</font>

312
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,400
computer like answer emails and shit the

313
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,280
like worse my eyes would get right and

314
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,510
so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing the Gunners I would</font>

315
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,770
have to at some point put the Gunners on

316
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,240
to make myself feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little bit</font>

317
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was still sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

318
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,300

323
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,010
working on a computer screen it's not

324
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,350
just the like backlight on the computer

325
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes you get you know get</font>

326
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,920
eyestrain from it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the fact</font>

327
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you don't blink very much while</font>

328
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,650
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a computer screen you</font>

329
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,330
don't blink nearly as much as if you're

330
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">not looking at a computer screen so your</font>

331
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,560
eyes can dry out and what he said was my

332
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,180
eyes were drying out the normal eye

333
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,650
strain was happening for me working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

334
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,640
computer and

335
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,350
these bumps under my eyelid were just

336
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,750
scraping over my dry eyes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font>

337
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,910
I would have liked continually worse and

338
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,960
worse effects and then I would go to

339
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,250
sleep and wake<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and feel a little bit</font>

340
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,110
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this was why when I take a</font>

341
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,030
week off from like working and basically

342
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,260
I'm only on the couch playing video

343
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,760
games and like not doing anything else

344
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,470
with the computers or anything I would

345
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,450
still have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red eyes and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never had</font>
