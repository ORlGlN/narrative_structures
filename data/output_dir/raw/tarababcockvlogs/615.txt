wonderful i love talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

27
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,579

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,620
with each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're a lot alike like</font>

29
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,290
seriously born very close to each other

30
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,530
and just have a lot of similarities both

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,180
left-handed like nobody has left-handed

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,549
only cool people like really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool people</font>

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,290
are left handed so that is my

34
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,640
prerogative and I think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> figured out</font>

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,470
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was wrong with the mic it was</font>

36
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually that I had left you know how</font>

37
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,920
the iphone comes with like this little

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">plastic protector thing with little like</font>

39
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,000
knobs at the end so that you can pull it

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,340
off easily well I left those on because

41
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,189

weird like over<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap thing and I think</font>

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,030

69
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get pretty close to someone when</font>

70
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,290
you don't see him that much you know

71
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,370
over the internet when you're spending

72
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,900
all your time talking to them like I do

73
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,000

he he has that he has a weird first

77
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,160
impression that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives a lot of people</font>

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,410
like he's stuck up a rude or something

80
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,930
