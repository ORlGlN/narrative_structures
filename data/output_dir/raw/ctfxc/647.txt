currently having the day from hell so we

130
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,830
were pushed to another flight obviously

131
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,960
two flights back because everything's

132
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,880
growing up let me just I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

133
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">note</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not complaining about them</font>

134
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,419
cancelling the flights because I would

135
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,979
always want to be on a safe flight

136
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,990
rather than a broken plane this part

137
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,070
right now is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we keep getting pushed</font>

138
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,930
to like all these standby things and

139
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,910
they're separating<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali and I even though</font>

140
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,710
I'm explicitly asking them not to

141
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,570
separate out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a and I we're going</font>

142
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,699
literally from gate the gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> just asking</font>

143
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,650
and begging I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking maybe fly to</font>

144
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,600
Sarasota or they end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a little</font>

145
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
too far

146
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright guys fingers crossed on this</font>

147
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,170
flight if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sending a lan</font>

148
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,810
destroyed by herself she could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone</font>

149
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,320
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 10 10 and 11</font>
