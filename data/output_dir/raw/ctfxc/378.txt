intro anyway so he made that designs for

55
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,390
that shirt and I kind of thought about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

56
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,520
was like this would look really cool if

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,380

practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> on there and the time I was</font>

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,280

65
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,630
I had a copy of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> birth certificate</font>

66
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,970

67
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,340
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> what time was born apparently was 557</font>

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,860

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,760

lizard<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one look at that face dogs</font>

80
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:37,860
are funny song one so far today I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

81
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,570
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at like TripAdvisor and things like</font>

82
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,090
that to find like cool things around the

83
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,730
area there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a place oddly enough</font>

84
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,070
at the Tampa Electric Company the power

85
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,890
plant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically have a manatee</font>

86
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,350
viewing area and the reason why is

87
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,870
because because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hot water because</font>

88
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,900
i'm assuming turbines or something very

89
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,290
scientific or logical even at the

90
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,690
electric plant the water is super warmer

91
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,600
out there so manatees generally kind of

92
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,280
gravitate towards the electric power

93
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,860
plant which is kind of weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of</font>

94
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,690
honestly it reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the simpsons</font>

95
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,810
where blinky lives by the nuclear power

96
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,620
plant so maybe we'll see three

97
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,680
three-eyed manatee still a problem yeah

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,169
the only problem is it's completely east

99
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,380
so we have to go north to get to the

100
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,960
gandy bridge and around and then back

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,430
down because if you look at the state of

102
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">florida we live in what's called like</font>

103
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,199
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a peninsula legaly said but it</font>

104
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,699
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bottle opener so it's kind</font>

105
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,620
of right there it's completely across

106
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pond or the Gulf they've got the</font>

107
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,960
Gulf no<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Gulf is on the other</font>

108
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,300
side right it is also Mexican<font color="#CCCCCC"> tamiya</font>

109
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">would I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become the bay is at the</font>

110
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,880
Bay Area yeah okay the bay the best so

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,550
we're across the bay which would be cool

112
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,870
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a boat we could just go</font>

113
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,910
straight there I've been wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

114
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,510
the manatees for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time it's going</font>

115
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">there I don't know what is good day</font>

116
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,570
after that but there's so much traffic

117
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,630
we left a little late so I'm fingers

118
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,400
crossing and I was going to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,100
drone but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is by electric</font>

120
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,250
company and I don't think I'd be totally

121
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,490
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fly that oh by the way on the</font>

122
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">same topic of flying my drone remember</font>

123
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,330
we was trying to fly the drone a couple

124
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,090
days ago and there was all those weird

125
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,729
restrictions I figured out why there was

126
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,349
all these temporary restrictions it was

127
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:38,280
because Donald Trump would there's a

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,400
puddle because he was flying into tampa

129
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,520
biggest amygdale air force so that makes

130
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,500
more sense why there was all those weird

131
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,090
restrictions<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's normally there's</font>

132
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,070
not those weird restrictions kind of

133
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,720
interesting that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did block off the</font>

134
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,350
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> area like that</font>

135
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,350
viola

136
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:24,710
