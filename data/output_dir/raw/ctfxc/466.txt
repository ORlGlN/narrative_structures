hey guys it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> November 9 2016 and I'm</font>

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,620
not normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put stuff like</font>

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,000
this in the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> but since these are</font>

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,950
daily videos like memories of my life

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,769
every single day I'm kind of speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,719
myself in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I was</font>

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,250
always like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think that I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back and watch the movies later</font>

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">in life and if you haven't been living</font>

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,920
in a deep forest with no internet no no

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,539
connections or cell phones which

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,070
actually sounds kind of nice right now

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,269
considering what's happened the past

14
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,789
year specifically last couple months the

15
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,250
United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States is elected a new United</font>

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,450
States President and with that I've seen

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">a tremendous amount of people that are</font>

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,110
really pissed off and angry and there

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,550
are equally the same amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

20
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,170
that are rejoicing or super happy about

21
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,600
the situation and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion is that I'm</font>

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,090
just glad it's over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have selected</font>

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,940
somebody whether it be my my selection

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,100
or your selection a selection has been

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,280
made so now we can hopefully move on and

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,859
just come<font color="#E5E5E5"> together as a nation together</font>

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,140
because right now we are separated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,720
it's it's disgusting to me it's so

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,000
disgusting to see and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hope</font>

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,950
there's no gloating with the situation

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just move on and just</font>

32
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,060
come together because here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beauty</font>

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,619
in my opinion about the United States

34
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a country we live in that even</font>

35
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">though we have this person who I don't</font>

36
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,790
believe in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things he says or</font>

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,759
does I mean that's my opinion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have whatever opinion you want we</font>

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,750
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell fight for the rights</font>

40
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,060
that we believe we should have and it

41
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,680
doesn't matter who's in office we can

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">still fight for those rights and I think</font>

43
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,729
that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to keep in mind and</font>

44
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,159
remember that just because the person

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,430
that we may or may not want in in office

46
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">be there doesn't mean we should give up</font>

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,880
it doesn't mean we should not fight for

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,829
things we believe in because we all have

49
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and for people who might be</font>

50
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,180
happy I just hope the gloating doesn't

51
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,630
happen because that'll just make things

52
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,909
worse and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all I want to</font>

53
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,878
say and Charles in the future you're

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,730
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of good you're gonna</font>

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">like John Stamos right now</font>

56
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,860
that's me hoping right there yeah anyway

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,060
so that's all I'm gonna say about that

58
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and um let's just come together guys</font>

59

<font color="#E5E5E5">country hating on each other that's it I</font>

62
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,080
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the best advice I could give</font>

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,020
to the situation because that's all the

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,410
advice I could say<font color="#E5E5E5"> is let's just move on</font>

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,240
just keep fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the things we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">really matter because that's what my</font>

109
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,310
daily videos are about it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just life I</font>

110
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,630

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,610
my dresser and do something a little bit

112
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,650
different to it without<font color="#CCCCCC"> it being like</font>

113
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,370
crazy crazy dramatic and if it ends up

114
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">being a mistake it's something that I</font>

115
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,240
can change so i ended up getting that

116
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,860
wallpaper stuff that looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Rick in</font>

117

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that's really cheap why would you</font>

120
