criteria of cognitive significance what

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,549
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's hard to explain it</font>

the distinctions between statements that

84
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,940
are purely logical and statements of

85
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,709
empirical significance and also between

86
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,570
those sentences which do and do not have

87
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,730
cognitive significance oh of course yeah
