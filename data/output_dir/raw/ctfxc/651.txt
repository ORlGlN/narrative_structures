00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,980
over and just everything starting to

134
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,290
catch out to me and I'm kind of feeling

135
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,880
a little crappy today for obvious

136
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons yesterday I'd kinda like push</font>

137
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,610
through everything and I actually was ok

138
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,920
but today woke up and i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I</font>

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,180
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm like getting sick</font>

146
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,450
have noticed so ever since I got the

147
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,360

148
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
sick easier so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it really</font>

149
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,410
like compromised my immune system can

150
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,700
actually take time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little bit</font>

151

<font color="#CCCCCC">better but pretty much the whole day</font>
