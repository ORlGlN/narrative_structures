awesome and scary that would be just

97
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,240
imagine being like the Mayans wasn't

98
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
that the Mayans like they would

99
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
sacrifice people until the lunar eclipse

100
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,120
and then they would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the gods</font>

101
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,800
were full when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moon was red like</font>

102
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,169
that I mean that's that's insane like

103
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,449
nowadays but I mean back then like was

104
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,760
it really that insane to believe that

105
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,130
there was a god and then the moon would

106
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn red I don't know I don't know I</font>

107
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,800
just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys thought</font>

108
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got to see it did you guys get to</font>

109
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,900
see it i wanna i want to apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

110
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,910
the whole jumping of the time lapse

111
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,740
other reason is because you know there

112
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,720
was around the Sun<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

113
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
hard to keep it pinpoint and like center

114
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,270
and zoomed in so a lot of you guys were

115
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that you couldn't see it because</font>

116
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,710
of either snow or rain in your region or

117
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,150
if you weren't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States I</font>

118
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,729
don't think you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it so i hope</font>

119
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,150
i hope that was a good enough but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

120
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,760
definitely worth staying up all night so

121
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,620
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys remember about a year ago</font>
