206
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,980

literally just made it so Ali came up

209
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,490
with a cool idea for the wedding for

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,160
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reception maybe doing like a</font>

211
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,780
lemonade stand or something like this

212
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,680
and then for adults having adult limit

213
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,730
so there's like you can do different

214
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,690
flavors before the name in jars they got

215
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,990
