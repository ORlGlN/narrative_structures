31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,490
satisfying feeling like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get all the</font>

scoop of dirt and hang up it's so

00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,980
at least another week or so until they

101
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,050
get all of them made for they sent a

102
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,900
couple of them to us is to see what they

110
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,100
think so it got little pizzas we got our

111
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearts we got Marley and Zoey diesel as</font>

they're only gonna be like limited I

118
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,690

hundred of them so they're super limited

120
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,140
