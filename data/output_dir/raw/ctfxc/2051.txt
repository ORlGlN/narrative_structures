it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a flash drive I guess it</font>

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,690
actually is a flash drive it's the same

24
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,199

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of are always on so it's</font>

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,680
incredibly fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just want to show you</font>

couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> resist basically the charger</font>

40
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,329

41
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,329
be connected to it then you would have

42
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,280
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'll goes there I'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

like it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer skinnier</font>

56
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,489
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like closer to the first</font>

57
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:10,929
generation you know it was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> white one</font>

wears<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can maybe half the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size then</font>

59
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,310
they switch to the vertical one and now

60
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,780

68
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,799
comparing address unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can find</font>

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,720
comparison<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine's the 15 but don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

74
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the general idea first thing you're</font>

75
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,200
gonna notice about the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> Retina is</font>

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,090
look how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much thinner it is you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see this</font>

77
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,100
and we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this orange thing out here</font>

78
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of unprepared that's</font>

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,239
why I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these this is the old macbook</font>

80
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,519
pro rate is the 13 but that's the same

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,980
like thickness and this is what the new

82
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,260
one looks like it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> about half</font>

83
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,049
the Sutta thickness it's insane how they

84
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,060
were able to basically what they do was

85
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,709
this is the old one<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could remove</font>

86
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,930
the hard drive and basically the battery

87
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,510
really really easily on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new ones you</font>

88
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,290
can't at all it's completely like locked

89
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,000
in there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the main</font>

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,190
downsides of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new ones is that you</font>

91
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,269
know if you want to replace the battery

92
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,650
and stuff it's going to cost like thing

93
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,880
would be two hundred dollars and you

94
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,200
have to send it to apple or take it to

95
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,720
an apple you know repair<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple repairman</font>

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,000
there are also some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes on how</font>

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,130
they were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this like so thin</font>

98
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,139
the first thing if you look on the sides

99
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:38,380
right here and right here you're gonna

100
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">notice there's no see</font>

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,180
and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast it is I'll just open up</font>

153
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,590
Final Cut Pro really quick one two three

154
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">four five five seconds you got a 12 and</font>

155
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">half minute video just waiting for you</font>

156
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,080
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last video I did that was</font>

157
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,790
actually yesterday's video and I think

158
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,860
when I actually exported<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 and a half</font>

159
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,700
at 1080p took around maybe an hour

160
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,470
that's a processing this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quad</font>

161
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">core by the way so is that so that's</font>

162
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually the processing power which is</font>

163
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,940
insane mmm boom now as far as all you

164
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube nerds are concerned with like</font>

165
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,660
exporting and compression and converting

166
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,090
and all that stuff for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your videos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picks</font>

167
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,830
up let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take a random file from</font>

168
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,560
earlier in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this review like vlog</font>

169
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,510
exception<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right i use a thing</font>

170
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,669
called MPEG streamclip it's free and it

171
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,710
lets you convert things see her to a

172
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,160
standard export to quicktime<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> h.264</font>

173
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,950
bar kids 1080 will keep the audio the

174
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,950
same this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about 137 megabytes just</font>

175
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,570
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this compresses right now</font>

176
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,669
ready do these quad cores go to work

177
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,500
right there little<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast that's going</font>

178
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,250
normally this would probably take

179
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,570
anywhere from four minutes five minutes

180
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,970
on the old ones all you video editing

181
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,820
nerds it's quite notice and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

182
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,140
biggest things obviously on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

183
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,030
macbook pros is the retina<font color="#E5E5E5"> the retina</font>

184
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,190
display I don't really have I guess

185
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything I music always hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scratch</font>

186
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,400
that I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Coley's password so i</font>

187
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,890
can but just trust me there's there's a

188
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,510
big difference so if you go into

189
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,100
displays you're going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> something a</font>

190
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,020
little bit different now it's gonna be

191
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,630
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we can have the best for the</font>

192
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,010
retina display and they'll change it

193
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,080
then there's a larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> text we're just</font>

194
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,640
gets you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously bigger and</font>

195
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,900
bigger but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can</font>

196
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,700
tell this is actually a computer screen

197
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,590
right now see how clear everything is

198
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,380
more pixels and your i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see</font>

199
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,440
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple they claim that</font>

200
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,090
there's more pixels than you know the

201
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,100
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can actually pick up so really</font>

202
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,560
you have no way to know if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

203
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,940
better because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're I can't tell the</font>

204
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,340
difference sneaky actually here we got

205
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Coley's up and I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you the</font>

206
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,460
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so this is the old</font>

207
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,890
macbook pros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys see the</font>

208
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,840
difference graininess a little bit the

209
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,660
screen difference and this is the new

210
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">one can you tell the difference just in</font>

211
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,950
the color hey don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get hey Yoshi see</font>

212
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,330
the tricky thing about the retina

213
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,799
displays it's kind of hard to see

214
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,570
through a computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you could be</font>

215
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">watching it on something it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not render</font>

216
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,080
display so I just recommend going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

217
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">apple store or whatever the best buy or</font>

218
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,590
anything like that don't have them and

219
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,390
just comparing yourself and that's the

220
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,250
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to truly see the difference but</font>

221
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,710
the the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to explain it would be</font>

222
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,650
the difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the iphone 3g and</font>

223
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,230
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone 4 and the 4s you know</font>

224
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,730
like it's like night and day so that's

225
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,040
pretty much it um it's an incredible

226
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,200
machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am really really happy with it</font>

227
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,320
it's so light super small the processing

228
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,200
power made<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh oh oh</font>

229
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,280
Oh like Santa Claus and Tim Allen that's

230
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,530
