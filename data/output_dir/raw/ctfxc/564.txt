111
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,779
but I'm actually really really freaking

112
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,960
surprised on how nice it looks it's it's

113
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,330
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very clean interface the only</font>

114
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,650
thing that don't like about is that it's

115
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,169
like very hard to find people and the

116
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization is a little tough what are</font>

117
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,129
you really doing so what I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

118
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:58,740
for the last 24 hours I kind of post on

119
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,419
both but I do different variations of

120
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,360
things so I don't know my I think the

121
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,560
jury is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on that whole</font>

122
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,529
situation I just like snaps Oh a filter

123
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,900
so I think the filters is the thing that

124
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,029
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta imagine it took like three</font>

125
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,860
years for snapchat that get filters I

126
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,110
only found snapchat winning head filters

127
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,400
so I don't that's true you don't know

128
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,860
the old days oh you're carrying a happy

129
