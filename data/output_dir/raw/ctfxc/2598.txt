105
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,630
the merch<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to ship out but</font>

106
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,488
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is the reason why we haven't</font>

107
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:18,720
gone through a company like district

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,709
lines or spreadshirt or

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,229
anybody else is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the we really want</font>

110
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,419
to we kind of like the idea that we're

111
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,850
taking control of the shirts and that

112
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,440
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shirts actually</font>

come from us like we're packing it we're

114
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,669
writing your names on it you're probably

115
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:36,069
getting Zoey Marley hair on it and we

116
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:37,090
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's kind of a cool</font>

117
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,550
connection that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys can have and we</font>

118
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,590
can have with you guys but it's just

119
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,979
it's becoming like so much to handle I

120
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,080
put like get on top of filming daily

121
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,080
doing the skits traveling and making

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,940
sure you guys get your merch on time

123
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,979
because apparently there's a lot of

124
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,460
annoyed parents that we travel and we

125
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,830
can't ship at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time so I don't</font>

126
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,849
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your if your parents are getting</font>

127
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,490
upset just explain to them but we will

<font color="#CCCCCC">is what we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now but I don't know</font>

130
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,370
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get asked us if if we</font>

131
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,780
started going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through another company</font>

132
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,880
like it was no longer through us would

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,259
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys feel a little bit</font>

135
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,380
disconnected or do you guys like the

136
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,789
fact that you could potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> win the</font>

137
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,440
lottery by getting Zoey Marley hair

138
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,780
actually that is actually one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font>

139
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,120
I laugh every single time I get like a
