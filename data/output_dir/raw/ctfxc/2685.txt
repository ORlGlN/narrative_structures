52
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,340
so they won't serve us<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this</font>

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,110
post office<font color="#CCCCCC"> infuses the service and then</font>

54
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,149
making us do this thing and as

55
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,240
everyone's getting really

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,060
stuff so Ali's gonna cope with 10

57
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,119
packages everything no do 20 they said

58
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,520
20 last time this is like a post office

59
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,500
for us attention post office you're

60
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna lose your entire structure to like</font>

61
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,180
ups and keep this up we're going through

62
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,920
hell to get you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> these shirts okay</font>

63
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,750
so we have to do this literally one by

64
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,810
one because this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> post op is</font>

65
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,830
the interval does it want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve us</font>

66
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,019
they apparently say that there's we

67
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,030
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually had a lady called and</font>

68
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,400
asked what the limit was and they said

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
there was no limit and that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,430
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> part they said there is no maximum</font>

71
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,220
but there's a maximum when you come in

72
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,380
with a maximum so if anyone knows any of

73
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher-ups at the post office let me</font>

74
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,480
know in the comments here's here's the

75
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,890
finest thing first and they said they

76
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,200
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> once I came in is that every 20 i</font>

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,090
would have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of line go back in</font>

78
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,140
line so I thought this would be

79
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,569
hilarious for the next time so what I

80
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,100
thought would be really funny is if we

81
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,110
got maybe ten of our friends gave them

82
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,840
each 20 packages and wait in line behind

83
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,060
each other so that way fills up the

84
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,010
entire thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think we might do that</font>

85
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,540
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're women</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not recruiting</font>

86
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,820
some people i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i do that this week</font>

87
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,859
it might be interesting i was reading

88
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:16,660
the comments and you guys suggested that

89
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,120
i put the little camera on the car so

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm gonna try that now what was that I</font>

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,239

96
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,989

97
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,609
I'm gonna put<font color="#CCCCCC"> this camera will sacrifice</font>
