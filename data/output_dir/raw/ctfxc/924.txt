00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,049
the stitches will probably heal by then

83
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,480

<font color="#E5E5E5">into things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this easily</font>

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,220
can do when it comes to vlogging

100
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,440
sometimes your daily life can be really

101
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,260
repetitious and boring to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>
