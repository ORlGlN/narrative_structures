96
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you guys remember a few weeks ago</font>

97
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,720
when i had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wake up at 3am because i</font>

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,370
was a nerd and I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre-order</font>

99
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,640
the Apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch I also pre-ordered the</font>

100
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,130
two new macbooks the gold in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> black</font>

101
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the black slate or whatever you want to</font>

102
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">call it actually want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hurt 12 inch</font>

103
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,800
macbooks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was immediately thinking</font>

104
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,240
who's gonna be as<font color="#CCCCCC"> good as mac book pro</font>

105
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,940
so Ali has a macbook air right now and

106
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,340
she's go searching more videos on her

107
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel so I thought it'd be kind of a</font>

108
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,900
nice little surprise to maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

109
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,450
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> give the macbook but apparently</font>

110
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,669
these aren't nearly as powerful as

111
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,610
microprose or even this powerful MacBook

112
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,290
Airs obviously didn't know which one

113
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,850
would look cooler the gold<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the black</font>

114
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,220
slate so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ordered both of them with the</font>

115
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,510
intention of bring

116
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,880
one back before actually all the reading

117
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,980
I've been doing now might've taken both

118
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,020
of them back because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fairly powerful</font>

119
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,060
as a macbook air they're just basically

120
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,640
iPads which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand</font>

121
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,850
like why would you have a computer iPad

122
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually sees the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ohm because</font>

123
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,440
anticipation

124
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,030
so remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking about the</font>

125
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,950

works too<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well it does a gold oh</font>

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,250
nice small<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the old one can</font>

151
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,230
barely tell it's really gold yeah it's

152
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,650
kind of like a rose gold champagne or

153
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,380
rose gold what champagne works too it's

154
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">really tiny there's no devil and I hurt</font>

155
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,030
for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you like feel it yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

156
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,830
heard the keyboards a little different

157
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">to blow over it's really there's not</font>

158
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,690
much there wow that's really crazy yeah

159
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,479
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the slate or gunmetal I like</font>

160
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,179
this one it's nice come<font color="#E5E5E5"> next to each</font>

161
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,090
other I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I kind of like the</font>

162
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,920
slate a little bit more too yeah I'm

163
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,200
going to run separate benchmark tests on

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,660
this thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if it's any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> faster</font>

165
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,220
this is the macbook air obviously I know

166
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,890
if this means anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else</font>

167
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,620
don't go to the new macbook

168
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,639
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty close to the same</font>

169
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,509
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impressive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

170
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,459
so if you look closely let me see the

171
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,639
sides there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are no USB drives there are</font>

172
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,009
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thunderbolt drives those stay on the</font>

173
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,170
side there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a USB what's called us</font>

174
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,319
bc which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what charges it so it means</font>

175
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,380
no more magsafe so more no more more

176
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,380
like for me who's a complete klutz it

177
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,600
always tripping over cables and yanking

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,579
out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable this will just bring the</font>

179
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:29,350
computer well with you and then the

180
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,110
other crappy thing I'm noticing is

181
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,120
Apple's of course making you buy an

182
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,670
adapter air has an SD card slot a

183
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,430
thunderbolt and another USB compared to

184
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,800
that mm-hmm Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You vana</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali and like</font>

185
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,170
pisses me off I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have data right</font>

186
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,949
here it doesn't what the charging thing

187
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:56,800
or this make a small one we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

188
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,300
to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it better than the</font>

189
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous which would be either make</font>

190
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,579
better than macbook pro okay yeah so

191
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:08,019
here's the air it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually it's</font>

192
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,430
definitely lighter but not that

193
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,250
considerably later pc thing then we go

194
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,279
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here there it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again and this is</font>

195
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,829
macbook air my opinion don't buy it's

196
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,709
essentially getting an ipad there's no

197
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,970
its asset to me is essentially you're

198
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,829
just getting an ipad cuz camera you

199
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,689
can't you can't I'm sure you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> edit</font>

200
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,120
but there's the I'm sure you can make

201
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,649
edit do all that fun stuff but like

202
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,930
getting things on to it I feel like

203
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just be a complete pain in the ass</font>

204
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,069
my opinion if you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

205
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,990
serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about editing just get a macbook</font>
