<font color="#CCCCCC">damage doesn't look terrible but it</font>

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,239

the comments right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want you guys</font>

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,230
to guess on how much this is going to

56
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,230
cost the fix the other day when we were

57
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,090
at the car show I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anyone</font>

58
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,680
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have guessed five million dollars</font>

59
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,989
for a car at this whole situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

60
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,269
become a giant cluster f basically going

61
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,579

I know accidents happen but if you were

65
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,000
to guess how much would all that damage

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,900
be $1,500 $1,500 ok try fifty three

67
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,150

put these in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the little hook and there</font>

170
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,589
was a spark and little baby flames came

171
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,660
out and it was very terrifying we have

172
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,670
28 new ones so we've decided that

173
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,380
Charles should not touch the lights<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

174
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,779
it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the job of me should be my</font>

175
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,149
job to hang the lights because it's not

176
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,250
really the thing no not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good at it</font>

179
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,279

180
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,899
when it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> working I agree oh</font>

181
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:39,339
yeah oh yeah so the lesson we have

182
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,320
learned today is don't let Charles do

183
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,730
anything that involved electricity yeah

184
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,399
doesn't involves electricity though and

185
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,950
