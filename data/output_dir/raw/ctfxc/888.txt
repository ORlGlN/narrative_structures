me application or thing on the Phantom

119
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,940
it's not as reliable as a one would hope

120
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,010
luckily the Phantom was record up for

121
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,930
some reason I don't know why turned it

122
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,260
on the cash it on my phone so luckily I

123
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,090
had that footage if I didn't do that

124
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,070
would have lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Phantom and with a</font>

125
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,190
loss of footage<font color="#CCCCCC"> but luckily I thought a</font>

126
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,470
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps ahead because this is kind</font>

127
