trying on dresses it was my first

39
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,270

about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know why i had my</font>

41
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,650
nerves are just going like crazy they

were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> awol yesterday and it was</font>

43
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,310
making me feel sick to my stomach and

44
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,320
all that jazz but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking</font>

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mom my sister and you know Marlene</font>

46
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,130

47
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,510
and reassuring me that's totally normal

48
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,150
but when I got there it's just it's such

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,040
a different feeling trying on dresses

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,130
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know seeing yourself in that way</font>

51
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,110
and we tried on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I went</font>

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,730
typically try on but I told her I wanted

53
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,890
something funky so it was so much fun it

54
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,180
did black out some of the dresses

55
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,610
because I liked them so much but there

56
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,380

<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't a hundred percent on either one</font>

78
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,920
of those but if I decided against it I

79
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,870
could alter it in some way those were

80
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">definite went like winners in my book</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in a dress so that's why I blocked it</font>

178
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,270
home with the dogs it's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird because</font>

179
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,910
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never really thought that I would get</font>

180
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,380
to that point my life where I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

181
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,410
at home more than I like to kind of go

182
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">out and do things I didn't realize how</font>

183
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,590
much I would love just kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

184
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:44,300
this me time so every few days every few

185
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,110
weeks every few vlogs i should say this

186
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,460
is one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've actually kind of</font>

187
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,840
discussed with Charles is that it's

188
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,070
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important for me to not be</font>

189
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,780
vlogging because I like being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

190
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,450
have my private time in and I like to be

191
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,820
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have just time alone with my</font>

192
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,360
friends or time alone with my family<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

193
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,590
that's the thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so important to</font>

194
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,700
me and something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've always wanted</font>

195
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to kind of maintain when I started daily</font>

196
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,350
walking with him and it's not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

197
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,150
don't love daily vlogging I love it but

198
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sometimes I like to just try to be</font>

199
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,010
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own and not really do anything and</font>

200
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:25,520
just feel like I can sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and I can</font>

201
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,860
kind of just relax so that's kind of

202
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,050
what he did today I wasn't feeling

203
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,330
yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many thing I loved every</font>

204
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,680
moment of it but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really been</font>

205
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,180
feeling the greatest the past couple of

206
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,400
days so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of just decided to take</font>

207
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,560
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy and you know spend some time</font>

208
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,650
with my<font color="#CCCCCC"> sister and I know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

209
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,090
understand but I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

210
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,850
when i vlog like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sometimes I just</font>

211
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of go m.i.a and I don't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

212
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">any explanation as to why I'm not there</font>

213
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,630
but most the time when you don't see me

214
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,990
in the vlog I am either working on my

215
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">own projects and I just need that time</font>

216
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,610
or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of just need my own time</font>

217
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,030
like I need time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just do nothing</font>

218
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,410
sometimes or I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to just do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

219
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,390
me where I'm not worrying about a camera

220
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,130
and I'm not worrying about filming

221
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,630
something just like Charles needs that

222
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,970
sometimes too we don't have really

223
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about it and</font>

224
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,240
I don't really give an explanation but I

225
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,480
did want to also kind of say you know

226
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,040
with this time that I'm spending by

227
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,490
myself and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from blogging</font>

228
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,320
it's allowing me the opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

229
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,420
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've always wanted to do</font>

230
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,329
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to thank Charles obviously for</font>

231
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,320
that but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> also want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you guys</font>

232

nervous talking about this but I just

<font color="#CCCCCC">really am so thankful and I really hope</font>

find positivity in the vlogs from

257
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,910
comments from you guys from the support

day that we can be in sync and I don't

266
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,519
know I feel like YouTube for so many

267
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,579
people has been such a positive place it

268
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,550
wore it was for so long and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

269
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,769
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hit a wall where there was so</font>

270
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,569
much negativity going on within the

271
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:24,000
comments and just fighting back and

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,699
forth between people and it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

273
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:27,870
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what this is meant to</font>

274
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">be you do is such a powerful almost</font>

275
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece of art</font>

276
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,130
that can unite so many people together

277
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,670
that would never or could possibly never

278
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,330
meet ever in their life and I guess I

279
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,250
just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say thank you for allowing</font>

280
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,660
me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then also</font>

281
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,490
just to not forget guys that life is so

282
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,890
short and we just got to be more

283
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,780
positive and better people and you know

284
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:58,240
we need to spread love and I don't know

285
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,470
I feel like this ran doesn't make any

286
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,780
sense but it made more sense of my mind

287
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,370
when I was you know thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

288
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,100
earlier but I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> love you guys and</font>
