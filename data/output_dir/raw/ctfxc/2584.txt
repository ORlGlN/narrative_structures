<font color="#E5E5E5">you know would you do simple things like</font>

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,939
when you kind of come to someone's

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,350
defense even if you don't know them or

45
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,600
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something generally and</font>

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,869
genuinely nice it can really it<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed</font>

47
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">your whole day that she probably felt</font>

48
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,740
nice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i felt great that she helped me</font>

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,350
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's a win-win so just do do</font>

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,090
something randomly nice for someone

51
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,830
because it really makes both parties

52
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,910
feel fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i promise you</font>

53
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,950
