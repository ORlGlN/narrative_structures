remember this place

105
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,660

108
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,890
he get to this keep walking no I assume

109
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably pretty respectful of</font>

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,220
fact that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> people walking around</font>

111
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,960
