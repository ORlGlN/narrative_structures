very small so I have a very very small

214
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,700
mouth so they said that it probably

215
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,550
wouldn't take too long and that I would

216
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">be more than ecstatic with my results so</font>

217

225
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,140
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it price it's not cheap I</font>

226
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,820
mean to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be completely honest it's not</font>

227
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,310
cheap but then I think about it and I

228
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,020
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been struggling with my teeth for</font>

229
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,140
so long and it does cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

230
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,000
thousand dollars but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had I mean at my dentist in</font>

232
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,330
particular you don't have to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

233
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,400
all up front you can just pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

234
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,160
little by little as you go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

235
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,170
office so that was nice too because I

236
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,630
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us living nowadays we</font>

237
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,370
can't just dish out a couple thousand

238
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,090
