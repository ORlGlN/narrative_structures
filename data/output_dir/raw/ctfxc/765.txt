94
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,219
if it's a female it's classified as a

95
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,259
doll like I don't know it's the

96
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,849
government or something like that I gets

97
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:38,889
taxed as I got a doll if it's like a

98
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,840
certain amount of inches and if it moves

99
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,029
a certain amount of things so that's

100
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,060
often why you don't see females and

101
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,620
action bigger forum because they'll just

102
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,060
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a doll and they'll text it</font>

103
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,620
differently I don't know if I google it

104
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,879

112
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,569

00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,220
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see females like this because it</font>
