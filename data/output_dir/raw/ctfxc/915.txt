that i am going to be so proud of ally

65
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,990
myself if we actually complete this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

66
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,850
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a decision</font>

67
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one we thought</font>

68
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,260
we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make one be better if we</font>

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
made it made personal to you on the show

70
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,040
and everything I see why these things

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,560
are so expensive now this goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,390
bottom we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought this think in part</font>

73
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,070
which made our life easy if we were

74
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,170
walking away I realized wait how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

75
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,030
going to do this on the bottom part so I

76
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,490
think what we do put<font color="#E5E5E5"> this down like say</font>

77
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,860
this is at the bottom we need to find a

78
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,590
flat screw that goes through an inch and

79
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,620
it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and it connects here so</font>

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,140
it's connected and spins I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

81
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I had a different idea but I think</font>

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,700
Seth out of work I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should</font>

83
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,220
get two screws one like through one side

84
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,450
one the other side connected with

85
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,060
separate the pieces of the board with a

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,550
washer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then connect the two screws</font>

87
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,850
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bolts they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually might have</font>

88
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,890
a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good plan B do they have wide</font>

89
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,230
ones well getting big look it's got one

90
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,060
on their prime example I think Ali's

91
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,800
idea actually might work where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,020
example let's do back then and knew you

93
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,780
wanted me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to thank you one basically</font>

94
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,100
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying this is like a really</font>

95
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,260
bad representation of it but so

96
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,460
basically you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> screw it into</font>

97
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,350
the bottom gonna have a washer they're

98
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,690
like let's just as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bum so you have a</font>

99
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,490
washer here there's the board you have a

100
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,280
washer here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board right here that</font>

101
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,230
make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so bored right</font>

102
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,880
there and what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

103
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,930
you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a bunch of bolts</font>

104
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,730
you're going to put in between however

105
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,770
you're gonna make this whole wide enough

106
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,280
where it's not too wide but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too</font>

107
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,890
tight either yeah and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

108
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,030
availability of spinning it however

109
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're still gonna be that's sturdy mr.</font>

110
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,110
yeah does that make sense I don't know

111
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,100
if it's gonna work but does it make

112
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense in theory makes sense</font>

113
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">Allie's currently gloating right now</font>

114
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,180
because she outsmarted everyone here on

how we can do this thing really good yes

116
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:50,969
