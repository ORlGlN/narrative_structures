27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,490
the idea that we have behind our save

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,909
the dates and our actual invitations for

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,000
trying to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,850
different where<font color="#E5E5E5"> were being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,790
more environmentally conscious um it's

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,770
actually kind of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it fits us</font>

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,409
very well too especially Charles but in

35
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,360
regard to our save the dates were going

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,920
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending them via</font>

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,470
email rather than actually sending up

38
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,930
paper to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that were inviting</font>

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,909
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a few of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

40
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,189

45
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,570
perfect thing for us especially since we

46
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,009
have so little time to plan everything

47
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,020
