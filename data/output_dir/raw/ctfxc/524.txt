80
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,830
everything I think Marley should be good

81
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,470
down Marley is the dougie devil no one

82
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,730
kicked other dogs don't give a crap

83
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,630
about it Marley just looks hilarious

84
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,800
apparently Marley has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> sneaking off</font>

85
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,440
in the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the night and using it</font>

86
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,660
as the lawn I think what happens is

87
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,310
morally doesn't want really<font color="#E5E5E5"> dance I</font>

88
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,620
think it's been kind of like her she

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,230
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset cuz nervous yeah need to put</font>

90
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,360
a camera down there so she's gonna tell

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should do that because I</font>

92
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,070
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my Marley is not like an</font>

93
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,140
untrained dog no she's probably the most

94
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,780
trained at all she just I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I really</font>

95
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,730
do think maybe cuz she's getting Aldo

96
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,560
her bladder is getting smaller I think

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,029
she's doing it cuz she's a smart dog she

98
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,269
does things on purpose yeah she is she

99
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,280
does things on purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

100
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of a really tough road before so</font>

107
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,330
rather than going to the home depot or

108
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,849
Target and just getting a random piece

109
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,159
of carpet for those rugs you thought

110
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,080
you'd be a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> smarter and go to</font>

111
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,779
an actual carpet place and maybe get a

112
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,689
