23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome walk on the water now I have</font>

24
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,300
this discussion with Charles earlier

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,860
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hard for me to bring</font>

26
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,390
the camera when we're walking that's a

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,190
really cute up to it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hard for</font>

28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,810
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring the camera when we're</font>

29
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,720
walking just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're using weights</font>

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,300
too so we're like lifting weights and if

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,520
I drop the camera I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in so</font>

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,100
much trouble so I'm just going to give

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,930
you a vivid explanation of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> beautiful</font>

34
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,730
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> which was there's a nice breeze</font>

35
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,800
the beautiful water lots of people

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,140
walking around birds chirping baby

37
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,950
screaming perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the water</font>

38
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,230
the dogs and I started walking and I

39
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,000
think we walked too far we're not

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,620
realizing how hot it was because the

41
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole point of this dirt all over the</font>

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,000
point I'll adapter right here was all

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,100
shady and then I realized there was

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,480
getting really hot so I think Ali's

45
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,220
coming to rescue us right now in the

46
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,880
golf cart you done you tapped out I'm

47
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,710
are they still looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cat don't</font>

48
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,840
even think about it I had to drop a pin

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,610
so hopefully Ali figures out where we're

50
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,899
at you want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing off all right let</font>

51
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,869

52
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:17,500
do your free our rescuer babes need a

53
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:24,370
ride okay ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry I think this</font>

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,780
was just an excuse or out of the Gulf

55
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,620
her<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zoey got a little gift from the sky</font>

56
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,140
during the hurricane she's been working

57
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,980
on it slowly but surely you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on that</font>

58
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,370
end I do some teamwork and I'm added

59
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,060
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that I didn't want to</font>

60
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,440
carve a pumpkin again which I feel like

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,569
is completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the Halloween</font>

62
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,400
spirit but I still kind of don't care

you equal or arm whatever's in stocking

106
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,490
essence is there in having a force they

gave me a five so it's kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>
