I was telling you as well and I did a

45
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,410
couple timelapses and while sitting here

46
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,700
you know what you're saying at the time

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,650
lapse you really can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything other</font>

48
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just sit there wait as in recording</font>

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,940
and while I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sitting here I kick as</font>

50
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,830
pebbled and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a part of</font>

51
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,290
this monument that we were just filmed

52
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,110
and I got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about like this is</font>

53
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,030
gonna sound so stupid and probably

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,340
really weird well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll pick up a rock or</font>

55
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,380
I'll pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of like like a</font>

56
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,660
stick or a tree analyze it for a long

57
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,910
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I'll think about like the</font>

58
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,160
possibilities and what it saw and it

59
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,840
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lifetime but what it's</font>

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,410
seen and its existence this pebble right

61
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,989
here sitting on this ledge quali came

62
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,299
from this marble and this marble came

63
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:27,519
from some other place which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was brought</font>

64
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,170
in here from so-and-so place which is

65
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,540
handled by<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-and-so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just kind of</font>

66
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,640
crazy for me I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every once</font>

67
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,200

69
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,600
