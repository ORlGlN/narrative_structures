00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
so another day another YouTube hack this

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,200
one's kind of funny this one effects of

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,330
I guess it's basically masking you know

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,519
the subscribers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I what did I say</font>

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:18,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those subscribers apparently it's</font>

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,250
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like masks it with a fake number so</font>

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,449
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at they're gonna switch to</font>

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,400
mac courtesy but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fred he lost</font>

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,260
what is that like I guess a million

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,939
subscribers or something like that I

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,039
guess apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know it's just</font>

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,929
faking this number out apparently he

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,809
still has all subscribers but it's just

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,309
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fake number yes so it's like</font>

15
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,050
kind of ramp it's a weird one actually

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,550
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's funny like YouTube gets</font>

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,100

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,360
new heck every single time but

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,820
apparently it's not messing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with mine</font>

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,640
it's random so if your best with you let

21
