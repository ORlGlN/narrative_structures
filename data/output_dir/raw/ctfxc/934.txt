made me feel so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better about</font>

38
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,260
everything I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds a little</font>

39
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,990
strange maybe but you know this has been

40
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a really strange year and a half</font>

41
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,370
for me like it's been a big transition

42
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,440
and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dwell on the negative</font>

43
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,430
because I don't even want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider</font>

44
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,890
any of this negative but it was tough

45
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,380
for a really long time and of course I

46
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,580
think everybody has to have days in

47
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,020
their life but it just like really

48
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,620
changed my life and and I loved it and

49
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,289
VidCon was kind of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment that</font>

50
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:13,250
really made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize how much it's</font>

51
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,510
affected my life also<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

55
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,880
telephone I think since the very

56
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,040
beginning was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things and gave</font>

57
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,230
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chance to be a part of it and</font>

58
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you guys hopefully became</font>

59
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,030

64
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,690
hugged me and hugged me and hugged me

65
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,430
and she made me cry<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we're at the</font>

66
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,650

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,190
beginning that I was a good person to be

68
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,090
a part of Charles life which is amazing

69
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,980

from all the videos from the past seven

80
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,540
