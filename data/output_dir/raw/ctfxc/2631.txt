00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,849
coming and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad because</font>

47
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,920
christmas is coming and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to make</font>

48

49
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,480
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should go if we can get it all</font>

50
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,880
taken care of then we'll go but I feel

51
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,050
like this should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be our responsibility</font>

52
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,110
and I promised you guys hoodies for

53
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,030
Christmas and I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try my</font>

54
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,160
darndest to get hoodies for Christmas

55
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,260
and also sad news the space shuttle

56
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,610
launch you guys were<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking about the</font>

57
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,290
space shuttle launch I really have no

58
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,730
idea what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with that thing</font>

59
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,860
last thing I heard it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off in</font>

60
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,040
February maybe I really honestly don't

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,000
even think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is going to go off</font>

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,410
it really sucks for the astronauts

63
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,850
because they've been training training

64
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,900
and training<font color="#E5E5E5"> to training and training</font>

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,400
and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keeps even push back</font>

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,659
and when you had like a big test or

67
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,870
something really<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme the the</font>

68
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,150
anticipation just before it is always

69
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the worst and then you must feel really</font>

70
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,469
like relieved best example would be when

71
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,450
I did skydiving when I jumped out of a

72
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,069
plane if you do not see when Ali and I

73
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,739
went skydiving I put up with the links

74
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,090
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sub are you can watch both of us</font>

75
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,000
go skydiving going like on the plane

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,219
waiting a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours before going that</font>

77
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,079
was probably worse than<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually jumping</font>

78
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,609
out of the plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of ramble but</font>

79
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,159
bottom line is I'm in the way sorry the

80
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,719
big old tractor<font color="#CCCCCC"> just made me move that's</font>

81
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,790
why I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> distracted on the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

82
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,709
on the good news is actually really

83
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,510
really really awesome news<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember a</font>
