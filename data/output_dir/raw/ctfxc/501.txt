103
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,040
of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recover that so that means</font>

104
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,230
I've now lost that I'm just having the

105
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,570
worst<font color="#CCCCCC"> luck ever but I had an idea so</font>

106
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,460

this is 6 plus has the data right this

109
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,260
has it right here so what I'm going to

110
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,750
do is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to backup and restore to</font>

111
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,550
here and then what I'm going to do is

112
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,410
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer all this stuff</font>

113
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had for the past like when i</font>

114
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,460
get die from this is the good thing is

115
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,170
it just came out so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

116
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,550
transfer all the new stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

117
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,260
photos White House photos all those

118
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,810
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto this which I'm going to</font>

119
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,030
restore back to the old version and then

120
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,130
from this I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to back up and then</font>

121
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,950
I'm going to erase this one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

122
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,810
very risky i know and i'm going to

123
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,840
restore this back to this still with me

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,060
so confusing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all in theory</font>

125
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,910
but i think it might actually work if it

126
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,300
is i'll consider myself a mild genius is

127
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,940
the mild one<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one and then</font>

128
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,130
step two we'll get this stuff all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

129
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,320
way over to this stuff and then back

130
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,170
this up and then make a nice backup of

131
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,020
this and transfer it back to this i love

132
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,430
