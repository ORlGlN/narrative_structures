that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just me trying to explain</font>

something I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wanted to elaborate</font>

224
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:14,620
a little bit more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole you</font>

225
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,120
know not driving thing because I know

226
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,740
there's a bunch of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there who</font>

227
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,899
knew to the videos we don't understand

228
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:22,870
why I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive when I can drive and</font>

229
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,420
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what I was explaining</font>

230
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,730
earlier that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid because i'm</font>

231
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,249
shooting longer to not drive because

232
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,499
you're on 31 years old and eventually

233
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:34,269
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> driving again</font>

234
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,240
and I'm terrified<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the date when I</font>

235
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,860
have to do it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> even walking</font>

236
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,730
around throughout in a normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> day it's</font>

237
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,629
not something i usually talk about

238
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it kind of kind of honestly kind</font>

239
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,230
of freaks me out because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had that</font>

240
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">seizure once before the show and i had</font>

241
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,980
the seizure on that airplane at one time

242
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,100
and I I honestly get like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

243
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's controlling my life</font>

244
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,759
because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it is but at the</font>

245
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,529
same time it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back of my</font>

246
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,930
mind like every single day of my life

247
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,600
it's tiring first off and it's also very

248
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">very scary but yeah I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

249
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,709
explain a little bit more because I

250
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,029
wanted to be completely honest if you

251
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys were confused why I was talking</font>

252
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,569
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that randomly and it was like</font>

253
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,459
weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> segue it's just I don't know how</font>

254
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:21,009
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> segue happened but it happened and</font>

255
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,439
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain it a little bit</font>

256
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:25,420
more rather than just leaving it there

257
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,579
at the edge but I do have this

258
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,009
so this can give me some brochures I do

259
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,199
whatever once a while just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

260
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,649
myself that sense of freedom and that

261
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">way I'm not relying on people because</font>

262
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:41,949
that you know with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know the car</font>

263
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:43,480
services and stuff like that you're

264
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,399
still relying on somebody's like a taxi

265
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,560
but women are driving you have that

266
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,759
freedom that's funny that reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of</font>

267
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,970
all the times like all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bands that I</font>
