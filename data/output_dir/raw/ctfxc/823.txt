built very thin so I was working very

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,380
very hard to get to a point where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable with myself and I was</font>

this morning I'm feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> good and</font>

30
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,550
it's kind of been the first day since I

31
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,860
got out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hospital that I felt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

32
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,770
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say like more normal than</font>

33
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,240
others there's days where I felt really

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,030
great but then today I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel much</font>

35
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,700
more normal than I then I have been I'm

36
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,320
actually really impressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,960
quality really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crazy this is a</font>

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,110
cell phone considering how crappy cell

39
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,560
phones once were just in my childhood up

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,780
until now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of crazy</font>

41
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,430
think about how good<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

42
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,470
gotten I also think it's so funny how

43
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,720
like cell phones were once super big you

44
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,890
weren't how like when they first came

45
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,259
out they're like super giant like I had

46
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,480
this giant phone I called the banana

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,000
phone it was so massive it was actually

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
this is actually the funny part it was

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,020
probably as big as the iphone 6<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus and</font>

50
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,410
now they're back that size because there

51
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,000
was this trend where they were that big

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,920
then they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get super small so</font>

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,180
they're miniature I don't know if you

54
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,920
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like will ferrell skit</font>

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,510
were they like we're making fun of the

56
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,860
fact that cell phones were getting so

57
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,959
small and now they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">being giant again i'm pretty sure every</font>
