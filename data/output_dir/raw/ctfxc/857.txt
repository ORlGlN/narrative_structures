00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,800
good morning and we're back at the

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,750
airport while we're in Oakland this time

3
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,780
we have made it to Hawaii you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

4
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,460
came here on our personal jet you guys

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,580
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah we thought would be really</font>

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,130
nice and think about me bring up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,910
Hawaii with us

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,060
I think a party

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">dote on and Fallon this build drove us</font>

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,840
all the way from all the way from LAX it

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,640
was a long drive through the ocean and

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,470
everything and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting up with</font>

13
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,700
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I want to show you guys</font>

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,500
something all right coming from Florida

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,810
siesta key having to the world's widest

16
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,660
and this is really really odd to see

17
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,700
like essentially is this like probably

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,500
like soot or sulfur from a volcano

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,270
probably because like it's like the

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,540
black expect that lava rock<font color="#CCCCCC"> that grinds</font>

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,440
up and I guess they built a wrap we

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,930
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent Danny a day ahead so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,940
