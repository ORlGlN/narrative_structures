watch this<font color="#CCCCCC"> boo so just got home and</font>

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,540
Charles's nor to be found he's probably

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,509
out doing this little workout thing

28
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,570
which so proud of him for the dogs are

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,030
missing so I know he'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i only say</font>

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,909
with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm trying to find a gift and</font>

31
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,560
do something really different for

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,130
Charles the thing is is that most of the

33
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,590
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he wants he has already</font>

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,229
purchased and has them in his possession

35
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,619
or he pre-orders them so they've already

36
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,030
been bought they're not even out but

37
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,369
they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here eventually so that's</font>

38
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,590
my dilemma is trying to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a man who</font>

39
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,239
already pretty much has everything that

40
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,450
he wants something special and different

41
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's where I stand so I'm trying</font>

42
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know pretty good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,530
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something a little</font>

44
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,440
different if I'm gonna be successful

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,590
with it I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea I suck with</font>

46
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,270
presents i really really do but i'm

47
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,739
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> my hardest to do something a</font>

48
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,230

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
at all so they're open-minded about

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
everything but they won't give you an
