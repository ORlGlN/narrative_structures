abscess on her armpit which i think is

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like a coincidence because she had</font>

48
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,730
an allergy outbreak from the grass while

120
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,810
is we're gonna enclose this area and put

121
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,120
some nice like roofing and maybe some

122
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,160

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,060
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> which ones we kind of want to</font>

132
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,250
do we're kind of thinking maybe the

133
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,960
basket weave is that the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> we felt</font>

134
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,620

that way we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of come to an idea</font>

138
00:06:50,080 --> 00:07:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">together and to make things even more</font>

139
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,630
complicated these are the colors were

140
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,580

141
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,040
it's a 50-50 on this one so we have the

142
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,770
red charcoal and we have the red yellow

143
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,820
charcoal which one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys like</font>

144
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,330
every time we go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed bath and beyond</font>
