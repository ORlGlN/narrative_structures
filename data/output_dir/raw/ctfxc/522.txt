22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondered why dogs do that what I go like</font>

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,570

know how like people always say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,729
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about dogs and the most</font>

29
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,140
loving thing about dogs is that they

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,210
don't talk back that's why I thought to

31
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,790
before I met Marley I redefined the

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,660
whole idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what a turtleneck is well</font>

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,630
hello good<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet we just</font>

34
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,190
got done meeting up with my dad for a

35
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,690
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of catching up which is</font>

36
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,979
really nice because we don't get to do

37
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,630
that often and now we're my favorite

38
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,500
place in the world Eddie delicious what

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,800
on one second do you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> get over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buddy</font>

cart you having fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

42
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,010
it's a leash or not dresses right now I

43
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of proactive and</font>

44
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,070
trying to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard later a little doggie</font>

45
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,090
cake but the closest place is like five

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,920
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six miles so I'm going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,380
this take 12 miles I've never taken this

48
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,080
thing this far so fingers crossed I

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,630
don't get stuck again I know I could

50
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,370
easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> just take an uber but see the</font>

51
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,780
thing is that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like having Ali</font>

52
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,850
driving me and if I do the golf cart

53
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,590
it's like me driving myself so it kind

54
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,810
of puts control back in my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

55
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,220
bit they do you feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in control</font>

56
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,380
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more and it makes you feel</font>

57
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,560
normal that's why I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try this</font>

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,850
until I get trapped and then I have to

59
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,710
rely on like five people gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me back</font>

60
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,680
home and then I'm not normal yellow car

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,930
so anyways get her cervix<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we</font>

62
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">need that to go like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys saw</font>

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,380
yesterday we already just kind of like

64
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,290
jumped on the whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking for</font>

65
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,880
bridesmaids dresses because we're

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting married in about six months it's</font>

67
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important that I start narrowing</font>

68
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,900
that down and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ready to go we're</font>

69
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,870
kind of in our brush and Sam

70
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,510
sucks but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

71
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I thought about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

72
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,489
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> dillards wear the dresses</font>

73
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,150
are kind of more fit to size and if you

74
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,620
have to have it altered it's already

75
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,450
there so that's why my<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea was to go</font>

76
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,879
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at dillards and see what they had</font>

77
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,200
and see if there was anything that I

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,610
could choose them they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

79
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,260
yesterday I still have this feeling that

80
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,549
what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> or ID i should say of</font>

81
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,269
wanting the girls to be in different

82
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,829
dresses that are all black or have like

83
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,290
black and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a slate gray black and</font>

84
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,140
maybe a floral but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want all the girls</font>

85
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,640
to be happy with what they're wearing

86
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,920
the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that always sucks is that</font>

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,859
you can it's very very rare that you get

88
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,950
to rewear the dress that you bought yeah

89
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that ever happens yeah I</font>

143
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,410
yesterday but it's not as like

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,720
form-fitting down the mirror but it was

145
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,460
like cool little details everywhere

146
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,440
