and I don't know why they're attached

153
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,520
cuz they're not reproducing when they're

154
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,000
detached they died right when they're

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,510
attached to reproducing yeah well cuz I

156
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,650
thought they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> always at either</font>

157
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,690
situation do animals put their bones

158
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,350
together I don't think animals put their

159
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,860
bums together in general reproduce what

160
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,090

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,070
that starts a lot it's just too<font color="#CCCCCC"> far</font>

165
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,200

if not what is your favorite Weezer

172
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,380
album mines either maladroit or

173
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,750
Pinkerton part of the rules you can't

174
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,340
say the blue album because the blue

175
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,980
album is like the best rock album ever

176
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,990
