I get really excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> for warp tour</font>

235
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,290
because of the fact that it's like it

236
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pushes me to exercise because I</font>

237
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,029
find it exercising be incredibly boring

238
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,009
Ali always asked me to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the gym and</font>

239
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,930
I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really stupid</font>

240
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,180
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid because it's good for you but</font>

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,470
you're unlike a treadmill I I hate

244
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling like you're literally running in</font>

245
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,040
place that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also why i love walk toward</font>

246
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,990
because every day is a different scene

247
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,430
so it makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like you're running</font>

248
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,740
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country like Forrest Gump</font>

actually I shouldn't say incredibly

253
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:44,079
boring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you gotta find a lot to do</font>

254
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,809
