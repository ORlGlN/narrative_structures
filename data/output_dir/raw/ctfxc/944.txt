challenge video for the vlog which is

20
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,890

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we did that day a lot of people</font>

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,250

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,140
as you guys saw we got the updated world

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,700

<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe doing something like maybe every</font>

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,680

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,090
cool because it would allow us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,820
kind of a break day which as you guys

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,680
know it's still not a break but edit

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,939
switches things up a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,210
don't know what it's like can I feel bad

122
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">for him because you know how he is he's</font>

123
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,170
always so vibrant and yes which energy

124
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he never listening then get him down</font>

125
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,040
but just past two rounds just kind of

126
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,900
really hit him hard I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he just</font>

127
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,330
wants to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> better for VidCon so we're</font>

128
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,500
gonna let him rest a little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

129
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,760
he's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something we'll do</font>

130
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,290
something but if not it's gonna be a

131
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,880
boring day and you know what those

132
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,980
