floor right now so there's another

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,740
option may be doing outside and having

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,149
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like layers like almost like a</font>

32
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:31,070
concert so you have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

33
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,590
balcony<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people up here and people</font>

35
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most unique way of laying out a</font>

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,470
wedding ceremony that I've actually ever

37
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,049

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">would go down here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we'd go</font>

40
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,190
over here so that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like three</font>

41
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,580
tiers of like levels be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

78
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,460
humidity we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really well I would</font>

00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,390
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the wind well but wait the</font>

80
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,910
noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you hear the noise it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

81
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,200
still funny cuz that last place was

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,570
beautiful but we're upstairs and then

83
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,340
we're all like talking or like i wonder

84
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,690
if there's do me some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of noise and</font>

85
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,850
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> adds like five seconds after here</font>

86
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,600
whoop<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will refocus I've just been</font>

87
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,890
laughing at the fact that there's a

88
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,080
giant so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it funny it</font>

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,850
does make it funny I think it's humorous

90
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,280
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a bland and it happens</font>

91
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,840
and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it when I</font>
