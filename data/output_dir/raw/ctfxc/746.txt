104
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,419
that's why I keep driving a golf cart

105
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:27,979
actually it's more fun to drive the

106
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,229
Hofburg truthfully I haven't driven a

107
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,740

109
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:43,229
was driving it like this that was

110
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:44,490
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last time I actually drove</font>

111
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,550
a car on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the street I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>
