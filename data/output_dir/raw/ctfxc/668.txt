came on<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really knew absolutely nothing</font>

155
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,870
about vlogging I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube was</font>

156
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,100
just where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you went to figure out how to</font>

157
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,709
unclog drains and look at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fiji's</font>

158
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,990
videos and things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know just looking</font>

159
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this watching the vlogs and I watched</font>

160
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,660
many many blocks before I even

161
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,670
understood what was happening my first

162
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,949
reaction was who are these people and

163
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:28,880
why are they after my job and how are

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,620
they getting so many millions and

165
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,060
millions of fans<font color="#E5E5E5"> and viewers what's</font>

166
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,320
happening here there's a real connection

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,180
happening here and I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just</font>

168
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">really get granular about that I'll che</font>

169
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:39,620
and his amazing

170
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,470
it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool that's amazing rise to</font>

171
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,420
prominence from being a you know a

172
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple in rural Idaho to two mega stars</font>

173
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,080
and very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business people</font>

174
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,880
it's a tremendous an American success

175
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,500
story that I think it only happened

176
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,870
today in the case of Charles you have

177
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who's blocking his everyday</font>

178
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,960
life and that really resonated for me as

179
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,490
a documentarian because really what

180
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,230
people who do this are saying is that

181
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,500
real life matters it's dramatic there's

182
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to say and everybody can can</font>

183
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,970
join the party and I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

184
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,190
like this is a tremendous sea change in

185
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,620
entertainment to really be off with an

186
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,020
idea to show your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stars and nobody has</font>

187
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,029
shown more scars is evident desculpe

188
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,150
than you literally other I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

189
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,100
hear like where was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that moment where</font>

190
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,050
you said and you were like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

191
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is why I am I have to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

192
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,290
you were shooting every day you're doing

193
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,910
it every day it was like this is not a

194
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,070
choice it's just who I am it looks like

195
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,260
habitual this is so much fun when you

196
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,500
beat everyone like here and it's just so

197
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,600
much fun I don't know how many how many

198
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,390

239
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,240
and I mean that sounds very simple but

240
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,370
it's very hard if you do this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

241
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,189
long time as anyone like Robin Hood

242
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,649
surfactant 11 years then become this

243
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,750
character and you lose yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

244
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,939
those views that I can lose yourself in

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the moment but with your family and you</font>

250
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,870
little bit more a lot of myself to be a

251
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more honest with</font>

now what would you care about you know

273
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,800
probably not anything that you were

274
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,930
worried about today when you lost a

275
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,330
bunch of subscribers at once I was

276
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering what made you decide to keep</font>

277
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,710
going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a positive way that you</font>

278
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,350
did and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like addressing those</font>

279
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,420
rumors the way you did I'll be

280
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely honest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know i was</font>

281
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,780
actually about to hang up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera</font>

282
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,370
aren't you smash the camera at the

283
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer ali west right down there</font>

284
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,060
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the one person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

285
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">convinced me to keep doing the shooting</font>

286
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,600
want me to be the person that just

287
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,430
stopped because of all the negativity

288
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,030
and uh I was just I was honestly I'll be

289
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely honest I've talked to Shay</font>

290
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,590
stuff I was done I mean at that point I

291
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,330
was just I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kabuki is this</font>

292
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,370
like at this point you do eight years

293
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,470
you shared everything and then all of a

294
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,870
sudden people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just turn on a rumor and</font>

295
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just at that point I was just like</font>

296
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,530
I'm done and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like this do I</font>

297
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,970
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to waste my time doing this</font>

298
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,490
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff for somebody kind of will</font>

299
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,260
just turn on you like you can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand</font>

300
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,150
in the back is how I essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt</font>

301
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,710
and after talking without income that's

302
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,300
honestly the sole reason want to get

303
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,450
doing this that's why

304
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,880
still doing this I put first over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

305
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,220
motivation for doing this as youtubers

306
