with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Minecraft finding all things</font>

64
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,280
minecraft I don't really know much about

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">Minecraft which is not very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

66
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,500
maybe I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update myself and I do</font>

67
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,959
remember about 12 days we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just around a</font>

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,269
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I love that quote we gift around</font>

69
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:58,139
a lot would you do in this quest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

70
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,359
a lizard did you break something it's

71
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:02,159
funny because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was alizarin der there</font>

72
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,169
and I got rid of him hey I'm grant puts

73
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:09,120
it that's it and you can tell my plant

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the plants are</font>

75
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,229
finally keeping a life I've noticed that

76
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">when he does this there actually is a</font>

77
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,549
lizard<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the area so what I do is I</font>

78
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,650
bring them inside and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example this</font>

79
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,419
thing he's looking at right now where's

80
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:22,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">my finger that thing right there I</font>

81
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,930
thought he was crazy but I pulled out

82
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the plant and I looked in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

83
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,409
there was two lizards stock and three

84
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,439
frogs so usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he does this and</font>

85
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,849
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why he broke that thing was</font>

86
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,889
because there was a lizard<font color="#E5E5E5"> blast you</font>

87
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,509
checked under and I had to lift it up

88
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:38,849
and let him<font color="#CCCCCC"> go run away no I know you're</font>

89
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,530
not understanding like he was right

90
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,239
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lizard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there we just didn't</font>

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:52,860
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it he's so dumb</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diesel</font>

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,030
letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate I hate jumping like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

111
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,169

112
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,220
rolled back in your head on that one

113
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,930
good I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really so today cuz i get to</font>

114
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,330
set up my<font color="#E5E5E5"> new drove oh I talk to you</font>

115
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,790
guys about these before but they have

116
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,979
sent me a brand new one amateur I know

117
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,110
it really is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because my brain sucks</font>

118
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,100
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,380
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed you a long time ago I</font>

120
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,570
had this thing called a drobo if they

121
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,790
rate a mini raid system so there's

122
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,310
multiple hard drives in this thing this

123
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,520
is the 5d which is pretty amazing it has

124
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,500
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of these are</font>

125
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,930
six terabytes so there's six times five

126
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,360
so that's 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> terabyte of a hard drive an</font>

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,890
external hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive it's 30</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tales like</font>

128
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,690
and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just that it's our external</font>

129
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,490
hard drives that has a redundancy system

130
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,440
so basically if one of these hard drives

131
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,210
sales it gives you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit light</font>

132
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically pop it out I'm going to do</font>

133
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,590
it now because it's running you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pop</font>

134
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,850
it out because all the data it's been

135
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,860
spread amongst the other drives so drobo

136
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,780
actually knows they use these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

137
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,460
we've been talking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

138
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,480
they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

139
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,950
face so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see right here believe</font>

140
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it or not i'm running out of 30</font>

141
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,880
