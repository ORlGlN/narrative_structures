sunglasses a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different things</font>

165
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,790
that's the one thing I've never

166
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,980
understood that how do you just leave

167
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,900

173
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,330
like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> million times in the logs</font>

174
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,370
