asphalt and bubbling mmm it's really

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,359
intriguing is actually really sad how

49
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,530
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that's pretty</font>

50
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,159
up this is like from technically the

00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">1800s is that when they were mining for</font>

52
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,629
asphalt this was just like a like I

53
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:49,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pond and then water got in</font>

54
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,590
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it just mixed with everything</font>

55
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,379
and made it all disgusting a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

56
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:55,939
misconceptions here aren't it really

57
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,849
funny that there's like greenery around

58
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,769
because sad that is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> baby yeah</font>

59
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,590
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really sad this culture shows the</font>

60
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,209
female has wandered knee-deep into the

61
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">lake presumably to drink sticky tar</font>

62
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,739
concealed by several feet of water traps

63
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,129
are there

64
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,959
this actually isn't our it's asphalt

65
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,959
tars man made ours<font color="#E5E5E5"> man made if you guys</font>

66
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,060
could smell this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

67
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,920
overwhelming do not won't necessarily

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,500
sink to the bottom but you get trapped

69
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,599
on the surface yeah that's even more

70
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,819
frightening though to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be trapped</font>

71
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,849
and never be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move gross go</font>

72
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,709
follow that core group for free

73
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,359
crazy we're just like walking past this

74
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,629
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where tar has bubbled up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

75
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:55,530
poking no you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charles</font>

76
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,140
this is asphalt

77
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,910
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy and got it on your finger</font>

78
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,290
probably wasn't supposed to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

79
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but it really didn't want me to go</font>

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">over there will be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just a oh</font>

81
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,630
my goodness gracious<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that's just</font>

82
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,970
crazy though look it's gotten all over

83
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,709
the tree to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crazy to think about</font>

84
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,540
that any<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment in this area that</font>

85
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,418
asphalt could just kind of fell up to

86
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,030
the surface at any moment really

87
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">intriguing I wonder if they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any way</font>

88
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,080
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> predicting where it's going to come</font>

89
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,270
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if they have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

90
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">this specific area that kind of shows</font>

91
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,200
that maybe they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,210
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the specific area I'm so excited</font>

93
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,740
we came here this is definitely a place

94
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,810
I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit look there's another</font>

95

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,150
volcano so all this coming up right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

97
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,180

98
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,730
up and then Tommy Lee Jones coming and

99
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,120

121
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,830
details we'll have to try and learn

122
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">about our way because we had a revival</font>

123
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:20,569
within those so what they were saying

124
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:22,849
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they found one human that dates</font>

125
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,449
back to about 9,000 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago which is</font>

126
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">after</font>

127
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,300
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually recognize her though</font>

128
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,439
yeah they're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to learn stuff</font>

129
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,659
before they get the presenter I want to

130
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,280
see I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say lets you can google it</font>

131
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so I did a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

132
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,360
googling and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a photo here you go</font>

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,729
to do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have so many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fossils</font>

139
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:09,550
we're able to look at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> population</font>

140
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,719
catching a big chunk of asphalt they're

141
