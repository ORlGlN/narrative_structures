jokes and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let the internet decide</font>

146
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,970
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the chair or the picnic table</font>

147
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,490
thing like this or the other idea was

148
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,779
that we flipped it the other way so

149
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,560
we're gonna try both ways

150
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,070
you

151
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,180
this was the other direction uh I kind

152
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,890
of like that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> always switch it</font>

153
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,210
back I kind of like it because it's new

154
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,710
so we can have a fraud a little bit and

155
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe switch it back I can't help</font>

156
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,740
you I can't help you

157
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,600
