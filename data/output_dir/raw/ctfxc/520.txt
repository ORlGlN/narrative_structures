58
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,739
Apple unfortunately underestimated the

59
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,690

60
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,489

66
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,689
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they don't have any</font>

67
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven pluses which is the only one I</font>

68
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,969

jack I get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I don't ever use this</font>

70
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,379
stupid headphone jack because everything

71
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,780
I have is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wireless and be the</font>

72
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,510
camera is amazing and since I've vlog

73
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,250
and sometimes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have my</font>

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,100
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> geez have much my</font>

75

camera and you guys see it put like

76
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,759
iphone clips in there and what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

77
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,849
do is get a better quality camera and I

78
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,490
feel the one I've seen the specs which

79
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,380
is insane the cell phone has better

80
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,560
specs in some cameras not the g7x no way

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,349
if it did I'd be vlogging all the time

82
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,270
on that so they said not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to even wait in</font>

83
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,830
line so I was like I'm gonna sleep in

84
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,840
now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait could I ordered</font>

85
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,430

86
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,620
stupid stupid me and I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

87
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,090
people are all kind of bummed about the

88
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,789
whole headphone jack thing here's the

89
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,650
thing here's my thought process does

92
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,130
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more pissed off when they</font>

93
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,050
removed firewire 800 from<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're doing and how we're gonna get</font>

211
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,530
across crazy busy road we're slowly

212
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,360
discovering that this city is not the

213
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,210
best place<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk or that it's not the</font>

214
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,510
safest city to be for an individual who

215
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,030
likes to walk everywhere there's not any

216
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,190
sidewalks anywhere near where we need to

217
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,860
be we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cross like crazy 8</font>

218
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,680
plane intersection and there's like a

219
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,750
sidewalk like the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of a sidewalk</font>

220
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,490
and then you cross through there's

221
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,840
another very end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sidewalk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

222
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,960
then that's it there's like no

223
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,770
continuation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sidewalk if that</font>

224
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,200
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people don't care a</font>

225
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,850
pickle Hills brain is over multiple

226
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,370
times so it was a little terrifying but

227
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,530
thankfully we've all made it I want to

228
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">go just simply try to clean up the area</font>

229
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,170
here in the counter and I accidentally

230
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,510
move my sunglasses and you know that

231
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,130
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> where something hits the ground</font>

232
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lands perfectly like your phone or</font>

233
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">just anything and you know it's broken</font>

234

235
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">is take a perfect flat just like it's</font>
