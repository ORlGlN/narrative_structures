again so cool mezmorized a lot of you

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,220
guys have been asking where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

34
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,810
cover song that Ali and I we're going to

35
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,300

<font color="#E5E5E5">waiting I'm going to post a the printer</font>

37
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,319
video this sunday and then after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

38
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to post the zombie video and</font>

39
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,269
then after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the cover song the</font>

40
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,409
reason why these have been taking

41
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,170
forever is the zombie video I did I

42
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,640
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the original files so that</font>

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,300
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was my Homer doe moment and then</font>

44
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,920
for the after hours I've been having

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,540
this problem can you guys see this way

46
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,810
what I switch my bass track keeps going

47
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,510
missing so I have to keep re-recording

48
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,540
almost every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single time the bass track</font>

49
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,790
so it doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense I don't get</font>

50
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,230
why it's doing that everything else is

51
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,420
here I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I mean everything</font>

52
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">else is there so you got everything</font>

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,700
except the stupid bass track which you

54
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,530
know it's pretty important because it's

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,709
a big

56
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,560
it's a base driven song so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,780
record the base and then have to do the

58
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,670
vocals though since Charmander was so

59
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,080
