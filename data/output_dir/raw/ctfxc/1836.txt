00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like I can touch my brain</font>

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:12,000
when I'm doing this one of the doctors

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,710
always tell you don't think small on

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,199
your pinky in your ear like yeah I know

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,900
right you're gonna put a bead in there

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,369
what's the word look like a fear

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,740
irrational fear but I when I do this

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,269
when I I know you're not supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,590
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things for stories I've know how</font>

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was going here but when you do this I</font>

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,090
can't be near anything or if anyone

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,189
walks near me I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a karate chop him</font>

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,960
because I I don't know what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

imagined I just right into your brain

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,270
