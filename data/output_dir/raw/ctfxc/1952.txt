everyone in Brazil into everybody was

59
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,680
watching online that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just such a</font>

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,200
cool collaborative experience and I

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,370
think that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that you</font>

62
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,780
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet is</font>

63
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,579
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though you feel like you're</font>

64
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,590
just a small you know person you don't

65
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,450
have any subscribers or whatever it may

66
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,980
be that seems discouraging to you just

67
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,389
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like there are always</font>

68
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,680
people out there they're going to be

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing and want to collaborate with you</font>

70
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:17,489
it's a really cool experience we were

71
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,109
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in those</font>

72
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:20,940

73
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,920
footage to everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was shown in</font>

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,799
that video was shot and made by friends

75
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,660

76
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,709

77
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,150
so many of you guys in it there were so

78
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,040
