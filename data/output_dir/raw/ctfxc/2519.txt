<font color="#E5E5E5">something you don't see every day oh not</font>

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,110
anymore at least like actual physical

34
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,759
buttons usually everything's like a

35
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,980
touchscreen

36
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,330
that resorting back to the olden days

37
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,000
the old the holy days I was just having

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> national conversation at a local</font>

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,380
circle k and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they were having a</font>

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,740
debate on whether or not guys could use

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,270
a ladies restroom for example like if

42
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,310
the men's restroom is busy right and the

43
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,080
women's restroom is completely like

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,080
empty<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of wrong for the guy to</font>

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,600
go use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the women's restroom but when</font>

46
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,370
it's the opposite a girl has to use

47
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,950
restroom and the girls is occupied it's

48
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,720
okay for her to use the veil rest or

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,250
it's like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> double standard women's</font>

50
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,080
restroom is generally cleaner not all

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,290
the time generally cleaner so if a girl

52
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,020
is willing to handle what goes on in a

53
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,380
men's restroom I guess that's why it's

54
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">like punishment enough if you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">into a men's restroom men's public</font>

56
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,040
restroom probably the grossest thing you

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,830
could probably ever yeah ever go into I

58
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,910

59
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,010

60
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,080
