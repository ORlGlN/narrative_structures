its legs any possible sales to move very

122
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,220
fast like on each of its short arms it

123
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,630
had hands with three fingers each with a

124
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,020
sharp claw this is what the old

125
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,850
Brachiosaurus is dead in florida there's

126
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,310

127
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,570
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too i thought this</font>

128
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,760
would be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier i actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

129
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that I mean don't get me wrong it's</font>

130
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,260
pretty damn cheesy but it's just

131
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,010
actually a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk would be so cool</font>

132
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,290
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> kids to learn this way I love it</font>

133
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,360
what you doing yes what is that avi me

134
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,960
mas so they're like dinosaurs live there

135
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,660
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bird-like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they some scientists</font>

136
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,160
decided that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be classified</font>

137
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,830
as a bird not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dinosaur interesting</font>

138
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,720
that is frightening to most investors

139
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,060
they go like this about growing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

140
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,360
your mouth this was just a call queue up

141
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,580
I saw was closely more closely rated

142
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,370
look related to birds and reptiles is

143
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,960
that the thing I believe so

144
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,410
so what we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> about dinosaurs right</font>

145
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,030
now a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

146
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,890
about dinosaurs and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovery of</font>

147
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,260
dinosaurs obviously I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

148
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,610
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> still you know finding remain</font>

149
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,990
some things of that sort but not as

150
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,030
early as like the 1980s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things as</font>

151
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,710
scary as what was over there that burns

152
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,630
like one fan freaky because you think

153
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,090
like you discovered everything yeah then

154
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,750
like 1980 like 2016 good priority

155
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,790
digging a hole can you imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

156
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,200
that they does it because you know they

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,280
are they're going to discover a new

158
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,070
species of dinosaur yeah this is

159
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,740
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> largest of the dinosaurs</font>

160
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,100
so is this not to scale obviously

161
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,060
because he seems pretty small in

162
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,820
comparison to like the t-rex and the

163
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,240
bright the Brachiosaurus really one of

164
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,529

196
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,470
right on top of them these are like the

252
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,130
riding and kind of feel like riding is a

253
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,870
