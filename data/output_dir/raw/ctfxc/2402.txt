1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
so yeah I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run through</font>

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,350
some of the features and designs of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,600
assassins and I just kind of show it to

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,280
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys and I'm really excited first</font>

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,650
off we went with a low top we figured

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most practical</font>

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,030
type of shoe there was some suggestions

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,460
for a high top but I feel the low top is

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,650
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Universal for males and females</font>

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,660
younger and older people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why I</font>

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">went with the low top and then another</font>

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you guys wanted a shoe that was</font>

13
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,000
very light and very<font color="#CCCCCC"> Airy so your feet</font>

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,830
can breathe so these shoes are actually

15
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,539
made of canvas of a really high quality

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,380
canvas so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very light and if you</font>

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,210
can breathe and they're very we're

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,500
really comfortable actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,239
nothing going to poke you or stick you a

20
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,829
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys wanted the shoe that was</font>

21
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,809
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more casual but you also</font>

22
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,460
wanted to shoot that was very sleek and

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,920
very slick<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tops of the shoe they're</font>

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,809
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like this frayed edge so it's</font>

25
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,010
kinda like my cutoff shorts and stuff

26
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,020
and it gives you kind of a very

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">laid-back casual kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of look but at the</font>

28
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,710
same time when you look at them<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font>

29
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool another really unique</font>

30
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,579
suggestion one of you guys gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> us you</font>

31
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,989
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like plugs these black plugs right</font>

32
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,430
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> something suggest doing something</font>

33
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,899
similar to this for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye holes</font>

34
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,790
instead of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire shoe like</font>

35
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,990
that it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little bit of problem</font>

36
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,960
but putting two at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very top one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

37
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,390
either side kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it more of a</font>

38
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,330
unique look you know what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean and</font>

39
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's so subtle but you know without it</font>

40
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,990
it would look totally different i really

41
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,610
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the sides we had like these</font>

42
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,900
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> pouches you don't necessarily</font>

43
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,400
have to put anything in there but if you

44
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,049
want to you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a secret note or</font>

45
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,490
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know whatever you want</font>

46
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">some diamonds however what makes these</font>

47
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">CTFxC internet killed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telogen shoes we</font>

48
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,650
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that would speak for</font>

49
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,750
younger people and older people<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

50
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,829
wouldn't be assured that was designed

51
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">for just a specific age group or gender</font>

52
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,180
it's for everybody we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to put</font>

53
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">them in several different places first</font>

54
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,930
off we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tongue as you can see</font>

55
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,880
it's a CTFxC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's tweaked right</font>

56
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,310
there and if you want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

57
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,369
fold the front flap down and it reveals

58
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,159
a broken television<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says internet</font>

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,659
killed television so that's kind of cool

60
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,340
so you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do tongue flap down</font>

61
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,469
you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your tongue flap up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its you</font>

62
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">know whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> style you want then if you</font>

63
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,430
turn a shoe around<font color="#CCCCCC"> BAM it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

64
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">this 8 16 bit font CTFxC you write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

65
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,959
the back then to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it more of like a</font>

66
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,130
CTFxC shoe

67
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,650
did these<font color="#E5E5E5"> like caricatures of myself and</font>

68
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,690
ali you see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the left foot and then</font>

69
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,670
right here just get a better one on the

70
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,850
yellow one um you can see Zoey Marley so

71
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,560
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of cool and I</font>

72
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,770
really like the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're depicted I</font>

73
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,420
think they're kind of a cool little

74
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,370
design something small but every time

75
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,510
you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> your foot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the shoe you're</font>

76
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,580
like yeah these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> statuses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

77
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,590
you can do this as you're saying these

78
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,480
assets lastly I want to show you my

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,850
favorite feature of all and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

80
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,100
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most debated in the comments</font>

81
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,720
section a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted lace up</font>

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,520
shoes right everyone wanted lace up

83
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,260
shoes but then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this other group</font>

84
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,660
of people that wanted more slip-on shoes

85
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,910
so what do we do you're right we merge

86
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,100
the ideas so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking every</font>

87
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,690
shoe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see a strap here on both</font>

88
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,730
sides and under the tongue so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font>

89
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,470
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lace up your shoes you</font>

90
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">can lace them up and if you don't want</font>

91
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,220
you can just slip slip your foot right

92
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,780
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to tie your</font>

93
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,730
shoe you just throw your laces in you

94
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,320
know tuck them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there and you're good</font>

95
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,730
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much what I do because I</font>

96
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,860
hate tying my shoes those are the CTFxC

97
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,710
assassins they're finally done they're

98
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,780
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my hand they're actually real this is</font>

99
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,220
this is really mind-boggling to me

100
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,240
because not only did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys demand for</font>

101
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">tweak to make these shoes you guys gave</font>

108
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,500

109
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,630

110
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,610
