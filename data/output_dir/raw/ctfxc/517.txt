since she can't take me I figured the

20

best way to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole situation</font>

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,149
would just take the golf cart try to

22
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,129
find a vet in the area and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found one</font>

23
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,770

31
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,270
what comes with the territory when

32
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,680
planning a wedding you got to get

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,650
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order and you need to get</font>

34
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of it done quickly so my task for</font>

35
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,430
like the next two<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks is basically</font>

36
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,640
finding bridesmaids dresses because they

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,090
do take time to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> girls</font>

38
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,850
need alterations that time frame needs

39
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,240
to be included<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this as well so we are</font>

114
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,510
flatter each and every person that you

115
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,870
have all night all night so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

116
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,520
like my biggest issue is like I wanted

00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do different styles if I wasn't going</font>

118
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,180
to do like<font color="#CCCCCC"> some different print so I</font>

119
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,490
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> three different styles all that I</font>

120
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,680
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> are gonna fit the girls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly</font>

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,110
cuz they all have similar body styles

122
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,090
for something more chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to than the</font>

123
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,550
others but I left every single one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>
