71
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,690
all the amazing adventures that you've

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,020
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda like why</font>

74
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,400
the song meant so much to us is because

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,080
it inspired us to want to inspire

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,120
morning that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear i mean how</font>

78
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,140
song whatever into a rock song in a

00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,490
console how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work for you guys</font>

80
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,160
I don't know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the hardest</font>

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,120
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to do because the</font>

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,490
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> Broadway is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim at aside so it's</font>

83
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,840
like it's like this won't think you're

84
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,940
like how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we turn that to a pop song</font>

85
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,220
and so we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the play that</font>

86
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,120
were really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping that Len is seeing</font>

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,950
this is my potential you were kids

88
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,780
you'll be younger you like snow into the

89
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,510
warmth or essentially right we did and

90
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">we were always scared to tell that story</font>

91
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,630
because now that we are actually

92
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,070
contracted

93
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to perform on the work tour we're</font>

94
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,240
like oh my gosh what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if kind of lino who</font>

95
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,130
runs the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Torah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't sit what if he</font>

96
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">finds out that we snuck into our very</font>

97
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,830
first world tour without paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

98
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,830
tickets come on we told<font color="#CCCCCC"> him and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

99
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,660
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shy and nervous about it and he</font>

100
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,210
used like that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome how do</font>

101
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,770
you all come together to put together an

102
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,170
hour well we're now like we're separated

103
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,350
so much wheat or about 10 months of the

104
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,440
year so we are constantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the road</font>

105
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,330
living in closer quarters and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

106
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,430
have ever imagined how did you initially

107
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,770
develop the sound of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> music because</font>

108
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,020
yes you I don't know if you started out

109
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,330
with song<font color="#CCCCCC"> lyrics and then had it music</font>

110
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,000
but how to decide what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted the</font>

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,529
sound room and feeling

112
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,959
that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good puzzle to ask that</font>

113
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,729
question I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've ever sat</font>

114
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:38,199
down and said like hey we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sound</font>

115
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,719
like this or we're even chose a van and

116
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:44,079
long as a sound like we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunter</font>

117
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,639
grabbed a guitar or Chloe grabbed a

118
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,829
piano and Danny tried to grab the trunk

119
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,019
KITT Charles with police and we were

120
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,599
like let's just kind of try to write a

121
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,699
song and see what happens and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

122
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,929
organically kind of became that

123
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:00,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">society's I think the best answer is</font>

124
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,669
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really who we are like we love</font>

125
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,199
upbeat music we're all hopeless

126
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,659
romantics and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's running for the</font>

127
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,599
lyricist<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the lyrics come from and</font>

128
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,879
then like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the style of music is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

129
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,889
just what we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play at that time</font>

130
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,619
