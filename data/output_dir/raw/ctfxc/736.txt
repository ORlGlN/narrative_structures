honestly been having a blast doing it

71
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,110
because it kind of makes you think of

72
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,940
really creative things to do instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

73

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,010
which should take from<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube is to be</font>

82
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,620

83
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,120
how it all works you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody made</font>

00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,949
