the head and people at YouTube they're

39
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,000
like I can't believe this it's pretty

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,009
gnarly but as a result of those things

41
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,380
I've had seizures like walls on tours

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,490
when I found out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

43
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,009
situation so long story short i've been

44
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,079
on this medication and they've been

45
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to wean me off of something</font>

46
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,770
that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bad for me so as</font>

47
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,810
a result i just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you i'm at</font>

48
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,020
an all-time high of 10 pills at once so

49
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,740
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my daily dose right now dilantin</font>

50
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,790
vimpat lexapro I can't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name</font>

51
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that one this is a new one that's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">i have to have that going on my phone</font>

55
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,520
forget I pretty much could they have a

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,930
bad memory that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's film every</font>

57
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,910
single day yeah I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> over exaggerating I</font>

at this tempo not exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coolest</font>

61
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,060
trick but it's a trick nonetheless

62
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,220
because I know when Ali takes a pill she

63
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,600
