00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:27,769
tour to a clean house is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best thing</font>

funny like she's definitely my better

176
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,850
half she always is the type of person

177
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,339
that like when I feel bummed out or down

178
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,029
or uninspired she<font color="#E5E5E5"> always finds a way to</font>

179
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,870
like basically light a fire under my ass

180
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,130
figuratively obviously she's really

181
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,110
literally light a fire under my ass

182
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,000
