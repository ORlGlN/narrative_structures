144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,799
what has been driving me crazy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

145
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,479
past few days ever since those big

146
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,849
storms came through I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

147
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,469
necessary but it's just like an OCD

148
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,720
thing I have do you think if I ran

149
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,020
really fast I can make it to that roof

150
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,010
actually I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think so it looked</font>

151
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,840
closer than I thought it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was you know</font>

152
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,490
this kind of reminds me of remember when

153
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,230
Ben and I were in New York City<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

154
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,570
halloween and they left the window open

155
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,700
the window is usually a latched shut
