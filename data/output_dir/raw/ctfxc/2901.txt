00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,820
observation at the beginning of the

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,340
movie when Edward is his name the

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,970

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,810
like parallel park using four of the

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,360
parking spots and he just gets out is he

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,680
allowed to just do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he's a</font>

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,420
vampire but they don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's a</font>

like this at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all hours of the</font>

54
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,730
night cuz Bella kept having those
