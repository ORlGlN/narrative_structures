00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,750
we're all walking together there's some

75
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,130
little dachshund background don't like

76
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,320
dogs or it's not that they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

77
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,090
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that they're just loud and</font>

78
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,600
it's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> funny because diesel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Zoe I'm</font>

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,010
Harley or not he's making word they're

80
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,900
just too busy smelling everything that's

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,820
on this neighborhood I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always find it</font>

82
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,780
funny though because when they're at

83
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,639
home for like always sparking in the

84
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,080
house but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're actually out and</font>

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,240
about I never really<font color="#CCCCCC"> barked at anybody</font>

86
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,190
or any other dogs they just kind of like

87
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,930
stare and they might have come off a

88
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,550
little bit but they never actually bark

89
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so good for some reason my lease</font>

90
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,729
trailing behind Zoe not a good spot to

91
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:07,250
be unfortunately today was probably the

92
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,950
worst<font color="#CCCCCC"> day that I've had on tour not</font>

93
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,389
because of anything or anyone in

94
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular just like glitches and</font>

95
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,380
glitches and glitches

96
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,300
pretty much played eighty or ninety

97
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,910
percent of a song before a guitar came

98
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,890
on i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just our Wi-Fi what</font>

99
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,650
happens is with Wi-Fi has got RF signals

100
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,300
and there's so many RF signals because

101
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,610
so many bands are using wireless guitars

102
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,970
so it ends up kind of crossing signals

103
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,470
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like good remember that one time</font>

104
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,330
I don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it was exactly</font>

105
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,130
we're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can hear</font>

106
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,350
Spanish television coming through this

107
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ears kind of like that but just</font>

108
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,390
other bands like today we heard I think

109
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,160

125
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,139
task walking three dogs at one it's like

126
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,229
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there are a few factors that</font>

127
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:24,180
come into play though when walking these

128
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,790
stocks it's not terrible if there's no

129
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,710
other dogs around if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other</font>

in a sweat and I was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking</font>

132
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,110

133
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,810
that they were not like they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>
