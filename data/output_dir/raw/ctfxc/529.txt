to go to the wedding venue in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,990
of everything which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> way more</font>

209
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,059
important but you know me I'm all about

the gadgets in the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's funny</font>

211
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,500
because every single vlog at the same

<font color="#CCCCCC">time the release an iphone I've done</font>

213
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,790
probably the same exact thing I just

214
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,279
geeked out and was a huge nerd but it's

215
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,470
just what I do whether or not it's any

216
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,879
piece of technology i know there's

217
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,980
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a people i hate apple and people</font>

218
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love apple and all that stuff</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that aside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't care because the</font>

220
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:45,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why I'm really stoked about this</font>

221
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,589
is because I make videos for a living

222
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,899
that's what I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact that these</font>

223
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,829
these cell phones are now becoming so

224
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:57,069
good with their<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera it's making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

225
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:59,620
much easier to capture like moments and

226
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,990
I think as a vlogger or anybody does

227
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,990
anything on youtube so long as you turn

228
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,809
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone sideways we're all good that</font>

229
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,819
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually 101 I think every</font>

230
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:11,410
single person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who gets like a phone</font>

231
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,629
before they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do anything on</font>

232
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:16,170
it they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be trained to turn their</font>

233
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,699
their phone whether it's a samsung or

234
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,699
droid or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone sideways so it</font>

235
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,930
doesn't do that stupid vertical thing

236
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,790
totally just one off on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of</font>

237
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,410
tangent are you guys pretty stoked about

238
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,269
the fact that these these cameras are

239
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:28,490
get

240
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,800
so freaking awesome their full out of

241
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,050
