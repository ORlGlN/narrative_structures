a very very annoying day I cannot get

155
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,890
anything to work so it's just kind of me

156
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,500
wasting the day like I think I'm being

157
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,690
productive and then I look<font color="#CCCCCC"> down for</font>

158
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,099
example I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing is working</font>

159
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,950
and then I look<font color="#CCCCCC"> down not my robots of</font>

160
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,450
upside of all over the place where

161
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,800
robots broking little annoyed this isn't

162
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,339
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> the robots not working so what I</font>

163
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,180
have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things manually what the hell</font>

164
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">just kidding all right pirate</font>

165
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,590
I feel very very cooped up right now so

166
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,770
I figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually it wasn't my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea he</font>

167
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,270
just started<font color="#E5E5E5"> barking and started running</font>

168
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,430
out to the door what what you think

169
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,740
you're gonna do buckle we have a wagon

170
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,900

171
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,070
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> boy you kicking some butt right now</font>

172
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:30,330
dude somebody got tired

173
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,690
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to Tyson though</font>

174
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,820
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four legs and how</font>

175
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,460
bad he felt he feels way better up with

176
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,730
three legs Tyson is a beast though he's

177
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,730
protect my mom from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dog attack he's</font>

178
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,240
had two ACL surgeries he's lost a leg

179
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,430
what else numbskull I don't know how was

180
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,240
it does this you're a big boy it's like

181
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,400
double the exercise when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it this</font>

182
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:05,540
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tyson put your wiener away focus</font>

183
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:14,030
buddy ready you are a rank or good catch

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,910
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get as much as I wanted to get</font>

185
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,520
done because things started breaking but

186
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,230
I still got some time because Ali's

187
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,880
coming home tomorrow I think in the

188
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,670
afternoon I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite sure it's</font>

189
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,320
actually been the longest I've actually

190
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,840
gone without speaking to her because you

191
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,760
know her phone's off no reception<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

192
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,350
really kind of sucks because I'm always

193
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,150
around her you know we speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day</font>

194
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,010
and she's she's essentially my best

195
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,650
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I miss her a shitload</font>

196
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,930
from when I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her loss is</font>

197
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,820
having a blast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the most</font>

198
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,280
important part I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> my little sister</font>

199
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing birthday and I'm so</font>

200
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,600
happy that Ali was able to go with her

201
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that she has one who I</font>

202
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,700
sister is she's such a nice girl and

203
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,620
she's such a what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> word I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

204
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,870
say she's like a like innocent innocent

205
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess would be the best way to</font>

206
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,070
describe a very innocent girl or woman

207
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,670
now she's 32 him my sister's 30 so she

208
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,650
wouldn't normally go out of her way to

209
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,740
go and do something crazy like<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on a</font>

210
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,050
cruise by herself I'm actually really

211
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,940
really happy I've actually was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talking</font>

212
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,130
to I was talking to somebody about how I

213
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,800
love the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that alley and Melissa are</font>

214
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,410
able to be so weird together<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

215
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,970
you guys see it all the time of the

216
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,700
videos like I think I'm weird but when I

217
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,210
see them together

218
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,500
I get embarrassed sometimes how weird

219
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,930
they are I'm still feeling it for last

220
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,480
couple days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just don't want to be</font>

221
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,100
over exhausted because every time I am

222
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually what happens if I don't</font>

223
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,089
drink water or I'm exhausted or don't

224
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,100
get enough sleep you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know bad things</font>

225
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,420
start happening I've been really

226
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,459
honestly taking your advice as much as I

227
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,410
possibly can and I would feel really bad

228
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,940
though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly feel guilty when I</font>

229
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,339
don't get to do like crazy things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thought that was kind of cool I'll be</font>

233
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,730
completely honest I feel sometimes

234
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,959
guilty when I can't do something

235
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">incredibly entertaining I shouldn't say</font>

236
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,250

237
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,870
