27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,909
bit because it's gonna take a couple of

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,190

white Slayer shirt and it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

123
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,750
surgery<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mom ended up having a biopsy</font>

125
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,370
on her eyelid thank you and they ended

126
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,670
up having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know do biopsy for a</font>

127
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,130
reason and then because they did a

128
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,260
biopsy on her eyelid what they ended up

129
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,690
doing is they took a skin graft from

130
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,850
behind her ear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then put that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on her</font>

131
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,710
eyelid which to me is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the craziest</font>

132
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,270
and coolest thing in the world and that

133
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,570
your body can adapt to that and like
