8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,550
I'm going to film that at like what time

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,890
is it now I did it I would always

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,270
thought i had my app watch I was like

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,980
joking around I don't film that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,840
an hour and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get on a</font>

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,550
plane head back home so literally this

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,890
trip was only 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours it was probably</font>

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,080
one of the quickest times I was in and

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,570
out of a city other than la at one time

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,820
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm literally here for only 24 hours</font>

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back home it's in</font>

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,180
the meantime though I'm gonna enjoy this

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,188
view right now because look I have a

21
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,110
cable on this one out this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">hurt snow pack oh there's stairs</font>

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,190
how do i get done that was like a fluke

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,240
complete fluke I knew it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would never</font>

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,360
happen again mmm smells like pizza and

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,140
sewage<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York for 24 hours a night</font>

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,990
here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> freezing and now raining you</font>

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,640
got to just laugh at things like that I

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,500
have to try to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the YouTube space in</font>

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,180
New York that's we're filming everything

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,490

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,110
one you know the one with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> helicopter</font>

33
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,400
in the front but I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually I think</font>

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,500
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a giant Google</font>

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,570
last night that we saw if I would guess

36
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,300
that would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a safe guess this</font>

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,800
is the elevator to youtube right here

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,110

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,680
us a few few takes trim will get reading

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,989
through the whole script to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font>

89
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">at other than for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the head</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube Walker it goes up and</font>

93
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,080
down side to side diagnosed whichever

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,990
way

95
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,199
straight up and down just like Willy

96
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
Wonka obviously just finished everything

97
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,639
and I could either go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the airport</font>

98
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,580
right now which i think i might do what

99
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,229
I'm considering because there's a pizza

100
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:39,849
place called Gotham visa which has now

101
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,949
become<font color="#CCCCCC"> ally and ours a little pizza</font>

102
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,889
place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of found it</font>

103
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,880
accidentally discovered here in New York

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,940
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to find rays pizza and</font>

105
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,229
literally as I think Ali Anais favorite

106
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,720
pizza ever and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a mile and a</font>

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,460
half so I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about maybe just</font>

108
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,580
taking a little walk even in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rain</font>

109
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,139
and then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the airport and</font>

110
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">then going home kind of crazy to think</font>

111
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:03,940
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I could be in New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City</font>

112
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,039

113
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours literally back in my own house air</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">afford to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for things and I've been</font>

230
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">there when I needed help from other</font>

231
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,649
people and that's all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could bring</font>

232
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:05,880
through my mind was that

233
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,680
you know just she's got her baby here

234
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,440

235
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">something good you know without even</font>

236
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,470
thinking about it just go out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

237
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,990
something good for someone else or for a

238
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,450
friend or a family member or just do the

239
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,890
right thing even the littlest thing like

240
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,170
holding a door open or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know smiling</font>

241
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,820
giving away<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that could bring</font>

242
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,250
kind of light to someone's day cuz you

243
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,300
never know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of day that they're</font>

244
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,670
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you never know what they're</font>

245
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,080
going through in life of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that car moment</font>

246
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,370
in time and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just think it's always</font>

247
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,260
important to just do good and be good I

248
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,790
get I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to end this</font>

249
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,650
little things count they really do

250
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,120
little things count and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

251
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,460
change someone's entire outlook on that

252
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,050
moment because some people are going

253
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">through some of the craziest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

254
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,590
the world on that note goodnight we're
