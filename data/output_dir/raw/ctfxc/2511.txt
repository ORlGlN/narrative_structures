shot I think sound is such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge thing</font>

105
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,060
cuz think about the old times the old

106
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,430
times 1911 time now think about when

107
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,050
YouTube first started the picture

108
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,940

109
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,040

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,510
video that had bad like a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality</font>
