<font color="#CCCCCC">doctors on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bay video after eight hours</font>

98
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:11,560
and it's so frustrating yep that's

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,940
what's going on but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

100
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,370
overall just a frustrating day just you

101
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what I mean just a frustrating day</font>

102
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,729
so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think when what I do is I</font>

103
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we're going to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grocery</font>

104
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,120
store and get some food because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,280
you're frustrated you make some food you

106
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,810
feel better because if you make some

107
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,060
pizza or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

108
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,509
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> always feel better look at that</font>

Twitter made a good point I at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least got</font>

113
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,099
the video uploaded so Ali doesn't need

114
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:47,529
to punch me in the balls so that's

115
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,529
definitely a perk I guess you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

116
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">could always be down side but that's</font>

117
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,300
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upside so that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> true</font>

118
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,770
Ali does not need to punch me in the

119
