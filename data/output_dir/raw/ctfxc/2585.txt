blogging from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car I travel a lot in</font>

59
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,660
between classes and it's hard because it

60
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,580
there's nothing to film like I'm when

61
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,080
I'm on campus I have my schedule set up

62
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,970
so nicely that I'm literally in one

63
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,490
building for every class so I don't

64
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,600
really walk anywhere and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,800
really interesting to film on campus

66
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,240
i'll try and find something but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

67
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,740
kind of boring when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in one</font>

68
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,930
building a whole time lens on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlog</font>

71
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,930
it and the end of that last clip<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

72
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,640
watched my face when i turn the camera

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,260
off and I ok it's really funny because

74
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,700
sometimes you guys do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you send me</font>

75
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,550
screen grabs of us in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

78
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,610
ridiculous spaces where our eyes are

79
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,310
half open and like our lips are drooping

80
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,590
and it just it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really funny you guys</font>

81
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,540

82
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,400
class asked me if I owned any animals

83
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,470
which made me laugh a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

84
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,470

other about the way I wear my hat

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,940

just listen to me during those parts

102
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,739

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,200
the worst thing you could possibly ever

108
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,900
do to yourself it's up your tub as the

109
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,390
worst thing in the world I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather cut</font>

110
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,820
my toe off than stub it it's such a

111
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">painful thing now it's bleeding I'm</font>

114
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,738
don't

115
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,470
boldly go where only a few people have

116
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,479
ever gone before actually probably a lot

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,520
since there's a trail and it's next to a

118
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,120
road and pretend<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we're the I don't</font>

119
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,699
know that didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen I also has</font>

120
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,500
pretty annoying news right now as well

121
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,819
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you since I'm just clearing my head</font>

122
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,300
and walking we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'll make our</font>

123
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,970
reservation a reserve our wedding day

124
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,680
and apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are booked pretty</font>

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,759
much almost until 2012 so there's one

126
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,259
date<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could possibly do it in</font>

127
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,380
december but they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like unblock</font>

128
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,849
it apparently it's blacked out for some

129
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,259
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if they can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can do</font>

130
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">in december otherwise we have to find an</font>

131
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,490
entirely different location which really

132
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,740
is kind of annoying since we've been

133
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,840
looking we finally found the place we're

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to figure that out so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know a</font>

135
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,630
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been asking about</font>

136
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,210
the wedding when it when was it and all

137
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,400
that stuff it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> originally gonna be in</font>

138
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">november but now it looks like Abby</font>

139
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:25,130
December or maybe even sooner so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

140
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,630
know it could actually be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the summer I</font>

141
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,860
really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do a summer wedding</font>

142
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,509
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot of her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> friends</font>

143
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:31,789
coming they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you really used to</font>

144
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,800
Florida heat and I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

145
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">be wearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a suit and I'll you know</font>

146
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,490
putting on the makeup on and you know

147
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,780
her wedding dress so if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

148
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be sweating xplory the summer kind of</font>

149
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,259
sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what's all like let's all</font>

150
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,780
hold our breath and hopes that she she's

151
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,840
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> call us back great actually</font>

152
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,550
probably shouldn't hold her breath she's

153
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">been pretty awful first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> baby been busy</font>

209
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,330
unnecessarily this hospital so he would

215
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">long process and this is very</font>

216
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,780
uncomfortable staring into the Sun

217
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,280
actually just walking around here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

218
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,900
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes I've almost been it hit</font>

219
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,390

just drives like 60 miles an

222
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,039
or so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's gonna be a really</font>

223
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,860
crucial crucial decision-maker isn't it

you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I I don't like to</font>

225
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,640
