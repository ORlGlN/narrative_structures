11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,480
right now i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,640
i'm sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all these planes go i</font>

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,059
have all right so i leave the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 19 I don't</font>

14
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,210
get to New Zealand until the 21st so the

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,860
20th doesn't even exist for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me kind of</font>

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,680
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually didn't realize</font>

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,689
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the air like that</font>

18
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,270
so I'm a little bit stressed out trying

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,310
to make sure that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss a day I</font>

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,310
know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds stupid and I'll let all</font>

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,229
itself but just after doing this for so

22
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,630
long I need to figure out a way to do

23
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,240
this it's weird cuz we fly the 19th we

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,490
get there the 21st so we kind of time

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,369
travel or flash forward that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we</font>

26
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,960
time travel I guess it would be time to

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,579
but we're not the cool time travel we

28
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,200
couldn't go back in time so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,990
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out where I can do this maybe</font>

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,110
in LA I think it's going to be fine it

31
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,420
just looks it looks really daunting I'll

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,640
be completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest and this is stupid</font>

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,759
stuff I shouldn't be stressing out about

34
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,430
but I just I do you know it's I put so

35
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,140
much into these videos and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're good all the time</font>

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,180
and on time I'm not too worried honestly

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,030
because I always end up somehow figuring

39
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,759
this crap out right there and cut it

40
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,340
like that around the corners<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> swear</font>

41
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,910
that's perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

42
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,730
sucks because i just<font color="#CCCCCC"> took my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> medication</font>

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,569
I'm a little shaky right now worst thing

I guess we can call this now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

75
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,280
kind of I don't know why they left this

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,020
but there's like this little section

77
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,810
right here and I can't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> if this is</font>

78
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,630
cement or not or like concrete but you

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,130
actually gonna hope this is cement this

84
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,140
is kind of cool so I got to sign mine

85
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,970
and then when Ali gets back she's gotta

86
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,010
sign hers that's as best as I can do and

87
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,560
submit whatever the hell is this mud I

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,480

89
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,380

90
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,390
practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so Ali's got to do</font>

91
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,220

summer everything's flipped around

106
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,420
because they're so far on the other side

107
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,160
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> south I guess it would</font>

actually painted anything in my entire

140
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,900
life except for

141
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,900
maybe art school or art class maybe in

142
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,250
high school when I was forced to paying

143
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,009
things so it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a challenge I</font>

144
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,960
think I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set the alarm when I</font>

145
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,580
left thank God I have like the remote

146
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,919

147
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,780
completely forgot the dogs was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

148
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,820

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel like an asshole Oh Zoey it was</font>

makes me feel bad this was such<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

151
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,240
idea to get one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things at the</font>

152
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,530
same time it makes me feel even worse

153
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,900
because I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how Zoe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just chills at</font>

154

224
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,040
he gave me a cool idea he recently did

225
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,139
in one of his videos where he painted

226
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,089
something he tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it up on like</font>

227
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,620
an auction kind of thing I go jet

228
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,810
painting gallery so what I'm going to do

229
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,300
is when I finished with this glorious

230
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,459
thing which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost done as you can</font>

231
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,350
see I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> finishing it up I'm going</font>

232
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on ebay for you guys and</font>

233
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,800
whoever wants to get it can try to get

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,459
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the money every every cent of</font>

235
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,990
the money will go to bring cancer

236
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,300
research I just thought this would be

237
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,269
kind of a cool way to like get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and</font>

238
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,629
so you guys can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an awesome</font>

239
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,980
centerpiece for your wall or for a

240
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,709
mantle or whatever or couch wherever you

241
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to put it so I definitely have to</font>

242
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:33,829
give a shout-out for Danny for giving me

243
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:36,589
this idea and doing it himself because

244
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,470
he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I think his painting with</font>

245
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,660
me I think he did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a house on a field I</font>

246
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,769
think what needs to happen is Danny and

247
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,540
I need to came up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an awesome</font>
