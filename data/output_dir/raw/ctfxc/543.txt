00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,520
show you guys a quick little tip or

39
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,009
trick that might actually help it's been

40
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,270
helping me with some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the videos that</font>

41
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,429

00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,670
com sauce CTFxC and then right here next

43
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,590
between the subscribe button and the

44
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,330
subscriber there's this little sprocket

45
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,210
looking thing you click that and it said

46
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,770
send me<font color="#E5E5E5"> all notifications for this</font>

47
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,619

48
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,149
you also want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure to subscribe</font>

49
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:03,860
because if it doesn't do that you know

50
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,590
obviously something kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messed up in</font>

the internet world it's a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

52
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,470

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,910
personally haven't been to getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

54
