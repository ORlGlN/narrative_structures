oxygen playing a hundred drive I think

day a much better day than yesterday so

25
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,500
in regrets that rant yesterday I know it

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,330
wasn't like I had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment of weakness</font>

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,700
which I think everyone's entitled to but

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,130
I a big reason why I actually wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,560
do it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I thought it was</font>

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,979
necessary to remind people because I

31
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,649
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind myself to a lot that we</font>

32
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,869
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more positivity in this</font>

33
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,030
world and less hatred unless negativity

34
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,920
and I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> where most of your</font>

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from saying this is things that I</font>

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,680
should expect with being<font color="#E5E5E5"> on YouTube and</font>

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,340
I agree with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I still felt that</font>

38
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,110
it was necessary to state my opinion and

39
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,270
say that I just feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's wrong and</font>

40
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,950
it's inappropriate for people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

41
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,369
unkind and if by speaking out just a

42
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,580
little bit changes someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> from deciding</font>

43
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,990
on whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're going to write</font>

44
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,459
a mean comment then I fully I have no

45
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,840
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking up and I have no</font>

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,520
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying what I said I'm sorry if</font>

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,440
I came off as a baby it wasn't that I

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,209
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do that I wasn't trying to</font>

49
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,280
get sympathy by doing what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,349
yesterday I might have influenced<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

51
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,540
person who was negative what I said was

52
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,050
not

53
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,110
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack anyone who writes the</font>

54
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,190
negative comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> more to instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of be</font>

55
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,080
that person who either rights negative

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,400
comment or response to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative</font>

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,000
comment which I know I did try and

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,400
spread positivity instead you know be

59
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,520
the bigger person and now that i think

60
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,810
about I should have done the same thing

61
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,210
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just because I can I just wanted</font>

62
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully touch a few people who have</font>

63
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,450
maybe been mean in the past or unkind

64
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,160
hopefully that does country or something

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,750
with him that

66
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,910
this world is so precious and the people

67
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,400
on our so precious and that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

68
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">work together to make it a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better place</font>

69
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,620
so that's hopefully what came across I

70
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,410
know I was angry but I hope it dad and I

71
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,510
hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

72
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,630
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I felt important for me</font>

73
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,090
to say something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them I am off to</font>
