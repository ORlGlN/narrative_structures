00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
stick your head in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,670

easier in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dishwasher</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh God</font>

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,799
hurricane has yet to hit probably in a

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,049
hand the next like two days but this is

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,170
definitely the call before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> storm</font>

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,240
when preparing for a hurricane like

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting enough water make sure you have</font>

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,400
candles

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,400
it's not gonna go bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> why Charles and I</font>

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,840
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just realized we haven't prepped at</font>

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,759
all I don't know I guess I'm very

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:32,870
optimistic though it's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font>

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,940
because it does pass pretty much every

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,980
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> time but for some reason there is</font>

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,960
something deep within me that's like Ali

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,879
you need to go grab water need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab</font>

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,660
more candles and that wind out there we

19
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,190
have enough really<font color="#CCCCCC"> in rain and every</font>

20
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,330
once in a while we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little bit of</font>

21
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,290
wind but no crazy rain yet it's like

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,050
hurricane Matthews on his way we haven't

23
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,140

00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,670
we've only had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that little spurt like we</font>

25
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,290

31
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,080
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consciously remember it</font>

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,299
going up and swinging back around kind

33
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:15,710

113
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,080
a little confusing because we started

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,620
bringing food into the actual venue and

115
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,850
then we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure it out to where</font>

116

we're gonna actually have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truck</font>

that's worth of proteins or the like the

120
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,060
actual entree without the sides will be

121
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,530
served in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the food truck the desserts</font>

122
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,229
will be served in the future I don't

123
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">give away too much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah aside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from those</font>

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,460
little brownie bites which I every

125
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,870
single one of them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were so</font>

126
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,850
good the dessert ideas so we came up

127
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">with these like mini donut ideas are</font>

128
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,250
mini churros because we figure every

129
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,840
wedding that we've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to you know</font>

130

131
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,350
cake nobody ain't it it gets passed

132
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,900
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> and nobody eats it and it's super</font>

133
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,340
expensive and just gets thrown away

134
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,600
we're talking to the caterer of people

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,460
and they make the all these cakes all

136
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,039
over the place shut up sit all over the

137
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,220
place but basically they were saying

138
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,660
like it's just it kind of is always the

139
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,950
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have to agree with him on</font>

140
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,720
that they speak about the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> wedding</font>

141
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,970
you went to and if you ate the wedding

142
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,490
cake and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was even good yeah not</font>

143
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,289
that it was baked in properly but they

144
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,640
could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not in the mood for</font>

145
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,870
cake I think our wedding is gonna be

146
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,550
more to this style where it's like

147
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,490
smaller portions of things

148
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,800

like Halloween decoration shopping I

204
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,660
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I felt like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

like a good time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to bring up</font>

206
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,590
audible and I know people get to worry

207
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,350
about promotions but this is the coolest

208
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,830
most long-standing they've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

209
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,650
with the CTFxC for I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> over two</font>

210
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,900
years now so crazy I think they're one

211
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,110
of the most like chill coolest companies

212
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,880
ever in the world I love reading books

213
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,250
but obviously I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of time</font>

214
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,929
to like sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to read a book the</font>

215
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,309
beauty about that is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have somebody</font>

216
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,080
reading a book to you so you still get

217
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,700
that feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're actually</font>

218
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,349
reading a book<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you're not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

219
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,120
movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's like a movie book but</font>

220
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,060
it's it's cut I don't know it really to

221
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,620
me it reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me of a movie and I'm like</font>

222
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,700
one of those people I like to listen to

223
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,590
music rather than watching movie so this

224
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">is like complimentary yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

225
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,000
like both yeah so I decided that'll be

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,830
kind of really fun to do a goosebump

227
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,870
book because I freaking love goosebumps

228
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,130

229
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">kids were one of my cam we couldn't</font>

230
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,940
figure out which one we should do so I

231
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,890
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali which one was scariest for her</font>

232
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,100
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she chose Idol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Living dummy and if</font>

233
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,480
you guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should</font>

234
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,310
read it used to scare me so bad when I

235
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,530
was younger but ventriloquist dolls

236
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,200

237
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,450
