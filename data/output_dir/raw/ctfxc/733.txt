<font color="#E5E5E5">think that we've accomplished</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

119
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,520
a huge help from his mom and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge help</font>

everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks beautiful and I know</font>

123
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,820
it's kind of bittersweet for char

124
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,070
because you know who loves<font color="#E5E5E5"> his house so</font>

125
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,290
much and it means so much to him and

00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,220
about him a lot of wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> memories so</font>

127
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,630
you know I know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably really</font>

128
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,830
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> for him to get rid of this</font>

129
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,840
right now why memories are so specialist

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,390
