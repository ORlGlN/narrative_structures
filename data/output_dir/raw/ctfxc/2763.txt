Norris<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's the ultimate if Chuck</font>

34
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,240
Norris was a pirate or Chuck Norris was

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,240
a ninja who would win that one it's

36
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,720
essentially Chuck Norris okay yes yes

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,869
true Cyrus okay Chuck Norris ninja Bruce

38
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,490
truck North pirate all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right which</font>

39
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,170
creates a dilemma the<font color="#CCCCCC"> check Norris beats</font>

40
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,710
everything so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world just explode yes</font>

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,549
you think ninjas I don't know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

42
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,380
what would just blow without a penis

43
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,960
like check well no no no you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I take</font>

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,270
that back pirates because if we were

45
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,739
Chuck Norris pirate and Chuck Norris a

46
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:11,530
ninja Chuck Norris is already a ninja so

47
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,630
he'd have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a ninja</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I</font>

48
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,319
pirate oh I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the two ninjas</font>

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,870
which is kind of campus that's true

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,790
double ninja double ninja or ninja

51
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,560
pirate would be double ninja cuz here

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,910
you wouldn't gain the power he already

53
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,340
be a ninja but he gained the power of a

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,650
