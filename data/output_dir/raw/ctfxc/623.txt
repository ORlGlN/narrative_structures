00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,049
we're gonna try to check out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach</font>

30
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,020
and see how I bleach yeah bleach is not

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,479
not now we put a pause on the bleep six

32
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,759
years old I I<font color="#CCCCCC"> called his sister</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,040
Hillary told me earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like we're</font>

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing sales like while we were going to</font>

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beach but instead where do you</font>

36
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,189
bleach let me see she's like what that

37
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,600
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> really weird the reason why is</font>

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,509
because our granite countertops it's

39
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,040
like a marble color you guys noted as

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,560
you see in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vlogs all the time it has</font>

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,259
a little bit of yellow and I called Shea

42
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,470
cuz you know Shay used to have a granite

43
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,270
counter business he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said since I didn't</font>

44
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,370
know this grant it you think you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,740
like a very hard stone is very porous

46
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,889
same with marble absorb it so it absorbs

47
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,290
things like random things that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

48
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,150
of turn yellow so that's where the

49
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,070
bleach situation came from for some

50
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,080
reason I'm in this like chore detail

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,630
situation really is and it's freaking me

52
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,100
out let the Scourge that feeling

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,720
flattened that's really kind of cool now

54
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes off in such a really</font>

55
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,600
beautiful bridge in the water whoa the

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,670

58
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,090

there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways actually are several</font>

240
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,350
ways to try to do this one was with

241
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,269
bleach and I kind of want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

242
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:56,250
avoid bleach much as possible just goes

243
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,500
so harsh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and since I can't open the</font>

244
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz the you know the rain don't</font>

245
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">end up suffocating for the other is a</font>

246
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,510
like a baking<font color="#E5E5E5"> soda can I don't really</font>

247
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,010
know

248
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,920
kind of mixing water and baking soda I

249
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,890
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might work why you ask I</font>

250
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,460
don't know it says to like cover it all

251
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,710
completely I feel like I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

252
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a mess cover it plastic wrap oh</font>

so I'm car together one with bleach and

257
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,390
see which one works better if you like

258
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,460
Bill Nye arena and we will see this in

259
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,670
24 hours seems too simple and too easy I

260
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,590

and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one works this isn't me</font>

267
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,940
