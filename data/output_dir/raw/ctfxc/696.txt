I turn a certain way it hurts so bad and

15
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,869
I've been like trying to rub it out

16
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:36,110

17
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,460

00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,700
traffic that is just like that every

<font color="#E5E5E5">anything of that sort you are constantly</font>

57
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,519

73
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,660
a lot hotter out here than I expected

74
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's a nice change of pace not all</font>

75
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,410
machine so I like it

76
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,289

entire Beach just because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> got two</font>

78

veal

81
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to kind of walk over to the</font>

82
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,040
touristy area where the liberty bill

83
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,680
things like that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a super tourist</font>

84
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,750
today I always loved how old

85
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,970
philadelphia looked just because out old

86
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,130
it actually is every time I'm here I

87
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,500
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that I'm like Nicolas Cage</font>

88
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,540
I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Benjamin Franklin's like</font>

89
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,240
optical glasses I was test with that

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,600
movie sometimes I tend to forget like

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,430
how beautiful it is around here and can

92
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,900
I kind of take advantage of the fact i

93
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,000
live in this type of area I don't come

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the beach as much as I used to thanks</font>

95
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,660
three something that was like quite a

96
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,260
ritual in my life is I would go to work

97
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,120
dude whatever I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do and then i</font>

98
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,620
would meet my friends I beach didn't

99
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,600
wonder what time of the day it was even

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,790
for this early morning sometimes I would

101
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,260
go really early and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> running and then</font>

102
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">at night you know I'd even go the Sun</font>

103
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">would set because it's just so beautiful</font>

104
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,580
and it's kind of nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> think being out</font>

105
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,320
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> honestly I haven't been</font>

106
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,780
out this way in so long except to take

107
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,310
the dogs to the dog beach so it's nice

108
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,570
to cut like be out here when the

109
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,000
weather's really beautiful and kind of

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,770
remind myself of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I have around</font>

111
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,870
me and that I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure I take</font>

112
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,250
full advantage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this here I'm</font>

113
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to continue my run I have like a</font>

114
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,530
mile back that I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take so I need</font>

115
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,720
to get going cuz the park closes very

116
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,540
soon you want to go through cities like

117
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,150
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Boston or anything like that I</font>

118
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,760
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of like imagine or</font>

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,640
trying to picture myself back what it

120
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,010
looked like maybe like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1700s</font>

121
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,270
eighteen hundreds back when the first

122
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">was developed you know before they had</font>

123
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,840
skyscrapers and things like that when it

124
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,300
was just you know horse and buggy you

125
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,210
know just scrape everything off and try

126
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,800
to imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's kind of like what i</font>

127
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,650
try to do

128
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,750
gonna think because it's me it's amazing

129
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,810
how these buildings were built back then

130
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,790
with very little you know like

131
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,070
scientific structure or scientific ideas

132
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,539
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say like now we</font>

133
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,430
have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this crazy computer stuff or</font>

134
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,810
were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build all this giant like</font>

135
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,699
skyscrapers but just some of these

136
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,039
things like he's building<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's</font>

137
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,210
called cobblestone roads

138
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:01,449
are the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoying roads ever to</font>

139
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,019
strive on

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,400
pretty cool though example right now all

141
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,920
these buildings originally it was just

142
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,190
discussed off this was a giant courtyard

143
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,900
like what it would look like let<font color="#CCCCCC"> alone</font>

144
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,360
smell like here's something interesting

145
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,980
in all the years they've come to

146
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,350
Philadelphia I did not know once that

147
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">this was the original or not the</font>

148
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,830
original the third presidential house I

149
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,270
just thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

150
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,190
design which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

151
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,860
mansion<font color="#CCCCCC"> do years I've been here I've</font>

152
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,049
never once you learn something new every

153
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,890
place you go they had a lot of flat

154
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,919
screen TVs back then I managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

155
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,440
persuade them to let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> in even though</font>

156
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,900
they're technically closing negative 1

157
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,090
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so we're gonna check</font>

158
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything out</font>

159
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,769
