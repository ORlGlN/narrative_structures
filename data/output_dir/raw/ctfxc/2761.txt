00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times that we have to like</font>

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
travel but luckily we don't have to do

78
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,690
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think Marley</font>

79
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,670
would probably revolt she<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's a funny</font>

80
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,370
story when Marley was little I I used to

81
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,320
cater because you know what why would

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,850
you gauge murali she's a perfectly

83
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,890
innocent dog no<font color="#E5E5E5"> she used to destroy</font>

84
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,840
everything right and so what I usually

85
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,880
do is I leave like a blanket you know

86
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,950
her toys she pushed one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the blankets</font>

87
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,530
under the bar then pulled it through the

88
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,390
other end with her teeth and kept doing

89
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,340
that and basically wrapping around and

90
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,110
then what she did I'm not kidding<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

91
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,690
swear there's actually footage oh there

92
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,600
was footage before my computer crash but

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,100
then what she would do is she would pull

94
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,940
on that that that towel or blanket and

95
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,970
she managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull the the crate so</font>

96
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,180
hard that the crate collapsed and she

97
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,950
basically became Houdini that's why I

98
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,020
call her Houdini sometimes cuz she gets

99
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,580
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the craziest things but she</font>

100
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally broke out of a metal cage by</font>

101
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,890
wrapping a blanket<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the bars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

102
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right the right hinges and yanking</font>

103
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,480
what did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do Zoe I don't know just</font>

104
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,820
ate through an entire wall she actually

105
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,190
ate through drywall and in an apartment

106
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:53,560

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,200
same thing which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different word and</font>
