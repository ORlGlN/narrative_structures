yesterday I flew to<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City from</font>

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds stupid when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really break</font>

200
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,190
it down to that power<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

201
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,680
travel that fast like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross the world in</font>

202
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,630
a matter of hours this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally random</font>

203
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,220
I know I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thinking about</font>

204
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,230
because i was so tired<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I was</font>

205
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,760
complaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> about to myself because I</font>

206
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,470
was so tired<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I realized I</font>

207
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,360
should shut up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just traveled</font>

208
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,010
across the country in a matter of hours

209
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,770
stop complaining I feel like this is a

210
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,750
cherub I can just sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk and</font>

211
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a conversation I've never actually</font>

212
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,400
played on a television show never

213
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,320
thought I'd actually do that let alone a

214
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,630
live television show kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crazy when</font>

215
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,910
you think about what you thought of as a

216
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,970
kid what you wanted to do and then what

217
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,680
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in life for</font>

218
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,110
example I wanted to actually run this by

219
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,560
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> this arm is representative</font>

220
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,120
everything I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do as a kid you</font>

221
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,250
know wanted to be an astronaut you know

222
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,870
spaceman that's why I'm a spaceman

223
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,970
around here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this arm I was thinking</font>

224
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,000
of making this a sleeve of everything

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,430
that I am I currently am<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I make</font>

226
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,470
things on the internet Wi-Fi you know

227
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm in a band all that stuff I don't</font>

228
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,160
know it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thinking that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

229
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,190
kind of a cool idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> themed tattoo</font>

230
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,080
so like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to be as a kid</font>

231
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,960
what I ended up being as an adult I know

232
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,340
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds cheesy and I know a lot of</font>

233
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,750
people say to you and I know you

234
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably hear from these vlogs a lot I</font>

235
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">honestly we believe if you wanted</font>

236
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,250
something truly bad enough and you work

237
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,380
hard enough you will get what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

238
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you can be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dragon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

239
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,470
the whole thing be a dragon

240
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why I had this thing on my arm</font>

241
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,190
and I think that's completely true and I

242
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,710
i hope if anything these vlogs are kind

243
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,260
of a living proof of that but in all

244
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,510
