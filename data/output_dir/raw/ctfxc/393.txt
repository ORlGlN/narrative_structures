00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,489
huge and it used to use to sync all DV

22
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,320
tapes which were ridiculous they use

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,370

shot a vlog one day on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing the</font>

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,869
only thing that would actually suck it

30
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,850
that's on DV tapes importing it's like

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">drag drop likely on SD card so literally</font>

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,869
if I shot an hour's worth of vlog it

33
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,400
would take one hour to import I actually

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,840
don't think I could even import this

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,479
nothing has firewire 400<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more so i</font>

cluttered we got the storage unit with

91
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,390
the intent of using it so we have this

98
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,739
scenario we just abandon the storage

99
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,150
