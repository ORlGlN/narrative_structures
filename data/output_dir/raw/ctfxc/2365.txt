from<font color="#CCCCCC"> English to German so if you hit</font>

40
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,000
translate right here actually focuses

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,819
back so that's it right there and if you

42
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,000
hit translate puts it over here right

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,280
but instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listen for</font>

example like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just do whatever</font>

45
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,500
and hit translate it'll say listen right

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,019
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go and undo that I hit</font>

47
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,060
translate again it'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a beatbox</font>
