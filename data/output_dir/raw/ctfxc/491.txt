that Charles is actually going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,959
maybe what we would do is obviously the

201
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,490
night that we get married we might just

202
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">stay in a hotel but it's kind of have</font>

203
