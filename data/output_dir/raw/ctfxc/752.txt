very<font color="#E5E5E5"> true I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that person that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,139
take forever to unpack after I've

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,089
traveled somewhere and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

5
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:19,529
I'll kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like live out of my</font>

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,300
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> over all the clothes that I</font>

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,250

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,820
today even though it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,320
later in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon but now I can</font>

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,239
actually start my day I feel better than

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,479

21
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,320
should say but I'm getting there

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,229
progressively this car right here hasn't

23
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,119
even started yeah as you can see still

24
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,550
in his pajamas and it's in the late

25
