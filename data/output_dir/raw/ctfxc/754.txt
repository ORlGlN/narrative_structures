were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down the tubes for some</font>

82
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,700
reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had so much snow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

83
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,419

89
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,120
some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we are getting picked</font>

90
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,099

91
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,930
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna take a red-eye home because</font>

92
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was looking at the news and it looks</font>

93
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,820
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might snow tomorrow we figured</font>

94
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,080
it might be smarter to take a red-eye

95
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,849
the way we'd actually get home in time

96
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,840
so we were just killing time right now

97
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,010
truthfully my arms and my legs are

98
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,539
