144
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,300
had a revelation about shopping and

145
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,970
girls so I was in publix and I looked

146
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,950
and I saw this girl with a pair of Tom's

147
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,500
on and they were sparkly and kind of

148
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,680
brownish<font color="#CCCCCC"> copper colored and immediately</font>

149
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,120
the first thought that came into my mind

150
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,520
is oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my gosh that's a pair of shoes</font>

151
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would perfectly match the bag that</font>

152
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,850
i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought so I feel like what</font>

153
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,890
happens is girls subconsciously by

154
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,690
accessories that they know they kind of

155
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,950
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tie together like you know</font>

156
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,060
whatever whatever girls buy a bag or you
