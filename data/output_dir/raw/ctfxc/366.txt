never thought I'd say is that a kind of

118
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,780
niche work for me not because we were

119
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">walked or we had a shell on blood but</font>

120
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,720
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is kind of a club tour we</font>

121
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,490
usually Bank on the fact that then you

122
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,520
have showers but some of them do not so

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,100
this becomes my shower is embarrassing

124
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,380
as that cheap it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do it</font>

125
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometime</font>

126
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,690
looks like a Pedro go ahead hope he

127
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,790
hasn't been enjoying these tour videos

128
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,520
because honestly really want my third

129
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,400
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I never thought</font>

130
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
I'd be able to spew my prayer list but

131
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,680
he was told me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 10 years ago I'd be</font>

132
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,960
soon my day every single day to put it

133
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,830

134
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,740
platinum-selling man taking a shower to

135
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,020
think that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going out well</font>

136
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,300
everything else just totally awesome how

137
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,520
it is probably never<font color="#CCCCCC"> believed you know I</font>

138
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,370
definitely believe tour videos I wanna

139
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,580
hear one because because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> living my</font>

140
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,560
dream I feel like it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

141
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,220
testament never giving up so let's might

142
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,620
have liked<font color="#CCCCCC"> you because I hope this house</font>

143
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,290
inspiring some people should never give

144
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,990
up and never succumb to people with

145
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,710
pressures negativity or that you can

146
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,600
accomplish<font color="#E5E5E5"> your dream no matter what</font>

147

154
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,950
tends to happen a lot I can remember

155
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,580
when my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart's getting married and</font>

156
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,280
they had a huge list of people that they

157
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,590
had invited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their wedding and a good</font>

158
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">portion of them didn't respond not</font>

159
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,290
because they're being disrespectful or

160
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,440
being rude but more because sometimes

161
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,540
you say that in my relatively early and

162
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,900
then they kind of get lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the mix</font>

163
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,120
of things so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to forget like</font>

164
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,220
for instance my older sister she's

165
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,930
actually in the wedding<font color="#E5E5E5"> is super got to</font>

166
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,330
Center and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy back with including my</font>

167
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,640
nephews and things of that sort so it

168
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,140
happens I mean to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a goal of time</font>

169
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,390
but getting a hold of everyone tends to

170
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,729
be a very tedious job and very

171
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">time-consuming so I was working on that</font>

172
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,900
today now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just getting all the final</font>

173
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,049
touches done and I'm feeling a sense of

174
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,760
calmness which is wonderful because i

175
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,270
really really need it

176
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,390

187
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,850
