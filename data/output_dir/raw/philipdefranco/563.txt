sure but I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fan fiction but I</font>

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,170
saw this post on this youtuber

19
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,969
confession tumblr and it was like I was

20
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,640
an intern<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling he was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> douchebag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was like why first of all ninety-five</font>

22
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,149
percent chance that person didn't work

23
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,730
for me and secondly it could have been

24
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,230
someone I mean granted half of the fun

25
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the internet of someone saying</font>

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,660
something anonymously and then you try

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out if it is a lie and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

28
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">like maybe it's true because you know</font>

29
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,120
we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty interns and we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,129
hired on three and it's not even based

31
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,260
on skill or personality if you when it

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,939
comes down to and this might rub some

33
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,590
people the wrong way initiative and when

34
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say like ninety-five percent chance</font>

35
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,100
that this is not true<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because I</font>

36
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,540
still have a good relationship of a lot

37
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,010
of our intern I mean a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the non</font>

38
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,530
hiring came out to money issues but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

39
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,330
really did come down to initiative

40
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,820
because here's how it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are an</font>

41
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,860
intern for me and maybe you will be

42
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,450
because in January<font color="#CCCCCC"> were bringing up some</font>

43
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,280
more interns but here's how it kind of

44
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,780
works as an intern you come in and

45
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,060
initially right off the bat you just get

46
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,850
coffee and like supplies and things and

47
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,710
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like hold the ladder for</font>

48
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone setting up lights and then you</font>

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,159
set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lights and then someone's</font>

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,960
like hey can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get b-roll on this</font>

51
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,909
shoot and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shoot at the</font>

52
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,649
main camera and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you learn to edit</font>

53
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,890
it and then you do other stuff but it

54
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,189
all comes down to not necessarily your

55
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,290
skill set that does come into it but

56
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,909
it's about initiative<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll get two</font>

57
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,380
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories the first story this</font>

58
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,570
guy Mitch very cool in turn came from

59
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,479
Canada came down very awesome guy first

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,939
and second day he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like hey how about</font>

61
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,100
I fix the audio of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your show I didn't</font>

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,160
ask him he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and showed me</font>

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,008
this very cool thing that he could do

64
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,510
and they've also been people like Mitch

65
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:12,870
did

66
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,400
have that necessary skill set but were

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,799
like hey can I do this and they usually

68
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">did that in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1st to 4th</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week but we</font>

69
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,299
have also had people that very nice

70
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,120
people never asked the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gist it's so</font>

71
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,670
simple and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of almost don't</font>

72
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,690
want to say it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like i'm</font>

73
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,909
giving away for future interns but what

74
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:33,629
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do Oh magical words and so that's</font>

75
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,769
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way I could thank</font>

76
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,390
someone's like he's a douche bag because

77
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,220
I didn't hire someone because as far as

78
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,010
like personality<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a very nice person</font>

79
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,750
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of kick it up a notch or videos</font>

80
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,299
but I feel it was pretty nice guy like

81
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,129
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I've gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into an argument</font>

82
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,200
with like an intern was they were like

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">David Tennant sucks and I was like not</font>

84
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,010
my house don't you dare say nothing

85
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,859
about tenant double negatives are loud

86
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,390
now the main thing that I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

87
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">across with this was it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really is it's</font>

88
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,739
true whether for this interning thing or

89
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,799
just anything in life and that is if you

90
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">want something speak up because if you</font>

91
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,269
don't you most likely won't get it in

92
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,069
that really it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a variation</font>

93
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,989
of that Woody Allen phrase half the

94
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">battle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is showing up I probably fucked</font>
