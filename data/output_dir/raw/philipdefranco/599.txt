figuring out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next project 30 is</font>

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,830

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do from time to time which is uh</font>

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,220

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,680
asking a question about me<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your</font>

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,279

which is always fun because always

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,579
really interesting so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I wanted</font>

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start this off was it you answer the</font>

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,780
last question I got last time we were

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,570
answering questions or yeah which was my

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,910
question to you is why is it

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,120
inappropriate to for girls only to wear

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,360
their bra and panties outdoors instead

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,500
of wearing just a bikini outside because

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,670
ninety percent of the time bra and

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,840
panties cover up more than a bikini does

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,470
so I mean why do people frown upon just

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bra and panties whenever it's just</font>

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,659
fine to wear a painting outside I hope

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,299
you get back to this bye<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,400
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question i have this conversation</font>

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> many pointless conversations but</font>

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,770
the main difference between bra and

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,830
panties swimwear is the material if you

32
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,540
go into the water<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a bra and panties</font>

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,600
the material isn't a friend the hub of

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">water they don't they don't go together</font>

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,420
like on dates or anything and so you

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,520
essentially become naked swimwear you're

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,490
good as far as like what they do yeah

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,110
they essentially cover the same areas

39
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,020
depending on the brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can lift</font>

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,340
separate push<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh the bottoms can be</font>

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,280
faust astok boyshort ish all essentially

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same but what you're talking about</font>

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,649
is the shame I feel so shamed I can't

44
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,060
believe you saw me my problem panties

45
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,409
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna wear a bikini later aah</font>

46
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,750
yeah there's really not a big difference

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,299
except in name and it just feels

48
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,670
different I think for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ladies now</font>

49
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,878
mean i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not a an enemy of skin</font>

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,420
i see many a busty lady in la running

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,970
our

52
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,700
staying fit and really I mean they're

53
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">just wearing a sports bra and nothing</font>

54
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,980
else as far as a top and so they call it

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,380
a top but it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a bra it's</font>

56
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,030
just a bra that's continued the only

57
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,740
difference it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing between</font>

58
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,400
me and your areola is a one piece of

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,140
fabric that's a bra one piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fabric</font>

60
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,140
that's a bra that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a rule yeah</font>

61
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,440
essentially um you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at</font>

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,060
the same time I've gone swimming in

63
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,310
boxer shorts before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only the only</font>

64
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference there is once again you can</font>

65
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,910
you can see stuff more sorry to the

66
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,550
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that party uh</font>

67
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,910
anyways that's many difference I think

68
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">if someone catches in your bra and</font>

69
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">panties you shouldn't be shamed and that</font>

70
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,080
