32
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,270

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,600
months if there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a demand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people like what yes big fear of talking</font>

96

that's why my living is essentially made

97
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,250
by talking to myself I found<font color="#CCCCCC"> a loophole</font>

98
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,090
I can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself record it hundreds</font>

99
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,169
of thousands millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

100
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,829

107
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,330
