actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel the emotion really good</font>

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,090
story oh my god when the coolest things

58
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,619
is actually the way it's shot one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,810
biggest examples is of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big bite seen</font>

60
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,640
one of the big fight scene<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just love</font>

61
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,650
when they just they stick to one shot

62
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,450
and they just let it just let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

63
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,549
and aha blindsided I was blindsided but

64
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,049
without Sandra Bullock in a big black

65
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">man</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's less enjoyable that's weird I</font>

I'm gay I don't know I without a shadow

68
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,250
of a doubt recommend this movie because

69
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,870
it's amazing may not be in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> top 10</font>

70
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,489
movie but if you honestly see what's

71
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,380
coming and it actually happened you get

72
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,480
points you get like 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> DeFranco points</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,440

allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get thai girls to massage</font>

118
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,329
cinematography was really good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it</font>

119
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,340
was really interesting to watch visually

120
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,340
but storyline wise and acting wise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

121
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,349
just didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really buy it if I was</font>

127
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,789
everything you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it I must</font>

128
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,220
see why the heck do they get John Wayne

129
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,650
to do voiceover I don't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds</font>

130
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,240
like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> old country boy doing this man's</font>

131
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">marriage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by far the best part of the</font>

132
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,320
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie is that fight scene where it</font>

133
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,030
becomes like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a side-scroller video game</font>

134
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,800
and he just beats the shit out of

love these characters I love the

137
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,090
antagonist<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the protagonist I love</font>

138
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,949
hard I give it a thumbs up I'd recommend

139
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,570
watching it twice because you see the

140
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,220
