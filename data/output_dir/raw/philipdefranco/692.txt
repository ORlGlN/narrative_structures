that I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple accordion sucks</font>

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,780

73
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,979
it's different for me because I'm just

74
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,599
I'm just bitter against the Cowboys for

75
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,400
sucking so bad you got a while tony was

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,020
a tony was just throwing a hissy fit

77
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,090
he's like no we can't fit four people in

78
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,680
the car if we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting bicycles and I</font>

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,430
was like Tony you can you can use the

80
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,999
bicycles what is a bicycle part to put

81
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,279
in your car and then drive it around all

82
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,560
the time right that's what you do but

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,270
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get bicycles because um I</font>

84
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,789
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should have</font>

85
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:07,590
one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would make me less me I</font>

86
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,789
think that's a good we could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

87
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">it on camera let's let's talk about this</font>

88
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,449
personal situation no so okay so so so

89
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,580
Maddie's parents have a have come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to LA</font>

they're doing it in conjunction with

95
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:37,029
some parts of documentary filmmaking so

96
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:39,699

97
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,979

just gotta recharge and we so yes we got

121
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,610
the bicycles we wrote them back to the

122
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,159
studio very nice it is magical I love

123
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">riding a bicycle though because um I</font>

124
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,610
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm always like sheltered from</font>

125
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,479
the world's I'm either in like a

126
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,520
building or I'm in a car that's covered

127
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,249
that's going to another building or you

128
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:10,770
know just you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not ever out in</font>

129
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,169
nature and riding a bike is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

130
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,120
because it just reminds you like I'm

131
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,969
being a kid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just like one</font>

132
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,520
with the world the poet sounds weird but

133
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,439
it's nice the reason we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

134
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,449
the bikes<font color="#E5E5E5"> though is 1 i've been wanting</font>

135
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,539
to have a bike to ride back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forth</font>

136
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,419
from work because it's within<font color="#CCCCCC"> five miles</font>

137
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,849
for a very long time and then the only

138
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in my car now is because i</font>

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,050
can't take the bicycle to my house in

140
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,379
this car because it's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> small and so</font>

141
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,729
i'll probably have to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like the</font>

142
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,469
weekend someone will drive me to the

143
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">office i'll drive or ride the bike back</font>

144
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,060
and the reason David needed one is

145
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,250
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bike is his main source</font>

146
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,360
transportation i don't know if it's

147
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,099
because he's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a health nut or what</font>

148
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:53,900
but

149
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,240
but his was stolen about a month and a

150
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,500
half ago from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gym that he was</font>

151
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,889
working at and he's literally been like

152
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,840
walking or like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a ride so I was</font>

153
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">like dude you can't do that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't do</font>

154
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,880
that we have a bike so we got a bicycle

155
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,830
and that was that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of that</font>

156
