00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,079
and with that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scary thought</font>

2
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:02,490
already in your head let's move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,080
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> final story of the day and that is</font>

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,270
sista sista is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber intelligence</font>

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">sharing and protection act or as many</font>

6
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,650
people have called it the new sofa after

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the anti SOPA protests the just</font>

8
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,790
general outrage it sent many people back

9
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,109
to the drawing board it seems like

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back with sista Congress</font>

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,890
says this<font color="#CCCCCC"> act would provide for the</font>

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,420
sharing of certain cyber threat

13
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,920
intelligence and cyber threat

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,420
information between the intelligence

community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security entities</font>

16
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,859
and for other purposes if that felt like

17
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,359
a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> words that really didn't</font>

18
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,579
describe anything yeah I got that

19
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,050
feeling too because I want you guys to

20
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a genuine opinion on this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

21
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,129
just like let's burn it with fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

22
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">explain both sides for you this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

23
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,460
the supporters of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Act say it will do</font>

24
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,200
that it will help us companies defend

25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
themselves from advanced cyber threats

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,070
without imposing any new federal

27
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,140
regulations or unfunded private sector

28
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,969
mandate it will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> create new private</font>

hackers are trying to steal every day

representative represent out<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

35
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,489
immediate changes to American cyber

36
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,260
security policy I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> our country</font>

37
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,519
will continue to be at risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

38
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,990
catastrophic attack to our nation's

39
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,460
vital networks networks of power our

homes provide clean water or maintain

41

the other critical services we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

42
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">day also it seems like many private</font>

43
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,840
companies including like AT&T and

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,430
Verizon they like the bill because it

45
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">removes some of the regulations that</font>

46
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,159
prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> them from sharing cyber threat</font>

47
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,540
information so the supporters are saying

48
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,220
this bill will protect people from cyber

49
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,630
attacks or two super dumb it down for

50
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,520
you the supporters of sea spa are saying

51
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,320
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> act will protect people from</font>

52
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,390
like what happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie live</font>

53
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,430
free or die hard except for the part of

54
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,630
having Justin long as your sidekick

55
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,220
which would be awesome and then the

56
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that are against it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are kind of</font>

57
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying a lot of the same things as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sopa</font>

58
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,380
the bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a very broad almost</font>

59
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,960
unlimited definition of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

60
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,119
can be shared and when sharing that just

61
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,799
unlimited information with the

62
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,149
government they don't have to worry

63
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,070
about privacy or laws then saying the

64
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,509
bill is likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lead to the expansion</font>

65
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,799
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government's role in monitoring</font>

66
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,720
of private communications as a result of

67
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,009
the sharing others adding that this will

68
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,329
most likely lead to the government's

69
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,549
role expanding as far as monitoring

70
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,320
people also that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity will</font>

71
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,210
probably move from the civilian sector

72
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,250
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> military sector because of the</font>

73
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,979
broad vague verbiage in this bill once

74
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,538
that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is shared from like</font>

75
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,520
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet provider to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the government</font>

76
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,240
you can essentially be used for any /

77
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,380
press whatsoever so what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font>

78
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,330
are worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is privacy and finally</font>

79
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,830
once that information is shared with the

80
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,240
government what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do with it</font>

81
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,350
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing in the bill and I'll</font>

82
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,910
link so the bill so you can actually

83
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,830
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that clearly defines that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

84
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,030
what I would say is read it for yourself

85
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,400
see if you see those same problems the

86
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,510
real thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna bother me with</font>

87
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the arguments gonna go into all</font>

88
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,900
the wrong places the people that support

89
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,040
system are gonna say to the people

90
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,080
opposed to it what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want us to be</font>

91
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,880
cyber attack we're doing this to protect

92
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,500
ourselves and the people against that

93
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's a great</font>

94
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,920
idea how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you don't keep it so</font>

95
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,570
broad and vague so that you can actually

96
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,400
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know tell what the hell this</font>

97
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,930
bill is supposed to do is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill</font>

98
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">about protecting people's identities</font>

99
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,590
government information or you just don't

100
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,970
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to torrent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Happy Madison</font>

101
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore and you want those internet</font>

102
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,090
service providers to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> away all their</font>

103
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,740
clients information that's gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,970
question the day today<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys I'm gonna</font>

105
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,410
include all the resources down below

106
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,790
like I always do but what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

107
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,110
about sea spa you think it's something

108
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">we legitimately need to protect</font>

109
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,560
ourselves from cyber threats or do you

110
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,940
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a ball of craziness that</font>

111
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,290
Congress is trying to put through right

112
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,390
now to supersede all online privacy

113
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,890
protections I know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are of that</font>

114
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,750
mindset as well there is a petition<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

115
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,850
below same thing as soap show your

116
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,040
support if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are or being against it</font>

117
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,990
and stuff at the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> least I do think</font>

118
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,310
that you should read up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and inform</font>

119
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,350
society is a dangerous society and I

120
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,480
want you to be a dangerous one<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non</font>

121
00:03:25,480 --> 00:00:00,000
blow stuff up you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of way</font>
