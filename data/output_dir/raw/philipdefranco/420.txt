00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,980
great that he met Christine<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

48
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,630
was pretty sure if he was by himself

49
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,880
he'd eventually like insert way that he

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,710

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,630
that happens all the time is that

54
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,120
there's usually like one partner that's

55
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,500
a part of this relationship that gets

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
left out in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the talking I feel</font>

57
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,420
do you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the law of attraction</font>

58
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone ma'am do you need help I feel</font>

like you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking that question under</font>

60
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,780
duress um law of attraction my answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

61
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,209
this is yes and no no in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense that</font>

62
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,879
if you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vision board and you put</font>

63
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,760
up a Mercedes like it's not more likely

64
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,920
that you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Mercedes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

65
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,900
yes in the sense of if I have a goal and

66
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,790
I have positive thoughts towards it and

67
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,920
I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that energy into something in a</font>

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,470
positive way like through actions you

69
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,549
believe it's more likely that i'm going

70
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,230
to accomplish that goal or attract

71
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,330
people that have that positive outlook

72
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,440
as well if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna lose</font>

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,299

coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to whatever the hell because most</font>

77
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,400
likely it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to affect the way that</font>

78
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,079
you do things and your effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

1996 periwinkle geo prizm that I loved

119
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,140
and drove into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground it was the</font>

120

<font color="#CCCCCC">first expensive big purchase I ever made</font>

121
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,330
and I'm a big believer in kids needing

122
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,700
to purchase their own first car have you

123
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,800
considered having tray as a baby bottle

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,620
not really i think the whole baby model

125
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,570
deal it's more for the parents and it

126
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,640
creates a<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird thing i'm also really</font>

127
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,590
odd about<font color="#CCCCCC"> trey i post a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of vines</font>

129
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,790
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have conversations internally</font>

where i'm like i have this video I'm not

131
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,730

sponsored video something very odd to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

133
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,660
like just straight up making money

134
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,520
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of him I have posted video is</font>

135
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,810

I'd be open to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is if like the cut</font>

that would normally go to the company

140
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,419
would go into like his college fund but

141
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,470
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think about all the</font>
