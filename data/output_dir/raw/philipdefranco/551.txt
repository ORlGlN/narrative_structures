00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,690
answering a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions but</font>

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,069
rather than asking you hey what

6
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,719
questions you want me to ask and then

7
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through the millions not millions</font>

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,110

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,940
