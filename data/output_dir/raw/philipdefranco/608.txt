00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,140
that ties most sexy women together is

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,860
confidence because a woman with

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,920
confidence talks walks and fucks with

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,840
confidence and that's sexy it is

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">100-percent sexy what I mean is just</font>

25
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,000
