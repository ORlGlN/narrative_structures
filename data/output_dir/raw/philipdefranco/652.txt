recommends but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to open up the</font>

page which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the channel page for this</font>

47
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,680
account this isn't the main show if

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,540
you're confused and you guys will

49
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,149
essentially name a movie that's possibly

50
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,840
in the Netflix queue or on netflix and

51
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,759
and then you guys can up-and-down vote

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,500
stuff and then if it gets enough like

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,290
yeah watch it then I'll watch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

54
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,729
will do it a week at a time so we'll do

55
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,430
