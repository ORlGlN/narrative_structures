00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sony rather than rambling on for 18</font>

62
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,370
notes which i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> most definitely do</font>

63
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,160

sidebar<font color="#CCCCCC"> totally post a video about who</font>

69
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:10,050
he is where he comes from and I think it

70
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,449

71
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,520
the first time we met my best friend

72
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,909

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,910
