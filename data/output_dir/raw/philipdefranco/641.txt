of course star samuel l jackson

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,629
christina ricci and oddly enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> justin</font>

29
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:04,680

bringing me a sandwich because she's

32
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,750
awesome so this movie is ultimately

33
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,310
about friendships and what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,439
overcome but so samuel l jackson is a

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,729
black men in the south which means of

36
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's either a pimp a religious</font>

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,019
that's him that's the main thing I got

87
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,639
out of this movie because he's like I'm

88
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,950

until she realizes like oh I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect</font>

92
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,650
myself and I can overcome this and then

93
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,120
Justin Timberlake comes back because he

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,949
is an anxiety disorder so they they

95
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,019

96
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,699
start shaking when they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone there</font>

97
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,299

102
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,709
down the end of the movie the end of the

103
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,510
movie Christina Ricci and Justin

104
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,459

105
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,079
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fix a fucked up situation you</font>

106

107
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,060

108
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,709
is literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> Justin Timberlake having</font>

109
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,290
having an anxiety attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christina Ricci</font>

111
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,909
comes down and she hugged Justin

112
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,979
Timberlake and you're like okay so

113
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">people can overcome problems kind of as</font>

114
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,009
long as they have a good support system

115
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:13,919
or they're just gonna fail eventually

116
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,709
