<font color="#CCCCCC">its country i made a video response and</font>

47
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,550
I hugged the camera and I was like it's

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it gets better or not all three</font>

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,900
people aren't like terrible people a lot

50
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things that we do we kind of fell</font>

51
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,890
into having like in the fields marketing

52
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,570
degrees one of the ways you've obviously

53
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,270
video response to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it youtuber not even</font>

54
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,430
tweeted eating at Twitter back once sold

55
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,080
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned the video responses that</font>

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,330
kinda doubt a small subscriber base like

57
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,690
a thousand

58
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,630
kind of good back then and and so there

59
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,370
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one day I think was rush limbaugh</font>

60
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,070
went ahead at he said in his radio show

61
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael J Fox was faking his</font>

62
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,980
disease and I was like you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

63
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:19,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> am I reply because that's what I</font>

64
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,540
used to pursue i made a video kinda fell

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,920
into what i was going to do for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

66
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,110
three or four years i stumbled ass

67
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,370
backwards out of it because I was like

68
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Allah want to be an actor for like six</font>

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,800
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I realized I was terrible but</font>

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,000
instead of just getting the two thousand

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,920
years to my subscribers I almost have

72
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">done sixty thousand views and I was like</font>

73
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,180
how did this happen I look back and I

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize the SEO search engine</font>

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,990
optimization market because you can to

76
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,480
become one of the largest search engines

77
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,880
like I google half the time I youtube it

78
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,740
like if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn how to make out I</font>

79
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,240
used to it because I don't like reading

80
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,690
every guy and what I realized was a lot

81
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,790
of it was about tagging and titling

82
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,040
properly I mean if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

83
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool like a mystery guitar man</font>

84
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,459
whose fantastic you did a video where he

85
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,800
meet things disappear and used ones

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,050
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harry Potter was coming out</font>

87
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,730
make sense to be like Harry Potter type

88
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,920
one thing I'm a jig and they were like I

89
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,660
love Harry Potter one thing what you're

90
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,320
going to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what happens like</font>

91
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,209
he would serve to see what I was talking

92
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,940
about not specifically for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but to see</font>

93
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,460
the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> clip and because it was tagged</font>

94
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,400
and titled properly they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw</font>

95
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,220
minded or eventually

96
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,560
it was like the most viewed out of the

97
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,330
surgeon so that's an accountant one of

98
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,980
the reasons we've been able to survive

99
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,820
as long as you have is really good

100
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,080
tagging and titling and<font color="#CCCCCC"> boom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mills watch</font>

101
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,100
my show people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> live but then I kind</font>

102
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,900
of dropped off of youtube for a while

103
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,700
cuz those doing skits they're terrible

104
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,890
it was stupid things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really wasn't</font>

105
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,930
into it that is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found this thing</font>

106
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,130
that inspired myself the blog brothers

107
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,320
wheezy waiter and I was at his community

108
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,890

113
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,370
and how awesome communities could be

114
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,440
because I did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same called the show</font>

115

117
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,500

118
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if Lindsay Lohan died up for</font>

119
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,250
mean girls we would never have that fat

120
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,230
Lindsay Lohan we have but those fond

121
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,000
memories but like who is this just this

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,100
awesome community that would send in

123
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,440
videos and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy went around the</font>

124

country riding bicycles only stopping at

125
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,880
places of you would watch the show as

<font color="#E5E5E5">well and I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like taken by it he</font>

talked about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's still</font>

128
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,540
relevant today and that some waves kind

129
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,610
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking about our industry and</font>

130
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,470
how a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies and a lot of</font>

131
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,140
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will say like to get cheesy</font>

132
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,540
popular in on the internet or on youtube

133
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,740
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you have to go through us</font>

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,020
and they play in boulder ship other

135
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,700

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,710
all time just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like riding that way then</font>

137
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,110
a whole new video a bit and eventually

138
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it sure and if you are man enough that</font>

139
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,490
you think you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again you just</font>

140
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,729
go right back out and and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> again and</font>

141
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,070
when he was sick shit every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

142
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,430
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it was amazing these gems</font>

143
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,030
eventually entered and I like this is a

144
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,910
void in my life this it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

145
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,890
melodramatic but I was was really sad

146
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,009
because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I would do</font>

147
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,289
every day it was my hobby I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

148
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,330
next two<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks I completely ripped off</font>

149
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,969
his show on YouTube and I was like it's

150
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:54,180
the news showed filled Franco and I

151
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,589
wasn't talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't</font>

152
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,169
make sense and people kind of like dance

153
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,499
by them listen it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> good really and</font>

154
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,449
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I realized like the reason</font>

155
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,759
that you were so passionate and so into

156
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,770
it was because they was such an

157
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,629
interesting guy and he's so genuine and

158
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,699
he just spoke his mind like<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever was</font>

159
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,800
in his<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind as crazy as it was you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

160
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,080
doesn't throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at the computer and it</font>

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,249

172
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,270
long term but and so once I had the show

180
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:16,379
