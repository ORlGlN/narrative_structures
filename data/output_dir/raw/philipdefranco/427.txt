37
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,080
pretty terrible but Bennett once I work

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,180
on myself and I figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what's inside</font>

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,180
here maybe a mug full of jelly beans on

40
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,160
tumblr asked have you ever read a book

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,780
that changed your life I would say the

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,550
closest thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to that would be a</font>

43
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,100
4-hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> workweek by Tim Ferriss haven't</font>

been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of his ideals of</font>

45
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,220
actually getting to a point where I only

46
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,650
work four hours a week because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legal</font>

47
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,230
obligations and my job is much different

48
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,090
than what he talks about for people that

49
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,770
read that book but a point that comes

50
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,570
across is there's no reason you have to

51
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,330
be the best you don't have to ace every

52
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,610
test as long as you're rocking an 85

53
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,950
doing 95 that's fine like if I want to

54
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a new skill or</font>

55
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,700
something I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the best in</font>

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world any of the tools and the</font>

57
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,390
tricks become like someone that's say

58
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,459
the 95th percentile because the 95th

59
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,860
percentile and up the advantages over

60
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,420
people that are like really really low

61
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,180
incremental small and significant to the

62
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,739

130
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,319

comfortable in their own skin but if

177
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,729
it's also that they're super unhealthy

178

privilege cisgender male etc do you

190

think any of them have valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> points so</font>

191
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,289
we as the nation can learn from Oh white

192
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,300
male privilege the thing that I love

193
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,949
seeing in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube comments and on</font>

194
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,300
tumblr<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the thing that annoys me</font>

195
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,340
is that no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> who I support what</font>

196

hey I'm still just a 28 year old white

198
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,220
guy in too many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means I can</font>

199
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,560
have valid input on many topics I think

200
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,390
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in large part due to if you've</font>

201
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,380
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a certain</font>

202
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,820
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time you think that empathy is</font>

203
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,380
dead that people are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> capable of</font>

204
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,820
putting themselves in someone else's

205
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,620
shoes for a moment as far as the valid

206
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,630
points that we could take away some of

207
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,330
the the more sensible people that don't

208
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">just try and crucify me because I say</font>

209
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,560
one word because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was referenced in</font>

210
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,390
a story is the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that I try to</font>

211
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,070
preach understand where people are

and happy as long as they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not hurting</font>

214
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,020
other people it also believe there's a

215
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,790
lot of extremism and hypocrisy when you

216
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,350
start talking about these<font color="#E5E5E5"> subjects still</font>

217
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,580
one of my favorites is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I someone sent me</font>

218
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,440
a four-page email saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was a</font>

219
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,270
bad person because I said I was having a

220
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,030
son<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the baby in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

221
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,280
fiancé's stomach had a penis and maybe

222
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,380
he won't recognize himself as my son but

223
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,880
maybe my daughter which is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like wow</font>

224
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day what I</font>

225
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,780
understand is that the world is filled

226
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,760
with a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of angry people that have</font>

227
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,920
possibly been hurt maybe they're they're

228
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,020
scared they're they just they they have

229
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,490
a lot of emotions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it be about</font>

230
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,810
this or anything else in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world I</font>

231
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,160
kind of just shake my head and keep
