comfortable thing in the world and

69
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,630
that's less personal for me and more

70
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,069
personal like he has a

71
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,599
he loves any things I would love it to

72

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lindsay she's always got my back</font>

74
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,540
since baby tre came out I saw a huge

75
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,329
motherly nurturing sort of person like

your favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about being a father</font>

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,139

83
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,989
get from little things like Trey crying

84
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,000
like this morning at<font color="#CCCCCC"> four forty in the</font>
