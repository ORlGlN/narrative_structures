24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,640
people on the web so they didn't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
that the end came to abruptly i thought

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,909
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good movie and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was also</font>

27
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazed by the fact that it really did</font>

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,920
only cost 1.8 million dollars that's

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,240
amazing it did do a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things right</font>

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see the you know the lack of</font>

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost here and there but I thought it was</font>

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">a great movie the main character was</font>

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,850
awesome but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it got me thinking about God</font>

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,590
and demons and it kind of goes with

35
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,439
Stephen Hawking today where everyone's

36
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,610
been talking about his new book and

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,060
about how he said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the universe in</font>

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,240
no way needed God to create it that that

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,729
kind of stuff happens God is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not part of</font>

40
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that equation and you know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,820
people when talking about it'll our God

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,210
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist is this possibility and</font>

43

45
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,810
some weird you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had some weird</font>

46
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,540
things with religion i was i was raised

47
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">Catholic I went to a Catholic school you</font>

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,270
don't know it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was interesting I</font>

51

52
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,950
church that was fun but you know nuns

53
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,700
really mean the priests I distinctly

54
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember a priest saying i'm looking</font>

55

forward to dying so I can be with my

56
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,200
family and I was like that's a really

57
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,370
weird thing to say to an eight-year-old

58
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,860
child and then I think actually it

59
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,930
wasn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> Catholicism that that</font>

60
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,260
terrified me about religion my mom had

61
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to New York it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a family thing</font>

62
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,069
and she left me with this family that

63
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,030

64
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,239

68
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,380

00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,500
Baptist you need to convert to being

75
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,130
Baptist or you will go to hell forever

76
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,410
and like then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> like literally tried</font>

77
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,019
to convert me behind my family's back

78
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,640

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,090
parents left me or my mom left me with

83
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,880
the craziest fucking family on the

84
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,880
planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so every time I see a horror</font>

85
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,310
movie where it's just like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids</font>

86
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,780
that can't get out of situation I'm like

87
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,860
oh I like I get scared but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so growing up</font>

88
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,709
I had this this weird idea about about

89
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,190
God and especially demons and you know I

90
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,650
mean these days i don't i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

91
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,799
believe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

92
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,860
the classic idea of God about one of

93
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,390
these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are like I'm spiritual</font>

94
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,730
I just know that there's this I feel

95
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,170
like there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> much bigger or</font>

96
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,250
something that we don't understand

97
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,690
whether it's you know something

98
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,739
spiritual or it's just something like

99
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,269
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like back in the day like oh</font>

100
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,640
man wouldn't it be cool if we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly</font>

101
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,339
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't hop onto people's minds</font>

102
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,418
like they were like oh there are birds

103
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,640
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like well you know maybe in the</font>

104
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,590
future will think like hey remember how

105
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,110
we used

106
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,060
think that that light was like the

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,889
fastest thing in the world and then it

108
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,360
turned out not to be and then we found

109
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,860
out about the fifth dimension and that's

110
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,930
where I were all the creepy shit that we

111
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,449
thought was and I don't know I feel like

112
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,270
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the stuff that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

113
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,379
religion or mysticism stuff like that I

114
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,550
really just things that we don't

115
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,110
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that we try and put</font>

116
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,509
labels and explanations on I don't know

117
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,180
I have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no problem with religion</font>

118
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,180

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,289
