tight budget actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending close to</font>

30
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,539
two thousand dollars for the entire trip

31
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now we're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to produce more</font>

33
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,100

scoot stars now in june thirteenth we're

35
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,869
gonna ride these scooters the max out of

36
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">29 miles per hour across the united</font>

37
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">states years ago actually when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i first</font>

38
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,950
joined<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of delving</font>

39
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,509
into different types of projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

40
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">spending different items on my finger I</font>

41
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,400
was making trying to make that viral hit

42
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,170
but then I kind of gravitated towards

43
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,400
what I've been doing most my life and

44
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,799
that's traveling so I picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

45
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,450
camera with a couple friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

46
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,610
documented<font color="#E5E5E5"> a journey where we decided to</font>

47
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,200
walk from here in Los Angeles to San

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
Diego so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we uploaded the</font>

49
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,659
videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> and film every day and kind of</font>

50
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,280
create a real-time experience

51
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,590
entertain her audience and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

52
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,570
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on another trip so we kicked</font>

53
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,330
it up a notch and we rode these like

54
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,780
dinky 49cc scooters that<font color="#CCCCCC"> max out at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 29</font>

55
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,250
miles per hour and rode them across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

56
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">United States all the while allowing via</font>

57
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,330
viewers to vote on our next destination

58
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,940
so it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of snowballed into a</font>

59
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,159
travel show<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess and that's where I</font>

60
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,690
found my niche in my comfort zone and

61
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,729
that's what I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do like to travel</font>

62
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,709
my parents immigrated from Poland and

63
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,660
when I was a child around three years

64
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,819
old we went to go visit back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

65
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,340
homeland and we traveled around all of

66
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,080
Europe Nick campervan and that sort of

67
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">sparked my interest in traveling I guess</font>

68
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,780
I didn't know at the time I was young

69
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,810
but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> although until high school is</font>

70
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,670
sort of with my philosophy of travel

71
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,890
chance fired into what it is now which

72
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">is sort of this concept of kind of</font>

73
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,519
appreciating the mode of transport that

74
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,350
you're utilizing instead of flying to a

75
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,040
destination I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of felt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe we</font>

76
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">should embrace the concept of getting to</font>

77
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,060
your destination that usually was the

78
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,560
slow route that way you can really

79
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate the road and where you</font>

80
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,819
started where you're going and where

81
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,530
you're at right now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

82
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,019
about where you go it's about going the

83
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,610
people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet and the things you see</font>

84
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,860
along the way they call it wanderlust

85
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,410
and I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious case of it</font>

86
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,190
amazing

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,819
so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i first joined youtube I didn't</font>

88
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">think anything of it but actually what</font>

89
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,250
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed me to do was broadcast the</font>

90
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,810
stupid things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making and I</font>

91
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,580
didn't think that I was gonna turn into

92
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,560
anything or just a place for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to show</font>

93
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,180
my friends and family<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I was doing a</font>

94
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,680
lot of time to really why I got a lot of

95
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,750
time on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you're crazy</font>

96
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,610
you're weird but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like these</font>

97
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,440
moments when they would feature a video

98
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,390
and it'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the front page and you</font>

99
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,790
get 100,000 views but early years they'd

100
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,769
be like 20,000 and that just kept me

101
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,750
going just kept me just hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

102
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one viral sensation and it never</font>

103
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,400
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I still had that that hope</font>

104
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,110
and dream that one day it would happen

105
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,760
but I just kept doing what I was doing

106
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,440
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found my niche I found what I</font>

107
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,790
really enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that was travel</font>

108
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,310
content so just recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube has</font>

109
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,049
created this program called the next up

110
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">competition it's like 25 youtubers and</font>

111
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,099
they provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 35 thousand dollar grant</font>

112
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,620
to help them further produce their

113
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,840
content and I was chosen recently as one

114
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,209
of the winners so now finally I could

115
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,640
tell myself all that stupid hard work

116
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,220
paid off and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font>

117
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,319
I the opportunity to keep doing what I

118
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,060
do and not have to feel so guilty about

119
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,019
wasting my time or

120
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,699
you know maybe focusing on something

121
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,280
else so<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube really really is helping</font>

122
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,250

123
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,810
knowing where you are or where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>
