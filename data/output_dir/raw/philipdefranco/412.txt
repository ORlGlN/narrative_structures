something that I'm embracing now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,010
that we're probably gonna just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

101
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,540
beaten up if you had to choose between

102
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,569

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,510
interactive art form it can take

112
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's from a book I think</font>

113

that you know we're gonna see<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of</font>

child having like a Sony Walkman like

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
the one that was in home alone just

124
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,958
listening to alvin and chipmunks like

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that question to strangers because</font>

128
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,199
I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's probably like a</font>

129
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,509
terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> icebreaker depending on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

134
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,490
they're like ah this is it drink vodka

135
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,960
soda for a while because it was the

136
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,879
healthiest version of an alcoholic

137
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,460
beverage also a taste terrible which

138
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,020
made me drink it really slow but then I

139
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,400
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to the flavor and now I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

140
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,630
can kick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back but if we're gonna go</font>

141
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">with flavor and purpose it's gonna be</font>

142
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,560
Jack and Coke Jack Daniels by itself or

143
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,419
vodka redbull cuz what's the point of

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,009
being a drunk person if you can't be a

155
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,289
knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i will choose to sleep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

156
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,539
bed rather than do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I hate</font>

157
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,310
and that kind of boils into a thing of

158
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,530
keeping myself out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of situations where I</font>

159
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a decision like that most</font>

years they were really really all about

171
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,849
each other and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> like prized himself on</font>

172
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other friends that</font>

181
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">he didn't even like himself for a while</font>

182
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,479
and I didn't know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel towards</font>

him in a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the long story is</font>

more understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in general</font>

188
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,729
because this guy showed no sign so
