1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,060
all right Phil so I want to know do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,310
think that war is necessary for the

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,490
great of greater good of humankind where

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,470
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's just pointless I feel</font>

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,510
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video response is justified</font>

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,029
for me to do it in the the bathtub here

7
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,330
because it's so easy for anyone to cast

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,510
out an opinion or belief on war is

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,970
necessary when we throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> out our opinions</font>

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,650
while we're in our bathtub well in our

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,710
lazy boys watching Fox News CNN watching

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,238
pretty much anything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing</font>

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything except actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> participating</font>

14
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:35,300
in the war itself it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,469
anyone seriously when they talk about

16
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,089
war they don't face to lose anything

17
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,159
directly like their lives from the warm

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,019
myself included you know the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

19
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:43,819
I face to lose is the carbon dioxide

20
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:45,530
spilling out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my body right now but</font>

21
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,440
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is war a</font>

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,079
necessary thing is it a necessary evil

23
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,289
that's yeah now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it used unnecessarily</font>

24
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:56,420
oh my god yes are you kidding me but I

25
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,969
would love if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can all hold hands and</font>

26
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,649
sing Kumbaya but that's not the world we

27
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,019
live in the problem is people in general

28
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:05,479
ones more human beings by nature are a

29
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,149
very aggressive species it's easier to

30
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:10,130
say things<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the United States</font>

31
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">of America because what we have has come</font>

32
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:16,100
from war land or independence more land

33
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,079
and some other stuff and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

34
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,640
you can play than world war is very

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,680
profitable part and it is as long as you

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,479
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> winning and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't decide to</font>

37
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,490
occupy the police they can just fucking

38
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,289
destroyed since we've seen how well

39
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,939
that's worked out in the past but

40
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,770
ultimately to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main question yes i do</font>

41
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,560
believe war is a necessity because some

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,409
doors do not have a key sometimes you

43
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">just got to kick that fucker in and</font>

44
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,170
there's all these specific incidents

45
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,609
that we can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about but the ultimate</font>

46
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,950
question that is is violence ever

47
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,109
necessary and I do feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it is it is</font>

48
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:47,420
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with that is with it</font>

49
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,759
being a necessity it also happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,530
getting more violence violence begets

51
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,929
more violence that's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fact when</font>

52
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,570
we're attacking bad people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we kill</font>

53
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,390
innocent people we create more bad

54
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,789
people because they think we're the bad

55
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,039
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost no one goes into a fight</font>

56
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,720
into a war thinking they're the

57
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,340
bad guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when everyone has the moral</font>

58
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,020
high ground<font color="#CCCCCC"> if no one wants to move then</font>

59
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,120
people are going to fight and it is sad

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,160
but I feel it is true i thank god Joe

61
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,050
Pesci in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Invisible Man every day</font>

62
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,460
that there are people out there willing

63
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fight for us and to do what I would</font>

64
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,600
not do don't get me wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

65

<font color="#CCCCCC">times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over but you're asking me do I</font>

places on the planet to where everyone

70
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,730
hates me even though I'm trying to

73
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,320
mentally affected in some way afterwards
