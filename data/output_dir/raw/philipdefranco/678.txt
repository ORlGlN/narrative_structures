92
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,710
weight specifically focus on body mass

93
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,900
index very not body mass sorry not that

94
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,719
body fat percentage and and I was

95
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,279
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> what could make it more fun and</font>

96
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,520
I was like makeup game you know the fear

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,520
of loss is a much bigger motivator than

98
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,370
than than gaining a reward I mean just

99
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,039
just by itself you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm not</font>

gonna die in two months if I don't work

101
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,159
out but someone that's like morbidly

102
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,990
obese or they have no other option

103
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,610
they're like well let's fucking do this

104
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,409
there's really no other option where I

105
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:29,430
die and so I was thinking who who could

106
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,460
I do this with who could I challenge and

107
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,690
I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to myself and I thought</font>

of trying to lose weight promoting

126
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,800
healthy lives to our audiences so the

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,839
loser should have to pay two thousand

128
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,880
dollars to the winners chair

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,250

that the gauntlet<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been thrown then</font>

137
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,870
we literally don't report on our wait

138
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,550
