00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,660
hello ends webs<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so I like the office</font>

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,630
it's like 720 in the morning painters

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,340
are gonna come finish the job here so

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,920
everything's kind of a mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know</font>

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,220
the walls turning white slowly and

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,039
almost all done but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> my body woke</font>

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,560
me up at four thirty in the morning I

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,009
had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time to look online and to</font>

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,010
start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start pondering and I ended up</font>

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,230
looking through religious blogs and I

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,149
always you know I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stay away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,320
religion because every opinion someone

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,250
has as as much as it's not intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">be hurtful or blah blah is always seen</font>

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,770
as like an attack on someone but it I

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,629
did end up wondering something because a

17
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,640
lot of a lot of the pose<font color="#CCCCCC"> and arguments</font>

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,329
for for why gays should not be married

19
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,930
is that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a it's a god thing</font>

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,600
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserved for religious people</font>

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,010
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> um marriage is God's design and it</font>

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,210
should it should just be a reserved for

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,740
religious people so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I started</font>

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,189
wondering why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there no rallies for</font>

25
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,210
and like I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking how to say it</font>

26
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,280
why do there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> no rallies to stop a</font>

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,520
theist from marrying each other why are

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,610
there no rallies for interfaith couples

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,369
to marry each other why is that not on

30
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,470
Fox News<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Huffington Post and CNBC</font>

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,650
not MSNBC but CNBC I don't know why is

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,200
that not there and and it's made me

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonder and so I put the question out on</font>

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter because I wanted to to see what</font>

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,009
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought and I look I did not</font>

36
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,960
choose these based on how super they

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,610
were these are probably the more

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,149
competent not hate filled ones and the

39
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,729
first one the answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my question is</font>

40
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,880
marriages from God which annoyed me

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,070
because that literally did not answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,200
question that's like I called India and

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
you were just reading from the script I

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,920
was like no no I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> recycled my</font>

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,050
modem no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you literally did</font>

46
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,869
not answer

47
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,150
my question and then so someone someone

48
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,780
finally then added<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if to atheists</font>

49
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mary it's still God's design man and</font>

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">woman it's still God's design that's the</font>

51
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,849
way God intended it and then added

52
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,069
something like everyone breathes God

53
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">created breathing no one's protesting</font>

54
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,980
breathing I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

55
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,319
second part meant but if it's God's

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,799
design that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's man and a woman why so</font>

57
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,560
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say well because a man and</font>

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,360
woman<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only two things capable of</font>

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,849
loving that's not sure that's not sure I

60
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,160
mean you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just see I get a couple</font>

61
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,410
and you go oh that's love yeah I mean so

62
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,120
then the only thing that comes to mind

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is procreation right okay procreation</font>

64
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,819
that makes sense I get procreation I was

65
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,560
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was raised Catholic so I mean that</font>

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,690
religion is like two things it's like

67
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,489
don't have sex until you're married and

68
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,700
then have sex all the time also number

69
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,760
to feel guilty<font color="#E5E5E5"> about everything else and</font>

70
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,459
so that's that's a very dumbed down

71
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,919
version of Catholicism it's so terrible

72
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,650
um and so and I so I get the procreation

73
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,389
thing and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's very Darwin of</font>

74
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:22,750
God as far as the everyone breathes but

75
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,250
no one protests breathing the only thing

76
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,340
that relates to I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be that we</font>

77
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,370
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> choice if we breathe or not</font>

78
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,430
and neither do gays as far as where they

79
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,910
stick it you know i just<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just find it</font>

80
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,940
very hard to believe the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people ah it</font>

81
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> frustrates me like people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> choose to</font>

82
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,290
be gay that's what throws me off people

83
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,569
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say people choose to be gay and</font>

84
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,750
why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you choose to be ridiculed why</font>

85
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,959
would you choose to be told every day

86
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,000
with words or without that you are a bad

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,849
thing you should not exist I don't know

88
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,109
I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how so and I</font>

89
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,609
am just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering this and I know that</font>

90
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,590
there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font>

91
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,069
form competent thoughts that don't

92
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,709
involve the words fag and blah blah ends

93
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,060
I don't know but if we can't end on any

94
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,589
note I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use your breathing</font>

95
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,160
no because homosexuality

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,170
is exactly like breathing we don't have

97
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,780
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> choice in if we breathe or not we</font>

98
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,130
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a choice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if we're</font>

99
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,590
straight or gay and no matter how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

100
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,450
or hard we try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold our breath</font>

101
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,970
eventually unless the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world smothers us</font>

102
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,160
you're going to take a breath the sooner

103
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,300
people realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the sooner</font>

104
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:45,200
everything will be fabulous I know it's

105
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna come up with people be like yeah</font>

106
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,960
it fills an atheist ur boo fills an

107
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,960
atheist I'm I don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am i I</font>

108
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,950
really don't as far as religious

109
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,570
spiritual blah blah I don't know I

110
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,910
really don't at this point I'm just I'm

111
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,830
like two steps away from becoming a

112
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,300
door-to-door atheist it's a lot like

113
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,530
jehovah witnesses except i come to your

114
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,190
door and I give you comic books a copy
