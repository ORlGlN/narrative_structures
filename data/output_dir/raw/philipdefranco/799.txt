perceived as very hateful especially on

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are huge</font>

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,199
communities where people think it's cool

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,449
to bash religion and all those beliefs

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,470

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,329
always like our religion religion

20
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,770
religion I don't know so I decided to

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a little fun and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was you know</font>

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,129
trying to go to the camera store over

23
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,660
the weekends and I send out the street I

24
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,430
was a grown man the camera store being

25
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,680
closed on Easter's as ridiculous as the

26
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,199
story and 00 some of the Christians

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,629
crawled out of their whole no<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh whoa</font>

28
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,149
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about Jesus of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

29
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,469
was referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that it's this</font>

30
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,270
religious story and we celebrate it with

31
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,890
bunnies and stuff but then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like oh</font>

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,659
wait let's let's mess with some people

33
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,850
because while i do believe in a god or a

34
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,280
higher power I don't believe in religion

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,750
but I make one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite things is</font>

36
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,390
to poke and<font color="#E5E5E5"> prod um the sum of the</font>

37
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,680
religious sheet now all religious people

38
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,030
aren't cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

39
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,049
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

40
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,990
don't believe no well yeah I my face

41
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,790
about this so you have to have fun with

42
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">them same thing when I find a hardcore</font>

43
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,119
atheist after like make the religious

44
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,220
argument cuz it's so fun and if you're

45
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,509
wondering if I'm an atheist or I'm

46
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,860
Christian or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm undecided</font>

47
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,420
which is a lot different than an

48
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,670
agnostic because as agnostics are lazy

49
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,720
mine is a tactic that I'm not going to

50
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,820
care until you know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

51
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,840
care which is of course when you go to

52
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,490
prison you kill someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you do</font>

53
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,079
something wrong you find God cuz that's

54
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">where Jesus is or God is or you know</font>

55
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,409
you're dying and then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh I</font>

56
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,210
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that route it's all</font>

57
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">part of my 70 year plan but so I go</font>

58
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,470
further I keep joking about and I keep

59
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,180
joking about it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's it's</font>

60
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing heat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full it's just these these</font>

61
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,689
pokes and prods you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

62
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,009
my Twitter although the stuff still

63
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,530
there and you get these these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

64
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">that just hate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on you doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ah and then</font>

65
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,060
he gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like hahahaha but I mean</font>

66
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,160
easter is kind of a silly thing you know

67
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean</font>

68
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,500
it's like oh and then he resurrected and

69
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,750
no one definitely touched the giant

70
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,700
boulder blocking the cave all I'm saying

71
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,280
is there was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no CSI back then</font>

72
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,750
there was none like there was they were

73
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,430
like oh well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess I guess he</font>

74
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,050
disappeared one of the things of course

75
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,460
that bothers me with religion is when

76
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,230
it's used to hold people down like when

77
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,900
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the money to go against gay</font>

78
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,640
people getting married in California was

79
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
from Mormons and I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was Joe</font>

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,060
Rogan who said it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know that he</font>

81
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,670
thinks that Mormons are so terrified of

82
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,010
the gay agenda because you know they

83
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,080
believe in a story that's crazy like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

84
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,190
have Mormons that have literally

85
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,080
converted because some kids on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

86
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">speeds knocked on their door</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

87
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,230
relax would you like to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

88
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,700
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's when he looked at the gold</font>

89
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,560
plates in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Hat and that person was</font>

90
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,660
like well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense if you could</font>

91
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,340
be talked into that if a gay person

92
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,870
walked up you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were like oh wait</font>

93
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,550
Joseph Smith got some of the stuff wrong

94
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,480
when he was looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place he</font>

95
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,010
misread it one that whole thing about

96
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,980
Indians not true and two you're supposed

97
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,540
to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your penis and another dudes but</font>

98
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,310
that's the word of the Lord<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

99
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,540
you believe those kids on the tennspeed

100
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,190
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up to you dress and nice</font>

101
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,350
clothes and those gays dress nice you'd

102
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,120
be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a right</font>

103
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,940
thing let's go do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know a lot of</font>

104
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably get the wrong idea with</font>

105
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,390
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation but I don't hate</font>

106
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,820
or try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and disrespect the people for</font>

107
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,250
believing in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain thing I love you</font>

108
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,680
either way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> your belief itself if</font>

109
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,120
it's funny to me or it doesn't make

110
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,860
sense or things don't add up I will

111
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,690
laugh at it but I'm not gonna laugh at

112
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,970
you for it because you know I understand

113
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,590
why religions there you want to know

114
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,330
that there's a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> game I'm</font>

115
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to believe one thing because i</font>

116
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,480
think it's the safe event you know it's

117
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a roulette table that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if i</font>

118
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,810
don't believe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> god and i put i put it</font>

119
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,310
all on black and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it doesn't turn out</font>

120
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,110
to be black I still lose but that lands

121
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,790
on red not betting on red eternal

122
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,620
happiness but if I put it on red<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

123
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,180
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no God then I still lose I get</font>

124
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,290
that and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

125
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,000
pessimist about it I hope there is a

126
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,740
game to win on the other hand when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

127
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,030
say that you do not believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font>

128
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,490
automatically lose something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose</font>

129
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,500
your hardcore christian audience you

130
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,640
lose the ability to ever become

131
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,240
president who's a lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot</font>

132
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,460
of it isn't is it's not like okay I need

133
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see it and feel it to believe it no</font>

134
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,720
I'm you know I know I can't touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> a star</font>

135
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,040
but I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's there and I</font>

136
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,238
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's made of what we think</font>

137
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,560
it's made of and I

138
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,200
no that we can't understand a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

139
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and I'm</font>

140
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,280
completely open to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being entirely wrong</font>

141
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,650
that is wish people kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Carlin</font>

142
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,540
said would have ideas and not beliefs

143
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,060
mainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea can change but a</font>

144
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,980
belief is so embedded and you know what

145
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you want the comments or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>
