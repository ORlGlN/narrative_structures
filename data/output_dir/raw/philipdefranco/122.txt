00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Sup you beautiful bastards I hope you're having a fantastic 4th of July

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,960
I kind of just wanted to throw out this this random video

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,700
today because I was on Twitter this morning and I was doing my my

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,540
morning thing where sometimes I say you know "what stories would you like me to talk about?"

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,660
I like to at least try and include one story

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,240
that the audience wants to hear.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,780
This morning when I tweeted it

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,640
out,

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,740
There were a lot of people saying

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,640
How about you don't work?

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,520
don't work today, why would you do that?

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,080
My response to that is well I give the entire team

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,080
the day off I I ask anyone else

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,560
if they want to come in you know you're more than welcome

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,880
we, we, can figure out if there is something

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,420
monetarily that makes sense or maybe you could get a, a day off

17
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,980
later in the week you can do any whatever you want

18
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,260
As far as me, I mean understand that I am

19
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,020
where I am today uh in part thanks to happen stance,

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,020
lucky timing, luck in

21
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,940
general the algorithm whatever the hell that is and also because

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,320
to help my chances working when other people

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,640
don't right? Doing, doing what other people

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,780
will not do, that is, that's what I do it's not like

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,780
this is a crazy

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,780
sacrifice for me it's

27
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,780
me doing a job that I love

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,780
right so it's easier there but,

29
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,780
that's really it I work when many others don't

30
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,780
I  I I don't ask of my

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,780
team anything that I have not done in the past

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,300
or would not be willing to do

33
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,800
one second

34
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I mean I still take off my end of the year stuff you know

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Christmas Vacation, things like that but it almost

36
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
feels for me for my personal

37
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
life, it, it almost makes sense to

38
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
work on July 4th if you really think about it

39
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,700
241 years ago the forefathers

40
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,800
of this country just regular people

41
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,280
regular people who are born

42
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,800
into this world, who decided to, to sign

43
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
the declaration of  independence, they

44
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,280
they separated  themselves from their past they

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
separated themselves from control

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
and, and they, they forged on

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
into a future they forged on

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
to create a world that they personally

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,760
wanted to live in, to a much smaller degree

50
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,161
a less scary degree that's

51
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:51,580
what I'm choosing to do today I

52
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,580
I am an independent creator

53
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,580
choosing to work to

54
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,580
build a future that I want to build

55
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,580
Or something like that I just kind of wanted to ramble to

56
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,580
a camera outside The Phillip DeFranco show which is going

57
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,580
up later today, that said have a fantastic 4th of

58
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,580
July unless you don't celebrate in which case

59
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,580
have a baller Tuesday, baller Tuesday's a thing

60
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,940
I apparently say now, okay

61
00:02:09,419 --> 00:00:00,000
bye bye
