course you have the Derrick's comedy

56
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,280
guys and a few comedians you might have

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,750
seen if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you watch Comedy Central</font>

58
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,550
Presents and it's funny yet but it's

59
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,110
hard to review this movie I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

60
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,490
gonna go into like what happens during

the story like it has serious stuff

62
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,330
mixed in with like what the fuck stuff

63
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,030

66
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,670
retarded and then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> second I just</font>

67
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">be laughing my ass off so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it</font>

68
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,820
kind of places<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Derek's comedy thing</font>

69
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,250
it has a theme a story that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes across</font>

70
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire movie but it's not funny the</font>

71
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,370
entire movie I mean if heels like a

72
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,990
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> skips strung together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

73
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,580
same storyline and only some of those

74
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,960
skits are really funny when they're

75
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,580
funny they're funny so should you watch

76
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,230
this movie if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't already maybe</font>

77
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,750
i'm not saying smoke marijuana<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just</font>

78
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,490
saying it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot more enjoyable</font>

79
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,670
if you were on that's terrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

80
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,040
condone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that except privately fun lover</font>

81
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,240

82
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,740
the guy who plays<font color="#CCCCCC"> the strong kid</font>

83
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,440
definitely given the weakest lines / not

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,850
the best delivery so if you're a fan of

85
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,620
Derek's comedy watch it if you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>
