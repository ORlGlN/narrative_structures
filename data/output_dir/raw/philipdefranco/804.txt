13
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,100
internet sometimes is like speaking what

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,930
I feel because most of the time it's a

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,330
bad idea like because most people have

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,670
have a filter for the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lack</font>

17
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,070
of filter and I have an admiration not

18
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,130
an admiration an addiction to talking to

19
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,680
the camera so so we go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,259
twestival is it's for charity that's the

21
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,670
main idea but at the same time it's the

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">second idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you're going to</font>

network and you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>
