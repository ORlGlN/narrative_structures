43
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,720
the movie the change I've got me

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,160
thinking if you could be anyone we're

45
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,229
like a set amount of time in a month or

46
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,420
so would you be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

47
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,310
have to be alive it could be like it

48
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,360
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one of your friends it could</font>

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,520
just be like someone generic it could be

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,729
a famous person and I think my answer

51
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:10,209
would be giant black person not not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

52
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,530
like the stereotypical reason to look

53
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,290
giant black person I do is no no cuz i

54
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,900
would just like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pumped up and</font>

55
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I jump around corners a black eye papal</font>

56
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,769
crazy and like to scare tiny white

57
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,019
people because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be hilarious</font>

58
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:26,260
because black people know black people

59
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,690
know like semi racist white people that

60
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,610
would be amazing you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> scare them and</font>

61
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,380
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegal about scaring</font>

62
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,910
someone as long as you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the right</font>

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,370
community in LA some communities you

64
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">might get show but I think it would be</font>

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome personally you might say Phil</font>

66
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,239
that's racist<font color="#CCCCCC"> wotcha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say a</font>

67
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,760
little bit but it wouldn't be racist at

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,690
the time because I would be a black

69
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,049
person and we'd be boys possibly is that

70
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,090
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>
