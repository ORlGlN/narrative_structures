the planet the only reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I even have</font>

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,410
them as someone bought them for me as a

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,180
present but seeing as my puppies destroy

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,129
anything with wires they get their hands

more of whatever you can do I can do

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,700

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,540
be up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this at midnight who</font>

41
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,979

49
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,230
poses like those little key chains or

50
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,810

school<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now I'm</font>

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,850
confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what I'm supposed to use</font>

58
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">effect or affect guys if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube looks</font>

59
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,320
different to you at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,610
you're watching this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video you're</font>

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,570
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do because it always links to</font>

65
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,340
whatever other new video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did that day</font>

66
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,410

67
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,520
can watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the videos I've ever made</font>

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,680
fun times I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to side note because a</font>

69
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,670
lot of people have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking about</font>

70
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,470
like totally awesome be posted some

71
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,820
videos but they kept glitching and they

72
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't going out to anybody zero people</font>

73
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're like okay we're gonna hold off</font>

74
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,830
our videos have really only been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

75
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,780
out to like half my audience so I'm

76
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,220
really surprised we're still getting any

77
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,750
views whatsoever I<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost feel like</font>

78
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,910
lucky that like all these problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

79
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,230
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it made me realize you</font>

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,420
fun again I'm kind of happy these lugs

82
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,910
make people look into<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves I think</font>

83
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,989
one of the biggest things have to decide

84
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,549
is something like along the lines of

85
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,350
what kind of schedule am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>
