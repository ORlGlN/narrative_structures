awesome I'm definitely giving it my

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,530
recommendation for a few reasons um with

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,899
final cut pro x it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a an</font>

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,090
upgrade it is a completely different

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,859
feel the best way to describe it would

19
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,580
be a feel between vinyl cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro and I</font>

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,270
movie 2011 now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm movie 2011 I wasn't I</font>

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,310
was a big fan of the one before it

22
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,810
didn't like it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't actually liked</font>

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,979
I movie since I movie HD but I want to

24
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you a few things that I really do</font>

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,299
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna start</font>

26
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,150
with screaming at me<font color="#CCCCCC"> rippled elites in</font>

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,890
Final Cut Pro which was a previously a

28
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,200
thousand dollars every way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">would go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead you would click and if</font>

30
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,840
you wanted to delete the empty the soon

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,549
to be empty space you would have to

32
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,500
ripple delete which is shift elite but

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,960
now you just hit delete everything in

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,970
Final Cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pro X is magnetic so it</font>

35
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,490
doesn't leave dead space<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

36
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">very nice because sometimes at the end</font>

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the philip defranco show there would</font>

38
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,329
be clip seven minutes away from the

39
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,920
timeline we wouldn't pay attention and

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,469
it would mess up our entire video now a

41
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,750
big thing is ripple delete would only

42
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,630
work on one clip at a time but because

43
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,520
everything's magnetic if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> select</font>

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,699
everything command function for clips

45
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,300
you had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave Oh magic little things</font>

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um little things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

47
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,400
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be normal then given to you</font>

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,100

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,040

without doing a transition over the

93
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,890
video that's the only thing I haven't
