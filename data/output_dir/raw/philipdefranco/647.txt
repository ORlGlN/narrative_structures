20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,220
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a low-budget</font>

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,050
movie it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> only costs about five</font>

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,060
hundred thousand dollars they did

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,099
gorilla shooting so a lot of the extras

24
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,020
didn't know they were extras directed by

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,060
gareth edwards main two characters are

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,220
played by Whitney able and scoot<font color="#CCCCCC"> mcnairy</font>

27
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,439
and the movie is described as six years

28
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,329
after aliens invaded earth a security

29
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:16,130

on the job so I've heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> very mixed</font>

00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,259
reviews about this going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> movie</font>

some specific stuff and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> fico here is</font>

it's the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> option you've got okay</font>

47
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,970
we're back I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> torn as far as this</font>

48
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,620
movie goes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely see what a lot</font>

49
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,820
of people were saying why they hated

50
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,080
this movie I definitely see why a lot of

51
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,790
people loved this movie a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

52
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">were saying it weren't enough aliens or</font>

53
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,080
creatures or whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I wanted</font>

54
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,179
like transformers meets alien meets a

55
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:14,209
movie where things actually happen the

56
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,470
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> side people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying well no the</font>

57
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,300
whole point is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's subdue even</font>

58
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,790
though they are in this extraordinary

59
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,770
situation it always comes down to

60
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,730
relationships because this is a monster

61
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,200
movie where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like Godzilla just</font>

62
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,790
attacked it's like Godzilla just

63
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,980
attacked and he got a condo and he's

64
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,600
just chilling and it's like six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

65
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,830
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everyone's like oh hey it's</font>

66
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,180
Godzilla it's just fucking of away

67
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,530
Godzilla and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at this movie I</font>

68
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,239
can't help but stress like it gets a

69
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,820
little it's a little extra like room to

70
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,260
mess up<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it really was it was</font>

71
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,700
made for<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred thousand dollars</font>

72
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,230
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing especially when you</font>

73
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,790
look at like all the stuff they got into

74
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the movie the relationship between the</font>

75
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,370
main two characters is actually really

76
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">good that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably because in real</font>

77
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,180
life they're married but you do actually

78
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">care about the characters even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

79
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,480
mistakes are made here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

80
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything starts off easily enough</font>

81
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,390
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get back home the only</font>

82
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to get back home it's a fairy they</font>

83
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,900
drop some cash and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main guy has sex</font>

84
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,400
with a mexican girl which of course be

85
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,410
watched any movie ever means mexican

86
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">girls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna steal his ID and his money</font>

87
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,709
because apparently that's what mexican

88
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,180
people do in movies then they're forced

89
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,190
to go through the infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell which of</font>

90
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,840
course infected because a satellite

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,910
probes six years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> crash-landed with</font>

92
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,440
some bacteria from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moon which</font>

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,480
obviously resulted in monsters and well

94
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,549
you don't see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of monsters you do</font>

95
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,079
feel the tense situation because most

96
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,980
the time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to see these</font>

97
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you're about to die so they go</font>

98
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,489
through a relationship of bulbs you find

99
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,500
out more about the monsters mainly that

100
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,780
monsters have sex and then they jizz on

101
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,060
trees<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's what happened in</font>

102
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,980
the movie then<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone dies except then</font>

103
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,019
because well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how a movie works</font>

104
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,730
kind of when the movie got interesting

105
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,530
was the last 20 minutes they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

106
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,959
giant wall which America's finally built

107
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,420
because as much as we complain about

108
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,590
Mexicans jumping our borders<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like</font>

109
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,380
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking our fruits giant monsters</font>

110
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,760
that kill people<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking the biggest</font>

111
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,750
wall you've ever seen which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

112
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,370
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually helps since these</font>

113
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,810
monsters look like they flop then

114
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">something said</font>

115
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,060
during this part of the movie that kind

116
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,160
of just stayed with me anyways the guy

117
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
talking to a girl he's like once we get

118
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">over those walls we're just gonna go</font>

119
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,600
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our regular lives and like this</font>

120
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,560
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have been a thing that</font>

121
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened to us and we'll be on our</font>

122
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,800
perfect suburban home and and the world

123
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
will continue being messed up but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

124
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,910
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone and it reminded me of what I've</font>

125
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,470
talked to two soldiers who have come

126
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,120
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> America as they refer to America</font>

127
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,070
as Disney like that the real shit is

128
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,540
over there with what they have to go

129
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">through and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they deal with on a</font>

130
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,418
daily<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they come back here and</font>

131
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,150
it's just this weird artificial not so

132
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,340
raw nerve of what life really is and it

133
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,880
was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a more like an emotional</font>

134
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,310
response victory for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you director and</font>

135
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,600
then of course they had a jump over the

136
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
wall I realize I want to be together

137
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,240
there's this moment where you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

138
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,280
two giant monsters like gente cool

139
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,350
having I don't know pretty sure one of

140
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,790
them came probably the guy work that the

141
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,290
military shows up you think everything's

142
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,510
good until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you realize the people that</font>

143
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,800
you think died in the beginning of them

144
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,750
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact the two characters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

145
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,280
been with<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the past 90 minutes but</font>

146
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,290
does their dash change anything they've

147
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,060
gone through really it is still open

148
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,350
ended you don't know if they die I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

149
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,150
the main point of the story is a lot of

150
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,030
shit is messed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we put up walls to</font>

151
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,220
try and block ourselves away from it but

152
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,890
what we really do is trap ourselves and

153
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,140
and just really postpone the inevitable

154
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,240
death and and shit that's going to

155
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,470
happen to you I being said I think there

156
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,760
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of missed opportunities on</font>

157
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,410
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie I definitely recommend it if</font>

158
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,690
