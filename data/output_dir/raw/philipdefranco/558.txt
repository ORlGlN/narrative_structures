down below but here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clip of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,930
trailer a madman has come undone these

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,770
are his final hours and this is the

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,780
story that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has never been told don't</font>

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,719
fall and so downfall was this really odd

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,520
movie to me i<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had only heard</font>

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,559
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in two ways one it had become</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,480
meme which was hilarious where that one

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,219
scene where hitler finds out that he's

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,260
been like figuring out army strategies

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,550
with armies that weren't there anymore

25
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,260
but people put funny captions if you

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,820
haven't seen them once again<font color="#CCCCCC"> links down</font>

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,680
below and to most of you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to</font>

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,290
Europe about two months ago and when we

29
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">went to Berlin we went and we actually</font>

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,170
checked out like some of the

31
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,490
concentration camps and they talked

32
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,229
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this movie and how amazing it was</font>

33
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,880
and was weird watching it because I'm a

34
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,610
part of a generation and also a culture

35
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,320
that never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with it</font>

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,939
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Holocaust is</font>

37
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,729
from books<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my random Jewish friends</font>

38
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,920
whose grandparents like new some stuff

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,720
and the portrayal of Hitler is really

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,460
eye<font color="#CCCCCC"> opening because he's not like</font>

41
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,259
kicking puppies and waking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and he's</font>

42
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,210
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna kill everything it</font>

43
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,590
doesn't portray him is that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows him</font>

44
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,960
as this guy that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like it's over</font>

45
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,840
like he's stuck in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his ways it's over</font>

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,780
he's gonna sink with the ship not to say

47
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was like oh poor Hitler but it did</font>

48
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,149
really portray him as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human being and</font>

49
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,369
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a few of my actor</font>

50
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,439
buddy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you know they told</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me when I</font>

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,930
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you portray like weird</font>

52
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,850
things and they said essentially when

53
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,950
you become a person you can't judge them

54
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,170
you can't be Hitler and go like oh fuck

55
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,149
Hitler you have to be like oh he was

56
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,189
this guy that had this vision and he's

57
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,009
very analytical and maybe not moral

58
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,310
about it and

59
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,199
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye-opening and so I think really</font>

60
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,209
that's what I loved about this movie is

61
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was really human it wasn't about</font>

62
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,370
this evil nazi killing everyone it was

63
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,220
about this guy's dream and the these

64
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,170
goals that almost came to fruition

65
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,690
except for the fact that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was so blind</font>

66
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,209
in his ambitions and and and so

67
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,459
heartless that even though the people

68
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,769
around him would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not leave for the most</font>

69
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:30,940
part even though in those last days

70
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,190
didn't have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of faith they stuck by</font>

71
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,290
him like a loyal dog and so I think

72
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason I liked it because you</font>

73
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,430
know movies and TV shows for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

74
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,650
part they make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really apparent like</font>

75
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,200
that guy is evil he shoots dogs in the

76
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,290
face he punches babies he has a monocle

77
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,840
and a weird accent and the good guy like

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,480
wears all white and he has pistols and

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,310
he's like Barrymore also side note if

80
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know your history you'll you'll</font>

it it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really emotional movie</font>

98
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:37,000
usually i watch history movies but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,370
one overall was right this Austrian

100
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,160
German epic takes the story of possibly

101
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the worst men in history and</font>

102
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,819
makes you feel for it makes you

103
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,260
sympathize with one of the most hated

104
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,989
men in history he was a whiny baby goes

105
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,900
fucking crazy I did watch a couple other

106
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,359
reviewers and I noticed a couple of them

107
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,630
said that they felt sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Hitler he</font>

108
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,359
was an actual my<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor him he was an ass</font>

109
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:04,269
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he deserved everything he got it's</font>

110
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,190
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think that he was a human no</font>

111
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,109
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how evil and how much of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

112
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,970
dictator how much the wall likes to hate

113
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,460
him it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a human being I thought</font>

114
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,960
interesting contest and typically what

115
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,850
you see in a world war two movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for</font>

116
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,470
me this is a really a problem but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

117
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a lot of people that probably will</font>

118
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,279
be there subtitles to this film it is

119
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,260
all in german didn't like that it was

120
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,840
German moment I thought was in German I

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,020
was like oh now suck it the fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> up it</font>

122
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,210
added to the overall effect and

123
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,950
believability of the film just means you

124
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to focus a little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on movie</font>

125
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,690
I can't can't we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kill yourself</font>

126
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,360
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> harden the fuck up and read some</font>

127
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,610
fucking subtitle take a moment to

128
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,930
