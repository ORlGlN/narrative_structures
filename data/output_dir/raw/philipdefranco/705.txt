excellent oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 540 in the morning I</font>

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,430
was just called by a telemarketer and

41
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,950
I'm an idiot and I didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> my phone</font>

42
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,380
on vibrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's exciting I still</font>

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,380
have a revenant women number that<font color="#E5E5E5"> land</font>

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,459
now one of the reasons I'm okay with um

51
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,959
with waking up this early is because

52
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,760
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of my schedule anyway and</font>

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,320
the reason I do this is so that i can

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,000
just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can take advantage of the</font>

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,070
day because if I at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point if i wake</font>

56
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,810
up at like 10 or 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like my days</font>

57
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,510
wasted because I get so much done before

58
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,790
no I get so much done before 10 and so I

59
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,019
like to stick to it like even though

60
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,630
