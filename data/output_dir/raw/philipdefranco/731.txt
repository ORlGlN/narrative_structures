30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,060

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,649
know what am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say and then I</font>

32
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,719
literally just I turned on the camera

33
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,860
which is over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's see my little</font>

34
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,070
my canon 5d I should have gotten a 70

35
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,200
because I mainly is it for video but i

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,939
do like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do still photographers some</font>

37
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,609
time and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what I do is I turn on</font>

38
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:43,619
the camera right right here and then it

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,020
connects through hdmi to the screen

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,390
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't see what I look like and</font>

41
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus is so harsh that that you</font>

42
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,539
really do just you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

43
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:57,960
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at and I an extra TV</font>

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,700
and I was like well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to pay</font>

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,109
five hundred dollars to get like a

46
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,090
little monitor so that's what I'm

47
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,530
constantly looking at I'm just making

48
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,509
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm centered making sure that</font>

49
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,330
I'm in focus and yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's so</font>

50
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,649
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I look off and I just look at</font>

51
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,050
myself and I kind of get lost in thought

52
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,720
and when I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking my face kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,530
just goes like open mouth which really

54
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,120
you know it could be like thoughtful or

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
can be sad it really just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,819
like the mood so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was greatly</font>

57
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,590
swayed by the music that I used and a

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,580
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people thought I was said I don't</font>

59
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to kill myself at least these days</font>

60
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,540
but yeah that's that's generally how the

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,680
show is done<font color="#CCCCCC"> I film for about an hour</font>

62
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,940
more time probably goes into the

63
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,790
research and a lot more time goes into

64
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the editing of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah so</font>

65
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,060
that's let's both<font color="#CCCCCC"> DeFranco show I've</font>

66
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">been kind of blessed the past week</font>

67
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,910
there's been a lot of news so we've been

68
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to do a larger show which a lot of</font>

69
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,010
you seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to enjoy anyone there's</font>

70
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,600
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff a lot of stuff and things</font>

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,980
but i thought i'd share that with you

72
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,150
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't just want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

73
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,769
I do the show some of you already kind

74
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,630
of had an idea and so let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

75
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,090
over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the weekend this weekend was</font>

76
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,830
interesting because I went to this thing

77
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,810
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> a gifting suite I had I had no</font>

78
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,550
idea these things existed it was just

79
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the gifting suites for the Emmys</font>

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,540
and so what a gifting suite is is this

81
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,370
place where companies literally paid to

82
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,650
be there so that they can give free

83
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,500
stuff to celebrities and in hopes that

84
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,079
you know maybe they talk about it or

85
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,329
they you know they get photographed with

86
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:30,390
it or something and so somehow the

87
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,250
referendum a friend of a friend it was

88
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,269
like hey you should go to the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

89
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:34,230
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you'd get a kick</font>

90
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,930
out of it and I went and I'm probably

91
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the most awkward people to be</font>

92
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,410
around I am I had this huge like mental

93
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,570
crisis you know I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> really awkward</font>

94
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,390
and really nervous because it you know

95
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,820
it's Hollywood so even even the interns

96
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,880
everyone is beautiful everyone is

97
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,709
beautiful and I'm like on this you know

98
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,440

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this there's doughy fuck with</font>

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,799
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet show and I'm in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

101
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,760

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">be you know I feel like there's I have</font>

103
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,400
like this this crisis and then you know

you are and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's just it's a</font>

110
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,260
weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you know it's I don't know</font>

111
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,960
grow it growing up I was always like

112
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,289
I don't know I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> insignificant and</font>

113
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,990
it's weird when people in the real world

114
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they treat me like I matter I</font>

115

<font color="#E5E5E5">very I'm not fully sure of myself I'm</font>

117
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,800
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of myself in some ways but you know</font>

118
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,349
in that world I still remain unsure of

119
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,319
myself and humbled so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like</font>

120
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's beneficial but anyway</font>

00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry I've like like let's go into my</font>
