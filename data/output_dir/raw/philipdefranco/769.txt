18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,460
very tempting and it's and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,260
do it in moderation because it's the

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,300
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I'm fat I I can't just have</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel amazing then</font>

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,049
eventually if I don't do it it'll make

27
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:13,060
me feel like shit yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like a</font>

30
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:21,520

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">just start working as fast as possible</font>

32
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect to eventually be misguided it's</font>

33
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,869
kind of why I like these video responses

34
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,609
i'm knocking out like a week in a day

35
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:32,799
and then I'll do it again and then like

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,990
that because if I do one every day if

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,639
I'm like oh I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I'll put it out</font>

38
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:39,100
put aside<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes I'll do it then</font>

39
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,530

40
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,869
something off I love whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing</font>

games I do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for eight hours if I'm if</font>

43
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,889
I'm eating vagina<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do it</font>

52
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,620
buddy he has this the saying i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

53
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,080
forget where it comes from but it's that

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,350
feelings are not facts what you feel is

55
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,690
not necessarily

56
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,270
the truth you know whether you're like I

57
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,040
need I need chocolate now you don't it's

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,420
it's not a fact that's just something

59
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,010
that's a feeling that's a that's a

60
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,660
that's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> electric thing going off and</font>

61
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,460
your brain saying I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and that's</font>

62
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,730
and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me I usually</font>

63
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,000
react very emotionally whether it's a

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's business personal life I usually am</font>

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,530
very my act with my heart more so than

66
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">bringing something that down and</font>

67
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,780
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it first which is</font>

68
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on and</font>

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,490
fixing myself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now my mindset is</font>

70
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,950
be a mirror I mean be yourself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

71
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,480
someone's acting a certain way just

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,550
reacts like a mirror someone's nice to

73
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,020
you be nice back if someone's being

74
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,760
skeptical they might have a reason that

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're being that way so be skeptical</font>

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,480
yourself someone's working hard and

77
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,610
they're really fast then<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and be like</font>

78
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,990
them this kind of veers off into

79
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,310
something completely different but one

80
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,750
of the biggest things about being a

81
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,920
mirror is that it doesn't discriminate

82
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,620
if you're black white whatever color

83
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,320
you're wealthy or poor you're religious

84
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,960
or orientation anything I mean there are

85
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">so many times like people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been</font>

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">in meetings with or something that they</font>

87
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">just treat like their leader or like a</font>

88
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,380
driver or one of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> employees like</font>

89
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,989
shit just plain out rude and mean I'm

90
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,610
too busy trying to reach my goals than

91
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,850
to act out emotionally so if one of the

92
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,280
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I employed just didn't give</font>

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,770
a shit anymore then I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna give a</font>

94
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,239
shit about them but if someone's

95
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,709
fighting for me and they're killing for

96
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,239
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do it right back for them you</font>

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,440
get what you give but I hope that

98
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">answered your question and kind of gave</font>
