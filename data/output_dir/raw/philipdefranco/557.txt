sup blog and atop people's it is just

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,830
athlete sup blogger the top people's I

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,450
literally just finished filming the

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,680
philip defranco show and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was thinking</font>

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">i should talk other words to the camera</font>

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,679
about non newsy things so this is that

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,570
that's the thing though so this is that

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,920
that's what I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talking about</font>

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">last week I started posting these things</font>

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,550
called the blog at ease oh it's so

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,380
original but essentially like what a

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,359
blog would be but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> text like just</font>

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,369
going back to text and stuff because

14
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,519
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a kid I mean I'm still a kid</font>

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,529
does some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you but some some of you</font>

16
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,140
I'm like old<font color="#E5E5E5"> man to Franco but when I</font>

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,170
was a kid<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would always right out you</font>

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,480
know what I was feeling ideas either

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,370
some of that came in to really shitty

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,879
badly written poetry because poetry

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,820
unless it's really well-written kind of

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,000
lame a little bit sorry it's true but

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know I was talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two things</font>

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,020
you know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt really</font>

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,840
weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Iraq war and then I had</font>

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">one about uh I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always treating</font>

27
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,770
myself to a christmas present because

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,049
you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do not a</font>

29
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,180
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me know that I</font>

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,470
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy very expensive thing like when</font>

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,030
I do it I'm like it this thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,010
gonna happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a billion years so I</font>

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,100
got I feel like such a douche<font color="#CCCCCC"> wore it</font>

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,259
and maybe I partially<font color="#CCCCCC"> am but for my</font>

35
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,759
Christmas birthday present because i am

36
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,320
a December baby and everyone always did

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to me anyways I got myself an</font>

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,380
80-inch tv be any which is ridiculous

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I even said in the blog</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80</font>

40
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,030
reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> to philly did on TV it's</font>

41
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,860
ridiculous because there's no reason you

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,320
need to have a TV that big I mean it

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,030
would suck to play video<font color="#E5E5E5"> games on it</font>

44
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,560
especially professionally or not

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,920
professionally but competitive with Lee

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,780
rule whoa but you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

47
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,030
about that like why as a consumer do I

48
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,979
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it so I was talking about that</font>

49
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,680
and you know I was like I will return to

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,960
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> forum for one day so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

51
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,579
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm referring to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so new</font>

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,200

55
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,320
so that I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not play them because when</font>

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">I get stressed out I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just play video</font>

57
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,310
games and I end up not working and it's

58
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,720
kind of a dick thing to do when you're

59
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,800
playing video games and other people

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are working so i did that the</font>

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only so many hours</font>

64
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">like there's so many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

65
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,930
actually one of the things is um

66
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,390
SourceFed SourceFed I don't know what it

67
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,520
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good because I want it to be semi</font>

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,220
surprising for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but it's launching</font>

69
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,920
january twenty third and you know we're

70

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the the youtube backed thing</font>

72
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,140
because they were like you bid on

73
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,480
youtube for five years we kind of trust

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,930
you here's some money and things so you

75
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,370
know we moved out of the old office

76
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,400
which wasn't a good place it wasn't like

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,410
things weren't soundproof it was all

78
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,959
cramped and like it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of the I'm at my house right now I</font>

81
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,040
one of the rooms of my house look at the

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
office but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving into a new place</font>

excited I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep burping and just</font>

87
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,129
being a disgusting individual sorry yeah

88
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,989

95
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,299
exciting like the my favorite thing is

96
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:31,440
hiring people that I think are more

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,780
