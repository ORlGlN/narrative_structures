yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home it literally</font>

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been home before like 7pm in</font>

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,310
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> as if you know me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i wake up at six</font>

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,660
in the morning leave here at six at

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,160
night and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not complaining i love</font>

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,350
this but you know it does lead to me

18
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,090
being tired especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

19
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,590
anything else in my life but yesterday i

20
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,180
was laying<font color="#E5E5E5"> in bed and I saw a trailer</font>

21
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,860
for this movie and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> either gonna be</font>

22
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,270
good where's gonna be a terrible fucking

23
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,890
movie like it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just try too hard to</font>

24
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,060
be artsy but it's like it's either

25
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,760
called another world or 2nd earth or

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,200
another earth or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,640
essentially it's this trailer about how

28
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,500
this second earth appears and when they

29
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,030
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and contact if they realize it's</font>

30
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,130
like a replica<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our plant and even all</font>

31
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people exist there too so it's I</font>

32
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,450
imagine it's like the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> times poof</font>

33
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,280
everything double and in the trailer ask

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,270
this weird question there's another<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

35
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,880
now you begin to wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sammy make the</font>

36
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,320
same mistakes I made

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,740
and is that me better than that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

38
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,680
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another me out there have they</font>

39
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,720
made the same decisions I've made have

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,790
they made the same mistakes how are they

41
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,470
better are they worse it would be

42
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,180
essentially like if everyone had an

43
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,530
identical twin because if you have an

44
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,970
identical twin and you're like the fat

45
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,190
one that must suck because you know oh

46
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,750
that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would look like if I</font>

47
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,040
wasn't such a lazy schmuck we're like

48
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,110
one that studies harder or just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

49
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">attendant and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> net and that made me think</font>

50
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,259
about choices we've talked about choices

51
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,610
a lot in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past but it did make me</font>

52
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,560
think like the small things all the

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,880
small things it jumps back to the whole

54
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,229
butterfly effect that there are so many

55
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,850
small decisions i've made that have

56
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,710
ended<font color="#CCCCCC"> up having huge impacts some</font>

57
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,630
people's lives would be much much worse

58
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,369
some people's lives may have been better

59
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,110
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i never think things like oh I</font>

60
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,030
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been hurt if I didn't meet</font>

61
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,649
that one girl<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one time I would I</font>

62
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,180
wouldn't have wasted time I mean I think

63
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">those are bad thoughts and there was</font>

64
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,000
something i<font color="#CCCCCC"> said yesterday that that</font>

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
apparently bring home to a lot of you

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,630
and it was don't live for today because

67
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,430
you then you just be fucking crazy live

68
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,930
your life like it's a story that you

69
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,790
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to tell someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

70
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,080
to some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that sucks is</font>

71
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,640
obviously not changeable bit more

72
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,560
importantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i shouldn't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

73
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,180
it because the story's not good without

74
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,280
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> twists stories not good without</font>

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,470
drama story is not good without heart a

76
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,540
and it is often the complexities in life

77
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,060
that make it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome it is these sick</font>

78
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,070
days that make our lives so amazing

79
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,540
because no matter where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are in your</font>

80
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,010
life whatever is happening there's only

81
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,079
been one moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you were at the</font>

82
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,610
bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that mountain you've seen the</font>

83
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,260
bad you've seen rock bottom and you know

84
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,120
that today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is better than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another day</font>

85
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,560
they not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than yesterday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

86
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,570
don't know what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming tomorrow it's</font>

87
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,100
gotta roll with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after saying all</font>

88
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,260
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why I love movies</font>

89
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,760
and games so much it's because it makes

90
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,590
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it makes me feel I mean I got I</font>

91
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,110
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt all that from a two minute</font>

92
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,700

93
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,709

group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching something</font>

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,829
feeling something and then talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

96
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,870

something always goes wrong in the show

132
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,890

instructor I think I liked her less

143
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,669
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this episode because just of the</font>

144
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,260
way she yelled at<font color="#E5E5E5"> her students like I</font>

145
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,570
get it she was personally involved but

146
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,340
still that just reminded me<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all</font>

147
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,470
looking bad teachers I've had and that

148
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,240
