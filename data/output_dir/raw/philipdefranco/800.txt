it's 70 pixels by something and if your

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,040
partner you'll be able to see and that

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
148 videos oh they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in</font>

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,790
their lives may be there other videos

58
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,350
are good so you can click this now and

59
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,299
it will load up all the latest videos

60
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,250
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go through all</font>

61
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,098
their videos and buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> all their videos I</font>

62
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,940
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44 pages of their videos but really</font>

63
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,050
you should just subscribe to their

64
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,860
channel if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to watch</font>

65
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,260
many videos so you do that you click it

66
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,560
it takes you to do that video and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

67
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,690
perfect ah I hate that person's voice

68
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,510
anyway so something interesting now is

69
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,970
when you subscribe to someone you now

70
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,710
have multiple options and if you're

71
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,090
already subscribed to someone you can

72
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,770
edit that subscription so you click edit

73
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,870

want you to enjoy the video as I enjoy

83
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,220
but do not do this currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

84
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,020
there is a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with subscriptions</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show you right now you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

86
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube main page ok so here are a bunch</font>

87
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,400
of videos now YouTube made it so you can

88
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,530
click this little X button to remove the

89
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,980
videos that no longer works does not

90
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,630
work even sometimes when you watch a

91
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,780
video it doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if I don't want</font>

92
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,760
to watch any of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos well</font>

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,530
fucking tough luck I just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait</font>

94
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,540
for people to upload new videos so I get

95
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have this set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 num nail</font>

96
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,450
thumbnails of this chick that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

97
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,910
she wants to deepthroat kassem g which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

98
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,190
heard is pretty easy and you know that's

99
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,480
fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i can text out of the video if</font>

100
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't want to watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so a lot of</font>

101
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have been getting spammed by</font>

102
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,690
accounts that upload a shit ton<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

103
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,670
videos like machinima love those guys

104
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,590
but they produce like a hundred videos a

105
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,049
day and they take<font color="#CCCCCC"> over people's boxes so</font>

106
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,420
currently i would recommend just only

107
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,220
subscribe to the video is uploaded but

108
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just me because that's convenient</font>

109
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">so anyway back to this video we go</font>

110
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,940
further down you might not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar</font>

111
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,680
with a new player so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come down</font>

112
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">here you can watch it in higher quality</font>

113
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only going up to 480</font>

114
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,739
because 720 lags especially in firefox

115
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:05,910
you should probably download<font color="#E5E5E5"> google</font>

116
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,600
chrome this makes the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> window bigger</font>

117
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,120
go back to smaller this is full screen

118
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,340
then captions are pretty fun because

119
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're always wrong and then you can</font>

120
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,279
turn annotations off to the right of

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,410
course you have the add the promoted

122
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,640
video which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially another ad</font>

123
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,740
and then usually have three to four

124
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,260
videos from the user so you have this

125
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,090
this

126
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,010
this this all from the same user and

127
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,810
then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a bunch of semi related</font>

128
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,910
stuff so don't worry youtubers you can

129
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,590
still game your your way into people's

130
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,770
sidebars by spamming tags yay<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

131
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,300
we go below<font color="#CCCCCC"> the video so there's no</font>

132
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,620
sidebar anymore you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an underbar e</font>

133
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,600
there's all the text you see oh that

134
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,889
he's saying something maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should</font>

135
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,030
click you don't have to click more info

136
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,530
anymore you can just click anywhere in

137
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,690
there it opens it up now you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

138
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,419
texts the tags fantastic then of course

139
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can click the views because for some</font>

140
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,790
reason you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in who's</font>

00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,889
to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have all that information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

144
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:59,510
used to be easily available but now you

00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to click a button then of course oh</font>

150
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,580

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,650
you hit the like button it will help you

152
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,389
tube work especially if you do it on

153
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,400
sxephil and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philip DeFranco videos even</font>

154

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,010

157
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">many other people liked it how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

158
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,500
other people disliked it and you can

159
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,229
even check videos that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> like as</font>

160
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,690
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how good that is but</font>

161
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,010
we'll see or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like it</font>

162
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,560
because Phil's videos suck now there is

163
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,850
no favorite button anymore you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

166
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,320
to a playlist and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you can</font>

167
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,960
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> it any of any of these ways but</font>

168
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,190
most the time the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

169
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,260
share is just to take the URL and post

170
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,010
it on your Twitter your Facebook

171
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,410
whatever and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there's in</font>

172
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,570
bed and flag you never want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit this</font>

173
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,070
button it's a terrible button but that

174
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,200
brings us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> another fun thing boys and</font>

177
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,250
video response button that's because you

178
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,220
have to click into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text response to</font>

179

183
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,320
some comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe something that you</font>

184
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,870
would put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video of the person that</font>

185
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,150
is possibly a minority or different in

186
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,460
some way to you just the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

187
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,610
supposed to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then of course I</font>

188
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't even know what just happened in</font>

189
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the comments now there's this new weird</font>

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,419
hierarchy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comments and i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

191
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you on a different page so we're</font>

192
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,420
gonna go to another window

193
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,570
my main channel yay so the comments are

194
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,670
a little weird because it'll have what

195
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,860
is this video in response to shuttle so

196
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,570
it'll show that video in a new way that

197
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,040
takes up more room so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

198
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,480
then you have highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> rated comment so</font>

199
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,250
if you say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny or something</font>

200
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of people agree with they like you</font>

201
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,790
your comment will show up above everyone

202
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,440
else is then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the video</font>

203
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,540
responses which now it only show is one

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,930
random random random random page and

218
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,280

219
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,770
interactivity that's essentially most of

220
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,210
it but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I really really</font>

221
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">like it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the few things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

222
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,050
I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next in series tab</font>

223
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,850
but essentially on my channel I wanted

224
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a series where people could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

225
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,390
watch the latest<font color="#CCCCCC"> four videos on my</font>

226
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,310
channel so what I did is I went to my

227
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,050
channel I went to my videos i selected

228
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,420
like the last four videos this this this

229
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,250
so you check those boxes and then you

230
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,800
click add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to playlist and then you</font>

231
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
select the playlist so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever anyone</font>

232
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
goes on to those videos they're going to

233
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
see next in series so they go to this

234
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">video and they see there are other</font>

235
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,680
things so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> either click to it</font>

236
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,370
which is it's a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it or you</font>

237
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,080
can click autoplay that is a plane and

238
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,720
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the end of the video</font>

239
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">three two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one it'll auto a load into the</font>

240
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,930
next page and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll pop up all the</font>

241
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,390
time unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are watching your</font>

242
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,340
subscription so if I'm watching my buddy

243
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,380

245
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,000

and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the channel page is</font>

248
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,220
exactly the same except for the fact

249
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,229
that you can't five-star anything and so

250
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,750
mr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Glick maybe you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should get on</font>

251

255
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,990
as we trek through the new YouTube

256
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,089
wilderness that makes no<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense hope you</font>

257
