are they call to eat peas is that what

59
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,329
it is EP like when one like a kid makes

60
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:07,980
an album like a seven song album is

61
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">abney p I don't even know what EP stands</font>

62
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,579
for the question appeared to be

63
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:14,400
contradictory album would normally be

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,170
associated with LP or long play record

65
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,250
you play a

66
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,630
play record would normally have two

67
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,220
tracks per side hope that helps Brian

68
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,900
Brian your dick face<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jessie I didn't</font>

69
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,220

into my new house there's really no

71
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,420
reason to film because all it was like

72
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,360
me like trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wipe snot off my face</font>

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto moving boxes and setting</font>

74
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,420
up the new house which is it's pretty

75
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">fantastic I didn't film because I know</font>

76

and move there yet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it yeah ah</font>

80
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,440
but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address a question a lot</font>

81
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people ask what do the interns do</font>

82
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,510
which is a good question mark what do

83
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,700
the interns to anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

84
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,209
exactly that's what's the whole point of

85
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,150
an intern to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do anything and everything</font>

86
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,760
until we find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good at</font>

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,320
and or<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and/or can learn mark what</font>

88
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,700
have you learned so far it was good in

89
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world yes as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

90
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">like demon babies that tongue keeps in</font>

91
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,810
his office is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it as about it</font>

92
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,580
demon babies and good in the world and

93
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,190
so the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

94
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,540
week or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so our interns are babies our</font>

95
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,060
babies were your<font color="#E5E5E5"> was every day mark and</font>

96
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,200
Sebastian are going to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

97
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,750
something called intern pluses what

98
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,250
intern pluses which means yes there's a

99
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,990
subscription fee so the turning into

100
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,190
into intern pluses they'll still do

101
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,410
pretty much everything and anything but

102
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,080
they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more specific so then of</font>

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,900
course we have the new question what

104
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next set of interns who's who</font>

105
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,220
is available pretty sure Tony wants to

106
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,430
do it through you know like legitimate

107
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,530
means people actually wanting to work in

108
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,890
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and then I was like why do</font>

109
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,790
that let's have people in LA with cars

110
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,350
specifically cars for their

111
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,260
transportation so they can like get us

112
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,990
coffee<font color="#CCCCCC"> eid or bury dead hookers in the</font>

113
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,570
desert those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that do those things</font>

114
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,300
like I said before I got sidetracked

115
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,979
she'd make video responses essentially

116
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:30,670
giving us a

117
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,680
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> resume and the reason why they</font>

118
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,180
should be an intern here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maddie come</font>

119
