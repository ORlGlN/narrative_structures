3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,719
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> game yeah yes</font>

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,830
hello it's wednesday april 20 if there

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,169
is almost no footage of my day because

6
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,090
my day consisted entirely of sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,359
a couch<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing portal 2 and just be in</font>

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,609
that guy back so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been</font>

9
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:32,960
playing portal 2 masses have gotten

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">cancelled people are getting fired</font>

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,230
because they're calling into work

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,390
luckily it was Tuesday I didn't have to

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,010
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing anything and so</font>

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,870
I played games I stopped playing game

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,879
then Matt played games with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was</font>

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,860
it so today is essentially kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,199
store review of portal 2 so with that in

18
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:50,030
mind portal 2 is an amazing game<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,890
played the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original portal because I</font>

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,800
bought orange box for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> xbox 360 and I</font>

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,600
was like oh what's this minigame thing

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I originally thought like oh it's a</font>

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">minigame you know I thought you were</font>

24
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,789
gonna die in the end of portal and then

25
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,589
you're like oh my god this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is amazing</font>

26
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:05,780
i'm making an escape and so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font>

27
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">fan of the first one so when I heard</font>

28
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,170
about portal 2 I was like yes please

29
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,840
more I want more so playing it yesterday

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,840
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it is a much longer game</font>

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,070
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a very good thing</font>

32
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,720
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't ever rag on and</font>

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's thanks to the introduction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

34
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,009
white orange and blue gels<font color="#E5E5E5"> the white</font>

35
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,959
kind of the most dynamic gel because it

36
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,849
allows you to turn services into ones

37
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:28,039
you can shoot portals on the blue making

38
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,450
you bounce higher and the orange one

39
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,860
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you can run faster now</font>

40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,479
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool is all of these are</font>

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">really fun by themselves but as you get</font>

42
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,869
further and further in the game mixing

43
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,179
these new game mechanics with old game

44
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:40,729
mechanics is some of the puzzles are so

45
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,170
hard and if you don't know Hordle is a

46
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,550
very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> game because it is a</font>

47
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,770
first-person puzzler in fact you never

48
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,360
actually shoot a weapon you're just

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,220
shooting two portals the entire game and

50
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,229
transporting yourself between portals

51
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,330
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to say this is easily one of</font>

52
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,459
the most satisfying game I've played in

53
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,979
the past year maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer there's</font>

54
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,390
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about either knocking out</font>

55
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,220
a puzzle in 30 seconds anybody was like

56
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,110
oh that took me 20 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

57
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,940
doing a puzzle the right way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind of</font>

58
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,950
just hacking the level with portals and

59
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,649
your ass I gimped through this level so

60
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,599
awesome game mechanics awesome gameplay

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,790
awesome story and the story is even

62
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,200
better because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has some of the best</font>

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,970
voice acting of

64
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,310
game other than mass effect 2 when you

65
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,020
play male<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shepherd be the voice acting</font>

66
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,490
is superb and you have Ellen McLain

67
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,380
coming back as the voice of GLaDOS this

68
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,500
next test does require some explanation

69
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,650
let me give you the fast version<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

70
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,390
entities<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there if you have any</font>

71
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,460
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> just remember what I said in</font>

72
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,960
slow motion and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce the</font>

73
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,750
former CEO Cave Johnson voiced by JK

74
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,640
Simmons and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you gotta love that because</font>

75
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,340
whenever JK Simmons voices anything his

76
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,320
voice gets stuck in your head easily the

77
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,680
most standout person in this game is

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stephen Merchant Stephen Merchant makes</font>

79
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,590
this game ah Oh God they told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me if I</font>

80
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,540
ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> turned this flashlight all I would</font>

81
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,550
die they<font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about everything</font>

82
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,780
but I don't even know why they bother

83
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,220
give me this stuff if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want me to</font>

84
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is pointing she's not gonna say</font>

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,920
who he is because I don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ruin</font>

86
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,270
the story for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but he's introduced</font>

87
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,680
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game and you may recognize</font>

88
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,450
Stephen Merchant I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

89
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,610
office in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK or where I first heard</font>

90
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,080
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was the Ricky Gervais</font>

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,540
podcast so dialogues great and so the

92
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,100
single player is only part of it single

93
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,810
player is a fantastic experience by

94
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,730
itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then after that and I wasted</font>

95
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,500
another five hours playing the coop and

96
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,630
the coop is is amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

97
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,980
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-op that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to</font>

98
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,510
communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your partner you have</font>

99
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,370
to time some things set up some things

100
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,900
and it's made a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a point</font>

101
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,280
function actually co-op would almost be

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">impossible without the point features</font>

103
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,980
otherwise you're like put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the wall</font>

104
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,630
what the fuck important put the portal

105
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,450
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goddamn well oh my god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

106
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,459
heavy on communication but it is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

107
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:41,840
those things that when you actually like

108
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,790
rock out a really hard puzzle your looks

109
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,250
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> jossis bum so ultimately final</font>
