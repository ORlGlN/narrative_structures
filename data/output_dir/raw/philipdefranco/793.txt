00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,140
video explaining the the difference

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,660
between the new show<font color="#CCCCCC"> on sxephil channel</font>

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,390
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the understanding with</font>

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,809
a company that I cannot name that they

11
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,870
believed because of a contract I signed

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,250
way back in the day which was kind of

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,010
vague that they owned rights to the

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">Philip DeFranco show specifically</font>

15
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">redistribution rights and the rights to</font>

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,470
try and sell advertising against my show

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,680
which I would be forced to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,400

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,610
