00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason I achieve certain things because</font>

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,890
a lot of people are like no you're never

64
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,240

65
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,530
all over the place story so that

66
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,610
terrible thing happened a few other

67
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,930
terrible things happen and it pushed me

68
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,150
it pushed me to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when</font>

69
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,769
I found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was oh shit i still</font>

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,450
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was thinking wow thank you</font>

73
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">for hurting me because honestly if</font>

74
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,600
people didn't hurt you were bad things

75
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,610
didn't happen you would probably be a

76
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">fuckup because he'd never be forced</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

77
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,850
change and sometimes people need to be

78
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,860
forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change and so I think this</font>

79
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,840
girl who had you know messed with my

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,730
mind for so long because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if she hadn't</font>

81
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,680
I'd probably still be in North Carolina

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,200
with a job that I hate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pains kind of</font>

83
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,670
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you grow up I look healthy people</font>

84
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,560
healthy people and another crazy thing

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,880
is to kind of think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that butterfly</font>

86
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,810
effect a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of the</font>

87
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,400
butterfly effect like if you go back

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,020
into the past but just just think of it

89
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,240
now I think about my buddy Shay I think

90
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,680
if I never promoted him you know we

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,210
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> never become friends and you</font>

92
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,440
know his life may have taken a

93
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,180
completely different turn same thing

94
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,980
with my buddy Tony you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he did 2009</font>

95
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,390
a true story and it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

96
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting views I promoted it it got</font>

97
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,330
featured and then he got millions of

98
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,770
views and<font color="#CCCCCC"> somehow down the road became</font>

99
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,170
friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working together one</font>

100
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,760
action makes a completely different

101
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,800
outcome two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now and then 10</font>

102
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">years from now I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even imagine and</font>

103
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,040
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like people I helped</font>

105
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,130
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't do it it's not a case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

106
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,330
what if so I don't want you to think of

107
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,470
