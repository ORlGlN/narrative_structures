1
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,240
a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the embarrassment</font>

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,460
of your mom coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your middle school</font>

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and she like hugs you or kisses you or</font>

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,320
maybe your mom's attractive and all your

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">friends make weird jokes about how</font>

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,200
they're gonna have sex with her well I

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,760
have a different embarrassing story

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,770
about my mom at school because when I

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,418
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to college I initially went to</font>

10
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Community College and on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of being</font>

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,680
much more inexpensive it is more open to

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,860
having everyone be a student<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my mom</font>

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,329
was one of them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

14
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">Community College my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community college</font>

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,890
with a schedule very close to my own so

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,899
close that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even had one class</font>

17
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,239
together english 101 meeting at my

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,550
freshman year of college my first time

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,550
out as a man on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own my mom was</font>

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,620
sitting at a desk next to me do you know

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,149
what it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have your mom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

22
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,489
study buddy well actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't either</font>

23
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:03,949
because my mom wasn't my study buddy and

24
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:05,990
that's because everyone in a class of my

25
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,020
peers liked my mom<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than me they had</font>

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,360
big study groups that I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> invited</font>

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,980
to but the saving grace of all of this

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,990
is at least they didn't know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was her</font>

29
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,030
son we have different last names my

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,610
shame was just on the inside deep deep

31
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">inside that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was until one Monday morning</font>

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,140
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I walk into class and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

33
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,570
seems normal my mom asks if she can see

34
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,910
my notes cuz she missed her last class I

35
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">helped her out but then I noticed when I</font>

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,270
looked to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the teacher in the front of</font>

37
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,220
the room he is just eyeing me and

38
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,170
smirking like I have douche written on

39
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,150
my forehead but I didn't realize it and

40
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,680
wasting no time at the beginning of the

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,690
class he was like I have a secret I'm

you'd have a little more I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

51
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,110
empathy for being outed in a room full

52
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,270
of people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to judge you and</font>
