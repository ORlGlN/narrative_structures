27
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,270
of the military but the one I told you

36
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,890
mentality that I had a ten-minute mile

37
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,229
when I was like 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years old I love it</font>

38
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,640
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't just the physical</font>

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,100
stuff that that was the big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

40
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,170
watch the next five episodes or any of

41
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,400
the other episodes you see that they

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,740
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and break these people down</font>

43
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">just because it's a whole it's a mental</font>

44
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,850
game<font color="#E5E5E5"> real because it throws out all that</font>

45
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,369
stupid bullshit of like macho luck I'll

46
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,880
can branch 375 pounds because Ranger

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,060
schools like oh that's cool can you lift

48
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,220
375 pounds while taking on gunfire and

49
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,140
people are dying and you have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

50
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,060
hour rest in five days<font color="#E5E5E5"> because then</font>

51
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,590
that's a cool store and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what ends</font>

52
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,180
up making the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rangers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of these</font>

53
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,920
other guys so amazing is it's not like

54
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,960
everyone's Joe Blow like these are the

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,520
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best trying to be the</font>

56
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,649
bestest SS test and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't</font>

57
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,329
seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first episode or watch the rest</font>

58
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,649
of the series I definitely recommend it

59
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other episodes that focus on like</font>

60
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,369
underwater training those are hardcore

61
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,750
and I think the way they break people

62
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,729
down kind of inspires in that sounds

63
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,530
evil for a second not evil but it is

64
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,300
that life lesson that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you hung curd</font>

65
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,920
down and deal with it and you and you

66
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,990
just handle the worst possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenario</font>

67
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,880
you know that you'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font>

68
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the worst of the worst and you're just</font>

69
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be even that much better</font>

70
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-eight percent of the time and you</font>

71
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,550
yourselves are gonna be able to do your

72
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">job better knowing that everyone around</font>

73
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you had to go to hell and back just like</font>

74
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,740
you to get where they are whether on the

75
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,450
battlefields or anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in life but</font>

76
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,130

78
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,250
watch and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then maybe send a video</font>

79
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,400
response of your opinion / review is

80
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,720
downfall it is the movie that recreates

81
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,790
the last 12 days of Hitler's life yeah

82
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,470
that's it for my part what do you think

83
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,100
so surviving the cuts episode one Ranger

84
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,770

85
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,310
and testosterone collapsing and dying

86
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,370
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tough game folks bloating</font>

87
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,650
and bleeding and vomiting crying by far

88
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,020
