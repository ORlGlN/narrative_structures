with five like 20 new friends that's

27
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,570
just the way it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have something</font>

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">in common that you really really care</font>

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube video and you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking someone</font>

YouTube like whatever whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,200
everyone was super welcoming everyone is

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,509
really nice hugging written by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:59,670
when you ladies get so sexy I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

41
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,679
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet everyone as you know if you</font>

42
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:03,660
went if you did not go or have not heard

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,729
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cancel about an hour and a</font>

44
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,410
half two hours in and the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes</font>

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,720
like this you know we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,700 RSVPs</font>

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,250
and then we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing messages like</font>

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">hallway actually I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

48
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,040
able to go but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people weren't removing</font>

49
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,019
their RSVP so we're like oh the numbers

50
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,670
probably to be smaller there's gonna be

51
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,530
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> two maybe 2,000 people the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

52
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,450
thing we could relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to as far as like</font>

53
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,500
sheer amount of people showing up was

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,760
Vancouver Vancouver we had to meet up

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,590
and there are about 300 people and I was

56
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">like well a thousand people that's only</font>

57
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">like three times</font>

58
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,310
times we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even have security for</font>

59
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vancouver we get some security here easy</font>

60
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,569
peasy turns out no that is not true have

61
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,190
some sense of order i paid for a private

62
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,739
security to uh you know try and manage

63
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,930
the inner circle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what i call the</font>

64
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,849
death circle that circle sounds terrible

65
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:49,470
because the potential for it to be

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,269
terrible is very high<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something</font>

67
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">youtubers do naturally and that is I</font>

68
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,200
they see a youtuber they see like person

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,360
they want to go see they surround them

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like trying to kill</font>

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
them but just because they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,709
you know get close hey I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get a</font>

73
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,049
picture out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the giant group of people</font>

74
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,390
and so we had the three security but it

75
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,829
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to communicate to the</font>

76
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:09,959
entire group<font color="#E5E5E5"> now was it advertising the</font>

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,069
security because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be look</font>

78
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,720
oh so popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to have security</font>

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,459
but it was recommended it was very

80
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,709
necessary and after the fact i am very

81
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,079
very glad we we had some security there

82
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,940
and just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put across how much i really</font>

83
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,319
really like these meetups and want to

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,790
see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a sponsor for the event</font>

85
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,859
i paid out of pocket which was a hefty

86
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,450
amount especially in pound for a

87
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,890
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team but ultimately my</font>

88
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,159
inexperience with events of this size

89
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,180
part of the reason it<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't work you</font>

90
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,040
know they did an awesome job they try to

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">get everyone to back up but people were</font>

92
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,220
so excited they kept pushing in and I'm

93
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,780
fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people being close to me but</font>

94
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,190
people started literally getting pushed

95
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,380
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a little</font>

96
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,000
scary there towards the end once again

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing but really really excited people</font>

98
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,690
know when there was literally there was

99
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,040
no asshole there but towards the end

100
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,049
what started as a hey Phil do you want

101
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,160
to take a break<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was like yeah I</font>

102
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,510
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use some water you know my</font>

103
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,160
throat's getting a little tired and so

104
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,510
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started moving but then people</font>

105
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,400
started running trying to get pictures

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,079
in the front and people started getting

107
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,530
knocked over and got a little shaky

108
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,030
there for a second it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a right near the</font>

109
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,019
end they were like maybe we need to just

110
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,060
reassess how we do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then people</font>

111
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,400
started like running and screaming and

112
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,049
so then the security thing was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

113
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,280
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this we're calling it</font>

114
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,108
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way this crowd can be</font>

115
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,459
controlled there would have to be about

116
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">12 more people there to have some sort</font>

117
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,089
of organization and so it sucks because

118
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,099
security canceled the event and I didn't

119
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to meet everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's none of</font>

120
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,680
you have sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> me emails saying you had a</font>

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">great time don't feel bad but I do I</font>

122
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,460
honestly I do feel bad even if it's even

123
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,650
if you say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not my fault I feel bad</font>

124
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,690
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I really really like I</font>

125
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,070
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see everyone I had security</font>

126
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">there to like eight even though</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he said</font>

127
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the event was only going 2-5 we're gonna</font>

128
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,650
stay like a ton of time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to</font>

129
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,909
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what it means for the future</font>

130
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,470
well one however we

131
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,460
work everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm definitely coming</font>

132
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,320
back to London I want you see and love

133
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,180
all of your faces but to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

134
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,890
definitely an eye-opening experience i

135
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,620
need to change how this works tandem

136
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,450
fields middle a day does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not work all</font>

137
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,940
police start looking coming over there

138
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,200
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are possible safety</font>

139
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,850
issues so one of the ideas were playing

140
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with is possibly like renting out</font>

141
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,900
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater and doing like a 90-minute Q&A</font>

142
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,550
kind of sword along the lines of like

143
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,110
what Kevin Smith does every now and then

144
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,430
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the money from like the cheap</font>

145
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,230
ticket prices<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we'll have some</font>

146
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,880
merch or something in the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

147
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,860
that to pay like security<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font>

148
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,230
working at the theater the venue and you

149
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,150
know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really like legit and</font>

150
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,620
after the 90 minute thing you know we'll

151
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,930
do the actual meet-and-greet controls

152
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,540
not scary for anyone because I really do

153
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,670
I loved meeting you guys you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

154
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,620
