00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,989
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was probably amazing</font>

18
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,250
back then I was like the first movie

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,329
that ever used computer-generated

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,850

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,729
tron legacy than if I had not seen it

28
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,280

just you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that it was it's</font>

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,210
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those movies that you watched a</font>
