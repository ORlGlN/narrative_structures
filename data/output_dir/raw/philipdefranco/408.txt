00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
sup nation it is it's Wednesday if you

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,980
didn't know I'm taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small break</font>

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,990
from filming the philip defranco show to

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,660
extend on a point but it's also kind of

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,610
a standalone video so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm making this</font>

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,700
for you right now a ton of people asked

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,680
me based on last night's State of the

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,480
Union and also yesterday's philip

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,730
defranco show what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,279
getting taxed more for making more money

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that two year free</font>

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,529
community college should be a thing now

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,779
before I move forward I<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:31,859
mentioned this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the philip defranco</font>

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,440
show but I'm pretty I'm pretty moderate

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,170
like guns and gays I love them<font color="#CCCCCC"> both go</font>

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,620
for it I don't care in California<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,120
considered a conservative in the South

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm usually considered a raging liberal

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,610
it's whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

21
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,590
fiscally conservative socially liberal

22
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,960
for the most part<font color="#CCCCCC"> I it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so that's</font>

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,149
such a big hurdle for so many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,340
get past which witch is which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,649
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> but for the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> higher taxation</font>

26
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,140
yeah part of it bothers<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,390
go outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pick it but it bothers me</font>

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">it feels like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes away from being</font>

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,280
an entrepreneur and building a business

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,950
that's pretty successful and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,439
more money and now i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give more</font>

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it away but that's also because i</font>

33
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,220
don't agree with a lot of the things my

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,159
government spends money on like I'm for

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,680
bettering the people but there's a lot

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,380
of waste and there's a lot of a lot I

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean I I love my country I don't think</font>

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,939
of America's the best country<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

39
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,560
world but that's because statistically

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,259
or not it I enjoy living here though and

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,200
I like being a part of the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,390
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of my thing is yeah I</font>

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it sucks but it all you also have</font>

44
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,899
to take into account the<font color="#CCCCCC"> current system</font>

45
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,290
actually makes it better for me on a

46
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,509
spreadsheet to fuck all my employees

47
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,610
like it it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better on a</font>

48
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,890
spreadsheet for me to take all my

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,649
employees put them to part-time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

50
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,020
also hire more part-time employees so I

51
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,189
didn't have to cover their health

52
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,890
insurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't have to care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

53
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,079
them hey you're sick sorry you don't

54
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,550
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> health insurance with us hopefully</font>

55
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,500
you're paying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yourself or your</font>

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,870
other part-time job makes you enough

57
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,590
money

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,269
and I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna plug this other</font>

59
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,610
person into your spot while you're sick

60
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,099
so go fuck yourself but I also I don't

61
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,950
have that sense of thinking I'm not I'm

62
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,560
not walmart in that capacity I'm very

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,620
much paid sick leave yes make that a

64
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,750
thing someone shouldn't be worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

65
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,440
being sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the fact that someone</font>

66
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,310
doesn't have health insurance that's

67
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,640
crazy for me full-time healthy employees

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,580
is a good thing a healthy employee is

69
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,129
hopefully pretty productive right if you

70
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,569
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sick person what do they create</font>

71
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,569
more sick people productivity sucks so

72
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,030
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it benefits you on the</font>

73
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,299
whole huh on the whole to take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

74
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,610
your people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's why even</font>

75
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,610
though I dislike being taxed more big

76
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,360
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also can't can't hate a program</font>

77
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,150
that would then offer opportunities for

78
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,730
two years of free community college I

79
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,230
think two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years for you community</font>

80
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,370
college for those that are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

81
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,860
it and deserve it yes one hundred

82
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,750
percent yes if I knew specifically my

83
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,430
taxes were just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that I'm like</font>

84
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,530
yes let's do it because I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

85
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,519
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> complain about welfare states and</font>

86
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,590
and welfare in general and and crime and

87
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,900
all these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are symptoms of</font>

88
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,569
people not getting opportunities you

89
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,459
can't complain<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it if you also</font>

90
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,989
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to give someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else a fair</font>

91
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,200
shot I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to college and I had my my</font>

92
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,209
pell grant my little daddy pell grant<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

93
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,120
had loans i had a job and I busted<font color="#E5E5E5"> ass</font>

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
and I I didn't eventually graduate

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,019
because it was such a struggle and

96
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,760
there's so many people that were in

97
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,010
situations like mine and worse and they

98
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">succeeded and I fucking congratulate you</font>

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,799
and and it shouldn't take away from what

100
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,370
you did for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next guy to not have the</font>

101
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,769
same struggle it shouldn't be such a

102
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,500
struggle to get a better education so

103
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,700
you can better yourself in better

104
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,040
community and better your country that's

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,889
that's where my my thinking is and

106
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,079
that's why I really hate when I hear an

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,048
old<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy say like blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blah about</font>

108
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,000
this generation and they went to like

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,440
you're from a generation if you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

110
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1960s right yeah the 1960s you</font>

111
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,400
went to college for pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much free if</font>

112
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,160
you got the Pell Grant in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1980 if you</font>

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,840
had the Pell Grant I think you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,060
covered like eighty percent tuition has

115
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,050
gone up 1120 percent and 35 years

116
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,660
medical care has gone up six hundred

117
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,220
percent and we all know like what a

118
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,690
crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking bombastic bombastic yes</font>

119
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,180
bombastic clusterfuck that is in the

120
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">United</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States and the tuition is almost</font>

121
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,479
double that I think food was around

122
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,889
200-250 percent so you can only talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

123
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,199
much about inflation the Pell Grant I

124
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,289
believe covers<font color="#E5E5E5"> just under one third in a</font>

125
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:06,479
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places for tuition so you need</font>

126
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,690
all those things so you're not that

127
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,699
generation that that's criticizing

128
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,770
doesn't understand that struggle also

129
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,900
and I mean this with as little offense

130
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,440
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a little offense intended if</font>

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,479
you're criticizing Pell<font color="#E5E5E5"> grants and free</font>

132
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,039
college and your daddy and your mommy

133
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,590
paid for it please shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fuck up I</font>

134
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,930
love you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but shut the fuck up no one was</font>

135
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever a little kid like 12 years old</font>

136
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:31,979
going I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the laziest piece of</font>

137
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,500
shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not contribute to anything or</font>

138
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,139
realize any dreams in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my life ever no</font>

139
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,530
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one I hope I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and maybe it</font>

140
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe there is like a phase but people</font>

141
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to feel joy they want to feel some</font>

142
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,060
self-worth in some way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm for it</font>

143
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">last with America falling behind in so</font>

144
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,539
many ways I think at times we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

145
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,580
reach a hand back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help one another</font>

146
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,620
forward I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's it's very</font>

147
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,659
necessary and we know it works like if

148
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,849
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the GI Bill when vets came</font>

149
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:02,130
back from World War two they got free

150
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,750
college and what they found with a

151
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,759
congressional study was for every dollar

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,009
invested seven dollars came back and

153
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:10,440
it's because if you have a cog in a

154
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,509
machine it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> helping contribute but if</font>

155
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,960
you have a broken cog a cog but that

156
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,240
doesn't do anything you get zero what's

157
