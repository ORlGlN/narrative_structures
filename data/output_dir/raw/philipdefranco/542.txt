00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
it's interesting because I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> holding the</font>

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,620
camera today and for some reason that

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,569
makes me feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,220
time we've talked in a while I think

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,960
it's because it's what I used to do when

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,099
I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold a 5d in my hands walk</font>

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with you talk speak words and</font>

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,949
that was in my mind me connecting to you

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,680
but on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDS when I put you on a</font>

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,090
tripod and I turn on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lights I turn</font>

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,279
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AC so the sound is good I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,070
like it's a shell but free right here

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you it's me and you against</font>

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">worlds or you against the world with me</font>

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,239
cheering<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the sideline or something</font>

16
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,530
but these words have been stuck in my

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,379
head for a little bit and it's not about

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,680
anything in particular but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,219
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling in my brain it's not</font>

20
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,100
depression I think it's fear fear of

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,820
being complacent fear of having

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,069
succeeded and then feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm a</font>

23
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,960
walking gatekeeper people see me as

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,330
access to something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want not</font>

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,820
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they think I'm going to use</font>

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,740
that guy but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I fear that sometimes</font>

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,110
that's all I offers sometimes that's how

28
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,439
I feel I know that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not reality</font>

29
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,409
but reality is perception so how I

30
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,520
perceive the event is kind of my reality

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,220
yeah just want to throw that it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world</font>
