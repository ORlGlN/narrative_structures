79
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,790
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fun um it's a little</font>

80
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,470
claustrophobic<font color="#E5E5E5"> at first because you're</font>

81
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,090
like especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the visibility is</font>

82
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,830
pretty low it was like five to eight

83
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,890
feet visibility and we went down 40 feet

84
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,460
we had to do like uh you know like the

85
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,200
exercises<font color="#E5E5E5"> where like you simulate when</font>

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,300
bad should happen so like out of the

87
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,590
outer air and and cramps which isn't

88
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big of a deal but that out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of air</font>

89
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,910
was really interesting because um I was

90
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,440
buddies obviously with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lindsay were</font>

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,500
buddies with super buddies uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> buddies</font>

92
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,420
just mean you pair up because you know

93
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,730
if some some shit goes wrong like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

94
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,740
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> run a tear then you can grab</font>

95
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,870
the UH<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alternate regulator which is</font>

96
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,990
what you breathe out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and you're fine</font>

97
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,300
and uh yes we did that and uh Lindsay

98
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,700
being the lovely person that she is like

99
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,410
you be the person that's out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin's</font>

100
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">look okay I trust you underneath 43</font>

101
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,950
water and uh and so I did the air and uh

102
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,810
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and then we went up together</font>

103
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,310
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was interesting because the cord</font>

104
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,250
or the hose is really only like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 23 feet</font>

105
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,440
long so you have to go up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

106
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,210
level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was scared that she's gonna</font>

107
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,150
bring me up too fast because she loves a

108
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,340
filling up her BCD which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

109
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,650
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're wearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll just</font>

110
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:40,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">look no no PCT and which under water is</font>

111
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,020
so you know we went up we<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh we pass</font>

112
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,580
we're good and so we have one more week

113
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,680
so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our scuba cert and then we're</font>

114
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,590
kind of thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just going directly</font>

115
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,910

116

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,320
allows you to go like to the cooler

118
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,630

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,570
giant blue hole i guess um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>
