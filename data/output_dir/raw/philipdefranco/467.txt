with Joe it's not I actually I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,270
song but I hate the song at the same

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,530
time and I kind of feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way</font>

20
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,060
with movie I thoroughly enjoyed the

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,740
movie but with people saying that it's

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,180
better than the Lion King it makes me

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,860
angry I can't they just be two separate

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,570

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,710
probably saying this because I don't

<font color="#CCCCCC">have a four-year-old daughter because</font>

31
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,710
that girl would probably drive me insane

54
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,639
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people could clap and he was</font>

completely fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them until we got</font>

56
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,510
to the actual venue and anytime we tried

57
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,040
to put the earmuffs on he would start

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,930
crying so we decided 86 the earmuffs

59
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,910
have him just come out while he was in

60
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,560
his half sleep and people

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,150
snap their fingers instead of cheering

62
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,459
but still super weird but hilarious and

63
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:25,390
then everyone cheered when he was

from ever having any roots of any sort

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,689
in any conversation and ya can kind of

146
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,969
feel alone but if in that video he<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks</font>

147

<font color="#E5E5E5">about the disconnect also then becoming</font>
