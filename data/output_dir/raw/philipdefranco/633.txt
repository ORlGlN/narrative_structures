movie Fargo probably one of my top 20

21
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,220
movies of all time is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Coen brothers</font>

22
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,140
black comedy where william h macy plays

23
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,280
a car dealer who conspires with

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,410
hot-headed kidnappers to kidnap his wife

25
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,210

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">course it doesn't hurt that it's a Coen</font>

42
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,649
Brothers written and directed movie and

43
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:30,569
I will say it is probably william h macy

44
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:33,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">s best acting ever ever ever ever when</font>

45

you watch this<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie you go oh that's</font>

46
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:37,859
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do dark humor that's it this</font>

47
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,209
movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course was also a big deal to</font>

48
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,159
me because it's steve buscemi it was his

49
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,560
first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ever noticed him and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I fell</font>

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">in love with Steve Buscemi who made any</font>

51
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,100
movie that he was part of that much

52
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,289
better like you couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have Armageddon</font>

53
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,179
without Steve Buscemi screaming with a

54
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,579
rocket between his legs you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't but ok</font>

55
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,560

59
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:01,859
Brothers movies I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a big fan of</font>

60

kidnapper self and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into the</font>

68
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,530
story because if you have not seen it

69
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,879
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great movie to experience</font>

70
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,170
and of course it shows the desperate

71
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,390
dark places<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

72

<font color="#E5E5E5">nitty-gritty people it's also that most</font>

77
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,280
every scene in this movie is memorable

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,380
