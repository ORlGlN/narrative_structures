28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,230

00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,760
and half<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time he would he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,860
busting his ass at his job so I would

36
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,720
hang out my stepmom who is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,280
of the the best people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever in existence</font>

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,380
like the the sweetest lady ever and I

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,580

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,910
things with maybe that's my favorite

45
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,860
memory is because my dad did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

46
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,350
full custody I saw him a lot less and I

47
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,830
wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes if it is the fact that</font>

48
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,660
I didn't get to be with him that that

49
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,090
much you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that same</font>

50
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,820
the heart grows fun with distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

I was older he went from fun dad to

56
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,000
