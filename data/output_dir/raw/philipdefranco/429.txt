alone from time to time if maclife says

154
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,710
do you take for granted the money you

155
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">have or do you wake up every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day amazed</font>

156
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,530
that you weren't poor anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

157
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,480
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came from a place in young</font>

158
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,620
adulthood where I didn't know if I could

159
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,990
eat a day because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did not have money</font>

160
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just like waiting for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a check</font>

161
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,540
to come in it definitely gives me

162
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,180
respect for what money can provide

163
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,950
people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are moments where</font>

164
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little tiny bubble I</font>

165
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,040
do take it for granted and don't

166
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,360
understand that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the norm</font>

167
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,340
anymore but also having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a baby having a</font>

168
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,960
family<font color="#E5E5E5"> and being the breadwinner for the</font>

169
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,640
household will also give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a respect</font>

170
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,600
for money I think that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

171
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,430
reasons I'm not just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give trace</font>
