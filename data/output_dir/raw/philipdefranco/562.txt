screaming my mom was always a very loud

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,510
person like and so she would really

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">scream so it bothers me to actually be</font>

23
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,199

39
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,939
awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> on two fronts because there's</font>

40
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,890
you know the philip defranco show and

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,479
and getting a lot of order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chaos</font>

42
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,299
that was that and then there's a for

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,329
human people's front which it really

44
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:40,829
makes me exciting because we get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

45
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,810
