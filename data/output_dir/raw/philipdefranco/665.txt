doing a London meet up I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just scared</font>

68

up or I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna schedule a next Saturday</font>

72
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,480
and too many people going to show up and

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,590
there's gonna be no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep that</font>

74
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,260
organized but I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of how</font>

75
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it I know a lot of people have</font>

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,860
see hot chicks doing something and it'll

107
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,730
be funny and then the day the day I was

108
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaving I was like no I'm completely</font>

109
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,350
changing the idea if we do that then we

110
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,450
only have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one day of videos but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we do</font>

111
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,610
the other thing then we'll entertain at

112
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,440
least sixty-five percent of our audience

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">our male audience until until I get back</font>

114
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,950
then the event of course a thirty-five

115
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,740
percent of women will hate me but when I

116
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">get back we'll realize how sarcastic and</font>

117
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,610
charming i am and go Phil I forgive you

118
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,480
for the constant boobies in my face

119
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,960
perfect and the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing on top of it</font>

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,240
I was like well we need to get to two

124
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,180
does the best and do that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

125
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,910
somehow it's turned into content very

126
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,230
very lowest common denominator we know

127
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,960
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get views and be a</font>

128
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">little dirty but that's only because uh</font>
