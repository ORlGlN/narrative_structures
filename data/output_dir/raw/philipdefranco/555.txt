house to look like my<font color="#E5E5E5"> office I just</font>

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,480
really like the color blue but also

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,489
because people like challenge and so

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,860
yeah essentially turned room my house

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,860
into the studio everyone that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh that</font>

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,469
works for the company worked here too

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,989
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a little little stressful</font>

20
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,059
especially when your lack what I can't
