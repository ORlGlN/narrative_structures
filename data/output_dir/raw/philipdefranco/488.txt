5k so essentially what it is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,180
a good start to the day a nice little

59
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">run-in come on lungs hurting my heart</font>

61
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:02,099
work no my lady<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday</font>

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,439
a nation I think where I am today is

63
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,120
just in a state of reclaiming things

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
that I want my time my<font color="#E5E5E5"> patience my</font>

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,930
general happiness my sanity my health

66
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,819
things that that are really important

67
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:18,010
because a lot of people have a ton of

68
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,040
things in the air lots of

69
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,290
responsibilities and worries and and all

70
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,970
these things but at the end of the day

71
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,299
you can't control a lot of stuff and if

72
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:30,010
you're not if you're not making what you

73
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,139
can control the best then we really have

74
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:34,450
we have no excuse you know that's where

75
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,010
that's where my head is if I'm not

76
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,500
taking care of my health then you know

77
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff the negativity maybe</font>

78
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,819
that comes to me because of it who knows

79
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,519
but I'll never know if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a better</font>

80
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,980
side to things if I don't take control

81
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,950
of what I can and that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

82
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,599
where i am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know a lot of people don't</font>

83
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,389
change until it's like you might die but

84
00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:00,370
it is also i wanna i want to feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> good I</font>

85
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,079
mean I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> great right now trying I'm</font>

86
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,519
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of how to say it because</font>

87
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's as realization but it's not like</font>

88
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:08,260
this life-altering to the point of like

89
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,970
my life is so negative and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>

90
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,530
make it happy I'm in a generally good

91
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,359
place but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it even better</font>

92
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,418
and I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

93
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:20,228
son and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know just do</font>

94
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:23,530
that and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though I'm the only one</font>

95
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,780
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it i'm also the one that</font>

96
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,360
stops it and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not unique</font>

97
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,139
to me it's a very human thing so with

98
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,599
that negative thought it leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

99
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:36,130
to a lot of positivity and I'm not gonna

100
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,400
be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like which work out</font>

101
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,979
some doing and blah blah blah but you

102
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:44,349
know I'm gonna try and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some change</font>

103
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,479
in my life and maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

104
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,159
that you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to what are the</font>

105
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,419
things in your life that make you happy

106
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:50,590
and what are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hate</font>

107
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,190
and what can you do what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do what</font>

108
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,449
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually control you can control</font>

109
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,639
some of it you can't control all of it

110
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's at least a very very smart</font>

111
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,039
start so with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought i'm gonna say</font>
