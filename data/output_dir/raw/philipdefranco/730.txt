1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,400
I know if you can see it but there is

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,619
there's the moon I love that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

3
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,160
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning you see the moon it</font>

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,370
reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of</font>

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,890
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> childhood every Monday my dad would</font>

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">have me because he had custody on the</font>

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,240
weekends like a lot of dads did and he

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,590
drives me over the bridge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,580
times you I don't you'd see the moon

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,280
then I really never never noticed it

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,610
kinda it's funny what your brain

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,440
associates with other things for some

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,870
reason I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> why very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few people</font>

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">know this either my brain associates</font>

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,970
chocolate with extra sketches

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,440
specifically when I see an etch-a-sketch

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,330
I think of chocolate they crave

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">chocolate strangest thing I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,059
makes me wonder what happened to me as a

20
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:05,980
child so yesterday we were talking about

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">a or I was talking about insecurity and</font>

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,270
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys were talking about</font>

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,360
insecurity in the comments and lot of

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,950
people are like to fill don't be don't

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,870
be insecure but I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like</font>

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,810
it's this it's this uncalled for thing I

27
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,450
mean we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be insecure</font>

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,640
sometimes it's unjust but sometimes you

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,350
know you're insecure about something

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,810
then you hate it then you change it I

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,100
mean that's that isn't that kind of what

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,240
we've been doing on a plot still down<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,550
pounds by the way wow that bird almost

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,420
hit me and yeah I mean here's the thing

35
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,870
is I'm very the reason I'm

36
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,030
self-conscious or I'm like oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god I'm</font>

37
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we're is cuz it's new you know it's</font>

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,510
new it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy it's it's a whole</font>

39
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,090
different experience but that's that's

40
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,240
the fun of being alive as being unsure

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,140
but the same time I'm I am awesome at a

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,120
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but let's change where</font>

43
