1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
people always say to me Phil how do you

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,350
maintain that sunny disposition you seem

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,540
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy all the time well I was gonna</font>

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,220
write a book<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because that seems</font>

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,019
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing all youtubers doing now</font>

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,550
but then I've realized like the way to

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,700
make impactful meaningful change is to

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,650
do something in 140 characters or less

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,600
or make like a top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 list so I'm gonna</font>

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,609
do the ladder that you here we go just

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,740
scream preferably find some place that

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,060
no one can hear you because they might

13
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,289
think you're being murdered and called

14
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,750
the police to what letting out all the

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,539
scene before you explode if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel</font>

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you're about to pop let it out</font>

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,050
consider it a controlled detonation

18
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,910
drink water like as<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as you get up</font>

19
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then continually throughout the day</font>

20
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,030
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're dehydrated you'll feel like</font>

21
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have less energy which will make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

22
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,870
angry and ultimately make you a loser I

23
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,520
say this as an on and off loser

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,559
considerate the oil to your car the

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,570
grease to your bike chains read and

26
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,250
write more if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to type it or go</font>

27
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,410
to pen and paper it's good put<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

28
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,120
in someone else's shoes for 20 to 30

29

minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a time and your own life get</font>

30
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,260
that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on paper even when it doesn't</font>

31
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,940
seem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot going on there's</font>

32
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,680
a lot going on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can help you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

33
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,090
sense of it this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually kind of</font>

34
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,799
ties into<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading and writing make your</font>

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
commutes matter whether you take public

41
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,820
do nothing whatever you need at that

<font color="#E5E5E5">time cuz when you really think about</font>

43
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,670
those commutes for the most part just

of the future clean up your crap nothing

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,700
makes people more anxious than just

49
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,500
living in cluttered world is a confusing

50
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,450
messy place and the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can</font>

51
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,549
do is have your home or your<font color="#CCCCCC"> work place</font>

52
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,320
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to be somewhere 90</font>

53
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,060

56
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,979
with many of the things our life so if

57
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,390
we don't take control the things we can

58
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">control you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have a bad day</font>

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,649
keeping your place or your car or those

60
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,600
things clean it's a way of showing that

61
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually respect yourself cut out</font>

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,240
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your day and sometimes it can</font>

67
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,409
come from a place of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

68
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,270
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you enjoy an example for myself I</font>

limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff down to like two hours</font>

71
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,350
a day after

72
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,060
for myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> it changes from therapeutic</font>

73
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,040
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem this also includes friends</font>

74
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
or just acquaintances that tell you you

75
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,310
can't do things people that make you

76
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel like you're not good enough people</font>

77
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,010
always try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-up you hold things</font>

78
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,900
over your head just in general make you

79
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,540
not as awesome as you can be we very

80
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,760
often become somewhat like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company</font>

81
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,770
we keep put your change in a jar<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

82
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,480
dollars in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pockets when you find a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it was your ten-dollar bill and you've</font>

85
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,370
always had it it feels like free money

86
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,070
and free money equals happy also<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

87
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,630
you get that change it eventually adds

88
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,880
up to something or you can put all of it

89
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,500
in a sock and beat down your enemies

90
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,660
with it just make<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself tired just</font>

91
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,310
physically exhausted rather than going

92
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a really really long job which you</font>

93
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,450
can do go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a full-on sprint do</font>

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,550
push-ups till you fall down punch things

95
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,680
preferably that don't punch back and are

96
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,410
also not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hurt your hands work</font>

97
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,600
in 90-minute blocks specifically on just

one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a time gives you that</font>

99
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,110
clarity it gives you that focus and at

100

the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that 90 minutes no matter</font>

101
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,620
what take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten-minute break</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

102
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,600
yourself that little 10-minute defrag

103
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,490
whenever you get the chance wear a shirt

104
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">right after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dryer</font>

106
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,130
lasts about just as long butter<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

107
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">makes everything better I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know why</font>

108
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,430
it just does sure there are a lot of

109
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,320
negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about butter but this is</font>

110
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,330
a big thing there are bad things in life

111
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,160
of varying degrees butter being on the

112
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,750
lowest scale of those you can allow

113
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,760
yourself in moderation will make you way

114
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,770
happier than just withholding happiness

115
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,750
from yourself volunteer and you can do

116
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,400
