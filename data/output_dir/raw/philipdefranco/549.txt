37
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,110

fat is it's it's your own weight fit

59
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,879
people fit people have to wear those

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">bands that add 50 pounds to their body</font>

61

00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day what I've been doing is all free</font>

66
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,849

you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean change is not going to be</font>

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,250
easy overall the really hard part is

126
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,930
going to be cut is going to come when I

127
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,570
hit that week where I plateau I know

128
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,860
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come it's happened in</font>

129
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,780
the past and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sticking with it</font>

130
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,720
what I'm saying is start off easy so

131
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,520
that it's not the worst<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in the</font>

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,780
world like if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to juice</font>

133
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,699
don't go straight to super green juice

134
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,979
go and get like stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has fruit in</font>

135
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,780
it stuff that actually tastes good so

136
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,729
that you can slowly work your way there

137
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:34,720
and so yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean my whole thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if</font>

138
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,220
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shit then</font>

139
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,930
stopping stop doing the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

140
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,780
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and and do</font>

141
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,919
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that you would</font>

142
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to consistently do or at least</font>

143

209
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,719
really helpful to me is I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

210
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,849
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set these goals and these like</font>

211
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,889
rewards that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give myself for each</font>

212
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,800
weight class I get down to so the big

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,449
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind is 210 at 219</font>

214
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,990
pounds i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can skydive by myself or</font>

215
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,430
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and learn to and my buddy Richard</font>

216
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,589
Ryan he loves sky diving so much he got

217
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,500
he got his license he can he's done some

218
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,539
badass stuff and he was like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

219
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you hit to 10 we should jump out of a</font>

220
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,799
plane separately because I've only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

221
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,328
done it attached to<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone's back but</font>

222
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,680
he's like you know you jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

223
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,380
plane

224
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,400
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I'm going to reward myself</font>

225
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,230
because right now I'm technically still

226
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,290
over the weight limit so reward myself

227
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,540
there but what should<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do like 200</font>

228
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,870
pounds 190 pounds 180 pounds so just

229
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,940
think of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reward system for me so in</font>

230
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,140
the comments down below but also if

231
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,730
you're a part of plot think think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

232
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reward yourself and not with</font>

233
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,690
like a chocolate cake because that that

234
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,400
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just that's backwards</font>

235
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,730
thinking I get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of that but it's</font>

236
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,500
just it's just harmful to you what is

237
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you would you want to</font>

238
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,480
