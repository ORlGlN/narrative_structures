to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about me specifically an update</font>

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,070
because today once again was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday but</font>

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,079

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the first days actually know this</font>

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,420
whole week i really haven't I haven't

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,120
been stressed out and and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me and</font>

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,129
some of you guys can relate especially

21
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,170
if you're already working part of me or

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,109
even school part of me felt worried

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,670
because I was like I'm not stressed out

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,438
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my mind am i doing something wrong</font>

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I realize no stress isn't a good</font>

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,770
thing it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that cover of Time</font>

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,140
magazine stress is it was like a

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,630
negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it could in small doses</font>

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,200
like like root beer or weird sex like

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,759
it's not something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do all the</font>

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">time it should be a treat or marijuana a</font>

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,700
treat once again not drunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> or high</font>

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,530
everyone always thinks I am in these

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,930
videos which really makes me worry about

35
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,200
my personality but I think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dalai Lama that said it and he said</font>

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,000
human beings are the weirdest thing once

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,770
again I'm gonna paraphrase human beings

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,869
are the weirdest fucking things on the

40
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,149
planet because when we're young we will

41
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,829
trade our youth for money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and success</font>

42
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,110
but once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are older and successful we</font>

43
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,970
will trade our money<font color="#CCCCCC"> drunk trying to</font>

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,909
regain our youth and it's true it's like

45
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,009
I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a YouTube meet up about a week</font>

46
00:01:59,009 --> 00:01:59,650
and a half

47
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,710
and there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these 20 to 40 40</font>

48
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,850
year olds talking about all their

49
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,680
projects and like they're busting their

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
ass and dying and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm like</font>

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
motherfucker you been doing it for four

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,300
years and four years not a long time but

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,410
you're killing yourself and you don't

54
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,170
even seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be enjoying it and and and</font>

55
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,500
obviously joy is not the end all be all

56
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean i'm not i'm not an idealist and</font>

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,920
that way I'm a realist but success isn't

58
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,110
just money that's the only thing that

59
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,840
YouTube's really shown me like obviously

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,580
it makes things easier and I like to be

61
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,390
able to help my friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and family but</font>

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,580
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> said no to a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

63
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">would mean more work more stress but a</font>

64
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,480
lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> money because it just it didn't</font>

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,590
seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that would make me</font>

66
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,330
happy now granted that might sound

67
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,250
hypocritical because i have several

68
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,990
businesses the largest of those to

69
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,970
Franco inc which of course is the philip

70
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,459
defranco show even this to a smaller

71
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,450
extent but SourceFed SourceFed I think I

72
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,420
and I believe it to my core to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

73
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,370
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everything I'm doing because</font>

74
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,519
it is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so great and then FHP</font>

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,100
for human people's we're hiring in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,989
next two months<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're hiring six to</font>

77
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,840
eight people because things have been so

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,850
successful with my merchandise other

79
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,180
stuff like custom designs like this like

80
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,680
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just and it was just really cool</font>

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,930
stuff we're taking on a lot of extra

82
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,420
youtubers because we offer we better

83
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,730
rates then who either guys out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their</font>

84
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,550
district lines and spreadshirt so you

85
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,100
know just taken on that load right

86
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,670
ladies oh right no I'm a creepy person

87
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,780
sorry but those things excite me they

88
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,570
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't stress me out I'm not</font>

89
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,730
working a million hours a week I'm

90
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,160
focusing on what I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

91
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,130
and and I guess I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky enough that</font>

92
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,130
it works out and I mean a big part of

93
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is bringing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a lot of the new</font>

94
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,590
town anyways mean point that i do want

95
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> convey if there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a point in this</font>

96
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,720
because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really no point to vlogs</font>

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,600
is stress is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in small increments</font>

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,410
but don't don't kill yourself over it

99
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,870
figuratively or really don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

100
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,769
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to youtube confessions tumblr</font>

101
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,060
everyone that likes youtubers wants to

102
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,770
kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves and these videos are the</font>

103
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,540
only thing would stop you that is

104
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,840
Terrell acts on to something else I'm

105
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,720
the weirdest person on the planet

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
youtubers the weirdest people on the

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,030
planet do not attach your sanity to any

108
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,160
of us because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a bad move just</font>

109
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,390
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know life is this weird tragic thing</font>

110
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,740
but it is sort of fantastic and so I

111
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,390
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> main point especially because its</font>

112
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,090
final season<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about this</font>

113
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,870
because a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

114
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,250
messaging me about how they're like

115
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,740
stressed out about finals you could pass

116
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,140
or you could fail finals you still might

117
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,300
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a job or you might get a job</font>

118
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,980
completely unrelated to anything you're

119
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,810
doing everything in this life<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a silly</font>

120
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,250
silly joke just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it too</font>

121
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,070
seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the time</font>

122
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,720
that seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trick took success</font>

123
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:25,700
to success anyways I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go yeah</font>

124
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,230
love you faces and I'll see you next

125
00:05:28,230 --> 00:00:00,000
time
