30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,180
and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like doing the show has made</font>

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,280
me realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,810
their their beliefs I may not agree with

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,470
it they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have their their ideas of</font>

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,759
how things should work i don't agree

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,939
with it but i do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 as the best as</font>

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,100
i can has<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone that may not share</font>

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> belief you know argue their point</font>

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,350
for them so that it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just me going</font>

39
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,750
these things are the way they are

40
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,079
because that nothing's black and white

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,720
in this world except um um um graham

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,200
crackers mmm Graham guy had sugar-free

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,170

44
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">amazing but I the thing is if you eat a</font>

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,860
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sugar free stuff all at once you</font>

46
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,220
shouldn't because well hey you can try

47
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,479
and then you can find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens</font>

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,070
so that'd be funny I'll be funny for me

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,659
you feel me react don't film your

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,750
reaction that'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird but I think I</font>

51
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,790
would be as aware I've definitely I've

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,170
definitely changed throughout the years

53
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,220
I'm a little less liberal on some things

54
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,889
I'm definitely a little less

55
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,390
conservative on some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know that</font>

56
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,270
my a pain

57
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,100
on capital punishment has changed

58
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,840
throughout the years but I think that's

59
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,130
the whole point right i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

60
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,410
develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> DeFranco show is all about me</font>
