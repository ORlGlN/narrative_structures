23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,170
only is so many of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are harassing</font>

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,790
people for cash or you know something

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,650
ends you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what part of me feels bad</font>

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,570
for them but then part of me is like if

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,490
you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spend your entire day</font>

28

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's productive for society</font>

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,630
and I can't obviously hate to these

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,439
people because there are a ton of

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,420
homeless people that are that really did

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,119
just fall on hard times or they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,159
like they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> into drugs and it ruined</font>

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,229
their life and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font>

37
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,460

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,290
where I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help everyone but then I</font>

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,210
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> these places these places in</font>

40
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,560
my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I'm just like fuck that</font>

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">dude because what in my mind what</font>

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,720
defines a person it's not it's not just

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,759
their successes it's not just their life

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,100
it's how they bounce back from a life

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,280
shit on them it bothers<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean I</font>

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,659
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on from homeless people</font>

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,430
because homeless people are homeless

48
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,710
people but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and your life you</font>

49
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,469
you hit a hard time right what do you do

50
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,780
do you give up because then you're that

51
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,180
kind of person do you persevere you're

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,799
that kind of person if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

53
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,169
wade through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and then it</font>

54
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">just sits still there you're that kind</font>

55
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,870
of person

56
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,510
those are the kind of people that are

57
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,400
that are in the world and life does that

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,580
to you a lot like shits on you a lot

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,280
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bounce back so many times</font>

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,830
and well in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my life I wasn't</font>

61
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">even bouncing back i was just</font>

62
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,420
bottom-feeding<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting</font>

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,190
through through a life and that's the

64
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,310
thing is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not better than anyone else</font>

65
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,420
most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> successes in my life are</font>

66
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,030
because I kept trying even though I was

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">failing half the time is have to keep</font>

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,549
trying like with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this project lose an</font>

69
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:46,170
Olsen twin that I'm doing every now and

73
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,310
you know I realize I can fail every now

74
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,629
and then I can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't</font>

75
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:00,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a habit of it I don't just give up</font>

76
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,879
because then that's the kind of person I

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,370
am a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things and the ways that</font>

78
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,920

lying to their viewers about who they

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,239
are because they feel bad about it or

84
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,380
they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people will look down</font>
