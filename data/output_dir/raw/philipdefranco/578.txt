00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,600
talked to you in about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week and that's</font>

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I've been so busy but it's not</font>

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,639
like the other kind of busy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good</font>

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,769
where I'm like there's loss secret stuff

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,870
and exciting I was just I've been

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,139
playing video games like crazy for two

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,690
days two nights now<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like six to eight</font>

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,029
our gaming sessions playing a dead

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,010
island with my buddies and if you are

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,170
unfamiliar and just the premises it is

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,939
not this video is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sponsorship I</font>

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">just love this game dead island and when</font>

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,289
i say i love it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fun to play</font>

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,360
but also sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most infuriating</font>

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,640
thing on the planet because the game

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,380
still has like a well it feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,760
lot of bugs but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really but kind of</font>

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,960
but it's awesome it's kind of like a

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,379
mixture of borderlands where you you

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,520
know have an RPG sort of system with

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
fallout with zombies I think that's

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,170
probably the best way to put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,960
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun it also</font>

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,730
has some of the most stereotypical

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,180
characters like your tank is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,010
giant black guy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he punches things</font>

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,820
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fists then you have the</font>

29
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,189
football player that uh throws stuff

30
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay ex cop shoots stuff and then of</font>

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">course the person i'm playing is the</font>

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,850
asian<font color="#CCCCCC"> girl that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good at karate</font>

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,439
and also swords so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

34
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,119
essentially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road class but it's so</font>

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,430
it's so much fun especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

42
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,810
really really exciting and this is kind

43
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pseudo view a review / me just saying</font>

44
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,290
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's up this is what i'm doing is</font>

45
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,240
it like the random moments that you take

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,470
away look this game is not gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> win</font>

47
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,229
like game with a year or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

48
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,299
that just because there are moments that

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,310
you feel like God's so

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,439
glitch to fuckin ruthless come on joke

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,350
somebody but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like so many</font>

52
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">moments where like you're getting chased</font>

53
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,669
by like 17 zombies and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your guys</font>

54
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,008
gets like stop and so you like run back

<font color="#CCCCCC">and you heal them and you hit everyone</font>

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
with a machete that you have turned and

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,730
doing a lecture machete and then you run

58
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,959
away again or my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> was was this</font>

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">Matt was recording some footage and it</font>

60
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,670

<font color="#E5E5E5">that we ever saw one and this is how we</font>

66
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,400
handle

67
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:04,890
you gunfire he's on fire as awesome

68
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,989
that's like the second attempt opened

69
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,370
like that's the kind of moment

70
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,500
everyone's like for like 50 seconds

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,450
that's like everyone going on remember

72
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,370
the thing that just happened that was

73
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,959
like I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a moment like that</font>

74
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,760
since I played halo 2 multiplayer and I

75
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,400
like won the match by jumping a warthog

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,180
aim to a dude and we and we won and I

78
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,959
empty but um the point of this video is

79
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,019
one if you have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten the game I</font>

80
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,280

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,569

82
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,310
