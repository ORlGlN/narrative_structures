00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,820
hey interwebs so my buddy Matt was

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,230
telling me about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea called a</font>

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,730
tornado vlog I don't know if you came up

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,980
with this idea or if you just stole it

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,540
or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's</font>

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,250
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> a blog where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just spin</font>

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,680
around no cuts whatsoever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try</font>

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one point across and at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,310
of that point we try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand up and</font>

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,960
see if you don't kill yourself I feel

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,489
like you should do this though not

12
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,439
around knives or sharp objects or maybe

13
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,200
even not at all but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey</font>

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,460
I know I haven't made a vlog in a few

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,260
days starting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little nauseous but</font>

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll hook you going through it my main</font>

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,480
thought is about my my main show I can't

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,210
decide how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want these shows to be</font>

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,120
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just I just I think they're</font>

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,890
too long now you know I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

21
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,449
shows and maybe I'll just start

22
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:51,710
splitting stuff up whether it's

23
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,149
splitting video game stuff and actually

24
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">just putting it on LTA same for movie</font>

25
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:58,550
stuff and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing something</font>

26
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">else I know spin on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my mind so some</font>

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,079
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be giant</font>

28
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,870
Lee hugely majorly drastic or probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

29
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">come just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give you a heads up</font>

30
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,660
love you long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and let's stand up</font>

31
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,150
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try and go toward</font>

32
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,280
which isn't working oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay bring it</font>

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
it's all I think that you guys should

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,890
make tornado vlogs and post them to me

35
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,950
or if you want you could do hurricane

36
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,570
blogs which I imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be two or</font>

37
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,120
more people all doing it at the same

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,990
time and just see how that works out

39
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,640
okay I'm gonna go open the show and

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">hopefully that throw Oh</font>

41
00:01:53,270 --> 00:00:00,000
the fuck up
