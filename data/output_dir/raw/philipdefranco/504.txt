embargo has been lifted i was i was

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,150
lucky enough to get the privilege to go

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,269
to the LA event for titanfall and to do

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,070
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quickie review it's so awesome</font>

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,630
obviously if you've watched my main

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,680
channel you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is a game</font>

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been excited to work for a</font>

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,890
very long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and something that's</font>

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,720
scary with these kinds of games<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hype</font>

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,609
gets really really built up any wonder

13
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,710
is the hype real and for this I gotta

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,390
say yes also I'm pretty sure I'm a part

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,369
of the xbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> one beta for this game which</font>

16
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,900
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be in a few days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i'll be</font>

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,430
streaming my gameplay live on twitch.tv

18
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,860
/<font color="#CCCCCC"> DeFranco games and uploading some of</font>

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,420
the clips to be part of vlogs but not

20
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,040
probably full<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos and really quick</font>

21
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,719
for those of you not know titanfall is a

22
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,210
first-person shooter / neck killing

23
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,670
combat awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinga majig afters event</font>

24
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,079
after the quick jump into training so

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i learned how to wall jump which is</font>

26
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,530
awesome there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> three main types of</font>

27
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,539
battle first one was where was 6 verse 6

28
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,280
everyone already<font color="#E5E5E5"> had their mac and the</font>

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,260
main goal was to destroy all the other

30
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,360
macs the second was a 6 verse 16

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,949
deathmatch where you start out on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

32
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,539
ground and you earn your mex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,129
last one was along the lines of your

34
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,500
domination capture a capture be capture

35
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
see you slowly get points for having

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,530
those places and by far<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that was</font>

37
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most interesting game type and</font>

38
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously the big question in a game</font>

39
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,869
that has max are the mechs<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh p is it</font>

40
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,820
essentially just you play with mex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

41
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,799
then you can also be outside answer that

42
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,450
as of right now is no but even in the

43
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,220
three hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> of playing with all these</font>

44
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people you saw the game and how</font>

45
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,729
people played slowly evolved both

46
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,320
because you're unlocking stuff like at

47
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,939
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 you get a sniper rifle all of a</font>

48
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,350
sudden your gameplay changes you get

49
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">something for your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> titan instead of</font>

50
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,710
having a she'll be thrown<font color="#CCCCCC"> down poisonous</font>

51
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,000
smoke but also because you start seeing

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,020
weaknesses where something was

53
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,460
indestructible perfect example of that

54
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,750
is in a game<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of a sudden</font>

55
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,070
everyone had mex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were just</font>

56
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">having an all-out mech battle I got out</font>

57
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,369
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine and you can have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac follow</font>

58
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,140
you and protect you or guard a certain

59
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,670
spot on my loadout I had it set so my

60
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,980
character<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go invisible</font>

61
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,120
now and then which makes so you can

62
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,830
still kind of see them but not unless

63
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,240
you're specifically looking for them

64
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,530
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would double jump onto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the back</font>

65
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a Mac open it up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start shooting</font>

66
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing massive damage a smart player at</font>

67
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,300
this point would realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

68
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,680
receiving<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of damage if they</font>

69
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,090
don't have friends they would eject and

70
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,290
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kill you to get these many</font>

71
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,940
skirmishes in the midst of a much bigger

72
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,380
battle and also something that was

73
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,640
interesting is even though it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 verse</font>

74
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
6<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good number of AI opponents</font>

75
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,419
and allies those who can kill so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

76
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,400
slowly get your mech faster also some

77
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,600
that are more beefy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can deal</font>

78
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,160
you damage and then if an<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual human</font>

79
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,930
player comes up you're pretty much dead

80
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,790
and while at first I was on the fence of

81
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,410
AI being in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

82
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,790
definitely made it feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like there was</font>

83
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,530
more happening all the time rather than

84
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,240
just being alone on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one part of the map</font>

85
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,980
all this being said while I loved being

86
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,480
outside of a Mac<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I felt like a</font>

87
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-man army destroying these big Titans</font>

88
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Titans when you are in them are</font>

89
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,930
amazing they're awesome as far as human

90
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,580
players on the ground not in Titans<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

91
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,350
dead if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find enough the Titans are</font>

92
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,480
amazing the fact that you can customize

93
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,520
them as well as your character that

94
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,410
really opens up a lot for late game and

95
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,640
I'll be very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see once we</font>

96
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,570
get into the beta what other

97
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,340
customization options do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get that</font>

98
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,110
late game also<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a few things as</font>

99
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,880
awesome as<font color="#E5E5E5"> finishing off a Titan that</font>

100
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,380
you've been beating up by ripping out

101
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,630
the pilot or calling yours in right on

102
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">top of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so all of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said as of</font>

103
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,740
right now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am so so excited I have not</font>

104
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,260
really enjoyed multiplayer at this kind

105
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">of level since probably halo 2 so big</font>

106
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,160
things of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys from respawn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both so</font>

107
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,390
that I could play this game that I was

108
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,040
really excited and also so I could meet

109
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,110
us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many awesome cool gamers I met Met</font>

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,290
bunch of other dudes but that is it for
