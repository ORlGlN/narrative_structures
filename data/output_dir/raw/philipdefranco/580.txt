9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,359

<font color="#E5E5E5">defranco you're a bad person so what's</font>

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,019
happened since the last time we talked

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,488
well one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and watched some my</font>

14
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,320
friends shake the groove things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,940
actually I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never go out I never</font>

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,329
really go out I throw myself into work

17
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,550
and then laying down because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,989
exhausted but went out into the human

19
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,550
world the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other night to this place</font>

20
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,520
called the howling moon cafe and it was

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,370
awesome I ran into so many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,500
the nation which makes sense because a

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,570
lot of tubers they can noticed in malls

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,309
and stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have like young</font>

25
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,140
audiences I guess it makes sense that I

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,660
get noticed in like bars or places like

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,460
that because my audience is mainly like

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,220
18 to 35 male than the females are there

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,909
too but in much smaller a quantity and I

30
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,220
don't know it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun and then over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,360
weekend I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like you know why I'm</font>

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,070
gonna go hit Runyon Canyon again I'm

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna start working out because i feel</font>

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,140
kind of blase about myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,479
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel terrible because i'm</font>

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,580
nowhere near as fat as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was last year</font>

37
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,979
but I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leveled out at 220 225</font>

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,750
and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like I'm gonna do that and</font>

39
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,979
then in lamest way or most embarrassing

40
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,799
like almost as embarrassing as like when

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,909
I crashed my rx8

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,549
that was embarrassing but I went down to

43
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,829
get this is very weird talking about how

44
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:50,549
I'm in the shower because you're

45
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,590
imagining me naked and my bag in your

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,829
head because it's not true<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I went</font>

47
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,469
and I got conditioner but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tilted my</font>

48
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,719
head too fast apparently that's a thing

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,569
and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm that out of shape and I</font>

50
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,159
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stretched</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and blah Blee blah I</font>

51
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,128
pulled a muscle / pinched nerve and I

52
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,318
had not been able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn my neck past</font>

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,540
about here to the right which is

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrible because I would go to</font>

55
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,019
restaurants and I like I can't turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

56
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,459
neck without turning my body and it's

57
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,349
weird so then I feel like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>
