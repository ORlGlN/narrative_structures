00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,530
gym and sleeping on someone's couch and

64
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,400
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what foods you can eat</font>

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,250
because and drinking as little as

66
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,000
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> like last night I was at a kind</font>

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business meeting and it's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

68
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,840
those places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they buy food for the</font>

69
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,000
table and you're like oh shit I don't

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,519
want to be disrespectful and not eat

71
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,019
because where I come from if I don't

72
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,970
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't eat your food that and</font>

73
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,260
if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't eat the food there</font>

74
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,959
I'm kind of disrespected and so it's

75
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,150
just like choosing you're like okay okay

76
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,100

77
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time protein and it's like just</font>

78
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,959
balancing it's the emergency food right

79
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,940
your emergency choices and stuff and

80
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,799
