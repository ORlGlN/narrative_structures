23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,350
and then the hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the people that</font>

24
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,199
want something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that lost is not whether</font>

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,119
didn't answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the questions they had</font>

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,759
so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but that's that's</font>

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">not what lost is I mean you know it</font>

38
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,770
answered a lot of questions but if

39
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,570
you're the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of person that's like oh</font>

40
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Superman's ruined because I don't fully</font>

42
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,479
speeds on earth if that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,729
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bothers you then no I</font>

44
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,680
mean that there are certain things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,840
lost where you're supposed to speculate

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,570
you're supposed to have an educated

47
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,610
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> on why some of the stuff happened</font>

48
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,560
like some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

49
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last night that</font>

50
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,759
were hating on the finale<font color="#E5E5E5"> was what like</font>

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,040
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the baby</font>

52
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,829
I still don't understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I</font>

53
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">would speculate and what money educated</font>

54
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,850
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she was allowed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

55
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,380
the baby<font color="#E5E5E5"> and able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the baby</font>

56
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,659
because when Jacob<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going around</font>

57
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">touching people and making them</font>

58
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,310
candidates and protecting them<font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

59
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,799
became like<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and so she was able to</font>

60
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,139
have a baby<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not die that's the way I</font>

61
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,970
saw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of course it's like well</font>

62
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,599
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

63
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">and paradox and these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just things</font>

64
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the island is right</font>

65
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,200
the island<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and the amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,269
that were confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the ending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

67
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:22,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of astonishing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me because I was</font>

68
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was watching the news after lost and</font>

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that had just come out and</font>

70
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:29,579
this lost expert was like well from what

71
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,859
I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like they were all</font>

that and with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's let's talk</font>

78
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ending was</font>

everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened the crash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having all these flash sideways</font>

86
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,549
which were like oh it's this alternate

87
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,879
reality that they've created<font color="#CCCCCC"> where where</font>

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,799
they didn't die you know it's completely

89
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">different it's this place that they all</font>

90
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,669
created and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can call the</font>

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,530
after they died<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was no time</font>

95
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,680
right there the time it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant</font>

96
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,280
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because everyone that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was there had</font>

97
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,560
died at different<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason</font>

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know this is because Ben and</font>

99

<font color="#E5E5E5">survive long after much long after Jack</font>

104
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,739
died<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the very end that's how you know</font>

105
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,599
that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this place</font>

106
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then of</font>

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,810
course Jack's father pretty much

108
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,639
explained the whole time thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

109
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,650
they died<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they died after this is</font>

110
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,469
a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together and so</font>

111
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:06,180
that's why I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> confused by how many</font>

112
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">people were confused except for the fact</font>

113
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:08,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you missed like three lines of</font>

114
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">dialogue you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relax but they left us</font>

115
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,030
without an<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer and that you're</font>

116
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,650
finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that they wanted to</font>

117
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">find each other because they went</font>

118
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,680
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

119
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,149
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> move on together to what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her after life right</font>

121
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,099
and so people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were saying that the</font>

122
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,479
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> island everything like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

purgatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> no that</font>

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,449
was in purgatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> if anything the</font>

125
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,400
alternate reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of a</font>

126
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,860
purgatory<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> holding place before they</font>

127
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">could all move on together and then</font>

128
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,530
people were arguing<font color="#E5E5E5"> well okay well we're</font>

we're we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> Walt and Michael and you</font>

130
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,710
could say<font color="#E5E5E5"> well it might have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

132
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,520
well they didn't deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

133
