41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,620
stamina especially when you're just

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,500
pounds soon there's also the exciting

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,049
news that I mentioned on today's<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDS but</font>

50

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,549

58
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,400
like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to think of what I can</font>

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,650
say this is another thing that annoys me

60
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,690
there's a lot of stuff I'm not not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

61
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,430
like good stuff where it's like we're

62
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,700
working on a secret prod I'm just not

63
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowed to say I don't think that's</font>

64
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,940
really lame there's a lot of lame stuff

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,030
that's happened recently i'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda</font>

66
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,680
it's interesting right because in this

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,870
position<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be like the</font>

68
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,000

<font color="#CCCCCC">while having to deal with all the things</font>

72
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make you personally feel anything</font>

73
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,980
but that and so that's why i get excited

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,569
about the live shows because we get to

75
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,569
begin to have fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> on stage we get to see</font>

76
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,340
a beautiful place and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to see</font>

77
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,489
and interact with people and ninety-nine

78
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,169
percent of the time it's awesome I find

79
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself lost a lot and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

80
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably that's something that was</font>

81
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,769
pretty relatable in a YouTube sense I

82
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,220
saw ksi youtuber big FIFA guy you

83
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,280
probably know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> him if you don't</font>

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,930
entertaining to watch in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion I</font>

85
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,180
saw him go on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Twitter rant a</font>

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,608
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago and it was like how he was</font>

87
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,519
stressed out and you know it's a lot of

88
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and and people were just like take</font>

89
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,599
a break just stop posting videos and he

90
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,620
was like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

91
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,740
understand I just can't I can't just

92
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,440
stop it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's an addiction but</font>

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
once it turns into a business if you

94
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,910
stop posting for like two weeks that's

95
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,650
an eternity<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time I have stopped</font>

96
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,430
posting for two to three weeks at a time

97
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,590
for any reason could be vacation could

98
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,750
be limited schedule even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the small like</font>

99
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">paternity leave of you like you drop in</font>

100
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,240
views and it really has a negative

101
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,400
impact on your future so if you want

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,870
this to be your career you eventually

103
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,540
hit a point of like you're just you're

104
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,010
just trudging through it it's not the

105
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,000
worst thing in the world you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>
