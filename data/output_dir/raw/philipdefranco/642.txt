DVDs esencia as a good time and the

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,980
reason the prestige is interesting is

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,480
because it's another Christopher Nolan

57
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,300
amounts of detail and so later when we

58
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,680
spoil it for Pete starts off with the

59
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,270
two magicians<font color="#E5E5E5"> hugh jackman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Christian</font>

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,160
rivalry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that magicians have and so it's</font>

63
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,900
there it's there naturally until

64
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,420
Christian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bale silly goose accidentally</font>

65
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,250

fucking up each other shows Christian

68
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,650
Bale getting shot in the hand a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

69
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,350
drama ladies calm down so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> drama but</font>

70
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,400
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> things start looking good for</font>

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,900
Christian Bale meets a girl they have a

72
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,880
baby and he invents this amazing trick

73
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,290
called the transporting man where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

74
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,720
enters a door and almost instantly exits

75
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,280
a door on the opposite side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stage</font>

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,320
looking like he instantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> transported so</font>

77
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,209
this makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hugh Jackman insane goes to</font>

78
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,830
almost every show and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's like how is</font>

79
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,450
he doing it so he decides to his own

80
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,280
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> called the new transporting man</font>

81
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,480
but because he doesn't know the trick

82
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,370
uses a stunt body which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a dude</font>

83
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that looks like him which lucky for him</font>

84
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,150
is an alcoholic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he gets a new show</font>

85
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,040
girl Scarlett Johansson which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

86
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,930
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and his show has amazing success</font>

87
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,730
because he's a better showman than

88
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,350
Christian Bale then Hugh Jackman because

89
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,030
he's a sex of my aunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts having a</font>

90
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,770
sexy town with Scarlett Johansson that's

91
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,750
a good deal but it's not enough warm

92
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,980
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how to do the</font>

93
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">trick because his version of the trick</font>

94
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,100
he doesn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the bow he doesn't</font>

95
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,380
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the prestige he's by himself</font>

96
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,660
under the stage and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he cannot</font>

97
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,400
be content with what he has he sends

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,540
Scarlett Johansson over to Christian

99
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,459
Bale who's actually he's a nice guy when

100
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,600
he's not screaming because you're

101
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,190
fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> up his lights and so they fall</font>

102
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,989
in love<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they get together which</font>

103
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,160
isn't a good thing because like I said

104
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,959
before he has a wife then things go back

105
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,459
and forth I keep bucking each other over

106
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,810
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna skip some certain parts of the</font>

107
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">movie for you Hugh Jackman comes out</font>

108
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,170
with the real transporting man his last

109
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,910
show and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing he enters this</font>

110
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,040
machine that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> made by Tesla who of</font>

111
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,540
course spent most of his life trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

112
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,720
control AC

113
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,890
alternating current and then almost

114
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,050
instantly he's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 500 yards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

115
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,940
taking his bow and this makes Christian

116
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bale insane</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,060
spoil the<font color="#E5E5E5"> move so it spoilers for the</font>

118
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,590
next 20 seconds skip<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead to the</font>

119
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,680
annotation here that'll be when the

120
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
spoiler has stopped it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

121
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,370
Tesla's machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually made loans and</font>

122
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hugh Jackman is cloning himself going</font>

123
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a trapdoor landing in a water</font>

124
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,700
tank letting himself die and then the

125
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,650
cloned version was over there and so

126
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,450
literally on each show he would have to

127
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,460
kill himself which is also how he tricks

128
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,300
the government into thinking that

129
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,160
Christian Bale killed him which puts

130
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,380
Christian Bale's character on trial and

131
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,030
then ultimately he hangs for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

132
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,890
Christian Bale and going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down like that</font>

133
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,660
it turns out Christian Bale was able to

134
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,890
do the trick because he had a twin

135
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,420
brother no one ever knew about he was

136
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,890
the most dedicated magician of all time

137
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,400
and so Christian Bale or his twin finds

138
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hugh Jackman shoots him kills him he</font>

139
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,180
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> babygirl back because Hugh</font>

140
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,650
Jackman was gonna be an asshole<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take</font>

141
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,030
his girlfriend him his daughter and they

142
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,040
go off into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sunset also Christian</font>

143
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bale's wife killed herself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in starlett</font>

144
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:35,680
Johansson left if that's notable and

145
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,030
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to all the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that didn't</font>

146
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to see the spoiler aliens right I'm</font>

147
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,890
joking ultimately is it is a story<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

148
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,190
how passion competition and obsession

149
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,830
will drive change will drive innovation

150
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,260
but at the same time it can and will

151
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,680
destroy you without flinching because it

152
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,990
can overwhelm a person because a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

153

being is just that a human being<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>
