other higher quality camera or a video

94
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera on this is for some reason with</font>

95
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,640
the iphone when you're shooting with a

96
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,980
nice camera and you're using it for

97
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,680
pictures it takes you know a bigger

98

100
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,380
the wide-angle lens but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you switch</font>

101
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> video it zooms in and you can and you</font>

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,720
can't zoom it back out and you know it's

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,580
