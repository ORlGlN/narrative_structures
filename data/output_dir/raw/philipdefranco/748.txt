you know I can be angry at something but

50
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,110
I just have to devote that energy to

51
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,930
something that's good just staying

52
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,450
positive and I find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm around so</font>

53
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">most of the time really positive people</font>

54
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,180
and I mean I come from a place where

55
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,370
like the word that the word of the idea

56
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work ethic was like we can tell</font>

57
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,880
those motherfuckers to suck our dicks

58
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,770

there's a you can be passionate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

61
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,940

65
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,209
energy man but just you know being

positive and and working towards

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,310
something and just like taking that

68
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,920
anger and that that world suck and just

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">pushing it towards something the number</font>

70
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,540
one thing that that bothers me is lazy

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,519
people not even just lazy people people

72
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,370

<font color="#CCCCCC">ah ah and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know in Hollywood</font>

74
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,730

75
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,910
really tells the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that just wants</font>

76
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,220
everything to just be perfect for them

77
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,320

82
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,150
take a whole different thing a lot of

83
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,950
people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a lot of kids these days</font>

84
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,239
when you ask them what they want to do I

85
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think what the percentage of people when</font>

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,120
you're like what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be when</font>

87
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,130
you grow up fifty-five percent of them

88
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,549
say famous they don't give the reason

89
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,530
why they're gonna be famous not like I'm

90
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,150
gonna be a singer like<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

91
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,549
when I wanted to grow up actually that

92
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,769
that's probably that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a true</font>

93
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,569
statement when I wanted to grow up I

94
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,630
wanted to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like a musician</font>

95
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,090
I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write music I wanted to do</font>

96
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,769
stuff like that and you know I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

97
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,410
to get the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I guess maybe</font>

98
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,120
maybe a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fame I don't know I</font>

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
think I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> too young to think like imma</font>

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,319
be this but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that because</font>

101
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,260
i was super passionate about it but so

102
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,668
many people these days just want to be

103
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,149
famous famous hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

104
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,580

105
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,720
know many people just just

106
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,020
on it easy and and I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I feel</font>

107
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,280
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to work towards that</font>

108
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,470
