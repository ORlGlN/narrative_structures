Internet's Thursday today I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,690
ass and I blame you actually internet

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,490
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh last night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was i was</font>

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,110
feeling kind of down<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put up a tweet I</font>

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,140
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey feeling that Wednesday</font>

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,329
should I rally and go with karaoke or

13
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:35,920
should I go into bed watch modern family

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,960
and pass out and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of a split</font>

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,610
decision but then I saw one specific

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,200
tweet that said when offered an

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,420
opportunity for a new experience or

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,120
routine you always take new experience

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,399
philip defranco and I was like that so

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,160
deep I have to go rally and karaoke

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,260
because my life could change forever and

22
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,399
so the easiest way to wake up I

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,290
literally just flung myself into my pool

24
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,090
god I took a<font color="#CCCCCC"> shower and then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

25
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,379
let's do this thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went out</font>

26
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,539
karaoke I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't gone to karaoke since</font>

27
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,328
I was 13 yeah when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was 13 and for some</font>

28
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,580
reason I was like hey my entire family

29
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,470
is here wasted why don't I sing a song

30
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,570
I've never even heard before so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13</font>

31
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,240
and I sang the songs dreamweaver so I

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,280
sang off-key it was a terrible song but

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
then the thing that scarred me with life

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,439
or I guess till 25 was I was walking off

35
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,450
the stage I tripped over the wires and I

36
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,830
fell off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stage in front of a group</font>

37
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,049
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and luckily it was it was</font>

38

79
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,500
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> night and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was something that I</font>

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,690
would have missed out on were just a

81
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,300
night in bed with my dogs which there's

82
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,620

83
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,360
of the day you know if I think about it

84
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,549
I am 25 which medically speaking that

85
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:48,079
means I'm either half the way through my

86
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,489
life one-third the way through my life

87
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:50,959
or a quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> way through my life if</font>

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,060
