00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,460
these glasses that are on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my face</font>

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,710
because I like sometimes keeping my

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,690
friends on edge not knowing if they

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,400
should watch what they say because I'm a

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">douchebag</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am driving i'm taking</font>

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,170
shocker in la is jammed and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,109
maybe we could chat I thought the weird

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,060
thing about this this vlog channel is

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I thought that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a video up</font>

14
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,219
last week and then come to realize I

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,930
haven't posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything in three and a</font>

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,629
half weeks I get so crazy crazy

17
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,120
sidetracked with all the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,320
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool things that we're about to</font>

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,829
do for I guess ourselves I always going

20
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,250
to say for you but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if if</font>

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,510
we weren't kind of doing the channels

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,520
for ourselves I think there'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,960
point in watching why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you watch</font>

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,610
someone that's just doing it because

25
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,160
it's their job plumbing that's not true

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are plenty of people on TV that</font>

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,399
just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's it's a paycheck</font>

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
that's sad that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad I was</font>

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,720
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now how the brain is mush</font>

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,890
like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's that after work</font>

31
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,799
after school mush we're like you think

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're thinking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything and</font>

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,009
nothing at the same time there's no

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,590
there's no structure it's just chaos in

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the brain and I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean in the sense</font>

36
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,610
like when you get behind the wheel and

37
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,430
then your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind just kind of turns off</font>

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,810
and then you're like how do i get home

39
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,320
what I mean is like right now right in

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,750

00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,060
stew all the things and none of the

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,360
things because I can't focus on them and

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,160
that's that's what my brain is and I

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,440
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why sometimes it's it's</font>

62
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,840
hard to go I'm gonna vlog because I also

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,390

64
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,120

<font color="#CCCCCC">like a job the fogs they feel like a job</font>

69

87
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,420
driving probably an hour or an hour and

88
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,000
a half for what usually takes me 15

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,890
minutes in the morning I love your faces

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,130
