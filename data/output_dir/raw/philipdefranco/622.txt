23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,070
finish the movie club up with shutter

24
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,870
island which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a movie described as</font>

25
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">world war two soldier turned US Marshal</font>

26
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,800
Teddy Daniels investigates the

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,090
disappearance of a patient from a

28
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,070
hospital for the criminally insane but

29
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,870
his efforts are compromised by his own

30
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,059
trembling visions and by dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cowley</font>

31
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,800
directed by Martin Scorsese so I am

32
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,969
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> very excited about this because</font>

33
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,890
I did read the book I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person</font>

34
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that reads lots of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> books but I am</font>

35
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,159
actually a little nervous because you

36
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,479
know you read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book sometimes you</font>

37
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,770
don't Joey the<font color="#CCCCCC"> movie as month you know</font>

38
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,630
cuz they change stuff unless you're

39
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,040
making the movie watchmen in which case

40
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,290
you literally just copy everything set

41
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ending you change up a little but I</font>

42
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,960
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna go watch this movie you're</font>

43
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,310
gonna watch 15 second trailer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

44
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,400
gonna talk about so this prison escapes

45
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,380
in the last 24 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

46
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,299
she got<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a room this is if she</font>

47
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,890
evaporated straight through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the walls</font>

48
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,329
to shutter island it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

49
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:39,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting movie and my general feeling</font>

50
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,990
of it is you know a kind of like I guess

51
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,130
the twists<font color="#E5E5E5"> and turns were kind of wasted</font>

52
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,420
on me because I did read the book I know

53
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,189
it was gonna happen I understood a lot

54
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,530
of the plays and angles I imagine even

55
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,179
if I didn't read the book the twist

56
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:51,770
weren't hidden super well guess it kind

57
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,479
of depends on how how often you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

58
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,280
the movies so what I would say is acting

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,810
is awesome I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean honestly you never</font>

60
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,250
know if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> movies gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be good because</font>

61
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,380
Ben Kingsley's in it and Ben Kingsley

62
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,640
must have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of mortgages because</font>

63
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,409
he's in like every three<font color="#E5E5E5"> movies at a</font>

64
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,030
release it shot rather well except when

65
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,830
other shots on the water which if you're

66
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,989
like not streaming it on a like 320 x

67
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,930
240 s tiny box the green screen looks

68
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,430
terrible but once again that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

69
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,540
being a<font color="#CCCCCC"> snub so my ultimate</font>

70
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,250
recommendation is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have not read</font>

71
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,840
the book watch this movie I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font>

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,069
you have read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you see it</font>

73
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,480
too then you'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like okay now</font>

74
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,670
i will always imagine the main character

75
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,560
as Leo DiCaprio that's about it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I</font>

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,790
imagine there are moments where I like

77
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,470
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wonder what's gonna happen</font>

78
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,660
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but nation more</font>

79
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,370
importantly what did you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

80
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,230
movie basically this movie is a woof aah

81
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,140
this movie is awesome I gave it a 10 out

82
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,640
of 10 you guys have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check it out</font>

83
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're mind and Leonardo DiCaprio get</font>

84
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,540
like really hard total<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fast shutter</font>

85
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,940
island is that tastic I tastic would be

86
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,069
only mind right this movie is<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing</font>

87
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,660

88
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really well directed visually it</font>

89
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,530
was really good the acting in this movie

90
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,079
was wonderful are you eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> or drinking</font>

91
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,959
anything they gave you know creepy<font color="#CCCCCC"> music</font>

92
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,280
that they had whenever something like

93
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,260
suspenseful is happening it added so

94
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,109
much of the drama and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspense mystery</font>

95
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:11,840
creepiness it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of creepy movie</font>

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,730
actually like some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people in it</font>

97
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,100
are just scary and honestly interested

98
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,260
surgeries in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brain freak me the fuck</font>

99
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,049
out I were so scared that woman in a

100
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:28,940
Cell suddenly going on like oh yeah what

101
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,010
the hell's going on what kind of did

102
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,450
spoil things for me is when this first

103
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,950
came out everyone was like ranting and

104
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,510
raving look oh you'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

105
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,980
ending<font color="#CCCCCC"> there such a twist you'll never</font>

106
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess the end when someone tells you</font>

107
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,250
before you watch this movie you'll never

108
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,439
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ending you automatically once</font>

109
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,130
you're watching it just guess the ending

110
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,140
DiCaprio I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

111
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,730
like during Titanic but now I just

112
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting old I don't know why the thing</font>

113

underappreciated actors in Hollywood

118
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,340
right now he should<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an Academy Award</font>

119
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,140
for something I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's fantastic</font>

120
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,090
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said before i'm a natural blonde</font>

122
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,380

but focus it less on<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and more on you</font>

189
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,820
because I am but one man with an opinion

that is equal to 1.75 man but you guys

191
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,830

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,370
it's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision it's a commitment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>
