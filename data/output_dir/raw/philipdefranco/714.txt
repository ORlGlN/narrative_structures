bad place I'm not overweight I'm just

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,140
above overweight so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that's pretty</font>

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,570
bad but any next that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even good</font>

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,719
considering I dropped 15 pounds so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,410
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we're starting to 36 the</font>

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,690
goal it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an experiment is to</font>

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,600
see if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get down to 216 know if I</font>

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,430
don't hit down to 16 not the end of the

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">world because if I do with do gain</font>

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,960
muscle that's great if if I don't get

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,640
that number but I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> better that's</font>

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,119
great but having that set goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a set</font>

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,650
amount of time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we see we can</font>

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,330
actually do it so how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,549
this obviously cut out a lot of bad

30
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,009
stuff work out some and the first thing

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,600
is that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it super low</font>

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,000
almost have no white carbohydrates and

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,130
that's essentially true unless it's

34
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,720
going to be right after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really really</font>

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,820
really hard work out garbage is scary in

36
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,260
general because so many of the carbs

37
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,580
everywhere even if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind</font>

38
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,500
of healthy it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just processed</font>

39
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,240
bullshit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stay away from that</font>

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,030
the second is um<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating a core group of</font>

41
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,560
foods that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to mix and match</font>

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,900
and that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sticking with a</font>

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,490
proteins the veggies and the lentils<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

44
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,190
you have black beans pinto beans egg

45
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">whites though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will probably a mix in a</font>

46
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,320
full egg with those egg whites you know

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,070
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little flavor chicken beef grasp</font>

48
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,590
grass-fed<font color="#E5E5E5"> beef because I'm fancy pork</font>

49
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,080
spinach veggies asparagus peas and of

50
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,910
course the way that'll work is<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh if</font>

51
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,139
I'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an egg whites maybe I'll make</font>

52
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,899
seven spinach have a spinach tomato

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">omelette and peas asparagus chicken bla</font>

54
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,380
bla black beans pinto beans essentially

55
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">this being able to mix and match so I'm</font>

56
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">not having essentially the same meals</font>

57
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,530
all the time but I am having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

58
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,110
foods in my general diet and on this

59
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">food i'm gonna pretty much eat these</font>

60
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,100
foods whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like because i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

61
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,380
be eating six to seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a day</font>

62
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">because one of one of the best things i</font>

63
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,620
learned from project lose an Olsen twin

64
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,610

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,380
drinks and stuff was good one of the

66
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,870
best things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me was portion control</font>

67
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">going from three giant meals a day or I</font>

68
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,060
look at them now and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font>

69
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jaya to six or seven smaller meals I</font>

70
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,350
just felt better in general I didn't

71
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,269
feel as way down where your<font color="#E5E5E5"> body feels</font>

72
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,489
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the Bloods going to your</font>

Reese

83
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,950
which actually shows if you get yourself

84
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">one day to just eat gorge yourself on</font>

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,230
really bad food your body will actually

86
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,970
be less interested in that food down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

87
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,500
road and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually mixes it up for</font>

your body<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you're not just having</font>
