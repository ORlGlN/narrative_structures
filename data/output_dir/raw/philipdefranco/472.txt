00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,430
relevant to everything and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font>

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,090
get going on it's like a reverse Hitler

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,739
essentially I know since the last time

18
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,420
they sponsor the blog a lot of ladies

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,190
we're like I love this service and I

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,600
didn't even think that ladies could use

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,310
this so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out guy</font>

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,200
or girl link in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the description down</font>

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">below but that said it does relate to</font>

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,310
this blog because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been asking</font>

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,950
myself recently what do you want to do

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Philip DeFranco I usually ask that</font>

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,600
question in my head but also still in

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that voice so I don't take it too</font>

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">seriously but it's been on my mind</font>

30
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,470
because I've well especially with all

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,810
the late nights recently I have time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">think although it is fragmented and a</font>

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,700
little messy what do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,280
because you always ask the question of

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,690
what do you want to do in five years

36
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,970
I've answered that question twice once

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,520
over five years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once semi</font>

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,220
recently but the question now with a kid

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,979
here is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next five years for</font>

40
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,840
the next 18 years the next what do you

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,690
want to really do with your life and I

42
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know you know I look at my life</font>

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,720
now and I have the house check I have a

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,649
kid have the girl I have pretty much all

45
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,410
the the solid base things that I've

46
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted in my life but then I have to</font>

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of other than these these things</font>

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,390
that I wanted what else you know what

49
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,770
else for the past 23 years I've thrown

50
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,489
myself into a studio of early days and

51
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,680
late nights and it has paid off and has

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,750
done well but it's kind of a long the

53
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,410
idea of a fad diet it is this massive

54
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,640
drastic move that's probably in

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole for the long haul not very</font>

56
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,500
sustainable so what do you want to do

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,600
and it's this question I think that

58
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,330
people should ask it doesn't matter what

59
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,270
age you're at just what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

60
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,280
do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't look at your life all the</font>

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,410
time I think it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just do like</font>

62
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,209
kind of checkups instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

63
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,060
obsessing over it but it's been making

64
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,520
me think like what do I enjoy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font>

65
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,280
spending time with Trey and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lindsay I</font>

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,520
like running recently it makes me feel

67
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">like not a piece of shit i just got back</font>

68
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,959

69
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,820

hell I enjoy playing video games but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

73
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,090
don't think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do that a lot</font>

74
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,330
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot i enjoy reading writing so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

75
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,239

78
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> place I'm in right now I think part</font>

79
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that is also related to my paternity</font>

80

in like I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like can breathe for the</font>

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,130
first time in forever I think my head

84
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,510
will also be a lot clearer after

85
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">DeFranco does la which is tomorrow I</font>

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,610
think it's in glendale seeing the nation

87
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,350
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> on stage with the nation and</font>

88
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,180
everything like that that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stuff</font>

89
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,730
that kind of like gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that energy</font>

90
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,390
back but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that those don't</font>

91
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,040
happen all the time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

92
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,470
to feel fulfilled and some capacity in

93
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,019
between the times<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love your faces in</font>

94
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,640
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want anyone take this as a wine</font>

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,760
of some sort I am generally happy and

96
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,120
good with everything this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of my</font>

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,589
random check up with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

98
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,880
psychiatrists that are not registered

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,080
with the state this is my just kind of

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,500
talking about where I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy but not</font>

101
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,450
one hundred percent fulfilled but that's

102
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,550
not really a bad thing because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

103
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,710
leave room for me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> grow and rear</font>

104
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,260
and that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am so what I'm gonna</font>

105
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,140
do is I'm gonna do<font color="#CCCCCC"> DeFranco does la rock</font>

some games and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna I'm gonna run</font>

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,890
some more and I'm gonna dust off my

00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,320
camera and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back into the photography</font>

111
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,330
stuff that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on hold during the</font>

112
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">last part of the pregnancy and then just</font>

113
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,250
start doing different stuff so if it

114
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,650
might suck but it's still different and

115
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,850
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's really what I want right</font>

116
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,470
now in nature I don't know if anyone is

117
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,140
in the same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mindset or has been</font>

118
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">there so I'll pass it on a question to</font>
