down below that's it let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,350
what advice would you give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a 22</font>

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,030
year old who feels a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost and</font>

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what to do with their life</font>

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,809
not really advice just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have</font>

16
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,239
the knowledge that everyone that's 22 it

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,040
feels like this and if they don't feel

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,750
like this they will feel like this

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,610
insecurity doubt feeling lost in this

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,079
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are not unique things just</font>

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,100
to you is always kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny when I</font>

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,090
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz it's those things</font>

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,340
that make us feel kind of lost and by

24
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,320
ourselves it really tie us to everyone

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,059
else in a boil and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask if someone handed</font>

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,100
you 1 billion dollars today what would

27
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,600
you change about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life / do</font>

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,459
differently might stop doing this show

29
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,979
so don't give me a billion dollars I

30
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,720
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> also moved back to the beach</font>

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,190
but not in Venice where my shit always

32
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,440
got broken into but maybe like Malibu

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,789
where I could technically buy a house

34
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">now I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a baller-ass house in</font>

35
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,360
Malibu but then I'd have to like eat off

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,040
the dollar menu then I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a</font>

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,780

89
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,690
some inspirational shit so that you

90
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,209
reblogged me on tumblers and retweet me

91
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,860
on Twitter's if you are passionate at

92
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,480
something and that also includes

93
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,640
becoming better and standing out in

94
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,610
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> strive and go for but some</font>

95
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,739
people genuinely are terrible at things

96
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,420
and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better by</font>

97
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,819
need to understand it might not be your

98
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,319
thing but random I see it on the

99
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,090
internet every year because there's so

100
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,040
many stupid talent shows on TV where

101
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,450
people are like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this thing I can</font>

102
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,860
do it's terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you find out</font>

103
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,390
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing it for 15 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

104
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,799
it's just it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thing that they</font>

105
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,120
should do you need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

106
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,769
in the world out there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go is this</font>

107
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,750
something that one makes me happy and

108
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,730
two I can live on because the real world

109
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,859
is not the inspirational bullshit we see

110
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:32,900
on tumblr keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind all those years</font>

111
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,299
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no money in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube but it</font>

112
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,920
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I loved and everyone</font>

113
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,150
around me was like what the fuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

114
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,829
doing I took a look at myself what was

115
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,510
out there and where I thought this thing

116
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,489
could go and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> double down on I dropped</font>

117
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,530
out of college I devoted<font color="#E5E5E5"> all my time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

118
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,780
any resources i had to this thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

119
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,730
came out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other end successful I look</font>

120
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,380
back at those videos I was terrible at

121
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,880
this trying to be someone I wasn't

122
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,590
something that already existed rather

123
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,030
than just being myself and speaking my

124
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,380
mind but I also don't think my job

125
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,049
requires that much talent other than

126
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,220
unapologetically speaking to my mind in

127
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,019
a room by myself and then later posting

128
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,819
it on the internet and knowing when I

129
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,829
find people funny and then hiring them

130
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,810
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on channels I make so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jarrow and</font>

131
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,760
people like you in this place<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

132
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's not one way or the other it's</font>

133
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,880
something that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to feel</font>

134
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,319
and it's something that you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

135
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,970
fail at<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried a bunch other stuff</font>

136
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,620
before this I thought I was good at it I

137
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,760
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could do something and people</font>

138
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,350
were like that stupid and it turned out

139
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,030
it was stupid they should I think with

140
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that question answered</font>

141
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,720
