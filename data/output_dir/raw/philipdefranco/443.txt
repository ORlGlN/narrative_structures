several different<font color="#CCCCCC"> butt wipes they also</font>

47
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,700
and I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned this on the show</font>

48
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,860
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I feel like it's</font>

49
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,330
more of Steve's<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing see if you've ever</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">loves them that much I feel like I don't</font>

55
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,959
have lots of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't talk about</font>

56
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">but maybe the line is at its drawn right</font>

57
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,610
before butthole I said it last video and

58
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think when i was talking to them like</font>

59
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,639
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more and more ladies or join</font>

60
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,109
the server side anyway it's an awesome

61
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,100
service i recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you check it out</font>

62
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,390
and that said I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

63
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,520
some big changes coming to youtube that

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to preface with a little clip</font>

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,190
from a big panel i was on called the

66
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,200
future of online video which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so big</font>

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,020
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i always up there and someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

68
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,050
I admired we both had different opinions

69
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,580
say Frank<font color="#CCCCCC"> was very of the mindset that</font>

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,110
communities around personalities are not

71
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,580
the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't matter and I'm</font>

72
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,340
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much healthy the other side I think</font>

73
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,930
we both come from those places because

74
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,970
our current jobs are those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

75
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,010
we think is the future so I suggest at

76
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,920
all things first is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,760
better this this notion of audience is

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,930
it self sustainable so in looking at a

79
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,840
few different folks and you kind of

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">drill down into numbers up to sixty</font>

81
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,800
seventy percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the views on most</font>

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,770
channels do not come from subscribers

83
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,990
right so there's there's there is does

84
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,470
seem to be this this inherent problem of

85
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,530
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> audiences driving itself</font>

86
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,900
and i think i think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> would love to see</font>

87
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,930
though the i guess the size

88
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,939
show that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from</font>

89
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:41,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Australia's most everything in verse for</font>

90
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,439
that it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> all based on some thoughts</font>

91
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,989
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thats a conversation of</font>

92
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,079
those what to watch and subscription to

93
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">be another click and they're being so</font>

94
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,659
mean equates to be actual page and so

95
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">many different ways to subscribe on any</font>

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,639
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> be called out across any their</font>

97
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,799
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media because i didn't think i</font>

98
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:02,190
think

99
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,490
is it for obviously there there's a big

100
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,890
bag of people sherry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the young</font>

101
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,580
standing there

102
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,420
at least for myself I had the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> core</font>

103
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,930
audience for the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> few years I'm you</font>

104
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,839
slowly<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was wrong and ultimately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,360
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to be a good thing I admire</font>

106
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,340
them I think they<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frank so smart and I</font>

107
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,780
think in a place where we're constantly

108
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,550
changing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and new things are</font>

109
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,990
happening it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to have different</font>

110
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,880
opinions of where stuff is going so

111
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,710
everyone tries it out and yet the best

112
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,590
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hopefully hopefully of what</font>

113
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,120
that thing is luckily even though

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube has actually said pretty much</font>

115
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as they that</font>

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,910
subscriptions don't matter i'm hoping

117
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,290
they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public setting and</font>

118
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a place where i signed an NDA is of</font>

119
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,440
course having been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,520
their changes that they're talking about

121
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,930
this year that they are putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

122
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,580
place and beta testing now and that

123
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,990
you'll hopefully see rolled out very

124
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,520
good things in general the first one

125
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,380
maybe not community<font color="#E5E5E5"> related but also</font>

126
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,150
very community related because it

127
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,830
revolves around video games and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as</font>

128
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">youtube will be allowing 48 and 60 frame</font>

129
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,670
per second video<font color="#E5E5E5"> something not that</font>

130
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,900
important if you're watching one of

131
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,220
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos in fact that can be a</font>

132
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,990
little bit jarring but very important

133
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,610
for video game gameplay it is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

134
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,230
largest communities here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on YouTube I</font>

135
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,520
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fantastic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because the</font>

136
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,830
difference is actually huge I started

137
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,110
streaming my 60<font color="#CCCCCC"> frames-per-second games</font>

138
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,760
on twitch at 60 frames per second and

139
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,650
it's so fluid it's a closer experience

140
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,910
to the real thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they also launched</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nap</font>

141
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,740
called YouTube creator studio now on

notification see your stats are now more

145
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,660
licensed songs and sound effects the

147
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,020
but most importantly and these things

148
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,700
really really do revolve around

149
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,230
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I loved it so</font>

150
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,390
much because<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube saw maybe I think a</font>

151
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,669
place where they had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> week and we're</font>

152
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:44,140
not growing so they were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just</font>

153
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect to stronger things and the first</font>

154
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,010
bit is a real focus on funding<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

155
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,930
integration of tip jar a way that people

156
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,000
can actually just give money to the

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">creators</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they support at any time</font>

158
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,240
for whatever reason that's something i

159
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,310
could see pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much any tuber taking</font>

160
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,750
advantage of but i think more

161
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,850
importantly the small guys the guys that

162
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,190
are not big enough to to get these

163
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,050
sponsorships or the brand deals and

164
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,850
people want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support them that is so</font>

165
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,880
so important and vital for for small

166
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,620
creators then very awesomely it seems

167
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">youtube understood that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know people</font>

168
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,950
need crowdfunding they sell merchandise

169
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,410
how do people do it they usually do it

170
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,090
with annotations so YouTube saw the

171
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,400
weakness that annotations

172
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,870
show up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone they created a new</font>

173
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,220
thing called cards which you can see

174
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,530
here it starts out as a long annotation

175
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,820
then it turns into something small that

176
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,500
does not take you away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the content</font>

177
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you then click it it brings you to a</font>

178
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,770
very fancy card all of a sudden boom

179
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,600
you're on for human people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm where</font>

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,310
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Kickstarter for some channel</font>

you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone or tablet and</font>

184
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,160

185
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,590
annotation shows up there which is huge

186
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,630
because like fifty to fifty-five percent

187
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,759

much time they they loved the content
