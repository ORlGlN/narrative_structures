00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">haha he's like he's like a little gay</font>

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,560
little gay dad I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just finished recording</font>

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,599
my review for mass spec to that should

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,849
probably be up wednesday or friday

5
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:14,610
depending on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put up next on LTA</font>

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,199
but anyway it's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird little things</font>

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,000
make me think about little things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,939
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mass effect to your team that</font>

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,830
you bring along on your missions affect

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,080
whether you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to actually survive</font>

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,570
that scenario so or whether a scenario

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,990
is easier or difficult it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

13
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,000
true for everything the people in your

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">life are usually more or less than you</font>

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,020
for every different characteristic for

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,800
example someone's in niceness someone's

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,219
either more nice less nice sometimes

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,750
equally nice and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,280
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is more nice ending on the</font>

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,719
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example if I ever have an</font>

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,760
agent I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want them to be less nice</font>

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,510
just a bunch of different

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">characteristics and I started thinking</font>

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is one perfect being and it's</font>

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,840
the unexpected one and that is a

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,000
psychopath a psychopath is very looked

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,460
down upon as an illness but if you

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,260
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it it seems like it's</font>

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,030
just an advantage this also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

30
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,260
makes me think about episode of house I

31
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,180
know a few people in business that are

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,560
like this i'm not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,409
hypocrites the liars those are there i'm

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,420
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Psychopaths maybe it's</font>

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,520
a borderline sociopath cuz these people

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,950
are characteristic iguanas the ability

37
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,509
to adapt to their surroundings and be

38
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,070
what they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be so as not to be</font>

39
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,200
destroyed and to succeed I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,090
wish I was a psychopath to live without

41
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,880
guilt or remorse it seems fantastic I

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,439
think the reason I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is because</font>

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a reactor that's my hobby / job I</font>

44
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,100
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about stuff because I'm reacting to</font>

45
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,210
and it's me speaking from my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

46
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,619
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it my heart but these</font>

47
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,560
Psychopaths are just actors in life they

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,630
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to react like I do so summary</font>

49
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,159
of this video I wish I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a psychopath</font>

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,750
