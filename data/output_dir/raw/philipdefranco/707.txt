calls mainly just calling out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,329
that I've been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact me and</font>

42
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,729
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this hour to this hour I'm</font>

47
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,480
pointless like eighty percent of you but

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,860
if you constantly check your email I

49
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,230
lose so much of my day with just

50
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,720
bullshit email so if I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus myself</font>

51
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,320
at like one specific time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful</font>

52
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,860
its beauty full so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I</font>

53
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,450
do and then I'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a personal line</font>

54
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,990
that uh that'll be like I use it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

55
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,270
of an emergency which will essentially

56
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,370
just be my dad and my girlfriend and my

57
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,380
mom calling me twenty-four/seven so

58
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,400
there will be that line I think that's

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I want to do I was just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>
