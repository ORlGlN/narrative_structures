5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,090
miles per gallon but it means my

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,010
personal goals and I want you to do this

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,720

84
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool to not have to just try and be</font>

85
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,310
funny and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people just like some of</font>

86
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,049
them are confused but a lot of them get

87
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,600
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's super fun and I definitely</font>

88
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter where you are your</font>

89
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,170
life how stressed you are definitely

90
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,700
always try something new whether it's

91
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,720
small like trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just learn how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,760
juggle three things right like just

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">three tennis balls see if you can do</font>

94
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,840
that or something big like learning a

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,488
new language just you know something

96
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,620
something else in five years I want to

97
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">own the internet I don't know five years</font>

98
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,360
is always hard five years you either

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,700
over like you super underestimate

100
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,310
because five years is a long time five

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,420
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago i made like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six thousand</font>

102
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,500
dollars here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was paying my way through</font>

103
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,510
college it's up my cry it's still

104
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,080
from that and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did one of</font>

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,030
these very long time ago and i

106
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,800
accomplished most of the stuff within

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,890
the year actually superseded it and it

108
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,930
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it helped it helps you you know and</font>

109
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think you should constantly change</font>

110
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,010
this thing so right now it just looks

111
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,060
like a bunch of a chicken scratch but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

112
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,700
definitely think that that that this

113
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,830
this pyramid will really really really

114
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,620
really really really helped you a lot of

115
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,510
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> say what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you attribute to your</font>

116
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,270
success um like everything everything's

117
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,610
a little lucky you know you know no

118
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,100
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how hard you strive sometimes you</font>

119
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,540

<font color="#E5E5E5">be motivated but really everything comes</font>

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,710
down to planning it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does so the</font>
