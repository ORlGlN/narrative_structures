hands are as wide as our chest also<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

39
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,030
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the</font>

40
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,829
next push up<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

41
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,840
standard pusher understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> push up</font>

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,030
all we do is just extend the legs out

43
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping everything aligned and what</font>

44
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,780
we're gonna do is gonna inhale and down

45
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,450
exhale up again keeping the elbows in

46
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,490
tight because we do want to focus on the

47
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,439
triceps as well and if you want to

48
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,179
intensify that a little bit you want to

49
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:45,469
push yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

50
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you're gonna do is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can just</font>

51
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">wring it out wide to a wide stance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push</font>

52
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">up and that is slightly outside of the</font>

53
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,490
shoulders all right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna make</font>

54
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,740
sure when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down your arms</font>

55
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,690
are in an l-shaped formation

56
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,150
right exhale up inhale down exhale up

57
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,310
and then for the final we're gonna take

58
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,290
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into what we call a diamond push up</font>

59
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> diamond</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> push ups we're gonna focus</font>

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,070
on the triceps even more now and what

61
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,419
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do is you're going to inhale</font>

62
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,780
down exhale up inhale down exhale up and

63
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,820
there you go for the chest alright so

64
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,110
now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna focus on the core</font>

65
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,000
stability that's what we want to cover

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,620
with the core<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay first thing we're</font>

67
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,750
gonna focus on a plane so with the

68
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,100
planks what we're gonna do and have a

69
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,960
modified plank first with a modified

70
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,820
plank what you want to focus on most

71
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,890
important is having the knees down on

72
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,810
the ground also having the butt in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

73
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,450
air that boils out okay in a plank

74
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,860
position that's what you want to focus

75
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,990
on there with the extended plane the

76
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,580
difference all you have to do is extend

77
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,650
the legs out now we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

78
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,420
most importantly in both courses keeping

79
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,280
our core engaged not letting our back

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,860
sink in nor again having our butts too

81
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,570
far in the air where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes away from</font>

82
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,830
the core that's what we're going to do

83
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,390
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

84
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit intense with the core all you have</font>

85
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,770
to do is in the extended plank raise the

86
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,810
right leg up hold it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> five seconds</font>

87
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,670
bring it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise the left leg up or</font>

88
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,470
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold up the right arm or the</font>

89
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">left on and that's what we have for the</font>

90
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,430
core<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have we</font>

91
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,140
have the legs<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the legs what we can</font>

92
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,430
do you can do we have three different

93
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">variations with the legs first day we</font>

94
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,600
have we have is sumo squats I love doing

95
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,459
the sumo squats because we focus on

96
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">adductors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to outer thighs as well</font>

120
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,030

121
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,280
