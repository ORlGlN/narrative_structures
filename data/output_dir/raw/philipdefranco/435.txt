stuffs based off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bungie employees</font>

didn't know i did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not personally have</font>

154
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,430
that experience and and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

155
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time that I got to where I am</font>

156
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,730
today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> spite of what people told me in</font>

157
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,490
spite of what my parents did and I still

158
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,080
always get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoyed when they</font>

159
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,910
get to try and like take credit for the

160
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've accomplished I don't</font>

161
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,000
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot but I kind of</font>

162
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,830
resented my dad for a little bit because

163
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,690
he kicked me out of his house because i

164
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,400
was going for this whole YouTube thing

165
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,530
and I granted<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was lying to him about</font>

166
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,120
going to college but it was because I

167
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,530
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he didn't support my dream</font>

168
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,150
which it only took me<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a month to</font>

169
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,100
realize he did not support it because he

170
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,450
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> scared for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and that's not to</font>

171
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,950
speak ill of my father I<font color="#E5E5E5"> love my dad</font>

172
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,960
more than anything in this world I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

173
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,120
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just it'sit's if anything it's</font>

174
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,500
made it it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where I don't</font>

175
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you know where the tough love</font>

176
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,980
starts and stops but it's something as a

177
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,660
parent<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I will figure out hopefully</font>

178
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,970
and not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ruin my child forever</font>

179
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,350
but on that note I'm gonna end today's

180
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,060
Q&A and the light just turned off so

181
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,410
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in here way too long main</font>

182
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,970
point I love your faces if you've not

183
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,320
checked out today's Phil DeFranco show

184
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,450
