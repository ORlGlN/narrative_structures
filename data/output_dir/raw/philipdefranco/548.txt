00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah we go no nation it's Monday night</font>

00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,020
to be 50 to 70,000 Abby that is still on

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,139
this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> the channel hello I just</font>

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,730
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey and talk to you about</font>

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,940
things that maybe aren't news and and

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,340
just kind of Babel because for the first

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,170
time in a very long time I have more

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,650
things in my head that I have said and

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,789
that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons that I</font>

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,769
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first personal channel in the</font>

11
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,750
first place rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> than showing you my</font>

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,840
boring-ass life and so right now on my

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,890
mind i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a1 liquor in my brain which</font>

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,500
feels good but at the same time tomorrow

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to stop</font>

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,800
all substances entering my body not not

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,960
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like they are out of</font>

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,690
control but because i feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like i just</font>

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,579
need to test myself in the same sort of

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,390
way that i originally tested juicing

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,649
drinking juices instead of just eating

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,750
food<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if i can do it</font>

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,609
just kind of kind of give myself a

24
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">checkup a test which actually along the</font>

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,090
lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the juicing i am doing great</font>

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,310
right now fluctuating between 210 215

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,470
pounds which is great because when we

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,030
start started product lose an Olsen twin

29
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,259
I was 236 pounds and I feel great but at

30
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,180
the same time I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been exercising</font>

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,400
a lot doing resistance training anything

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,710
of that sort and so I don't feel like

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,700
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaining muscle but I</font>

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,689
definitely have been losing weight<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

35
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,130
I've noticed a lot of the comments which

36
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,170
have made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,530
saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I look much thinner</font>

38
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,210
specifically on the other SourceFed live

39
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,880
video people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are like wow feel so thin</font>

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,950
and honestly that was the only reason

41
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I kept that video up because you</font>

42
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys well not you guys some were very</font>

43
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,340
mean about the sourcefed crew and I was

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,829
like I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down but I'm</font>

45
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,720
getting so many

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,750
it's which is a very selfish reason to

47
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,540
keep that up but uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm doing really well I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,050
either insanity or p90x I kind of feel

50
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,180
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do uh insanity because I</font>

51
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,400
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like you know I'm building</font>

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,990
up endurance ladies not just just cuz I

53
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,120
haven't tried it and I have done p90x

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,540
for a month at a time but now that i'm

55
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually eating healthy sans this liquor</font>

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,270
that i am<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking right now i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i</font>

57
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,709
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna mess around with that</font>

58
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,160
but in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel pretty good I mean I</font>

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,070
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently there's been like random</font>

60
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,890
hate online which I haven't experienced

61
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,530
probably since the the ISA the<font color="#E5E5E5"> comic</font>

62
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,360
incident which if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't remember</font>

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was when ASA who is very nice</font>

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,100
gentleman was misled by another

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,620
gentleman that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I called some</font>

66
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,660
body and had his account I think was

67
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,160
turned off it's been such<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time</font>

68
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,800
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently there was this kid</font>

69
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,260
well no I keep saying kid he looks so

70
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">young and so it throws me off but I</font>

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,720
guess he's at he's a a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-something guy</font>

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
i guess i don't know i consider anyone

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,190
younger than me kid and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

74
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,280
detrimental term but um<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah so he</font>

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,800
says I feel body I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I did I</font>

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,950
did I didn't bod I was like wait I mean

77
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,450
I understand youtubers back<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

78
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,610
did bought but I was like I stuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

79
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,070
like talking about hot girls and using

80
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,630
their pictures with the thumbnails which

81
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,209
is completely within the limits of terms

82
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,120
of service I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I started</font>

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,220
including including my friends marina

84
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,340
orlova hotforwords in my videos randomly

85
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,110
so that I could use her sexiness

86
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,140
my thumbnails but yeah it's always

87
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about but people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

88
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">eye are so passionate even well I'll get</font>

89
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,610
correction people on the internet are

90
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,090
often passionate and a lot of the time

91
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,090
misinformed so so there was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

92
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,630
then generally everything else has been

93
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,240
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most part there was a</font>

94
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,610
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an sxephil video that I</font>

95
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,670
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dress someone was like filled</font>

96
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,880
you compared gay rights to<font color="#E5E5E5"> female rights</font>

97
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,459
to race rights that's not the same thing

98
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:13,900
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand where people are coming</font>

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,760
from because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from place</font>

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,730
like you know race and sexual preference

101
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,350
are different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and in my mind</font>

102
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,360
sexual preference is something that we

103
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,960
can't control like I love vagina because

104
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,990
I love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join I can't control that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

105
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,490
can't think you know what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

106
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,300
really interesting penis I can't I can't

107
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,910
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see like gays women</font>

108
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,560
black people or<font color="#CCCCCC"> judge general race as</font>

109
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,270
something that you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> control that</font>

110
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,410
you were there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were born with that</font>

111
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,510
you shouldn't go like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh man I wish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

112
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,800
could switch that up like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

113
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,490
should just own and be who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so so</font>

114
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,290
that was something and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

115
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,090
not even about gay rights I think it's

116
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,270
more along the lines of be who you are

117
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,479
be who you are there's really there's

118
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,150
not much to expand on because I mean

119
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,270
people people over to kill you for how

120
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,520
you have an opinion or or being who you

121
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,130
are but you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you can only be</font>

122
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best you that you can be and there's</font>

123
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,870
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with just being that I'm</font>

124
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,110
not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best mean that I can be I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

125
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think anyone's the best them that</font>

126
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,860
they can be I think that's what you

127
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,070
always aim to achieve and you will

128
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,990
always fall short which i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font>

129
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,529
completely fine because if you don't

130
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,749
something to aim for then what's the

131
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,899
point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you breathing oxygen I feel</font>

132
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,029
like there is none but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just</font>
