00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,510
and quickly I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT sponsoring this</font>

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,000
address it and I just ha it's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,590
and you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a rock star game it's</font>

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,239
gonna be like Grand Theft Auto with

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,890
cooler outfits but it's not in fact

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,059
because you're playing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other side</font>

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,030
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go batshit</font>

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,190
crazy like in Grand Theft Auto I you

25
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,320
know be down some hookers but you

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,910
actually you get super penalized for

27
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,680
hitting anybody you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,510
penalized for your car getting damaged

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,030
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually less about shooting people</font>

30
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,710
and more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like chasing people and</font>

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,159
like investigation all investigation I

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,619
have never<font color="#E5E5E5"> been so excited to listen to</font>

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,689
a woman talk and then ask her questions

34
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what she's talking about and</font>

35
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,299
what's cool is i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you know</font>

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they spent over a hundred million</font>

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,920
dollars making this<font color="#E5E5E5"> game and you can see</font>

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,840
it because they have like all sorts of

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,450
notable actors and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> graphics are so</font>

40
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,009
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their face that you can</font>

41
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,659
actually like tell when they're lying

42
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,210
sometimes because what i would say i

43
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,790
have a big gripe about the severity of

44
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,030
the truth doubt or lie system the thing

45
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,460
about the truth fly or doubt system is

46
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,250
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's a little weird let me let</font>

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,570
me explain how will you handle the

48
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,759
interviews usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it changes how you</font>

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,909
solve a murder if if you get enough

50
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,399
points and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say truth you</font>

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,570
believe them you're like you're telling

52
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,219
the truth one hundred percent and you're

53
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,200
gonna go on doubt is when you think

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,219
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> lying but you don't have</font>

55
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,230
evidence and then

56
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,060
why is you call them out on the line and

57
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,280
you show them the evidence so here's a

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,949
quick example Danny did you take the

59
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:16,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">milk I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember any milk</font>

60
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,230
now here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's lying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like</font>

61
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,900
okay he might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> milk let me say I</font>

62
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telling me the truth</font>

63
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,200
but this is what happens what's up I

64
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
know you took the milk<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,690
just harassing everyone because you're

66
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,940
like that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred percent true and</font>

67
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,130
it just comes off like what up will you

68
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,460
killed her main point even though the

69
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,350
investigation system is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little weird</font>

70
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,660
i've spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> about ten hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the game I</font>

71
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,850
am only<font color="#E5E5E5"> about half way through from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

72
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,640
for my estimates and i love this<font color="#CCCCCC"> game</font>

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,770
despite it not being as much about guns

74
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,050
which it is fun when like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go on</font>

75
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,390
random missions and people run and they

76
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">shoot and they kill a cop I'll kill him</font>

77
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,080
if they kill a cop I'll kill him cuz I'm

78
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,989
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the LAPD oddly enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

79
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,130
like beat down mini missions and no like

80
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,660
getting them raped in jail many missions

81
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,430
which would be interesting oh so dizzy

82
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,780
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately this game shows me I</font>

83
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,760
would one be a terrible investigator and

84
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,360
two I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of Miss killing some people I</font>

85
