1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's wearing sunglasses inside kill him</font>

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,650
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came in think around with a vlog a</font>

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,810
little bit um looking at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,849

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,150

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,810

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,199

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,460
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell the difference between</font>

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,289
Japanese and Chinese is because I've

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,939
never actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> hung out with a Japanese</font>

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">person in my life no it's to the point</font>
