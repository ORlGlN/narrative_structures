00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
hello interwebs you and I we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,270
chat used to chat about the world things

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and other things and other stuff</font>

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,799
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting here on</font>

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,150
the couch I was like when was the last

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,020
time I just had a random chat with the

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,630
the people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and in the office and</font>

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,980
in there cause even though they

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,939
shouldn't be watching this in there

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,609
cause because they might die crash and

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">kill us someone and people will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,488
fire and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember when I when I</font>

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,200
started making<font color="#E5E5E5"> these videos essentially</font>

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,870
because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show people my daily</font>

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,870
life but then also because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat</font>

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,270
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just chatted about whatever not</font>

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,770
necessarily news it was a lot cheaper

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,360
than going to a shrink and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,210
any medicine in my body<font color="#CCCCCC"> um it was all</font>

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,620
natural it was from the earth it was but

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,719
we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know he would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,699
about sad things and good things and I

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,000
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was stirred up today when I saw a</font>

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,979
few things there's a few things going

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of my life that it will not</font>

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,390
reference right now but one thing that

27
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,670
caught my eye was I saw snooki on the

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,729
cover of Rolling Stone and I was how far

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,619
down as Rolling Stone come I mean

30
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">rollers don't need to be a magazine</font>

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,140
about music and and it would actually be

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,490
you know you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like oh I should</font>

33
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,750
definitely check that out oh that's

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,740
really cool that's really interesting

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,640
and then they have Snooki in my opinion

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,540
and no offense actually offense who is

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,659
essentially a circus bear with a hat in

38
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,490
a unicycle and and we continue to to

39
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,100
further perpetuate this idea that we

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,880
should idolize this little no offense

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,009
this dwarf nothing against dwarves I

42
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,240
mean technically she actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a dwarf</font>

43
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,409
because she is under<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 foot 11 yeah but</font>

44
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,840
but I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even as she suffers</font>

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">you short it's that she she is</font>

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,128
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that people</font>

47
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,739
should not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

48
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,000
like I watched the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jersey Shore and i'll</font>

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,950
enjoy the jersey shore because it's like

50
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,540
when you go to the zoo you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you uh</font>

51
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,870
you you look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the silly animals</font>

52
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,950
you don't want to be them but you know i

53
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,510
watched jersey shore cuz<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like Ali</font>

54
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,400
these fucking people I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decent human</font>

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,670
being who judges people because they're

56
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,540
different no but I was I was just

57
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,519
thinking like man how far has Rolling

58
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,010
Stone come and I mean we're all we're

59
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">all guilty of it and in some way shape</font>

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">or form pandering because we know that</font>

61
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,099
it'll get more attention I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

62
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,290
completely i understand that but it's

63
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,840
just like this big publication does I

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,889
don't know it just seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

65
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,450
stopped trying but uh yeah man and then

66
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,400
it makes me think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a about</font>

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,669
everything we're doing we us not even

68
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">just youtubers people online because</font>

69
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:04,750
there are people online that you know

70
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,340
it's all about the ideas and and the

71
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,220
talking and the words and the stuff and

72
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,430
spreading truth or lies you know and

73
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,590
other people the internet is a place

74
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,209
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you post stuff that couldn't get</font>

75
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,060
on TV or movies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's it's it's</font>

76
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,310
it's good for all I've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

77
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about what I do would I do and</font>

78
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,639
why and just why every everyone and

79
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,120

81
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,699
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to a very creative place I am</font>

82
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,879
a victim of repetition in the sense of I

83
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,060
have a manic cycle I haven't ever been

84
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,260
