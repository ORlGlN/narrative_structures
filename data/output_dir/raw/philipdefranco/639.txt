the havoc and violence that followed in

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,800
its wake and I'm actually really excited

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,449

31
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,940
thought was weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a documentary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">well back okay so cocaine Cowboys is</font>

44
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,670
actually a fantastic documentary and of

45
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,539
course the thing that makes a

46
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,700
documentary good is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the content is</font>

47
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,369
something that you kind of knew about or

48
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,469
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really interesting and it</font>

49
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:45,969
definitely covers something that I had

50
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,259
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea about and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was cook the</font>

51
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,380
cocaine<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 1980s they started</font>

52
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">off with the guys that were transporting</font>

53
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:52,990
it and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were making</font>

54
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,600
and how their lifestyles change and how

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,369
it affected the people around them in

56
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,780
the darker side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that world of the</font>

57
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,880
cocaine Wars where the Colombians and

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Cubans would mow each other down</font>

59
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,479
with like machine guns at parks or

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,099
wherever and the murder rate was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

61
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,149
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this world essentially</font>

62
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:08,590
discovering the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real life stuff that</font>

63
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,620
inspired like Miami Vice and Scarface so

64
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,780
the easy one two punch review awesome

65
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,250
definitely check it out it's super

66
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,569
interesting and the two hours kind of

67
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,220
just flew by I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the weirdest</font>

68
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,360
parts of the movie is when they start

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,879
interviewing this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> reavy was the</font>

70
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,950
godmothers enforcer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's just this</font>

71
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,629
this weird kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that likes to</font>

72
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,519
brag<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how he would kill people but</font>

73
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could see that he would have like a</font>

74
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,700
different side to him every now and then

75
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,200
we're like you would refuse to kill kids

76
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,090
he killed them at other times and it

77
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,400
ultimately brings up the the moral /

78
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,709
life lesson you live<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the sword you</font>

79
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,660
die by the sword and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course greed</font>

80
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,310
conquers all because if you looked at

81
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,470
like when the cocaine trade started it

82
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">was just a cash money business yeah</font>

83
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,590
people died here and there people got

84
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,120
busted here and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but things didn't</font>

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,380
get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hand until people started</font>

86
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,819
killing each other because they wanted

87
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,650
more and that's human nature always to

88
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,569
want more human beings thrive on

89
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:56,739
competition but there's a whole

90
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:57,849
different level when you have people

91
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,440
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the godmother who like take</font>

92
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,450
pleasure and killing<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and another</font>

93
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing it brought up is that everyone</font>

94
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,239
does have a price there are tons of

95
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,650
regular people that were involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

96
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,150
drug trade because you know they just

97
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,680
stored some coke in their house someone

98
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,910
pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up they didn't have to do</font>

99
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,840
anything and they get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few hundred</font>

100
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,400
thousand they like that money so then

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,690
they look out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you stall really</font>

102
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,010
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff it's funny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how the</font>

103
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,480
