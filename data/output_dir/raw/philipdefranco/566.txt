26
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:12,810
philip defranco shows for those two

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,420
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so we can like keep traveling</font>

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,830
and traveling and only stay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,810
place for like 2-3 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,430

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,360
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna guess i just spent 13</font>

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,970
hundredth of my life overseas is that

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,430
true I don't know time gets away from me

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,710

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,250
like

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steve Jobs like we have the technology</font>

48
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the ability to release everything</font>

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,850
now but we realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we hold off</font>

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,660
then people will buy the phils penis for

51
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">s in the future with coming on your face</font>

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,170

55
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,450
