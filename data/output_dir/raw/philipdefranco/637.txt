I know my words mean nothing here's 15

31

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,320
have been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very first not personal</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a fever now it's wrong kindness is why</font>

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,720
I've been coughing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much so I was in a</font>

39
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,310
shitty mood when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watch this movie so</font>

40
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,679
maybe that play to roll it I could not

41
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,560
stand this movie for the first 55 60

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,729
minutes like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning of the movie</font>

43
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,200
it starts off pretty interesting when

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,640
they kill off the one backpacker that

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,860
could act a guy that survives goes from

46
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,280
like why did my friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ruth die like</font>

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
banging a nurse scary cuts in the

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,929
beginning of pace terribly but i will

49
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:54,640
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a horror movie so</font>

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,979
acting isn't always up there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

51
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,229
music may not be the best the reason i

52
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,090
say i hated this movie for the first 55

53
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,740
60 minutes is that when David finally

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,899
does transform into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the werewolf it's</font>

55
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,090
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this movie was made in</font>

56
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,459
1981 and they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

57
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,260
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> look that cool as impressed and</font>

58
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,790
it turns into this weird like dark humor

59
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,769
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people he's killed or like</font>

60
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,630
guilting him except this one couple

61
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,340
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy they're always happy I</font>

62
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,569
like them but it doesn't even become

63
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,610
like a moral<font color="#E5E5E5"> story like he's like David</font>

64
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,380
you have to kill yourself and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

65
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,970
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're like oh it's</font>

66
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,799
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a mud it's gonna be a moral</font>

67
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,930
story no he's turns into a werewolf

68
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,150
feels like a hundred more people and

69
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,319
then the police shoot him and you're

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,790
like well fuck good for him that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

71
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,200
except for everyone if he didn't die

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,269
what a selfish douchebag one thing I

73
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:38,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">wonder is if this movie is considered a</font>

74
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,959
classic because of the prosthetic work

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,489
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transformation and the</font>

76
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:43,930
werewolf scene because I am one of those

77
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,060
people that I i hated the original tron

78
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,530
movie but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it first</font>

79
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,209

80
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,310

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,790
I'm gonna start keeping the name of the

83
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,319
person who recommends a movie because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

116
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,959
puts a new twist on the werewolf legend

117
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,660
the people killed by werewolves aren't

118
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,640
necessarily dead and gone or spirit kind

119
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,580

<font color="#E5E5E5">it a yawn er it blew chunks next step</font>

124
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,540
the thing about this movie is I really

125
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,220
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it except for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ending I</font>

126

liked the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end the editing for its time</font>

127
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,290

129
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,610
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell him how to kill</font>

130
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,000
himself was absolutely hilarious the

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,190
crazy couple sitting there just like you

132
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,510

133
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,340
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd be very quick just just point</font>

134
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,570
it stretches your head it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>
