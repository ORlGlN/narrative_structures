wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know just say that it was</font>

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,990
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason that I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,520
stopped was because I wanted to focus on

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,770
the shows and I wanted to focus on a lot

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,950
of business aspects and I mean a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,380
the past six months has been just making

32
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,060
pivotal decisions like I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font>

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,549
outside from watching a show that I was

34
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally gonna be on and then four</font>

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,860
weeks before air I said no and like

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,009
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind of the big thing in</font>

37
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,439
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six months is saying no no no</font>

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,030
thank you very much for keeping me in

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind because it's it it's amazing that</font>

40
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,259
you would even consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but no to TV</font>

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,250
and actually following my words of what

42
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,680
I've said at VidCon what I said at

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,619
multiple places is that I'm staying on

44
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,390
the internet the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,850
for me it's a place for most everyone

46
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,649
these days and it's only getting bigger

47
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,869
and bigger and so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it's been</font>

48
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,729
like in this past six months has been

49
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,090
realizing that it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no even</font>

50
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,649
though like<font color="#CCCCCC"> because when you're in LA</font>

51
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,780
there is a pressure to succeed and

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,970
always take on more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than maybe you</font>

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,610
currently

54
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,240
want to do in the goal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be successful</font>

55
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,070
because you think of success<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

56
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,570
happiness that's not true in<font color="#E5E5E5"> la</font>

57
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,000
happiness and success can sometimes and

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,700
most often are two separate things and

59
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,590
so I I am plagued by a desire to

60
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,900
constantly be successful but in the past

61
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,640
six months in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years I've</font>

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,770
realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has to also go along</font>

63
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,930
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I love like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PDS the</font>

64
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,270
philip defranco show is something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

65
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,300
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> i care about i enjoy doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

66
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,130
day and that's the reason that it's the

67
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,740
number one most popular new show<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

68
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,660
pop culture entertainment whatever you

69
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,550
want to call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's kind of</font>

70
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,150
unrivaled and and i love it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

71
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,120
well how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do more like I I want to</font>

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,700
have like this a little insight I

73
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,920
probably shouldn't even be saying but I

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,720
want I want to be behind the video

75
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,510
version of like The Huffington Post

76
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,760
whatever that is for YouTube I want to

77
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on youtube like a brand that's</font>

78
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,780
based around a specifically video that

79
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,060
could rival like Maxim I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

80
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's something that I love and I</font>

81
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,239
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> my audience loves and we get</font>

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,910
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and a lot of its just been</font>

83
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,720
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know if I go into work I</font>

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,970
should really work or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> studio</font>

85
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,350
whatever you wanna call it I should be

86
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,110
excited and I am to do my show and I am

87
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,660
to do like LTA because it's something

88
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,360
that I already love and then finding

89
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,890
those really cool people that we've

90
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">found and worked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with in the past and</font>

91
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,070
yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm just so that's</font>

92
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,930
that's what I've been up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want</font>

93
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,330
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start the vlogs back up not only to</font>

94
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,400
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conversation with you which was</font>

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,560
actually the main reason because i

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,870
missed the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> i miss a hundred</font>

97
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,540
legitimate comments talking back and

98
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,959
forth over 40,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> pds comments of give</font>

99
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,480
me a fucking camera which is okay

100
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,829
because it's the hustle and bustle of

101
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">youtube but the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got onto</font>

102
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,299
youtube and the reason I'll always stay

103
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,850
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube is the conversation of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

104
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,430
money and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation</font>

105
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,738
the money just kind of allows us to do

106
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,710
cooler stuff but<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and allows me to be</font>

something that still excites you or is

120
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,940

126
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,419
starve and or die now if it's something

127
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,610
video-based then maybe we should do

128
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,949
another alike make a video to possibly

129
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:20,560
