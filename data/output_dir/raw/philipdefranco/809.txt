85
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,310
one thing that stood out to me and it

86
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,139

87
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone that I've never met but</font>

88
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,739
sometimes it's just easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

89
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,299
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're feeling to someone</font>

amy is you are possibly the sweetest

92
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,109
person and that's good because it

93
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,669
negates the fact that your user name is

94
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,370
