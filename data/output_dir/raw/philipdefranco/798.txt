53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think it's a lot of a lot of the the</font>

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,799
blessings in my life<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stress</font>

55
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,680
just a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress like when you're</font>

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,769
when you're helping someone or your yeah

57
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,600
just helping someone they they rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,269
you it's two pictures it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture of</font>

59
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,660
you pushing them up above yourself right

60
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,820
and then there's the picture of them

61
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,579
with an iron grip on your foot falling

62
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,980
to their doom you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess that</font>

63
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,600
that picture is you know you're trying

64
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,180
to push them to be to live better to

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,310
everything better but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time</font>

66
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,170
when that when that picture where

67
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,790
they're grabbing your feet and they're

68
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,250
pulling down on you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's stress that's</font>

69
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,890
that weighing<font color="#CCCCCC"> down on you and so a lot</font>

70
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,390
of my blessings are also stressors<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

71
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,329
think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people can relate to it</font>

72
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:11,519
growing up I think my mom was a crazy

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,920
person because you know she should be

74
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,870
like oh do you need me to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for</font>

75
