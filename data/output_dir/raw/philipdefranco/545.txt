nation the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pds today though will be</font>

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,810
sponsored and yeah essentially the way I

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,689
see this back this frequently asked

43
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,509
question how do you integrate sponsors

44
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,369
in a show when people keep calling you

45
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,299
edgy risque bruh-bruh bruh-bruh all

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,909
those words mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philip speaks his mind</font>

47
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,490
which I understand too many is scary

48
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,189
that's why a part of most every contract

49
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,350
we have is that whoever whoever doing it

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,140

<font color="#CCCCCC">very excited by it by today's thing</font>

53
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,590
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is so new and it's a fun way</font>

54
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,379
to test yourself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to get that</font>

55

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,410
