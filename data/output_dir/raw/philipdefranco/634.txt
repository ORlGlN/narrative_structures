88
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,350
it get a minus and not like an a there

89
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a lot of really good ideas but it's</font>

90
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,630
like the best friend character I don't

91
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,650
give a fuck about that guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy I</font>

00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,040
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roses that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want him to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

94
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well be a party or I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care</font>

95
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,459
I don't care the way the movie was set

96
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,019
up you knew how it was gonna end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

97
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,610
the most part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just like come</font>

98
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,650
on if I didn't care about this movie

99
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,209
club i would fucking fast forward

100
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,739
through your scenes but what I do like

101
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,630
is that you realize a lot of things

102
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've probably realized this with me</font>

103
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,110
with the past what 18 days<font color="#CCCCCC"> the morals</font>

104
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,519
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the emotion like in this movie</font>

105
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,660
there's a moment where Ryan Reynolds

106
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,450
realizes you know I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change who I</font>

107
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,120
am I've been doing all these new crazy

108
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,459
things but it's not who i am i am who i

109
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">am i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can try and do things but ninety</font>

110
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">six percent of who we are it's gonna</font>

111
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,550
stay the same like

112
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,680
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like alcoholism lightest</font>

113
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can fight against it ultimately</font>

114
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,310
lose that battle the faster you do

115
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,010
probably the better also<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgiveness</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

116
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping in mind with forgiveness his</font>

117
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,530
wife didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cheat on him she just</font>

118
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">slept with his best friend a week before</font>

119
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,640
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> slept with him though she's classy</font>

120
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,470
she was drunk at a party that's a better

121
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,900
story<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I was thought a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whore huh to</font>

122
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,700
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first girlfriend said that whores</font>

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,370
whores I can't hit the note right now

124
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,440
but it is a nice life tale that way I do

125
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,760
feel like Ryan Reynolds does have to

126
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,780
