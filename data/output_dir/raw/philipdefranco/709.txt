7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,380

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,960
change holy shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> oompah loop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just got</font>

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but loompa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five can we fix it can</font>

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,920
we fix it no oh well<font color="#E5E5E5"> once fixodent post</font>

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,070
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I don't really do interviews that</font>

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">often because I will basically I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,600
do text interviews because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font>

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,850
because you can you get my personality<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,000
guess is some somewhat weird some

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
somewhat self-deprecating sarcastic /

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,329
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> super blunt and so I know I</font>

18
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,059
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to understand sometimes</font>

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,640
but I did I recently did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> satus</font>

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,219
interview with a new TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on they</font>

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,140
asked me five questions and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,470
through the questions answer them in

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,460
video form and maybe elaborate so first

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,470
question oh and real fast the reason I'm

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this interview in the first</font>

26
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,110
place because like i said i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,090
usually do them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing their new</font>

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,680
TV live event which I guess someone

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,689
gonna go up there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I know we're gonna</font>

30
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,670
do a live interview in front of people

31
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,420
that don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> who I am I don't know</font>

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,220
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's see unless you buy a ticket</font>

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,320
then you might care but I let's see

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,590
what's the one big issue / Los /

35
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,930
attitude / restriction that you think is

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,430
holding back the industry the industry

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,770
being online video online entertainment

38
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,770
my answer and i will read this because

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,649
apparently I I think I wrote this

40
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,479
holding back the industry nothing if it

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work it's because you aren't</font>

42
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,329
trying hard enough or you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

43
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,380
right people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the least</font>

44
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,479
restrictions of any medium so to say

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,670
something is holding us back is really

46
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,490
just an excuse many people say funding

47
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,990
holds us back those people won't give us

48
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,149
money but I I started everything with a

49
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,719
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30-dollar webcam so I mean people</font>

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,330
saying that it's it's too hard that's

51
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">usually just people coming from a failed</font>

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,730
movie

53
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,460
like a failed script or a failed TV idea

54
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,600
and they come to the web and they're

55
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,480
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> only cost a million dollars it</font>

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,830
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two hundred thousand dollars</font>

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and people make these two hundred</font>

58
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,490
thousand dollar things and they don't

59
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,020
either they either don't get the views

60
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,170
or they don't they don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> money or</font>

61
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,600
it is they just fail but the thing is

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,570
like if I say I fucking hate blabbity

63
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,700
blah insert something no one can no one

64
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,490
can stop me maybe a portal will say my

65
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,100
video is not suitable for a blondie blah

66
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,620
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can put up whatever I want and</font>

67
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,270
that's I mean that's one of the reasons

68
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,720
that I mean that some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff can</font>

69
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,900
exist like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say funding is a problem</font>

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I start with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty-dollar webcam Tony</font>

71
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,330
who launched blackboxtv makes sure that

72
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,700
each each video he puts puts up that

73
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,690
gets like three hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> five hundred</font>

74
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand views does not cost more than</font>

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,730
five hundred dollars because right now

76
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,200
that you know they're there isn't a ton

77
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,340
of money but it shouldn't hold you back

78
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,980
let it be the thing that that helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

79
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,050
creative be creative and so that's

80
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,670
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying with that so</font>

81
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">number two what industry buzz word do</font>

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you never want to hear again there's a</font>

83
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,360
lot but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that bothered</font>

84
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,060
me for a while was viral because because

85
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,290
I was like oh it sounds like a disease

86
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,090
but I don't know I can't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a word</font>

87
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,520
that describes a video becoming popular

88
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,010
and spreading better than viral but my I

89
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,380
said transmedia it just sounds weird

90
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,180
most people using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

91
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,950
a hypothetical sense and there are years

92
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,380
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from actually doing transmedia of</font>

93
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,780
course is like a philip defranco show it

94
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,850
was online but then all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

95
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,900
had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TV show or a talk show on TV</font>

96
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,239
and so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on two different</font>

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,150
mediums and they're interacting and I'm

98
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,920
not saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's happening anytime</font>

99
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,420
soon but next question let's see if

100
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,040
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave you 50 million dollars to</font>

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,180
invest in the company in this space

102
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,250
which one would it be and then the

103
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,870
stipulation was mentioning your own

104
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't count now the reason we had to</font>

105
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this is I believe if i remember</font>

106
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,970
correctly they asked a few youtubers

107
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,738
this and they're always like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

108
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,899
invest in my company because it's the

109
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,500
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and so since i couldn't</font>

110
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,110
invest in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best company in</font>

111
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,550
and in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> field I said that's a hard one</font>

112
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,770
for me I'd probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> invest the money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

113
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,150
tools i already use whether it's like

114
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,479
like blippy calm dailybooth calm just

115
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:36,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much anything else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i use because</font>

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,830
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i enjoy something i usually want to</font>

117
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,659
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it in some way with my</font>

118
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:44,840
audience so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like a I wasn't</font>

119
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,219
like I'm gonna use this and then

120
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,650
everyone would like it but you know if I

121
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,300
enjoy something and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

122
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">something with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my audience then all of a</font>

123
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden there's this big rush of traffic</font>

124
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,960
to it it's I mean people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have compared</font>

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,219
it to multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> times what like a big</font>

126
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,800
thing especially now a dig push is

127
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,669
pretty weakness but so it's weird it's

128
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:10,729
like it's word of mouth marketing to an

129
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,419
extreme level and yeah i'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> say like</font>

130
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:15,949
companies like that but that except i

131
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,629
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 50 million dollars and i've</font>

132
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:20,750
yet to invest in any company other than

133
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,360
my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I got to build one thing</font>

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,560
at a time so yeah so that's once again

135
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,770
could come off super cocky<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm making</font>

136
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,529
popular dirt that it's not what I'm

137
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:35,539
trying to say but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to</font>

138
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,430
talk about it for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the last</font>

139
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">video that you weren't personally</font>

140
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,460
involved with that you liked enough to

141
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,360
spread to others now it's probably the

142
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,639
stuff from recklesstortuga they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

143
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if it's them or one that one</font>

dude or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know but those guys are</font>

145
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,379
so funny recklesstortuga the the gaming

146
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,639
series that they have right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they</font>

no no stop it stop it not that I hate

152
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:14,689
everyone on YouTube and then the fifth

153
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,069
question over the last few years you've

154
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:17,689
evolved your brand online from the

155
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">typical youtube channel to a thriving</font>

159
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,599
traditional vlog style commentary and

keeping all your different projects

162
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,930
sustainable and has a long question so

163
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,000
my answer in written form is if there's

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">any one truth industry is that if you</font>

165
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not growing</font>

166
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:40,039
you are dying that that's just that's

167
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:42,529
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a like I'm hoping they quote me</font>

168
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:44,539
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that just a fact that's</font>

169
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,610
something people know in their industry

170
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,309
I mean that in doer shift production

171
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,819
value properties and revenues I realized

172
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">after i started LTA that I could only</font>

173
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,049
stretch myself so far I mean I had a you

174
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,669
know 400,000 subscribers on that channel

175
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,379
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also had two other channels that</font>

176
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,139
were far more popular at the time and at

177
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,029
that time i was making 12 plus videos a

178
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,709
week and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it just it's not</font>

179
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,110
sustainable for for one person because

180
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,949
if you get into making videos that's

181
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,409
when most people realize how hard it can

182
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:17,569
be especially maintaining a heavy

183
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,479
schedule because a lot of people like

184
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,610
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard could it be and then again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

185
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,819
get a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of emails from people like</font>

186
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,989
apologizing which is there's no reason

187
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,079
to apologize you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I guess it's one</font>

188
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,849
of those the grasses brainer sort of

189
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,799
things but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I started trying</font>

190
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,589
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the show it's it's such a time</font>
