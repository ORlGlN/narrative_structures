00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,390
i'm leasing is like five bedrooms and I

47
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">literally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got it</font>

48
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,920
for the pool because you know I've

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,319
always wanted a pool and so I was like

50
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,050
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough furniture for one room</font>

51
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,900
but I really like the pool so you know

52
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,980
we're moving everything into their

53
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,990
surprisingly there is enough room for

54
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,870
like the entire office and and yet it

55
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like six thousand dollars</font>

56
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,010
between rent business and a business

57
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,780
Internet's like the biggest rip off on

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,670
and like four hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars it's not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cuz I want to rush into anything and</font>

63
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,370

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,870
