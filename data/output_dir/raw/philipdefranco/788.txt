2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,410

big break on youtube I know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube pimp on the chain king of the</font>

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,570
castle I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it means but I</font>

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,350
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big star on campus I mean</font>

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,410
what was that a big break like and how

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,630
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to be the star</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are today</font>

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,770
well I guess it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really all about</font>

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,650
perception because um will you call a

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,390
star I call<font color="#E5E5E5"> going Nova I am NOT the pimp</font>

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,720
on a chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you just</font>

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,020
said but uh I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on YouTube for</font>

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,900
three and a half four years which means

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,030
that I should have died a long time ago

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,160
on YouTube the reason in my mind that

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,750
I'm still<font color="#CCCCCC"> around as I was one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,120
first people to come up with no I should

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,800
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a fucking schedule mean at least</font>

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,329
on youtube because most of the time

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that were big were these people</font>

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were posting one time a month and</font>

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,800
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> got used to seeing me on those</font>

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,690
specific dates I'll be honest it's much

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,030
harder to get large on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube these</font>

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,920
days gotta know people or your shit's

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
gotta be so awesome with a look of the

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,550
dice someone notices it and it goes

29
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,830
viral a lot of youtubers came from

30
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,380
really shady beginnings I mean way back

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,030
in the day like<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,340
throw an image in the exact center of a

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">video to get a thumbnail like that was</font>

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,470
abused like crazy myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> included</font>

35
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,299
youtubers even<font color="#CCCCCC"> today they they've</font>

36
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,290
cleaned up their act still use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> copy</font>

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,320
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> music a copy written video that</font>

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,979
they're not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use Wow people in</font>

39
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,820
the top 20 used auto loaders back when I

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,860
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked and they would boost</font>

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,350
view counts spambots to subscribe like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

42
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,939
bunch of drug dealers trying to get into

43
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,590
the wall street game my favorite thing

44
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,360
was youtubers that were like yeah you

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,970
know my account did that but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

46
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,619
guy that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> running my account that did</font>

47
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:56,670
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the equivalent of saying</font>

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,140
something rude to a girl on the internet

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,970
and be like oh my god I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> so sorry my</font>

50
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,409
little brother got on the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

51
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,030
darn little brother that comes on and

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,140
says things like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,330
tits this is YouTube a place where video

54
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,310
thrives but not necessarily the best

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,370
video for example myself and

56
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,209
raywilliamjohnson pretty much anyone

57
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,780
that likes good video has men

58
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">and or talked about Julian Smith TV now</font>

59
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,060
before all the promotion he had amazing

60
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,770
videos but they weren't getting the

61
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,940
views that they deserve and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a</font>

62
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden these single person studios</font>

63
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,569
producing videos on youtube become the

64
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,370
curators for the content on the website

65
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,170
seems more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like yes of course</font>

66
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,840
make good content but it really depends

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,520
on who you know think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a youtuber you</font>

68
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,560
watch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then think of how you found</font>

69
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,480
out about the most often than not it's

70
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,770
because of word-of-mouth promotion

71
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,260
possibly a collaboration I just winced

72
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,540
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said collaboration but yeah make</font>

73
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,640
videos that you actually enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

74
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,910
just pander to whatever you think is

75
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,680
going to get the most views it would

76
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,480
naturally be part of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,220
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah include it let that be the tip</font>

78
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,690
of your spear if you're not into it it's

79
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,130
gonna show become friends with and

80
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,360
network with the right people if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

81
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,890
new to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole YouTube game there is a</font>

82
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,830
plethora of people that would just love

83
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,300
to do something with you they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

84
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,310
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 100 to 250 thousand</font>

85
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,019
subscriber club the reason is that more

86
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,489
often than not these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about</font>

87
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,980
subscribers the most than anyone else on

88
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube another surefire way to tell if</font>

89
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,370
they are part of this group if not

90
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,290
mathematically but mentally is that they

91
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,110
have twenty thousand million people in

92
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,880
their other channels boxes and what they

93
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,380
fail to realize is that when they have

94
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,079
20 people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their other channels even</font>

95
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,040
if the plan works and they subscribe

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,209
accidentally to all of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

97
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,549
people they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped put their next</font>

98
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,829
video out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the subscriber bucks and</font>

99
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,090
they fail to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

100
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,829
obnoxious and if you have just<font color="#CCCCCC"> four or</font>

101
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,360
five channels and the other channels

102
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,769
people are more likely to join because

103
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,109
it's like oh these must be special to in

104
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,299
summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's thirty percent making good</font>

105
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,670
content thirty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking and</font>

106
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,820
forty percent the fuck was that noise

107
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,980
and personally I got my big break two

108
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,900
ways one making fun of people on the

109
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and two I got featured back</font>

110
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,920
when it mattered now the equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

111
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,480
being featured on the homepage is being

112
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,549
promoted in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video of a top 20</font>

113
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube and I'm just being honest about</font>

114
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term because there's a</font>

115
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,810
difference between having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

116
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,120
popular video in a really popular Chen a

lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't see that I hope that</font>

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">helps uh me or you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found that</font>

119
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,380
interesting and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what at the end</font>

120
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">of every month I'll choose someone that</font>

121
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,728
sent in a video question and I will add
