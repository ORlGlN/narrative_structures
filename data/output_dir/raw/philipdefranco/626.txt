42
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,240
point i get that the over-the-top acting

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,440
have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff in this move</font>

47
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,580
let's jump into the movie what it's

48
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,289
about what happens things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff in</font>

49
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,789
words you got this main guy he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got his</font>

50
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,770
own gang a thug's he's a sociopath and

51
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,009
he beats down rapes and just causes

52
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">ultraviolence as they say in the movie</font>

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,860
he is then caught for murdering someone

54
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,740
with a giant replica of a penis<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

55
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting to watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but he goes to jail</font>

56
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,459
14 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the movie he opts in to a</font>

57
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:12,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">program that will help him be fixed in</font>

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,900
two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the movie he's like yes</font>

59
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,540
please in the book it actually plays out

60
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,560
differently at least so I've been told

61
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,330
where he<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like kills a guy in</font>

62
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,769
jail and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just throw him into</font>

63
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the program and whole program shows him</font>

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,830
like ultraviolent things which at first

65
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,680
he loves but then due to drug therapy

66
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,090
which actually makes him sick and is

67
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually something that the other CIA</font>

68
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,750
tested in the 50s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 60s showing him</font>

69
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,160
stuff that he would<font color="#CCCCCC"> normally be excited</font>

70
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,810
by it and creating a relationship a

71
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,850
correlation to feeling sick to the nth

72
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,799
degree making that person ever want to

73
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,150
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's then released in the public</font>

74
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,549
and essentially has no defenses keeps

75
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:43,750
running into people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's wronged</font>

76
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,090
and they just walk him up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

77
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,049
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie certain things and</font>

78
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff happen I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to fully ruin</font>

79
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,000
the movie but the main thing of the

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,650
movie was you cannot easy fix somebody

81
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,079
can him feel nauseous when he thought of

82
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,030
violence didn't change him just made him

83
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,079
feel nauseous when he thought of

84
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,910
violence he wasn't rehabilitated he was

85
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,130
just debilitated he was just no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

86
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,200
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's hard to come to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a final</font>

87
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,030
meaning of this movie especially since

88
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,530
the book was different and then it was

89
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,390
changed for America and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the movie</font>

90
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,400
reflects that see a person forced to

91
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,019
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a better person actually</font>

92
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,519
mean you change the person just change

93
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,019
their action you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might as well turn him</font>

94
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,220
into a vegetable because his crimes

95
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,380
against people dehumanize them but this

96
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,730
program that was meant to fix him

97
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,470
dehumanized him ultimately in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie</font>

98
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,359
I'm gonna spoil it I decided annotation

99
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,920
to get past it he stops feeling sick

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,359
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ultra violent stuff he says I</font>

101
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,730
am cured and he gets like a position

102
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,470
it's all very stupid and everything was

103
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,239
all for naught I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have</font>

104
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotten a lot more out of this movie but</font>

105
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,660
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of it with sociopaths or</font>

106
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,790
sociopath<font color="#E5E5E5"> and rehabilitating them is</font>

107
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,109
impossible this is probably one of the

108
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons i'm not a lil movie critic but i</font>

109
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,450
would love

110
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,040

sort of movie it can be as detailed as

113
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,470
well Phil shows that the rehabilitation

114
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,360
process is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only successful when</font>

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,800
you deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone getting what they</font>

116
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,260
dished out in blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> or it could</font>

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">be I was a fan of the movie because I</font>
