4
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:22,720
when I am traveling or just in general

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,180
to maintain some sense of physicality

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,099
you know just just doing shit

7
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,409

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">underwhelming when you come to a place</font>

00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">your health while you're on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> road</font>

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,909
it's really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just in general</font>

17
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:51,940
because it's so easy to snack but um

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,250
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been well and of course</font>

month that makes me a little happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,600
a little relieved that the first project

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,060
30 has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a success and I continue</font>

26

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,610
place which of course brings the next

28
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,800
point what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the next project 30 I'm</font>

I'm not going to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid or</font>

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
hurtful to do myself because I want

35

<font color="#E5E5E5">these to be really really positive</font>

36
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,520
