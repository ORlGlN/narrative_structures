40
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,370
your exercises so today yeah my trainer

41
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,599
David showed me all the exercise and

42
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,299
machines that he wants me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do when I'm</font>

43
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:29,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">not with them and we did this because</font>

44
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,330
today was my fitness test

45
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,730
and so we took all my measurements oh my

46
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,600
oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> good you know my arms everything</font>

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,270
and everything no not everything and and

48
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,750
we did we ran fitness tests on all these

49
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,930
machines just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see where I'm at and</font>

50
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,440
where we so we can test it essentially

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,130
every month and to see the small changes

52
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,380
so it's not just like this is my goal

53
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,090
for the next three months because

54
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,010
apparently when people try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and better</font>

55
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,210
themselves they do it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> like three</font>

56
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,600
months and so you know because a lot of

57
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,490
what we try and do is a motion base like

58
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,290
most of the good stuff in my life is

59
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,140
literally because I was desperate or I

60
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,080
was angry all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good stuff I ever ever</font>

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,470
in my life it is essentially from being

62
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,410
an angry person and for me a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

63
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,900
stuff has been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be all about</font>

64
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the good stuff you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like I like I'm</font>

66
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of all the naysayers you know</font>

67
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,290
people say you can't do it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

69
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,410
that helps a lot but at the end of the

70
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,840
day everything can't be because of

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">something negative it has to also be you</font>
