1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,720
so I kind of started off as a joke but

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,240
it's turned into a legit brainstorming

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,220
session of what the date should be I was

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,519
like what they should go is it would we

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,639
over the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> few target oh cuz we were</font>

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,199
like just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a movie that was the only</font>

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,420
rule and then we start joking and now we

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,099
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an honest-to-goodness list oh man</font>

9
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,949
that is insane so David everyone's

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,779
thrown down ideas what should Mady and

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,980
the the lucky girl whoever wins do see I

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no I don't</font>

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,559
know what I would do for a first date

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,110
right oh cuz you don't want to get a

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,820
wrong impression yeah because I mean

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,370
honestly like outside of college I've

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,340
never really had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on dates so</font>

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,719
obviously museum<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to get the</font>

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,710
impression that might be a little bit

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,489
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Monet's right</font>
