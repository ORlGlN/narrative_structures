1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:01,731
(jolly jazz music)

2
00:00:01,731 --> 00:00:04,564
(swooshing sound)

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,907
(ice falling)

4
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:12,369
- Good morning, guys.

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,561
We've got just a couple
days 'til Christmas

6
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:17,528
and we have hardly caught
anything in this Christmas cage.

7
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:21,075
We caught Buddy the Elf,
we caught Santa BBA.

8
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:23,240
We did catch mama at some point,

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,447
but we were hoping to
catch a couple of few more

10
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:27,880
magical creatures before
Christmas is over.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,773
So, I have acquired a bucket of ice

12
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:32,915
and I am gonna attempt
to catch something today

13
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:34,196
and it may work, and it may not.

14
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:35,607
But, I guess we'll see.

15
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:40,121
There's our Christmas cage,
and I am going to set the bait

16
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:42,779
right underneath it and see if this works.

17
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:45,279

30
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,064
- Good morning!

31
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:16,856
- [Brian] Good morning,
Ollie! Who is on your sweater?

32
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:18,976
- Abominable snowman!

33
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:20,920
- [Brian] That's right,
the Abominable Snowman!

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,753
- [Brian] He's so cool looking! (laughs)

35
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:23,624
- (roaring)

36
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:25,516
That is so cool, Ollie.

37
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:27,816
We are hanging out in
the boys' new bedroom.

38
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:30,326
If you guys have not seen
the reveal in the tour

39
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:32,104
I'll have it linked above in the I-card

40
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:32,937
so you can watch it.

41
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:34,835
Ollie is so excited, because he's got

42
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:36,596
the Abominable Snowman on his sweatshirt.

43
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,449
And your next, okay?
- Yeah!

44
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:41,532
(lighthearted music)

45
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,474
- [Missy] Where's Finn?! Where's Finn?!

46
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:53,342
- [Brian] Where's Finny? There he is!

47
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:55,684
[Brian] You got the Abominable
Snowman on yours too.

48
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:58,520
- [Missy] Oh look, and you have ears.

49
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,093
- [Brian] Yeah!
- [Finley] (roars)

50
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:03,093
(roars)

51
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:06,755
- (roars)

52
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,668
- We are hanging out right now

53
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:11,898
and we have been looking
for Fred all morning.

54
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,493
We haven't found Fred, huh?

55
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:14,646
- Yeah.
- [Finley] Yeah.

56
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:15,479
- [Missy] I wonder where he is.

57
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,586
Sometimes this guy,

58
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,954
he makes it so hard for
us to find him, huh?

59
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,803
But I did want to take the boys around

60
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:24,249
and show them that, there is only

61
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:26,822
three days 'til Christmas. That is wrong.

62
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,710
We're gonna change it
right now. Here we go.

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,127
Three days, boys.

64
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:35,500
That means we have like 72
hours 'til Christmas guys.

65
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,333
- [Oliver] Do we?

66
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,291
- [Missy] Yeah. That's not a lot.

67
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,510
I really hope all of you

68
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,011
have gotten your Christmas shopping done.

69
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:42,396
We are all done with our
Christmas shopping, huh?

70
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,941
We got our presents
that we wanna give them.

71
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,980
We just have like a little
bit more wrapping to do even.

72
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,848
But, yes guys. Three days 'til Christmas.

73
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:50,031
And I gotta say,

74
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,804
I'm actually kind of impressed
with myself this year.

75
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,775
Some years, I'm going out on Christmas Eve

76
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:54,832
to finish my Christmas shopping.

77
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:57,057
Ahh! It's so crazy to see that number.

78
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:59,114
Three! Three days!

79
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:00,610
Only three more sleeps

80
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,631
'til it's Christmas and Santa comes

81
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:05,166
and brings us presents.

82
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,983
- Did we put the bait down?

83
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,803
- [Brian] We sure did. Come check it out.

84
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:10,833
[Brian] What do you think
we'll catch with this ice?

85
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,636
Probably something cold, right?

86
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:14,286
Maybe like a penguin?

87
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:17,064
- No, maybe an Abominable
Snowman like this.

88
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:17,897
- [Brian] Maybe.

89
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,774
I don't know if that's
gonna happen though.

90
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:20,966
Maybe a Narwhal.
- [Boys] No.

91
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,021
- [Brian] Maybe we'll catch a Narwhal

92
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:23,485
[Brian] You want to catch this?

93
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:24,318
- Yeah.

94
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,923
This is going to be a
nice Abominable Snowman.

95
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,734
- [Brian] Alright, well
let's see if we catch him.

96
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,481
We got our ice under the cage.

97
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:33,949
(laughs) Shake it up.

98
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:36,416
- I'm coming for you snowman.

99
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,416
(mischievous music)

100
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,276
(cage slams)

101
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,697
(jingle bells cling)

102
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:57,530
- So, yeah. Today--

103
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,114
Oh, did you guys hear that?

104
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,807
Did you guys hear that?
Boys did you hear that?!

105
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,708
- [Boys] What?

106
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,096
- [Brian] We caught something.

107
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:06,726
I think we caught something
in the Christmas cage!

108
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:07,852
- (screams)

109
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:08,855
- [Brian] What is it?

110
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:10,982
- Abominable Snowman!
- [Missy] Oh my god.

111
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:14,222
- [Brian] We caught the
Abominable Snowman?!

112
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,923
Oh my goodness. Look at his hands.

113
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,829
Ollie, come here. Come here. Look at him.

114
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,088
Hi, Abominable Snowman.
Are you a nice snowman?

115
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,257
- I'm sorry guys. I'm really sorry.

116
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:25,897
I just, I smelled the ice and
there's no ice in California.

117
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,601
I just really wanted some ice. Okay?

118
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,554
- [Missy] That's okay. I mean,
we kinda wanted to catch you.

119
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:31,594
- [Snowman] Would you let me out?

120
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:32,527
- Yeah we'll let you out.

121
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:33,360
- [Brian] Should we let him out?

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,193
- [Oliver] Yeah.

123
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:35,026
- [Brian] Alright you guys, I think

124
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:35,861
the Abominable Snowman is good.

125
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,319
We're gonna let him out of the cage.

126
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,777
And we will free the Abominable Snowman!

127
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:41,081
- [Missy] You're free.

128
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,059
- [Snowman] I can keep this, right?

129
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:42,963
- [Brian] You can have the ice, yes.

130
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:43,796
You can have the ice.

131
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:44,629
[Brian] Ollie, look at his feet.

132
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,061
Come touch his feet, they're huge.

133
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:48,502
- [Oliver] (screams)

134
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:50,585
- [Missy] Those are
some big feet you have.

135
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:52,793
- [Brian] (laughs)

136
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,742
What do you think about that, Ollie?

137
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,548
The Abominable Snowman
in your house? (laughs)

138
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:57,395
- [Oliver] (screams)

139
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,066
- [Missy] He's not sure about that.

140
00:04:59,066 --> 00:04:59,899
- [Oliver] Hey, Abominable Snowman!

141
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,501
Come check out my room!

142
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,013
- I'm sure the Abominable
Snowman is very busy

143
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,303
and he has to be going on his way.

144
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:10,591
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna
go outside actually.

145
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:12,181
- [Brian] Oh, do you want to go outside?

146
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,014
- [Oliver] Yeah.

147
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,402
- [Missy] Let's go outside.

148
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,551
- It's really hot out there
though. It's California.

149
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:19,076
I think I actually wanted to
make some snow for you guys.

150
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:21,427
- [Brian] What?! Do you
guys wanna make snow?

151
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,510
- Yeah!

152
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,776
- [Brian] Finn, do you
wanna play in the snow?

153
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:24,754
- Yeah.

154
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:27,151
- [Brian] That would be so cool, Snowman.

155
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:28,357
You can really do that?

156
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:29,236
- [Snowman] Yeah, just follow me.

157
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:30,156
- He just, like, has magical powers.

158
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:31,415
He can make snow whenever he wants?

159
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,679
- Wow, this is gonna be crazy.

160
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,178
[Missy] Okay, we got put
all your shoes and socks on.

161
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:36,329
- [Brian] Alright, I
found some sleds boys.

162
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:37,730
Do you wanna go sledding maybe?

163
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,643
- [Oliver] Yeah!

164
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:39,589
- [Brian] That would be cool.

165
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,067
Finn, there's a green one
over there. You want that one?

166
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,559
- [Woman] Pull it like this.

167
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,798
- [Brian] (laughs) He's
like, no I want to get in it.

168
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:48,984
[Brian] (howls)

169
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:52,776
Alright, we are following the
Abominable Snowman out here.

170
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:55,453
He says he gonna make some snow?

171
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:56,600
(enchanted music)

172
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
(twinkling sounds)

173
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,790
(magical sounds)

174
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,036
(cheery music)

175
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,704
- Whoa, real snow!

176
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:10,037
- [Brian] There's snow?! What?

177
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,444
You guys, there's actually
snow in California?!

178
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:16,527
Whoa! We got our own snow hill, dude.

179
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:20,140
Jump in it. Is it real snow?

180
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,537
Oh, your-- (laughs)

181
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:25,704
His shoe came off already.

182
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:27,787
That's so cool.

183
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,705
(screams)

184
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,701
(laughs)

185
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:32,784
Wow, you guys. It is soft, real snow.

186
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,529
That's amazing!

187
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,696
Alright, Abominable Snowman

188
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,101
can you show us how it's done?

189
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,609
Oh, my gosh! Look what's
over here, you guys.

190
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,626
[Brian] Ollie, Finn! Who is that?

191
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:43,459
- Fred!

192
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,768
- [Brian] Mimi look, it's Fred!

193
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,310
- What is Fred doing?

194
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,637
- [Brian] What do you think he's doing?

195
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:50,202
- [Oliver] I think he's--
- [Brian] He's sledding.

196
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,361
- [Oliver] (gasps) Guys!

197
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,925
- [Brian] Whoa! Look, we got some,

198
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:55,485
We got some snow toys.

199
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:58,857
And Abominable Snowman is
gonna test out the hill.

200
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:00,127
- [Oliver] (cheers)

201
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,113
- [Brian] Whoa!

202
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:04,007
Oh, look at this Fireball, Ollie.

203
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,310
Do you want to go on the fireball?

204
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,469
- [Oliver] Yeah.

205
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,215
- [Brian] Alright, we got these two.

206
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:09,819
Ollie's gonna jump in this one,

207
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,281
Finn's gonna jump in this one.

208
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:12,114
And, go!

209
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:16,181
(howls)

210
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,656
(laughs) Finn won!

211
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:20,444
Huge thanks to the Abominable Snowman

212
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:23,695
for making snow in our
backyard, here in California.

213
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,496
We are now going to hit the slopes

214
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:27,058
and have some fun in the cold.

215
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:29,962
(screams) He almost got you.

216
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:33,212
(upbeat holiday music)

217
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:21,931
[Brian] Whoo-hoo! (laughs)

218
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:23,014
He is flying.

219
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:27,630
This is so cool, that Yeti
came and gave us snow,

220
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,576
and now we have an actual Yeti blow up.

221
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,409
- [Missy] I know.

222
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:32,316
- [Brian] Alright, Poppa. You going?

223
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:33,816
- One, two, three!

224
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:37,566
- [Brian] Oh, he almost fell off.

225
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:40,149
(upbeat music)

226
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:47,632
[Brian] Three, two, one, go! (howls)

227
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,933
(upbeat music)

228
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,998
[Brian] What do your doggies
think of the snow, Carma?

229
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,049
Do you remember that?

230
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,632
(upbeat music)

231
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,011
[Brian] Ollie, what do
you think about the snow?

232
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,712
It's like real snow, huh?

233
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,622
- I can't build a snow man.

234
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:09,455
- [Brian] Oh, I'm sure you can--

235
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:11,288
Oh my gosh, watch out!

236
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:13,385
You want to build a snow man, Ollie?

237
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:14,376
- Yeah.

238
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:16,126
- [Brian] Alright, we are going to attempt

239
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:18,635
building a snow man.
What do you think, Poppa?

240
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:21,437
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, it's so
cold and icy. It's just ice.

241
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,109
- [Brian] Uncle! Where have you been?

242
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:23,942
- Uh.

243
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:25,027
- [Brian] Do you see the snow?

244
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:26,108
- It's pretty cool, yeah.

245
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,574
- [Brian] There's a bunch
of snow in our yard.

246
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:29,428
But it had nothing to do
with you though, right?

247
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:30,886
- I was upstairs.

248
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,095
- [Brian] You were reading probably?

249
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:32,928
- Yeah, reading.

250
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:33,761
- [Brian] Yeah.

251
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,655
We're trying to build a snowman.

252
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,016
Be very careful, Ollie.

253
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:41,231
- Californians do not have
the right gear for this.

254
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,982
- Alright, the fun has really begun.

255
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,868
We have invited friends
and family to come over

256
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,289
to the sledding hill and tear it up a bit.

257
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,674
[Brian] And here goes Aunt Linda!

258
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,597
- [Aunt Linda] Whoo!

259
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:54,683
- [Brian] Whoo! Almost ran into CJ.

260
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:57,433
(cheerful music)

261
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:45,803
So, June just experienced a
sledding miracle in California.

262
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:47,095
Didn't you? (laughs)

263
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:48,508
- Did you like the snow?

264
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,946
She's like straight faced.

265
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:51,779
- [Brian] Kelsey and Corbin

266
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,690
brought June over to the sledding hill.

267
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,149
Be sure to check out them in the I-Card

268
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,251
and you can watch it right now.

269
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,444
We thought we would give you guys

270
00:11:58,444 --> 00:11:59,923
some Christmas presents.

271
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:00,756
- Aw.

272
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,095
- [Brian] And we have a really cool one

273
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:03,803
we want to give you guys for June.

274
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,099
Alright, help mama.

275
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:08,269
- It's a new dog!

276
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,548
- [Brian] Laughs.

277
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:11,689
- I'm holding it's mouth
so it doesn't bark.

278
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,739
- [Brian] Here you go,
June. Merry Christmas.

279
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:18,324
Do you want to see? (whooshing sound)

280
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:20,438
- [Corbin] Whoa!

281
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,172
- [Kelsey] Down here, it's right here.

282
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:24,559
- [Brian] Look at that.

283
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,516
- [Corbin] It's so fluffy.

284
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,995
- It's so fluffy. It's
like a fluffy Paris.

285
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:29,398
- [Brian] That's so cute.

286
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,252
- [Corbin] It looks just like Paris.

287
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:35,082
- [Brian] Finn will show her how it works.

288
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:36,916
He's a little crazy on it.

289
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,280
But Finn always has loved these rockers

290
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,971
so, I was like, oh we
gotta get one for June,

291
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:42,453
and that one's so cute.

292
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,392
- [Corbin] Okay, here we go. Saddle up.

293
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:46,590
- [Brian] Oh my goodness, look at you!

294
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,423
(laughs)

295
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:48,505
- Yeah!

296
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,425
Oh, that's so cool

297
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:51,258
- Yeah.

298
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:54,610
- [Brian] Merry Christmas, Junebug.

299
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,682
- [Kelsey and Corbin] Say, thank you.

300
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,349
Look, she's smiling.

301
00:12:58,352 --> 00:13:00,000
- We had such a fun day

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,384
hanging out in the snow with Yeti.

303
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:02,517
Didn't we boys?

304
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:03,350
- Yeah.

305
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,307
- Yeah, that was a fun day.

306
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:07,000
Check out the sweater I'm wearing.

307
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,017
I got the Belsnickel sweatshirt.

308
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:11,686
Impish or Admiral?

309
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,316
If you guys don't watch The Office,

310
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:16,320
it's basically one of Dwight's characters.

311
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,417
It is so comfy, I'm just wrapped up in it

312
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,638
walking around the house.

313
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:21,327
Missy is dipping some peanut butter balls.

314
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:22,347
- Back at it.

315
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:25,006
- [Brian] Back at it.
Getting some sweets going.

316
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:26,500
- [Missy] We have lots of
surprises this weekend.

317
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,101
- If you guys want to
watch more fun in the snow

318
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,552
that we've had over the years,

319
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:32,732
I'll have a playlist
linked in the I-card above.

320
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:33,974
So, be sure to check those videos out

321
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:35,089
Subscribe to our channel

322
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,136
and give this video a big thumbs up!

323
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:37,606
I think we'll see them
manana, right Ollie?

324
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:38,528
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

325
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,090
Three more sleeps 'til Christmas!

326
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,981
Two for you guys. Let's go!

327
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:45,493
Thanks for watching.
We'll see you manana. Bye!

328
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:46,326
- Bye!

329
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:49,647
- Daily Bumps bonus clip.

330
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:52,989
Look at this crazy cloud in the sky.

331
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:54,688
We just got a ton of text messages

332
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:57,367
saying to look up at this cloud.

333
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,617
Look at that. What is that?

334
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,693
It's so bright.

335
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:04,212
- [Missy] It's shining
on the perfect angle.

336
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:06,265
- [Brian] I don't know.
That gives me goosebumps.

337
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:07,114
That's crazy.

338
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,219
- [Missy] I don't know if I got goosebumps

339
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:09,052
or if I'm just freezing.

340
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:10,448
- [Brian] I know, right. (laughs)

341
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,031
Wow, that is crazy.

342
00:14:13,366 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
