1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,613
- She can do it, huh Finn?

2
00:00:01,613 --> 00:00:02,446
- Mhmm.

3
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:03,996
- Say, "Go auntie, go!"

4
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:05,439
- Go Aunt t-t!

5
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,272
- Say, "Go auntie, go!"

6
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,967
- Go Aunt t-t!

7
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,255
- Go Aunt t-t!

8
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:10,680
♫ This is our life

9
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,513
♫ This is our fun

10
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:14,336
♫ This is who we are

11
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,746
♫ This is our dream

12
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:16,748
♫ This is our team

13
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,793
♫ Shot among the stars

14
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:21,344
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

15
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:24,084
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

16
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:26,324
♫ This is our life

17
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,484
♫ Let's live it

18
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:29,985
♫ Live it forever

19
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:31,652
- [Both] Good morning!

20
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,042
- Say, "Good morning!"

21
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:35,302
- We at Mimi's house!

22
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:39,364
- We're at Mimi's house,
huh? And who's here?

23
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:40,540
Who's here?

24
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,574
- Ahhh! Muah!

25
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,407
- [Missy] Auntie!

26
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:43,515
(all laughing)

27
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:45,588
- [Missy] He's so excited.

28
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,392
He's actually pretty excited
because last time he was here,

29
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:50,833
he filmed a really fun video
with auntie, and I think

30
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,858
he's like, "Are we gonna do that again?"

31
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:54,280
- So, what are we doing now?

32
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,861
- So, if you haven't seen that
video, I'll have it linked

33
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,711
up here because they swam in slime,

34
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,038
and she actually convinced Finn to do it.

35
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:02,247
- And he was ...

36
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,616
- He was actually pretty into it!

37
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:06,695
- So, if you guys wanna
see that hilarious video,

38
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:08,487
make sure you go check it out.

39
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:12,227
But we're actually filming
another fun video with Papa!

40
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:14,029
Papa's always the best in the videos.

41
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:16,696
And I actually helped out
with this one, so I'm excited.

42
00:01:16,696 --> 00:01:18,636
I'm gonna try and finish filming it.

43
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:21,603
Oh, look! My dad did
this not too long ago,

44
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,572
and he's building a little
chest that's gonna be

45
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:24,553
built in here.

46
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:25,910
I think it's gonna look really cool.

47
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,857
So I just got done filming
that video of Cassey and my dad

48
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,334
and, just so you know,
these are some of the items

49
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:34,858
that they used, and it
was pretty hilarious.

50
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:36,521
I'll have to let you know
when that video is out.

51
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:38,756
But now, Cassey is being
so nice and she's gonna go

52
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:40,259
pick up Ollie from school.

53
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,079
And so, I'm just hanging out
at my mom's having some lunch,

54
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,110
playing some video games.

55
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,824
Fin's over there eatin' over there.

56
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:48,027
Just so you know, guys,

57
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:52,001
I am completely obsessed with
my Switch and with Mario.

58
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,042
Particularly Mario.

59
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,629
And I just beat the whole game,

60
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,811
but apparently, when you
beat it, you don't beat it.

61
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:59,640
There's just tons and tons more to do.

62
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,390
And it's, like, actually
a little overwhelming.

63
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,846
But I'm loving this game, so
if you guys don't have it,

64
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:05,677
you're crazy, 'cause it's the best.

65
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:06,725
It's so much fun.

66
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,568
It's so much fun when
there's just down time.

67
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:10,328
I'm like, "I'm gonna play
my game for a little bit."

68
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:14,064
And I already beat it. I'm
like way ahead of Bryan, so.

69
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,581
I'm such a gamer guys.

70
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:18,443
So Finn is trying to take a nap at Mimi's

71
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:20,897
and so, I set him up with
a little show to watch

72
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:24,196
and hopefully to fall asleep
that I thought I'd show.

73
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:27,196
(light piano music)

74
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:34,211
Shhhh. Hi, my baby.

75
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:39,279
He looks so tiny in that big ol' bed,

76
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,897
but I'm hoping he falls asleep.

77
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,575
Hopefully that didn't just
disturb him and he'll be like,

78
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:43,679
"What are you doing?"

79
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,645
Hey dude! You're back!

80
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,823
How excited were you when you
saw Auntie come pick you up?

81
00:02:48,823 --> 00:02:49,928
- Yeah.

82
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:51,493
- [Missy] Were you so happy?

83
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:52,523
- He was so excited. He was so happy.

84
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:53,819
- [Missy] Was he?

85
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,652
- Yeah.

86
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:55,485
- [Missy] Was he playing?

87
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:56,318
- No, he was eating his lunch.

88
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:57,645
- [Missy] Eating his lunch,
and he probably got so excited.

89
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,097
- He was so excited. Muah!

90
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,938
- [Missy] Did you tell
everyone that's your Auntie

91
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,271
and she's the bestest?

92
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:03,312
- Um, yeah.

93
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:06,821
- She is the best. Muah. Am I right?

94
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:11,085
- Yep, now we're all just
hangin' out at Mimi and Papa's

95
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:14,906
and playin' and they're just
so happy to have Auntie here.

96
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,169
- Rawr!

97
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,586
(Auntie laughs)

98
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:18,917
- [Missy] Did you take your nap, bud?

99
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:19,750
- No!

100
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,647
- [Missy And Auntie] No!

101
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:21,822
- [Missy] You never ...

102
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:24,223
- Never. Oh, losing his hand.

103
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:27,738
- We are now at our
house and Auntie is over

104
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:30,924
and Finn is playing with her
and he's so happy right now.

105
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:31,918
Let me show ya.

106
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:33,832
And they're on the Boosted Board!

107
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:37,082
(Auntie making noises)

108
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,441
- [Auntie] We're gonna see if we can turn.

109
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,188
See if we can turn
without hitting the car.

110
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:45,047
- [Missy] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

111
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:46,122
- Woo! We're good.

112
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:47,444
Should we go down the hill?

113
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:48,390
- [Finn] Uh-huh!

114
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,968
- Alright, he said yeah so ...

115
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:52,748
- [Missy] He's a daredevil.

116
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:53,665
Oh my gosh.

117
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:56,947
(Missy screaming)

118
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:57,973
(Missy laughing)

119
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:59,321
- [Auntie] Auntie doesn't
know how to work it.

120
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,488
- [Missy] Okay, ready? Go!

121
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:05,565
- Auntie's scared.

122
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:06,937
(Missy laughing)

123
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,371
- [Missy] You can't even see Finn's face

124
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,004
'cause he's got Spiderman.

125
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:11,598
(upbeat music)

126
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:13,342
- [Missy] Oh my gosh you're going so fast!

127
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:15,925
(upbeat music)

128
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:20,024
- [Missy] Ah! There are the dare devils!

129
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:21,823
- [Auntie] Oh my god!

130
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,593
- [Missy] That was actually really fast.

131
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:25,594
It doesn't look fast,
but it's way too fast.

132
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:26,929
(Missy laughing)

133
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:31,483
- [Missy] Backin' it up,
backin' it up, backin' it up.

134
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:32,991
- [Auntie] You havin' fun?

135
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:34,824
- [Missy] He loves it.

136
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:38,283
Here they come, here they come!

137
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:41,200
(Auntie screaming)

138
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,054
Alright, Auntie's gonna
experiment on our ...

139
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:48,667
- [Auntie] I'm really scared!

140
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,213
- [Missy] You can do it!

141
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,892
- I'm literally just holding the break.

142
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,257
(Missy laughing)

143
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:54,809
- [Missy] Alright, go faster!

144
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:55,951
- [Auntie] No! I don't wanna fall!

145
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:56,949
- [Missy] You can do it!

146
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:58,116
She can do it, huh, Finn?

147
00:04:58,116 --> 00:04:58,996
- [Finn] Mhmm.

148
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,376
- [Missy] Say, "Go Auntie, go!"

149
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:01,796
- [Finn] Go Aunt t-t.

150
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:02,878
- Say, "Go Auntie, go!"

151
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:04,183
- Go Aunt t-t!

152
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:06,814
- Go Aunt t-t! Go t-t go!

153
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:08,762
- Go Aunt t-t!

154
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:11,994
- It's so cute, he calls
her t-t. You're so cute.

155
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:15,110
Oh, here she comes. Back up.

156
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,027
Oh, that's pretty good.

157
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:22,316
Now you're makin' me wanna go.

158
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:26,344
Finn was like, "Kay, I'm going again."

159
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:28,139
- Let's go. Say, "Bye guys!"

160
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,222
- [Finn] Bye!

161
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:32,674
- [Missy] Alright, we
found an even better ride!

162
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:33,575
(Ollie screaming)

163
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:34,808
Here goes the boys!

164
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:37,028
- [Auntie] I don't think Ollie likes it.

165
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:38,944
- [Missy] Ollie is not
as adventurous as Finn.

166
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:40,464
- [Auntie] I think it's
'cause we traumatized him

167
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:41,297
with the hill.

168
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:42,156
- [Missy] I think so.

169
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:43,073
Ready? Woo!

170
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:47,565
(Ollie screaming)

171
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:52,034
Ollie does not, he's not a fan.

172
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:54,121
You wanna go with Auntie?

173
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:54,954
- Yeah.

174
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,302
- [Missy] Finn's like,
"Uh, I'm having a blast."

175
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:02,268
- [Bryan] Ollie, would you
look at that? What do you see?

176
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:03,851
Look up in the sky.

177
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:06,716
What do you see up there?

178
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,552
- Um, cotton candy clouds!

179
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:13,616
- [Bryan] Yeah, dude, look!
The pink clouds are back!

180
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:16,484
Cotton candy clouds are in the air.

181
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:17,620
What's up, babe?

182
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,735
- It's so pretty out here.

183
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:20,894
- Hey guys. I have not
been on the vlog today.

184
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,100
- He's been workin'!

185
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,797
- Livin' and workin'.

186
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,781
- We should fly up there and eat those!

187
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:29,339
- [Bryan] Really? Oh, we
should fly up in the sky

188
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,557
and eat that cotton candy.

189
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,413
- Look at that side. That is so pretty.

190
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:33,803
- [Bryan] Oh, wow.

191
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:37,466
This is right in the view
of our courtyard here.

192
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:40,199
Look at that sky, that's incredible!

193
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,508
- That's crazy. It's amazing.

194
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:43,416
- It's so beautiful.

195
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,924
Yeah, hey guys. Missy's
been vlogging all day,

196
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:47,746
but I've been at the house filming

197
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:48,987
for something really special.

198
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,862
We have a special video
going up in a couple days.

199
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:53,182
And it's been super fun, but I'm done!

200
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:55,343
So, now I get to hang out with the fam!

201
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:57,010
I feel like sometimes, being a YouTuber,

202
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,109
people say, like, "Oh, you just
sit at home and do nothing."

203
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:00,975
That is not the truth.

204
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:03,086
So, yeah, I put in a lot of work today.

205
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:04,594
And it feels really good.

206
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:06,280
But yeah, sometimes even being a YouTuber,

207
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,674
you're still dealing with work. Work.

208
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:11,205
- I know, and it's not
just, like, filming videos.

209
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,038
- [Bryan] It's fun work, though.

210
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:13,134
- It's a lot. It's more than that, though.

211
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:14,473
- Yeah, there is a lot
more that goes into it.

212
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:15,934
And maybe we can talk about that,

213
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,536
or even share, like, what works for us,

214
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,865
business wise and stuff.

215
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,677
- We are running a business.

216
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:23,454
- [Bryan] Yeah. Yes we
are. Aren't we, Ollie?

217
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:24,410
- Yeah!

218
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,457
- [Bryan] Yeah.

219
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:26,371
- We work hard, huh?

220
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,498
- Sometimes, Ollie
like, "Can we just play?

221
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,498
And, like, can you guys
come hang out with me?"

222
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:31,812
And I'm like, "I'm sorry, dude!

223
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,170
I've really gotta finish this!" Huh?

224
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,003
- Yeah.

225
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,475
- But now I'm here. Can I have a big hug?

226
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:36,642
Arg. Hi, dude!

227
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,148
Did you have a good day at school?

228
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:40,023
- Yeah.

229
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,148
- What did you do?

230
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,886
- I learned the, Mama, what letter?

231
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:45,267
- S!
- S!

232
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:48,567
- S, he learned the letter
S. And what starts with s?

233
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,851
- Um, scorpion.

234
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:50,768
- Scorpion.

235
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,067
Snake.

236
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,297
- Snake.

237
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:55,751
- That's a pretty good s one, huh?

238
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,804
- From Ninjago.

239
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:57,637
(Bryan laughing)

240
00:07:57,637 --> 00:07:59,392
- Oh, only a Ninjago
snake starts with an s.

241
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:00,570
That's so cool, dude!

242
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,403
- Yeah!

243
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:02,393
(techno music)

244
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:03,744
- It is such a good night.

245
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:06,586
I the kids dinner nice and
early, and I am working on

246
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,777
me and Bryan's dinner
and I'm making something

247
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:11,530
that I've made a couple
times this fall season,

248
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,368
which is chicken pot pie.

249
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,339
And I usually, I never
remember early enough

250
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,349
to put the chicken in the Crock-Pot.

251
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:18,750
So it's nice and shredded.

252
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,657
And I also read that you can
always get Rotisserie chicken

253
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:24,230
and shred that, but I
haven't done that either.

254
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,742
I just had a bunch of chicken in there,

255
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:26,963
so I cooked it up.

256
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,611
Then, what I decided
to do, 'cause I've been

257
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,224
wanting to do this
forever is I shredded it.

258
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:32,119
And it actually shredded pretty nicely for

259
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,167
chicken I just cooked up on the stove.

260
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,592
It kind of just, like, shredded apart.

261
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:36,887
It was, like, super juicy.

262
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:38,510
So, I'm pretty much impressed
with myself right now,

263
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,651
'cause I am not a cook.

264
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,759
And I've got all my veggies.

265
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,357
We're just doing corn,
green beans, and carrots.

266
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,756
Those are the ones I can handle.

267
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:47,494
There's not a lot of
vegetables that I'm like,

268
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,674
super excited about, but
these ones, I can handle.

269
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,057
And I probably will
pick around the carrots.

270
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:54,449
I know, I am so bad.

271
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:55,933
I'm really excited about
my chicken, though.

272
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,542
I feel like it looks pretty dang good.

273
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,706
It looks like it's starting to dry out,

274
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,959
so I'm gonna get this in here,

275
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,493
so I can start making my pot pie.

276
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:04,146
Alright, my pie shell is made.

277
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:07,107
I've got all my goodie
goodness inside of it.

278
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:08,558
I've gotta top it off.

279
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:10,188
And I'm FaceTiming my mom right now.

280
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:11,849
(laughing)

281
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:14,911
And, uh, yeah. It looks delicious!

282
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,235
I'm hungry now.

283
00:09:16,235 --> 00:00:00,000
(techno music)
