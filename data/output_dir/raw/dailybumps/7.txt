00:00:00,354 --> 00:00:02,464
- Hey, everyone, and
welcome to today's video.

2
00:00:02,464 --> 00:00:05,596
A big shout out to Mattel
for sponsoring this video

3
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:07,580
and for helping us create it.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,999
(playful music)

5
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:12,736
- I'm so bored.

6
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:13,736
What's that?

7
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:21,671
It's a map to Hot Wheels City!

8
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:26,253
Oh, no, the creatures are
taking over Hot Wheels City!

9
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:27,836
I have to warn Mom.

10
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:34,975

11
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,274

14

(relaxing music)

15
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,317
- Snake! Help!

16
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:54,749
There's a snake in the house.

17
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:55,582
Help me!

18
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,215
- This is the first creature.

19
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:04,712
I'll save you, Mom.

20
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:06,296
- Help me, help me!

21
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:09,520
Thank you so much, Ollie.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,709
You're so brave.

23
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,177
I don't know where that
creature came from.

24
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:13,684
I hope there isn't more.

25
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:17,267
- Don't worry, I know
what to do with them.

26
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:22,060
(upbeat music)

27
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:09,641
(whistling)

28
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,592
(screams)

29
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:18,853
- There's a giant spider!

30
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:19,861
Spider!

31
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,969
- Oh, no, Daddy.

32
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:22,516
I'll save you.

33
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,152
- Spider!

34
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:26,355
- I'll save you, Dad!

35
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,825
- Ollie, get the spider!

36
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:30,038
Oh, it's so big and scary!

37
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:31,600
You did it!

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,816
Thank you, Ollie.

39
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:34,731
- No problem.

40
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:37,870
You will just have to be brave like me.

41
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,473
I'll put this one with the other ones.

42
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:44,223
(rhythmic music)

43
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,801
- Gotta feed the fish.

44
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:09,625
Oh, no!

45
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,846
Piranhas in the tank?

46
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:13,346
Help, Ollie, help!

47
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,865
- What, Mama?

48
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,532
I'll save you, Mama.

49
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:26,061
Got it.

50
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:31,072
(upbeat music)

51
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:41,481
(monkey noises)

52
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:48,685
- I'll save you, Fin.

53
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:51,768
I will save you from the evil monkey.

54
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:55,830
- This is the last piece.

55
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,330
Hot Wheels City needs to have power plant.

56
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:08,614
I've got my power plant, and
my Hot Wheels City is complete.

57
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,059
Time to fuel up.

58
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:27,882
This is the bad guy.

59
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,647
We gotta put him in jail.

60
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,492
Oh, no, he escaped!

61
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:36,184
This place is the tire shop.

62
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:39,207
- [Dad] A big shout out to
Mattel for sponsoring this video,

63
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,143
and for helping us create it.

64
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:42,810
- He got new wheels.

65
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:51,422
Chomp, chomp.

66
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:52,936
(monkey noises)

67
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:56,123
- The creatures are taking
over Hot Wheels City!

68
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:56,956
Let's go!

69
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:57,915
Let's go!

70
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:58,989
Go! Go!

71
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:00,053
Get the door! Get the door!

72
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:00,886
Shut the door.

73
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:01,719
Shut it!

74
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,552
Shut it!

75
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,385
Shut it!

76
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:04,258
The creatures...

77
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:05,842
How are we going to stop them, Ollie?

78
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:07,092
- I don't know.

79
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,358
(monkey noises)

80
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,328
- These creatures need to be defeated.

81
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,281
- The creatures are going
crazy in Hot Wheels City

82
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:20,483
right now, huh, Ollie?

83
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,462
- Yeah.

84
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,295
- Oh, no.

85
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:23,565
I think I hear Mama in there.

86
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:24,464
- Let me check.

87
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:25,297
- What is she doing?

88
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:26,130
What is she doing?

89
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,963
- I'm going to defeat you, monkey.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,890
- Mama's shooting at the creatures.

91
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,756
- No way.

92
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:35,864
- Yeah.

93
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:37,031
- Go help her.

94
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,429
It's scary in there.

95
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:42,683
- The snake is gobbling
up all our cars, Ollie.

96
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:46,052
You stick this car in here
and then press the button.

97
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:47,469
Yeah, he got him!

98
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:50,831
He ate him.

99
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:53,019
Okay, now we have to defeat him.

100
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,033
So, let's stick him in here,

101
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,926
and get it to go down the slide.

102
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:56,759
One, two, three...

103
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,059
Get him!

104
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:59,583
Yeah!

105
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,407
- We got him!

106
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,998
- And he found our car.

107
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,566
- We got you, snake.

108
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,696
(screams)

109
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:09,899
- All right, let's get rid
of these pesky piranhas.

110
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,888
Drop your car in there and
watch the tank get destroyed.

111
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:13,721
Do it.

112
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,582
Whoa, we did it!

113
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:17,415
High five.

114
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:22,125
- Now the piranhas won't eat our fish.

115
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,044
- Yep.

116
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:24,932
This spider is eating up all our cars.

117
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:25,765
Watch this.

118
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,385
Go!

119
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:28,406
(cries out)

120
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:29,574
All right, we have to defeat this spider.

121
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:31,857
We're going to take the car and go...

122
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:33,872
(car crashes)

123
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:34,789
Let him go.

124
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:37,782
Yeah, we did it!

125
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:41,494
Rumor has it, there's a
nasty gator over here.

126
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,604
I wonder if he'll get us.

127
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,015
We're not doing anything.

128
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:47,482
(screams)

129
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:48,879
It's a gator.

130
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,376
Get him!

131
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,348
We've got to close up this shop.

132
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:52,219
Get the other side.

133
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:53,069
Hurry!

134
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:53,902
Get it!

135
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:55,587
We got him.

136
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:56,420
High five.

137
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:58,521
Yeah.

138
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:03,558
He got you.
(Ollie laughs)

139
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,863
- We had so much fun playing

140
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,530
with the Hot Wheels City
set today, didn't we, Ollie?

141
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,405
- Yeah!

142
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,238
High five.

143
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:11,254
- What creature is your favorite?

144
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:12,220
- The snake one.

145
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,351
- The snake one is so cool.

146
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,957
I seriously love seeing
Ollie use his imagination

147
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:17,790
with Hot Wheels.

148
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,216
I think it's like the coolest thing.

149
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:21,264
You told some cool
stories today, didn't you?

150
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:22,097
- Yeah.

151
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:22,930
- With your Hot Wheels.

152
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,938
That's pretty neat.

153
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:25,970
And, the Hot Wheels fun
does not stop there, because

154
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,468
Hot Wheels is launching
their own original show, and

155
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:32,490
they sent me an exclusive
trailer to share with you guys.

156
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,431
- Let's show the clip.

157
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:35,710
(cars revving)

158
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,460
(fast-paced music)

159
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,377
(tires screeching)

160
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:48,766
- [Commentator] New news.

161
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:51,566
Creatures have been
spotted in Hot Wheels City.

162
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,180
(fire bell clanging)

163
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,175
- [Sheriff] We just got
word of a huge creature

164
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,925
coming our way, boys.

165
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:01,155
- That's ginormous!

166
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:05,768
- Partly cloudy with a chance of spiders.

167
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:09,922
They're headed for the tire shop.

168
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,172
- Let's wedge 'em in there.

169
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:24,999
(toilet flushes)

170
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,089
- Special thanks again, to Mattel,

171
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,660
for sponsoring this video
and helping us create it.

172
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,078
We had so much fun.

173
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:42,547
- Yeah.

174
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:44,219
- [Dad] Hey, parents, what
is your favorite creature

175
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,205
that we showed in the Hot
Wheels City set today?

176
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:48,332
Let us know down below in the comments.

177
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:49,540
And if you enjoyed this video,

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,480
be sure to give it a big thumbs up.

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,079
- We'll see you next time.

180
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,158
- See you next time.

181
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,001
Bye.

182
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,700
- Bye, you.

183
00:08:56,700 --> 00:00:00,000
(happy music)
