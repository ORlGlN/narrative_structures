00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:23,690
We didn't eat dinner last night

13
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,357
and we were so hungry,
we ate all the candy.

14
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:33,596
- [Bryan] I'm sorry

16
00:00:34,872 --> 00:00:37,372
and we didn't have any dinner.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,963

25
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:58,903

27
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,776
Are you really upset?

28
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:08,703

00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,120
- No.

55
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,098
- [Missy and Bryan] No.

56
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:01,253
- [Bryan] You're to sad to eat now?

57
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:02,769
- Yeah.

58
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:05,125
- Are you okay Finn, you weren't

59
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,612

60
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:07,445
(Bryan laughing)

61
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:10,816
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, guess

62
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,540
(Missy laughing)

63
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,645
- [Missy] Do you want me

00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:15,886

65
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,942

66
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:20,617
Jimmy Kimmel told us to
tell you that, I'm sorry.

67
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,653
(Bryan laughing)

68
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:25,264
Come here, hurry, hurry, hurry.

69
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:27,929
See we didn't eat your candy you guys.

70
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:29,778
We wouldn't do that.

71
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:30,711
- I want this.

72
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:31,544
(Missy laughing)

73
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:32,750
- [Bryan] Skittles alright you guys

74
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,515
can each have one piece
before we go today okay?

75
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,073
- Finn you can have this.

76
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,270
- [Missy] Ooh do you want that one?

77
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,766
- [Bryan] He gives him the grossest one.

78
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,357
- He's like no thank you.

79
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:42,634
Do you want a different piece?

80
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:45,384
Ooh Sour Patch Kids, alright good

81
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,310
pick boys sorry we tricked you.

82
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,225
- [Bryan] Ollie would you have been

83
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:51,373
so sad if we actually ate it all?

84
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,614
- I want out.

85
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:53,768
- Now I'm happy.

86
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:55,526
- [Bryan] Now you're happy
'cause you have candy?

87
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:56,359
- Yeah.

88
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,620
- Alright, Ollie did you
believe mommy and daddy

89
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,386
when we said we ate your candy?

90
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:03,706
Yeah, he was kind of
like in disbelief, yeah.

91
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:05,590
- [Missy] He kept looking at me like no.

92
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,423
(Bryan laughing)

93
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:07,640
- That was seriously so funny.

94
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,312
We got such a different reaction out

95
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:13,544
of them than I was kind of
thinking we were going to get.

96
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:14,377
But if you guys have not seen

97
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,542
last year when we did this prank

98
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,422
on Ollie I'll have the link in the bio.

99
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:19,766
He was definitely very upset last year.

100
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,326
This year he was kind
of like, super bummed.

101
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,983
And Finn was like, no that's not okay.

102
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,603
But I don't think he really
knows what's going on

103
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:29,337
so next year for Finn
will be really funny.

104
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:30,280
If you guys wanna know what next

105
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,284
year's gonna be like for Finn.

106
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:33,220
Watch last years prank because

107
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,253
pretty sure that's how Finn's gonna be.

108
00:03:36,253 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
