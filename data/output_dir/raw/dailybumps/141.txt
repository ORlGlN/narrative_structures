1
00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:01,286
- Getting a fish!

2
00:00:01,286 --> 00:00:02,174
- We're getting a fish!

3
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:03,007
Are you so excited?

4
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:03,912
- Yeah!
- Yay!

5
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:05,590
We want to pick out a
good fish that's going

6
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,048
to be easy to take care of and we want it

7
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,260
to be super colorful, okay?

8
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,093
- Okay.
- Okay.

9
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,514
- You ready, Finn?
- Yeah!

10
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:13,659
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

11
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:16,663
♫ This is who we are

12
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:18,803
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

13
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:21,570
♫ Shot among the stars

14
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,648
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

15
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,427
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

16
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,387
♫ This is our life

17
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:30,457
♫ Let's live it

18
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:32,180
♫ Live it forever

19
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,198
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

20
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:36,417
- It is bright out here, huh, Finn?

21
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:37,416
Good morning, guys.

22
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,533
We are running a little bit late today.

23
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:40,843
Not too much, just about
four or five minutes late

24
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:42,021
and it's share day.

25
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,382
What are you sharing today?

26
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:44,376
- Um, a car.

27
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:45,610
- [Missy] A car?

28
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,387
But it's a car that Papa made.

29
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:49,220
- Yeah.

30
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,053
- [Missy] And what is the letter today?

31
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:51,028
- D.
- No!

32
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:52,027
- B.
- C.

33
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:52,860
- C.

34
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,036
- Yeah, he actually drew a C
for us yesterday at dinner.

35
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:58,768
And unfortunately, I
forgot shoes for Finn.

36
00:00:58,768 --> 00:00:59,601
(cries)

37
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,305
I was trying so hard to
get everything together

38
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:03,541
that I forgot Finn's shoes.

39
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,815
Finn is getting ready for music class.

40
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:07,751
He's very excited.

41
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:10,110
This is only our third time going and

42
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,132
the last two times he has been very shy.

43
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,277
Kind of just like sat in my lap and like,

44
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:17,682
kind of glued to me,
just watching everyone.

45
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:20,043
So I'm hoping that now, by the third one,

46
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:23,418
he's a little bit more into it and excited

47
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,012
and kind of more comfortable.

48
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:27,130
He is a little bit of a mess today.

49
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,214
He pretty much just woke
up and I got him dressed.

50
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,724
His hair hasn't been brushed.

51
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,085
(laughs)

52
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:33,618
He has no shoes on!

53
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:35,360
Some of the kids don't really
wear shoes in there anyways,

54
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,293
so I'm like, alright, I think
he'll be fine just for class,

55
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:40,766
but we'll probably have
to just go home after that

56
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,781
so we can get his shoes on.

57
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,640
Are you ready to go in?

58
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,642
- Yeah.

59
00:01:44,642 --> 00:01:47,903
- We're actually listening to
the music class CD right now,

60
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:49,941
which is always fun, just
makes him a little bit more

61
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:52,707
comfortable when we hear the song.

62
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:53,888
He's like, oh yeah!

63
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:55,065
I listen to these in the car.

64
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:56,105
So he's excited.

65
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,368
So I just got home with Finn and

66
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,904
we had so much fun at the music class.

67
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:02,136
But I am actually headed
out again with my mom

68
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:04,022
because it is her actual
birthday and I thought I'd

69
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:05,989
take her out and go
spoil her a little bit.

70
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:08,050
But first, I wanted to show Bryan

71
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,469
some pictures we got of Ollie, and I--

72
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,202
- [Bryan] Did Ollie--

73
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:13,793
- Wasn't going to look, but I had to look

74
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:14,626
'cause they were so cute.

75
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:15,642
You ready?

76
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:17,792
- Are they cute?

77
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:18,625
Oh my God.

78
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:21,529
- [Missy] They're so cute, right?

79
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:22,362
- Aww.

80
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:24,131
- [Missy] I almost like, literally, cried.

81
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:25,087
(laughing)

82
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:27,080
- I'm like tearing up
right now, it's so cute.

83
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,376
- [Missy] Let's show 'em, let's show 'em.

84
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,852
Look at his preschool school pictures!

85
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,069
- [Bryan] He did so good!

86
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,498
- [Missy] Like, isn't that crazy?

87
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:34,552
That's my favorite.

88
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:37,216
- He did really, really good.
- Like, they're so cute.

89
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,781
He doesn't look like a preschooler.

90
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:40,826
He looks like a fifth grader.

91
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:41,771
- Full-on dude.

92
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:42,932
Who's that?

93
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:43,765
(mumbles)

94
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,299
Who is that?
- Is that Ollie?

95
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,132
- Yeah.

96
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,610
- [Missy] Yeah.

97
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,317
- Yeah, he got his picture taken.

98
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:50,185
- They're so cute!
- Look at his skin tone.

99
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:51,182
- [Missy] I know!

100
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,571
- He's like just so tan all the time.

101
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:55,100
- [Missy] And his outfit is so
cute and his hair is so cute!

102
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,251
- [Bryan] I know.

103
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:57,150
(laughs)

104
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,061
- [Missy] I love it; I'm obsessed.

105
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,137
We have to pick one.

106
00:02:59,137 --> 00:02:59,970
- What?

107
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,000
- [Missy] We can only pick one!

108
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,114
- That's bullcrap.

109
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:03,760
(Missy laughs)

110
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,343
(techno music)

111
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:08,983
- I'm alive!

112
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:13,811
You guys, do I look normal?

113
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,055
Like, I got ready today, I took a shower,

114
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:17,115
I took care of myself.

115
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,696
I did all those things
that like, normal humans do

116
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:20,312
when they're not sick out of their minds.

117
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:22,004
And it feels really good!

118
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:23,214
What's up, you guys?

119
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:26,712
I feel like I have been,
like, gone from this vlog for

120
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:29,547
the past couple days because
my mind has just been focused

121
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:32,013
on trying to get me better
because I hate being sick.

122
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:34,985
And it's very difficult being
sick when you have two boys.

123
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:38,465
It was easy for me because
I have an amazing wife.

124
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:40,824
Missy did so good, you guys.

125
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,795
And I want you guys to just
leave her a ton of love

126
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:45,934
in the comments down below
because I'm proud of her because

127
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,686
she took care of me, she
took care of the kids,

128
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,277
and she took care of the
vlog, like, that was,

129
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:53,675
it was really, really
incredible and I love her and

130
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:56,736
she's amazing and we
make such a good team and

131
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,112
I'm really grateful for her.

132
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,948
So yeah, leave her lots of love
down below in the comments.

133
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,207
I'm feeling great!

134
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,016
I'm not a hundred percent,
still have a cough.

135
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:04,929
Cough drops are helping, but
I feel really, really good.

136
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:06,206
So today I got dressed,

137
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,697
I actually just got Finn down for a nap.

138
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:09,970
I've been watching him.

139
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,816
We've just been playing.

140
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,231
Missy's out running a
couple errands, and then

141
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:13,967
we're going to go do a
couple of fun things today,

142
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,737
but the house is like quiet and still,

143
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:18,725
'cause it's just Finn and I.

144
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,562
So a lot of times, I actually just like to

145
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:22,089
blast music in my office while I work.

146
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,716
Does anyone else like to do that?

147
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:25,710
Like, I've been, ever since I've been back

148
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,631
in my office working, I
love just putting on music

149
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:30,923
and just like, turning
it up, and like, relaxing

150
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,238
and enjoying it and it's been really nice.

151
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:36,247
And today, I think we are
getting a fish for our fish tank!

152
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:37,861
Which I am very excited about.

153
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,669
And also, we need water!

154
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,801
The guy who installed our fish tank,

155
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:43,939
who is awesome by the way.

156
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:47,868
He thought we would be going
to get fish a little sooner

157
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:51,042
than we have, so our
water level went down.

158
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,656
And apparently with a tank like this,

159
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:54,305
you got to have a lot of
water, like, on backup because

160
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:57,873
it's salt water, but you
don't put salt water in it.

161
00:04:57,873 --> 00:05:00,072
You put regular water in it
and the salt stays in it,

162
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:01,392
and circulates and stuff.

163
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:03,748
So, we're going to have
to get a bunch of water,

164
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:07,358
a couple of tools for the
aquarium, and hopefully,

165
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:09,412
a little fish that we
can put in this thing.

166
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:10,745
Look who's home!

167
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:14,235
- Hey, Ollie!
- Hey.

168
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:15,193
- [Bryan] What's up, dude?

169
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:16,305
How was school?

170
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,138
- Good.

171
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:17,971
- [Bryan] Good?

172
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:18,804
Took a good nap?

173
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:21,741
- Yep, and he shared Papa's car today.

174
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,630
- [Bryan] Oh, cool!

175
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,649
The one that he made him?

176
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:24,652
He carved him?

177
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:25,485
Yay!

178
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:26,318
- It went really good, huh?

179
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:27,736
- You had a good share day?

180
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:28,765
- [Finn] Mama.

181
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:29,813
- Yeah.
- Finn missed me.

182
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:30,885
- [Bryan] What is this?

183
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:33,475
- A sticker that smells like lemon.

184
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:34,881
- [Bryan] It smells like lemon?

185
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:36,072
Here, Finn, you smell.

186
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:36,905
(Finn groans)

187
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:37,790
- Smell it.
- Smell it.

188
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,623
(Ollie sniffs)

189
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:40,189
- Do you have to scratch it?
- Uh huh.

190
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,710
- [Missy] Mm, it does smell like lemons.

191
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,607
(Ollie groans)

192
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,578
- Do you know what that's called?

193
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:44,411
(Finn groans)

194
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,542
Mm, it's called a scratch and sniff.

195
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,833
Those things have been around
forever, scratch and sniff.

196
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,791
- I know.
- It's so funny.

197
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,023
- Kids love them.
- It's the coolest thing!

198
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:52,228
Hey, dude!

199
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,809
I missed you!

200
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,504
Look at our family back together!

201
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:56,466
- Group hug!

202
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,806
Group hug!

203
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:59,367
- With our two blonde boys.

204
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,200
- I know.

205
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,394
- What, are they adopted or something?

206
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,227
- I know.

207
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,288
- Where you kids coming from?

208
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,116
You haven't even had your
first haircut, have you, Finn?

209
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:06,146
- Oh my goodness.

210
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:07,420
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

211
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,771
- [Bryan] You're so funny.

212
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:09,810
Hey, Ollie!

213
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,643
- What?

214
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,713
- I saw your school portrait today!

215
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:13,546
- Good?

216
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:14,839
- [Bryan] It's so good!

217
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,229
- [Missy] Have you seen it?

218
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:17,062
- You took such a good picture!

219
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:17,912
Has he seen it?

220
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:19,230
Look at that, dude.

221
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,897
- Look how cute you are!
- That's a good picture

222
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:22,291
of you, huh?

223
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,296
- I'm good.
- That's pretty cool!

224
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,912
His first school picture, babe.

225
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:27,548
- They're so cute!
- It's a big deal.

226
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:29,591
- I literally was like, I
shouldn't look at these.

227
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:31,887
I should wait to like,
look at them with Bryan,

228
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:33,312
but then I flipped it over and I saw them,

229
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:34,917
and I'm like oh my gosh, it's so cute!

230
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:37,567
- [Bryan] Yeah, that is seriously so cool,

231
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,754
his school pictures.

232
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:40,187
Look at how cute he is!

233
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:42,156
Ollie, do the kids at school
like your light-up shoes?

234
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:42,989
(stomps)

235
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:43,905
Are they going?

236
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,616
There! That one's going!

237
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:46,875
Yeah!

238
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,108
Is your other one turned on?

239
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,110
Here, let me turn it on.

240
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,597
Now try.

241
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:51,430
Yeah!

242
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,104
Do the kids at school like 'em?

243
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:54,937
- Yeah.

244
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:55,770
- [Bryan] Yeah?

245
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,885
- His teacher today was like,

246
00:06:56,885 --> 00:06:58,733
oo, I like your shoes, Ollie.

247
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,566
- [Bryan] Aww.

248
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,785
(playful music)

249
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:02,618
- Getting a fish!

250
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:03,758
- We're getting a fish!

251
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:04,881
Are you so excited?

252
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,714
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

253
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:06,997
You and Finn get to pick one out, okay?

254
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:07,830
- Okay.

255
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,893
We want to pick out a
good fish that going to be

256
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:13,498
easy to take care of for our
first saltwater fish, okay?

257
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,626
And we want him to be
super colorful, okay?

258
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:16,459
- Okay.
- Okay.

259
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,521
You ready, Finn?

260
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,884
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Okay!

261
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:19,717
- Finn!

262
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:20,550
You're just like a fish!

263
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,257
- [Bryan] Hey, Finn!

264
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,924
(playful music)

265
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:33,685
All right, we are here at
Fish Frenzy with Vince,

266
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,575
and he's going to show me
one of his monster clownfish

267
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:37,781
that he breeds here in the store.

268
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,734
- Yeah, so this is our
clownfish breeding, back here.

269
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:42,309
- We're getting a
behind-the-scenes look, you guys.

270
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:43,374
This is cool.

271
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:44,555
- These are all our breeders.

272
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:46,033
This is our more
expensive pair right here.

273
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,263
This is the Picasso Extreme.

274
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:48,096
- [Bryan] Aww. Wow!

275
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,285
They look so cool!

276
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,625
Dang.

277
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,065
- [Vince] You see all
the different patterns?

278
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,506
- [Bryan] Yeah! That's so neat.

279
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,173
(playful music)

280
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:00,125
Look at this one!

281
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,135
So that's the--

282
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,835
- [Vince] Gold-banded
maroon, that's a female.

283
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:03,907
The female's always the biggest.

284
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:06,127
- [Bryan] Dude, the guy's
like ten times smaller!

285
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:06,981
(Vince laughs)

286
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:07,814
Dang!

287
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:09,270
That's crazy.

288
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,080
You boys checking out the fish?

289
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,811
(Ollie and Finn exclaim)

290
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:13,644
- Yeah, look!

291
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:14,602
- [Bryan] You like the crabs, huh?

292
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:15,491
- Yeah, I get that one.

293
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:16,324
- [Bryan] Yeah.

294
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:17,157
Finn?

295
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:17,990
What do you like?

296
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,966
You like the clownfish?

297
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:19,969
(Missy laughs)

298
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,896
We already got rock; we
don't need rock anymore.

299
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,890
Look at this fish right here!

300
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,244
I'm falling in love with him.

301
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,374
(laughs)

302
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,501
What kind of fish is that?

303
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:29,913
- Cow fish.
- A cow fish?

304
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:30,915
Does it moo?

305
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,707
- Yeah, look it, he's moving right now.

306
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:33,712
- [Bryan] No, does he moo?

307
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,727
(laughs)

308
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:36,989
- Be nice, huh?
- Oh wow.

309
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,979
- Buy something more.

310
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,056
- [Vince] But there he goes.

311
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:40,684
He likes blood worms.
- Wow!

312
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,595
He's gnarly-looking.

313
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:44,315
- I know, and he's really like, friendly.

314
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,824
Like, every time I go other
there, he, like, comes up, and--

315
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:47,015
- Yeah, no, real
personable, real personable.

316
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,715
I mean, we have customers that they

317
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:50,095
actually eat out of their hands.

318
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,262
- [Bryan] That's so crazy.

319
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:57,061
Look at these tangs going
crazy on that seaweed!

320
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:57,899
(laughs)

321
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,019
Isn't that so cool?

322
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:00,018
- Yeah!

323
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:03,462
- [Bryan] They have so much
personality, for a fish.

324
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:04,457
Whew!

325
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:05,290
- Whoa!

326
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,397
- [Bryan] Splashing even!

327
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:08,583
So excited because we just
picked out our first fish

328
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,825
for our new tank!

329
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:11,241
(Finn screams)

330
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,251
Finn's very excited too.

331
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,251
Are you excited, Ollie?

332
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,336
- Mm?
- Yeah.

333
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:15,500
- [Missy] Oh.

334
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,073
- [Bryan] We have all
fishies right down here

335
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:19,616
and I'm keeping them safe.

336
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:21,928
And I'm really excited because
we have to do the fish first

337
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,942
and then, in a couple weeks,
we get to start doing anemones,

338
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:27,334
and coral, and that's when

339
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,427
it really starts to look
like it's own little world.

340
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:30,301
What, buddy?

341
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:31,882
- We got a fire crab!

342
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:33,536
- [Bryan] No, we got a fire shrimp!

343
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,067
- We got a fire shrimp!

344
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,313
- We got a fire shrimp.

345
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:37,482
Wait 'til you guys see him!

346
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:38,358
He's so cool.

347
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:39,191
- I want to name him Kai!

348
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:40,138
- Kai?
- Yeah!

349
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:41,454
- [Bryan] Like from Ninjago?

350
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,454
- Yeah!

351
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:45,037
(techno music)

352
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:54,552
- All right, so we are back home.

353
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,264
We have had our fish acclimating

354
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,456
in the water for about 30 minutes now.

355
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:00,274
Well, we had to put in
a new heater in there

356
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:01,774
'cause the one that we
got originally installed

357
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:03,323
was broken.
- Yes.

358
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:05,850
- [Bryan] So, the water's
getting heated and I got the...

359
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,339
I finally got the flow down, I think.

360
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,172
(Ollie coughs)

361
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:11,131
It's so close to being perfect, you guys,

362
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,072
so I'm just going to
let it sit and see if it

363
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,188
adjusts on its own and
then fix it if I need to.

364
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:17,807
But, we have all of
our baggies right here.

365
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,269
All the fish are just chilling.

366
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,913
- I like the fire one.
- He's cool, huh?

367
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,297
- Yeah, I do.
- The fire shrimp?

368
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:23,600
- [Missy] We're going to let him go now.

369
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,433
- Yeah!

370
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:25,643
- So now we're going to use this and

371
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:28,196
set them in the tank, and
hopefully, it goes okay.

372
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:29,954
- Yeah.
- No pressure.

373
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:32,676
- So we cannot let this
water get into here.

374
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:33,644
- [Bryan] Yes.

375
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:35,634
- [Missy] Okay, there
goes all the Sebastians.

376
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,644
(laughs)

377
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:37,881
- [Bryan] Go on, guys.

378
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:38,714
- [Missy] Aw!

379
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:40,347
Look at 'em!

380
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:41,180
(Finn yells)

381
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,013
There they go!
- Welcome to your

382
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,651
new home, crabbies!

383
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,898
Keep it clean!

384
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:46,449
- All right, we got our crabs in,

385
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,666
and now it's next, the shrimp.

386
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,666
- Kai.

387
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,524
- [Bryan] So Kai is our fire shrimp

388
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:53,795
and he's going to keep everything clean.

389
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:55,652
He's going to clean
the fish and stuff too.

390
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:57,146
Let's put him in!

391
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,231
There you go, buddy.

392
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,123
There you go!

393
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,441
Look at him swim!

394
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:01,899
- [Missy] Oh my goodness!

395
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,110
- [Bryan] What do you think, dude?

396
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,282
- Um, good!

397
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:05,524
- [Bryan] He's so cool!

398
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:06,808
- Does he breathe fire?

399
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:07,641
(Missy laughs)

400
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:08,474
- [Bryan] I don't know.

401
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:09,474
Sure.

402
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:10,307
You know what?

403
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:11,991
- [Missy] He's going to clean our fish.

404
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:14,351
- Yeah, so he's a lot
like that little crab

405
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:15,561
from Finding Nemo.

406
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,517
Remember, who spins the fish
and gets them all clean?

407
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:18,427
- [Missy] Yep.

408
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,800
- [Bryan] He's going to clean the fish

409
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,633
and everything in there.

410
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:21,593
- Clean?
- Look how cool he is!

411
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:22,858
- [Bryan] It's pretty clean in there now,

412
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,168
so he might be bored for a while.

413
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:25,896
- [Missy] Yeah, he's checking
out his home right now.

414
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:28,666
- It's so cool, he's exploring for real.

415
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,986
- Picking his room.
- That is so cool.

416
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:32,495
Yeah, his big brother in real life.

417
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,619
(laughs)

418
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:34,452
Or fish life.

419
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,272
- [Bryan] All right, there's our foxface.

420
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:38,299
I'm going to name him Felix.

421
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,355
He looks cool.

422
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,751
- Look at him!
- He's got like a mohawk.

423
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,281
Play nicely.
- He's checking it out.

424
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:45,398
He's hiding; he's shy!

425
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:46,349
All right.

426
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:48,316
- [Bryan] That's our
white designer clownfish.

427
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,271
We're going to name it Pearl.

428
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:51,611
- [Missy] That's Pearl.

429
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,247
She's so pretty.

430
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:54,774
- [Bryan] And she could
be a boy or a girl.

431
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:55,607
(Missy laughs)

432
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:58,516
Because clownfish, all of
our clownfish are unsexed,

433
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,834
so they could either turn
into a male or a female.

434
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,257
- Yeah.
- It's really interesting.

435
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,797
And then these are our two clownfish!

436
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,322
- [Missy] Yay!

437
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:08,169
- [Bryan] They've got energy!

438
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,748
- [Missy] Nemo and Marlin!

439
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:10,726
(Bryan laughs)

440
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:11,559
(Missy laughs)

441
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,392
- [Bryan] They're so cute, and

442
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:13,596
they'll literally be best friends.

443
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:15,461
- [Missy] Yeah, aww, look at them.

444
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:17,227
- We have a couple fish in there
now, so we're just going to

445
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,200
let them adapt before
we start adding more.

446
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,152
- Yeah.
- But the thing about

447
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:22,302
saltwater fish, too, he said,
is they just keep growing.

448
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:23,756
- Yeah.
- So, these fish are

449
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:24,823
going to get big.

450
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,478
- Yeah.
- They're going to be fun.

451
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:28,101
Felix is like, freaking out.

452
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:30,858
- He's super shy!
- He's, like, so shy.

453
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:32,045
- [Missy] Aww.

454
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,628
(techno music)

455
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,020
- [Bryan] If you guys have not seen this

456
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,196
epic box fort castle that Corbin did,

457
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,390
go check out their channel,
link in the I-card.

458
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,591
This is impressive, dude.

459
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,014
(Bryan laughs)

460
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:50,845
It even has a working
drawbridge, look at that.

461
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:51,834
- [Corbin] It literally only
took me like five seconds.

462
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,643
(Bryan laughs)

463
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:54,661
- Sure.

464
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:55,825
Okay.

465
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:57,985
Good evening, June, how are you?

466
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,982
Look at that smile she's giving me.

467
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:01,195
- I know.
- You haven't seen me

468
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:02,720
in a while, huh, baby?

469
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,732
(laughs)

470
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,641
Decided to come over and
play for a little bit.

471
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:06,904
What are you putting on?

472
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,944
- They want to be a knight and dragon.

473
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:10,041
- [Bryan] Aww.

474
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,199
(Finn roars)

475
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,640
Oh no, we got a dragon on the loose!

476
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,765
- [Missy] Oh my gosh!

477
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:16,675
- [Bryan] That is so cute!

478
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:19,721
- Is that a fire-breathing dragon?

479
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:20,971
- [Bryan] Rawr!

480
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,737
You like the dragon?

481
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,110
Here, you can hold this, and then

482
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,862
you can control his head, see?

483
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:28,436
Keeps his head up.

484
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:29,603
June likes it.

485
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,250
Like, okay, cool.

486
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,652
Ollie?

487
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,244
What are you doing?

488
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:36,488
(laughs)

489
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:37,494
- I'm a knight!

490
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:39,806
- [Bryan] You're dressing
up like a knight?

491
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:40,663
That is so cute.

492
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:41,496
(laughs)

493
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,155
Looking good, dude!

494
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,002
So you're going to protect June, right?

495
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,041
(Kelsey laughs)

496
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,043
Okay.

497
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,522
Oh no!

498
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:49,983
All right, Ollie.

499
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:53,589
This is your box fort castle, okay?

500
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:56,086
You got to keep it safe, right?

501
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:56,919
- Uh huh.

502
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,234
- For June.
- Yes.

503
00:13:58,234 --> 00:13:59,879
- [Bryan] Okay, well you better be careful

504
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,891
because I heard there's a dragon!

505
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:02,357
(Ollie screams)

506
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:03,568
Get in there!

507
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,156
Get in there, dragon!

508
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:06,750
- [Missy] Close the drawbridge!

509
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,314
- [Bryan] Yeah, probably
should have shut the door, bro.

510
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,147
(adults laughing)

511
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:10,419
That was your first fatal mistake.

512
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,531
- [Corbin] First line of defense failed.

513
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:12,710
(Bryan laughs)

514
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,304
- [Bryan] Attack the castle!

515
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,579
(laughs)

516
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:18,662
(lighthearted music)

517
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:24,892
So, Kelsey and Corbin
don't have sippy cups

518
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:26,373
because they just have June.

519
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:27,789
- We don't have a toddler, okay?

520
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,030
- [Bryan] Yeah! It's fine!

521
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,469
So Finn really wants some milk, so--

522
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,771
- [Missy] He's like the Boss Baby!

523
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,344
You got to tip it back, baby.

524
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:35,824
- [Bryan] He's like, whoa!

525
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,618
- [Missy] If only you could
have taken that when you were

526
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:40,785
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 months.

527
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,077
- Twirling the hair.
- Twirling his hair.

528
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:45,798
That is so cute.

529
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,516
- He's going to go to bed.

530
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:49,942
He's going to go take a nap.

531
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:53,289
- [Bryan] He's going in
the box fort, to relax.

532
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:54,122
Hi!

533
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:57,645
Why are you so silly?

534
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:58,545
(laughs)

535
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:00,172
You are so silly.

536
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:01,350
Are you silly too, Finn?

537
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,702
Oh, is this for Ollie?

538
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,580
- Yeah.

539
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,522
- [Bryan] Oh!

540
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:05,392
He brought your water to you.

541
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:06,555
That was nice, huh?

542
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,166
I think that's all for the vlog, huh?

543
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,422
Did you have a fun day?

544
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:10,293
Yeah?

545
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:12,649
I loved seeing your school
pictures; those were cute.

546
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:13,680
And we got fish!

547
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,316
We got new fish, Finn!

548
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:17,505
Thanks for watching
today's video, you guys.

549
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:18,705

give it a big thumbs-up!

551
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,343
Thumbs-up!

All right, Finn, can you do the bye-boop?

556
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,095
Say bye!

557
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,701
Say bye!
- No no no no.

558
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:31,900
- No? No?

559
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,812
You can't do it?
- Yeah.

560
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:35,013
- Okay, Ollie?

561
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:37,130
Finn doesn't want to do it
tonight, you want to do it?

562
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,963
- Bye...

563
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:40,639
Boop!
