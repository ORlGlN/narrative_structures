1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:02,947
- Happy Easter!
Easter!

2
00:00:02,947 --> 00:00:04,388
- What'd you say?

3
00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:05,616
- Happy Easter I said.

4
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:08,199
- Oh (laughs).

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,122
♫ Wherever you are

6
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:17,371
♫ That's where I wanna be

7
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:18,505
♫ All it took was a laugh

8
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:20,128
♫ And that soft sunset

9
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:24,412
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

10
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:26,995
♫ This is home

11
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:29,257
♫ Just running around

12
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:31,503
♫ You never looked so cute

13
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:32,925
♫ Hugging you tight

14
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:35,721
♫ Cuddlin' all I could take in

15
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:38,764
♫ I am home

16
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:39,939
♫ Home forever

17
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,689
♫ You're with me

18
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,145
- Good morning you guys.

19
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,778
Look at my snazzy little boy.

20
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:50,312
- Hey guys, I have to show you something.

21
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:51,671
- He has to show you something.

22
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:52,606
What are you gonna show them?

23
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:56,845
He woke up this morning and
saw a deflated bouncy house.

24
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:58,519
- Yeah, and it's really flat.

25
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:00,832
- It's really flat because it's not on.

26
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:02,299
We're gonna turn it on later though, okay?

27
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,803
Missy is gettin' the boys ready.

28
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:05,230
Ollie is wearing a tie.

29
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,420
Fin is wearing a bow tie.

30
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,787
Looks pretty dapper.

31
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:10,648
Babe, you look so cute.

32
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:12,260
We're all dressed and sharp this mornin'

33
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,978
gettin' ready to go to church

34
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:16,399
for a really awesome Easter service.

35
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:17,740
I'm really looking forward to it.

36
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,928
You are so cute this mornin' Mr. Fin.

37
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:22,535
(laughs)

38
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:23,368
Alright.

39
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:24,479
It's time to do Ollie's hair.

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,012
Got to put a little bit of primer in it

41
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:26,845
to get it all wet.

42
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:30,155
Choo, choo, choo, choo,
choo, choo, choo, choo.

43
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:31,111
Now we brush it.

44
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:33,166
- Bryan, me wanna shoot.

45
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,735
- You wanna shoot the blow dryer?

46
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:36,568
- Yeah.

47
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:37,401
(laughs)

48
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:38,607
- Are you excited for Easter?

49
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:39,440
- Yeah.

50
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,273
- Guess what?

51
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:41,299
CJ and Bailey are comin' over.

52
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,132
- Huh!

53
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:42,965
They are?

54
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:44,178
- They are.
They are, yeah.

55
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:45,441
- At my house?

56
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:46,752
- At your house, yeah.

57
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,632
Is that gonna be fun?

58
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:48,758
- Yeah.

59
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,998
- Look at that happy, smiley face.

60
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:52,241
You ready for church dude?

61
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,977
- Yeah, but I wanna look at that.

62
00:01:53,977 --> 00:01:56,001
- He always wants to
play with the blow dryer.

63
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,025
- Okay, shoot the aliens.

64
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:57,979
Shoot the aliens.

65
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,102
(laughs)

66
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:01,569
I think we're just about ready

67
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,344
to head out to the living room.

68
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:04,243
- Choo.

69
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:05,076
- Choo!

70
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:06,548
You just blasted my arm off.

71
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:10,048
(delightful guitar music)

72
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,251
Lookin' good babe.

73
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,972
- Let's go see what the Easter got.

74
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:45,157
- Let's go see what the Easter got, okay?

75
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:45,990

76
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:49,094
- Look that.

77
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:51,739
- Is that rabbit poop?

78
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,575
- It's rabbit poop.

79
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:55,294
(laughs)

80
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:57,711
- [Bryan] Fin knows the idea.

81
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:00,969
- Huh!

82
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:03,627
- Da, da.

83
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,517

- This.

86
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,026
Mickey Mouse.

87
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,250
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

88
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,083
- Ooh.

89
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,419
I think this one looks like yours.

90
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,141
Ooh, and that one looks like Fin's.

91
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:19,974
- Ooh yeah.

92
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:20,807
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

93
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,921
- Fin's already eating the rabbit poop.

94
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:23,754
- Look.

95
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:24,715

97
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:26,381

Huh dude?

00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:29,572
Who's that?

101
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:32,209

And look.

105
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,247
Even flashcards, so you

00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:39,426
- Yeah.

107
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,171

108
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,609
And look, you got a Mickey
in the Roadster Racer car.

109
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:44,778
Fin, what do you have?

110
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:45,611
- Ooh!

111
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:46,444
(laughs)

112
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:47,627
- Can you open this for me you guys?

113
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,985
- [Bryan] He's so excited.

114
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:51,068
- It's a Ryder's Pup Pad.

115
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,279
How cool,

Oh, we've been needing

119
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,704

128
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,490
- Yeah, he's really giant.

129
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,551

130
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,783
Oh, hi there kids.

131
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:14,206
Happy Easter.

00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,589

136
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,595
- There's one more--

137
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:21,428
- What is that?

138
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,267
- [Bryan] That one I think's for mama.

139
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,100
- What?

140
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,132

00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:33,436
It's Beauty and the Beast.

00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:34,705
- Is it Beauty and the Beast?

149
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:37,758

153
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:42,253

Chip!

170
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:07,182
- [Bryan] It's an exact
replica from the movie.

171
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,938
- That's so cute.

172
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:09,929

- [Bryan] It's one of two-thousand too.

181
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,165
They only made two-thousand of these.

182
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:23,998
- [Ollie] Hey.

183
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:24,831
- Wow.

184
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:26,303
I'm gonna need to have a little tea party.

185
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,911
- [Bryan] Either that or
a hot chocolate party.

186
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,841
Whatever you want, ya know?

187
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:29,841

188
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:30,787
- [Ollie] Mama?

189
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:31,858
- [Bryan] But you're
always sayin' how cool

190
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:32,924
it'd be to have an
actual tea set, ya know?

191
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:33,757
- Yeah.

192
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:34,590
Yeah baby?

193
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,423
- [Bryan] And it's fine china.

194
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:36,764
So you can keep it in your hutch too.

195
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:38,057
- There's Chip.

196
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:39,891
- Yeah I can see that.

197
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:41,490
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool Ollie?

198
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,192
- It's got a little
bit broken right there,

199
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:44,151
but that's okay.

200
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:44,984
- [Bryan] Yeah.

201
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:45,817
- Yeah it's okay (laughs).

202
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,979
- I know Easter isn't about gifts,

203
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,195
but I saw that for Missy
and I had to get it for you

204
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,057
because it looked so cool

205
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:53,672
and I was like, I cannot pass this up.

206
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:54,653
(laughs)

207
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:55,486
- It's pretty awesome.

208
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:56,319
I love it.

209
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,152
- [Bryan] And the boys are so happy

210
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:58,554
with all their little toys and candy.

211
00:05:58,554 --> 00:05:59,387
- Can you open this?

212
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:00,220
- Yes.

213
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,053
- [Bryan] We will open that.

214
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,220
- There's an egg in there.

215
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,053
- Oh, bubble gum.

216
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:03,886
One of my favorite thing in the morning.

217
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:04,719
(laughs)

218
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:05,552
We're not gonna eat it right now, okay?

219
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:06,839
- [Bryan] Yeah, let's
eat some breakfast boys

220
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,428
and then we gotta go to church, okay?

221
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:10,174
- Can you help clean up
all this Easter Bunny poop?

222
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:11,038
Who did this?

223
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,712
- [Bryan] Yeah Fin, go eat all those.

224
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:13,648
- No, not eat 'em.

225
00:06:13,648 --> 00:06:14,481
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie.

226
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,835
Can you clean up all
the Easter Bunny poop?

227
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,286
- [Missy] Put 'em in your basket.

228
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:19,142
- [Bryan] Can you do that for us

229
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:20,861
and then you can have a piece of candy.

230
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:22,058
Sound good?

231
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:22,891
- Yeah.

232
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:23,724
- [Bryan] Okay.

233
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:26,529
Missy made me a very delicious
breakfast before church.

234
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,877
I actually just got done
gettin' all this meat

235
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:29,710
ready for tonight.

236
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,543
- [Ollie] Hey guys!

237
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:31,889
- [Bryan] I have all this filet mignon

238
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,464
sitting out and I seasoned it up.

239
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:35,032
I'm actually gonna sous vide it tonight.

240
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:38,490
This is my first time sous
viding big roasts like that.

241
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,459
But I'm pretty excited for
how it's gonna turn out.

242
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:41,292
- It was my idea.

243
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,294
- [Bryan] It was Missy's idea (laughs).

244
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:44,663
She's gettin' some eggs.

245
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:45,787
We're eatin' breakfast in a hurry.

246
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,641
We gotta leave in at
least 15 minutes, okay?

247
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,392
So finish your pancakes, alright?

248
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,836
- Okay.

249
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:51,669
- [Bryan] Okay.

250
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:52,502
You too Fin.

251
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:53,335
You don't get off the hook

252
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:54,403
just cause you're dressed all cute today.

253
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:55,391
- Uh, eggs.

254
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:56,224
- [Bryan] Eggs, yes.

255
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:57,099
There's eggs

256
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:58,115
on the flowers, huh?

257
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:58,948
- Eggs.

258
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:00,067
- [Bryan] Eggs.

259
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,367
- That's for Easter.

260
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:02,200
Mmm hmm.

261
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,999
- Guys, we forgot our camera (laughs).

262
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:07,672
We're so bummed but we're
gonna use the phone and--

263
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:08,795
- Luckily in this day and age,

264
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,860
you're never really without a camera.

265
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,693
- No.

266
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,080
You can always capture whatever you want.

267
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,537
So we are off to church.

268
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:14,933
We're all dressed.

269
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,246
The boys are dressed and he's actually

270
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:17,336
playing with his toy.

271
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,035
He's like obsessed with this thing.

272
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:21,097
Technically, Fin got it,

273
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,707
but they're willing to share.

274
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:23,644
So it's not a big deal.

275
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,425
Ollie's so great going to nursery now.

276
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:27,549
He has no problems and
he has a ton of fun.

277
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:29,807
Fin, on the other hand definitely
has more issues right now.

278
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,803
He's definitely in that
phase of separation anxiety.

279
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,011
So, it's a little bit tough.

280
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:33,857
We'll see what happens.

281
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:37,564
Hopefully, hopefully he
just does good for me today.

282
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:38,397
It's Easter.

283
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:40,705
So anyways, off to church we go (laughs).

284
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:41,538
(crying)

285
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:42,396
(laughs)

286
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,754
- [Bryan] Trying to take photos.

287
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,590
The little boys looks so cute

288
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,742
and they just ended in Fin being like,

289
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:47,575
don't hug me.

290
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,003
Ollie, guess who's here.

291
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:49,836
- What?

292
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,669
- [Bryan] Mimi and Papa.

293
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,502
- Mimi and Papa?

294
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:52,777
- [Bryan] Yeah.

295
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:53,714
Oh jeez.

296
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:54,547
(laughs)

297
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:55,830
- [Missy] Oh my God.

298
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,939
(crying)

299
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,561
- [Bryan] That was quite
the Easter hug Ollie.

300
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,921
- That's all he said.

301
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,517
- Give him a hug, a real hug.

302
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:05,267
(peaceful music)

303
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,423
- When they bow down with
their faces to the ground,

304
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:21,914
but the men said to them,

305
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:24,611
why do you look for the
living among the dead?

306
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:26,393
He is not here.

307
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:27,868
He is risen.

308
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:29,035
Remember how he told you

309
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,301
why he was still with you in Galilee,

310
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,116
the Son of Man must be delivered

311
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:35,276
into the hands of sinful men?

312
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:39,602
Be crucified and on the
third day, raise again?

313
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,211
- [Bryan] Hey buddy.

314
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:42,491
- They gave me a lot of stuff.

315
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,938
- [Bryan] You got some stuff?

316
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,692
- They got me

317
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,591
this.

318
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,914
- [Bryan] Oh, that's so cool.

319
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:48,747
- [Missy] You got neat stuff?

320
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:49,580
- [Bryan] Oh, you got a little bow tie?

321
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,793
- [Missy] Yeah.

322
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:52,778
- [Bryan] Oh, and a cool little bracelet.

323
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:53,611
Ollie got goodies.

324
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:55,741
- He says that that's his too.

325
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,749
- [Bryan] Oh (laughs).

326
00:08:57,749 --> 00:08:58,582
Both you boys did so good, didn't you?

327
00:08:58,582 --> 00:08:59,419
- Yeah.

328
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:00,824
- Did you have fun?

329
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:03,165
Okay, let's get your shoes on.

330
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:04,902
- Alright, guess what guys?

331
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:08,281
Boys, Mimi and Papa got you
a little Easter present.

332
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,324
Wanna see what it is?

333
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:10,157
- Yeah.

334
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:10,990
- Alright.

335
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,823
Go check it out.

336
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:12,656
Go in the living room.

337
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:13,724
- [Mimi] In the living room.

338
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,363
- Ahh!

339
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:16,196
Oh ohh!

340
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:19,606
This is mine?

341
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,381
- [Missy] That one's yours.

342
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,548
- [Mimi] They're scooters.

343
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,121
Excuse me.

344
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:27,866
- [Missy] Fin, do you like yours?

345
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,236
That's yours.

346
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,617
Ollie, who's on your scooter?

347
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:32,450
- Spiderman.

348
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,460
- [Missy] Spiderman!

349
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,250
- Yeah, and I wanna play out.

350
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,024
- [Missy] Look and you
got a Spiderman helmet.

351
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,651
- Oh.

352
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:39,768
- [Missy] What did you get Fin?

353
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:40,811
Are you excited?

354
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:42,317
- [Ollie] He got a--

355
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:45,873
- This is a bike that
then turns into a scooter.

356
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:47,664
- That's so cool.

357
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:49,138
He loves anything with wheels.

358
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,262
He is going to love this!

359
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:52,808
You guys look so cool.

360
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,392
- [Mimi] Oh, look at him.

361
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:55,225
- [Missy] He's ready to go.

362
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,291
Are you ready?

363
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,218
- [Mimi] Good for him.

364
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:58,791
- And these are really
cool cause the wheels

365
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,726
are like rubber and so they--

366
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,284
They'll like spin a lot easier.

367
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:04,351
- [Mimi] Yeah, the other
ones, we had plastic wheels.

368
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:06,412
- They're just not right.

369
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:07,245
- But ride this.

370
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:08,819
- [Mimi] Oh my goodness.

371
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,285
- [Missy] Look how cool you look.

372
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,615
- [Mimi] You look so good.

373
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:14,081
- Alright, Fin gets his on now.

374
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,405
Ooh.

375
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,983
It looks like the size
of your head (laughs).

376
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,854
Look how cool you look dude.

377
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,063
Fin wanted it to be a scooter,

378
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:23,296
so let's try that now.

379
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:24,518
- There you go.

380
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:25,403
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

381
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,134
He's so cute (laughs).

382
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:32,137
What do you think of that (laughs)?

383
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:33,804
Okay Fin, your turn.

384
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:37,701
You gotta push with your foot.

385
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:42,458
- Show Fin how you push,
push, push with your foot.

386
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,686
- [Missy] There you go.

387
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:44,914
And then if you push really hard,

388
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:46,725
you can just stand on it and it will go.

389
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,178
- [Mimi] There you go.

390
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:49,797
It takes lots of practice,

391
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:52,578
but hang on and we'll just
take you on a little ride.

392
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:55,952
- [Missy] I feel like the bumps
are actually not helping us.

393
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:56,785
Go Fin.

394
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:58,301
Use your foot.

395
00:10:58,301 --> 00:10:59,134
- Bring--

396
00:10:59,134 --> 00:10:59,967
- [Missy} Use your Foot.

397
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,924
Go.

398
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,007
There you go.

399
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,397
- [Mimi] Good job Ollie.

400
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,842
- [Missy] There you go Fin, go.

401
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:06,675
There you are.

402
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:07,508
Yay!

403
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:08,341
Missy, he's doin' it.

404
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,316
Oh, he started doin' it.

405
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:10,571
- Da, da.

406
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:11,404
- [Missy] Da, da, da.

407
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,185
You're gettin' it!

408
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,614
- [Mimi] That's so cool dude.

409
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:15,447
- Almost there.

410
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:16,280
- [Mimi] Almost there.

411
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,113
(laughs)

412
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:18,202
- Ollie, ready to watch?

413
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:19,035
Look.

414
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:19,868
Ready?

415
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:20,865
Push and then foot up.

416
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:22,861
- [Missy] See how she's riding.

417
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,266
Say good job Auntie.

418
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,371
- Good job Auntie.

419
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,040
- Thanks Ollie.

420
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,909
- Thank you so much for the scooter!

421
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:30,933
I love it.

422
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:31,817
- You love it?

423
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,067
- [Missy] Aah (laughs).

424
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,389
- [Mimi] Yeah, you wanna try that next?

425
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:36,711
- [Bryan] Alright, our Easter celebration

426
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:39,195
has officially begun.

427
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,028
Oh no.

428
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:42,146
DJ, she talked you into
riding in this thing with her?

429
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:42,979
(laughs)

430
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,047
Are you prepared dude?

431
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,439
Get that thing tight in
case you go upside down.

432
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,662
Missy likes to do flips.

433
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:48,158
Are you okay with flips?

434
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,651
(laughs)

435
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:50,678
He literally can't even speak right now.

436
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,180
He doesn't know what's gonna happen.

437
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,347
(revving)

438
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,005
He's got a last will and testament, right?

439
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:01,143
(laughs)

440
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:03,364
So while Missy's ridin'
around on the go-cart,

441
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,614
Randy has found my RC cars.

442
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:08,521
Woo!

443
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:10,788
You got the monster truck?

444
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:11,621
Woo!

445
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,250
(jubilant music)

446
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,504
I don't think you could of asked

447
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:26,167
for a more perfect day though.

448
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,301
It is so beautiful out here.

449
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,433
The sun is shining.

450
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,243
We got like a cool breeze.

451
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:32,944
The skies are blue.

452
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:34,631
Look, there they go (laughs).

453
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,466
And it's such a great day

454
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:38,005
I think to be with family,

455
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:41,313
to remember Easter and to enjoy yourself.

456
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:43,005
I am really excited.

457
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:44,787
Today is gonna be a fun day.

458
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:47,537
(exciting music)

459
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:01,720
That literally bunny-hopped (laughs).

460
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,387
Goin' up the road (laughs).

461
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,018
Randy literally knocked the rod.

462
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:09,862
- It looks like it's all there.

463
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:10,695
(laughs)

464
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:12,132
- The drive shaft is gone.

465
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:13,405
- Looks like it's all there though.

466
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:14,676
(laughs)

467
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:18,843
- [Bryan] Are you gonna
really pop it on (laughs)?

468
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,164
- That is hot.

469
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:26,997
- [Bryan] You found the other part?

470
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:27,830
- Yep, right here.

471
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,663
- That's cool.

472
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:29,717
(laughs)

473
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:31,091
- You might actually

474
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:31,924
not want to touch it.

475
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:33,315
- [Bryan] That is so funny.

476
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:35,772
- That should be it.

477
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:37,825
That attaches with an Allen wrench.

478
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:38,682
- Don't pick it up.

479
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:40,166
It's hot.

480
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,361
- It was hot when I first touched it.

481
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:44,115
- This is how we do Easter
ladies and gentlemen.

482
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,733
And this happened you guys.

483
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,254
We got a bouncy house for the kids.

484
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:49,921
You wanna go inside?

485
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,858
(jovial music)

486
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:10,209
- [Bryan] Alright kiddos.

487
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:12,532
The Easter Bunny came this morning

488
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:13,855
and we looked out in our courtyard.

489
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,402
There was a ton of eggs.

490
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,418
So who's up for collecting eggs?

491
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:18,251
- Me.

492
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:19,084
- [Bryan] Can you guys collect some eggs?

493
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:19,917
- Yeah!

494
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:20,750
- [Bryan] Alright.

495
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,651
We gotta make some omelettes,

496
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:23,118
so we need you guys to go out there.

497
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:23,951
- [Ollie] Want the big one.

498
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:24,784
- [Bryan] You want the big one?

499
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:25,617
- Yeah.

500
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:26,875
- [Bryan] You gotta be fast.

501
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,708
Okay?

502
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,541
- You've got to get all of them.

503
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,040
There's like a lot of them.

504
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,459
- [Girl] I want, I want them.

505
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:33,626
- [Crowd] Woo!

506
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,535
- [Bryan] Go Fin, go!

507
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:38,877
Go Olivia!

508
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:39,974
(laughs)

509
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:41,062
- [Missy] There's some with money.

510
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:42,061
(laughs)

511
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:42,894
- [Mimi] You gotta pick some up

512
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:43,736
and find eggs.

513
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:45,250
What happened?

514
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,624
- [Bryan] Fin just throws it.

515
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,450
He's like, that's how
you get the candy out.

516
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,033
(jovial music)

517
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,506
Whoa Ollie, there's a big green one.

518
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,563
Whoa, is there some in the fireplace too?

519
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:10,396
- A egg.

520
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,556
I got a egg.

521
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,325
- [Bryan] You found the golden one!

522
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,408
(laughs)

523
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:26,026
- A Skittle one.

524
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,716
- [Bryan] Oh, a Skittle one.

525
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:29,713
- Mama, I got a Skittle egg.

526
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:30,546
- Aah!

527
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,885
(jovial music)

528
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:43,540
- [Bryan] I don't think I've
ever seen Oliver move so fast.

529
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,781
(laughs)

530
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:47,159
He's running.

531
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,064
Ollie, you're a pro, dude.

532
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:49,897
- Yeah.

533
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:50,978
- [Bryan] I think we're
making up for that time

534
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:52,203
we went to the Easter Egg Hunt.

535
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,570
After all the Easter eggs were found

536
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,486
and Ollie couldn't get any.

537
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,319
- I remember that.

538
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,152
- Look, I found a pink one.

539
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:56,985
- There's more?

540
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:57,818
- Yeah.

541
00:15:57,818 --> 00:15:58,820
- [Bryan] He's seriously a pro at this.

542
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,653
How's Fin doin'?

543
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,486
- He's doing great.

544
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:01,403
He actually figured it out.

545
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:03,427
Now he's competing with his brother but--

546
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,127
- Look how much I got.

547
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:06,610
Look how much I got.

548
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,193
- [Bryan] Let me see Fin.

549
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:09,575
Whoa!

550
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:10,582
- [Missy] You need to
empty 'em and go get more.

551
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:12,453
Cause there's like two-hundred out here.

552
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:13,515
(laughs)

553
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,971
We are on the search for
at least one more big one.

554
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:18,707
We told them that there
might be one over here.

555
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:21,174
And everyone's a little warm.

556
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:23,007
- Colder, colder.

557
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:23,961
(laughs)

558
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,014
- [Bryan] Gettin' warmer.

559
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:27,454
- I don't know.

560
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,177
- [Papa] Did you get the ladder
out and put it on the roof?

561
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:30,010
- [Missy] No, I did not.

562
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,872
The Easter Bunny did
not put it on the roof

563
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:33,852
when he pooped it out.

564
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:35,203
I think that's what they do.

565
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,036
(laughs)

566
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,163
- I don't know if you got the story right.

567
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,245
(laughs)

568
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,127
Unsanitary.

569
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:42,646
- [Missy] Olivia's doin' so good.

570
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:44,221
- [Auntie] Come over here and look.

571
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:45,692
- [Child] Ow.

572
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:46,571
- [Bryan] Oh.

573
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:47,738
- [Missy] Ooh!

574
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:51,840
Let me see it CJ.

575
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,290
What!

576
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,601
- [Man] Oh, that was supposed to be mine.

577
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:55,988
(laughs)

578
00:16:55,988 --> 00:16:57,230
- [Woman] CJ's buyin' lunch.

579
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,897
- [Missy] Look at all your eggs.

580
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:04,746
(jubilant music)

581
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,229
- [Missy] Alright CJ.

582
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,326
How'd ya make out?

583
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:23,570
- Good.

584
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,403
- [Missy] Good?

585
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:25,362
You got a ton of candy?

586
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,008
Oh my goodness!

587
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:28,401
And forty bucks, right?

588
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,234
- Yeah.

589
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,354
(laughs)

590
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:31,363
- For mommy, right?

591
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:32,749
(laughs)

592
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:33,954
- [Missy] Yeah. We got a ton of candy.

593
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:36,720
We just emptied out
all the eggs basically.

594
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,282
Let me see Olivia.

595
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,875
You have a chocolate face.

596
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,106
You and Fin have chocolate face.

597
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,509
They just keep stealing
all the melted chocolate

598
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:46,777
and like putting it everywhere.

599
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:49,704
It's slightly gross but, ahh.

600
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,495
That was cute.

601
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:53,035
Good sharing.

602
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:53,868
(laughs)

603
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:54,762
He's like, sure I'll--

604
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:56,408
Oh gosh (laughs).

605
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,613
That's so cute.

606
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:00,512
You're gonna be a good
big sister (laughs).

607
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,345
- Alright.

608
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:02,815
While all the kids are
opening their Easter eggs,

609
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,238
I have just finished Easter Dinner.

610
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:06,074
Check this out.

611
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:09,772
We got green beans in a
garlic ginger with peppers,

612
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:12,030
mashed potatoes and gravy,

613
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,280
and filet mignon roasts.

614
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,575
I'm so nervous about this

615
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:18,070
because I've never sous
vide filet mignon roasts.

616
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,750
So I'm gonna cut into it now
and see what it looks like.

617
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,167
But I'm hopin' it looks good.

618
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:25,390
Yum.

619
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,022
It looks super good.

620
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:29,182
- [Missy] Oh yay!

621
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,877
- I did it medium so everyone can ya know.

622
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:31,989
Some people like it underdone.

623
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:33,023
- [Missy] For dad.

624
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:33,856
He likes well-done.

625
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:34,689
- I like mine cooked.

626
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,522
(laughs)

627
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:36,578
- Medium is supposed to
be the best temperature

628
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:37,411
for this cut of meat.

629
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,594
- [Missy] Yeah.

630
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:39,449
- It's supposed to be the most tender.

631
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,516
You get most of the flavor out so--

632
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:41,888
- My dad doesn't like well done,

633
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,291
but he's definitely on
the more like cooked side

634
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,043
and we're on the more rare side.

635
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,223
So there's always a struggle of like--

636
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:48,563
- Like a good vet can save it.

637
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:49,396
- [Missy] Yeah.

638
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:50,229
That's true.

639
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,456
Me and Bryan like it pretty rare.

640
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,339
Yum.

641
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:55,172
It looks good.

642
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:56,734
I think that's plenty
of food for all of us.

643
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,479
We'll see.
- We'll see.

644
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,312
(laughs)

645
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,729
- [Missy] It looks delicious.

646
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:08,595
- [Crowd] Amen.

647
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,095
- [Bryan] Let's eat.

648
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:13,936
It's buffet-style, so just grab a plate.

649
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:15,519
Grab what you want.

650
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:19,421
(delightful music)

651
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,536
- [Bryan] Check this out you guys.

652
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:29,302
These kids are loving this waterslide.

653
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,135
Whoa!

654
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:32,352
Gotcha!

655
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:33,976
Go Ollie!

656
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:35,493
Oh my gosh.

657
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:37,550
Hey dude, how does the water feel?

658
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,113
- I just lay down on my belly

659
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:42,181
and go down and jump in the water.

660
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,014
- [Bryan] Do it again!

661
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:43,847
Go.

662
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:47,772
(exciting music)

663
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:58,667
Fin is standing very dangerously
close to the splash-zone.

664
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,467
(laughs loudly)

665
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,300
Got you!

666
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,269
(laughs)

667
00:20:06,982 --> 00:20:08,872
Fin doesn't even care.

668
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:09,957
He's like, I want in.

669
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:11,174
- You want your bathing suit on?

670
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:12,716
Ahh.

671
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:13,623
- [Woman] Oh jeez!

672
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:16,514
- [Bryan] Oh (laughs).

673
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:17,430
- [Woman] Oh jeez!

674
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,362
- [Bryan] Oh (laughs).

675
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:22,695
Karma, you silly dog!

676
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,778
(laughs)

677
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,553
(jovial music)

678
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:57,797
- [Bryan] Look at these two

679
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:59,839
being all lovey-dovey.

680
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,882
How ya doin' Na?

681
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,169
I just did some training with her,

682
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:03,382
which is why her Gentle Leader's on.

683
00:21:03,382 --> 00:21:04,776
And she did so good.

684
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,343
Oh, you givin' her hugs?

685
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:07,655
You givin' her hugs?

686
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:10,316
Hey baby girl, did you
have a good First Easter?

687
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,393
- You can feel it.

688
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:12,734
- [Bryan] Did you have a good Easter?

689
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:13,567
- Mmm.

690
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:14,400
(kissing mwah)

691
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,715
- [Bryan] Ah, he gave her a kiss.

692
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:16,821
- Aww.

693
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:17,899
- [Bryan] Hey dude.

694
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:19,464
You watchin' what?

695
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:20,297
- Wing--

696
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:21,619
- [Bryan] Oh, are you?

697
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:22,452
- Yeah.

698
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:23,928
- [Bryan] Did you have
a good Easter, buddy?

699
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:24,761
- Yep.

700
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:25,780
- [Bryan] Do you give it a thumbs up?

701
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,660
Give Easter a thumbs up.

702
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,821
(laughs)

703
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,658
I love you kiddo.

704
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:31,881
- I love you too.

705
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:33,079
- [Bryan] Missy always makes fun of me

706
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,319
for playing with the spinner.

707
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,152
You like it too.

708
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:35,985
You know you do.

709
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:37,918
- I do like it, but I can stop.

710
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:38,952
I can get it so fast.

711
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:42,241
- [Bryan] She's so proud
of herself right now.

712
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:43,921
I put--
- Oh.

713
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:46,293
- [Bryan] Mrs. Potts--

714
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:47,722
- Oh, that looks so cute.

715
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:48,956
- [Bryan] In your china hutch.

716
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:50,456
- I love it.

717
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,525
- [Bryan] It's like just chillin'
with all our other china.

718
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,388
- [Missy] I just love their little faces.

719
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:55,221
- [Bryan] Yeah, I know.

720
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:56,368
- [Missy] It's like
they're really watchin' us.

721
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:57,620
(laughs)

722
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,453
That's so cool.

723
00:21:58,453 --> 00:21:59,286
I love it!

724
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:00,119
- It looks good in there, huh?

725
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,315
We had such a fantastic Easter

726
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:04,853
and I hope you guys did as well.

727
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:06,186
Let us know in the comments

728
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,725
what you guys did for Easter.

729
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,393
Thanks for watchin' today's video.

730
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:11,306
We will see you manana.

731
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:13,209
Fin, can you say bye?

732
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:14,042
Say bye.

733
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:16,291
Ah ha, he's waving.

734
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,124
Bye.

735
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:17,957
- Ahhh.
