1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
- Hey, guys!

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,443
Welcome to today's vlog,
but before it starts,

3
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:07,312
Finn do we have announcement to make?

4
00:00:07,312 --> 00:00:08,337
(babbling)

5
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:11,688
The wait is over and our
Christmas album is now out!

6
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:13,355
Yay, I'm so excited!

7
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:16,525
It's called A Very Daily Bumps Christmas,

8
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,355
I'll have it linked down
below in the description,

9
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:20,496
and it's just one of those rare things

10
00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:23,326
that came together at the
last second with our family,

11
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:26,604
and I'm just so excited and
so happy, and it just makes my

12
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:29,020
heart so warm, and Christmas-y.

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,191
- Yep, you're gonna hear
every single one of us,

14
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:33,610
we're all in it, including Karma and Luna.

15
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,569
- Karma's in the song, Luna's in a song,

16
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:39,342
Finn's in two songs,
Missy sings her own song,

17
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:40,461
I sing my own song.

18
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:42,379
- I'm so nervous, you
guys will have to tell me

19
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:43,252
if I did good.

20
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,289
You can tell me the truth.

21
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,983

on iTunes for a limited time,

00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,312

Go buy our Christmas album.

25
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,743
Our first family Christmas album.

26
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:53,576
- Yeah.

27
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:54,979
- It's a big deal!
- It's so cute.

28
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,325
I think it's fun for like, kids, adults,

29
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,165
like everyone.

30
00:00:58,165 --> 00:00:59,329
It's got the classics,

31
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,370
it's got some originals.

32
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,363
It's awesome.

33
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:02,196
- Yes.

34
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,029
So go check it out.

35
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,862
Now, onto today's vlog!

36
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,238

- Good morning!
- Good morning!

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,477
- You guys, I'm right in the
middle of doing my makeup,

47
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:34,318
but these boys are like
"We need to find Fred,

48
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:35,151
"right this second."

49
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:36,839
Yesterday he had some owies

50
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:38,759
and he had bandaids on, so we're hoping

51
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,587
he's feeling a little
bit better today, right?

52
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:41,420
- Yeah

53
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,471
- [Missy] Alright, where's Fred?

54
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,634
- Fred!

55
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:45,585
(Missy laughing)

56
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,253
- [Missy] I think they
might've already come out here

57
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:48,131
and found him.

58
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:49,009
Where is he?

59
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:49,842
Let's see.

60
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:50,995
Ah, there he is!

61
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:53,298
Why is he holding a pen?

62
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:54,131
- Uh oh!

63
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:56,862
- [Missy] What?

64
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,056
- Look!

65
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:01,473
- [Missy] Oh my goodness, what did he do?

66
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:04,203
(Missy laughs)

67
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:05,667
How did he even do that?

68
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,247
- [Oliver] I don't know.

69
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:08,918
- You can fly really good, Fred!

70
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,504
He drew little elf hats on you guys.

71
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:12,827
On all of us!

72
00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:14,580
That better come off, Fred.

73
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,209
That better come off.

74
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,214
Wow.

75
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:18,795
What if that doesn't come off?

76
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,878
What if that has to stay
there forever and ever?

77
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:21,835
- I don't know.

78
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:23,089
- [Missy] (laughs) I don't know.

79
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:26,293
Oh my gosh, look, Ollie, he
did did it on these, too!

80
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:28,547
Oh my goodness you guys,
I love this picture.

81
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:29,970
(Missy giggles)

82
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,019
He never cried, but he
just had that look of like

83
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,348
"Get me away from this man."

84
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:35,298
Yep.

85
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:36,297
And this one.

86
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,340
Oh, and this one.

87
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,965
He did Mommy and Daddy too, look!

88
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:42,221
Here, lets open it.

89
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:43,551
(Missy laughs)

90
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:45,570
Isn't that so silly?

91
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,525
- That's momma!

92
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:48,775
- [Missy] Yeah!

93
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:50,889
And a little hat!

94
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,191
That is so funny.

95
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:53,489
Did he just prank us?

96
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:54,532
- Yeah.

97
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:55,865
- Did he prank us?

98
00:02:55,865 --> 00:03:00,473
Mister Fredrick, all those
little hats better come off!

99
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,015
Oh look what it says here, boys,

100
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,848
it says "ha, ha, ha...

101
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:05,639
"ha, ha...

102
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:07,679
"ha, ha, ha...

103
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:10,468
(Missy laughs)

104
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:11,801
"Got you! Fred."

105
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:15,292
He wrote a note that said
"ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

106
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,683
He's such a jokester huh?

107
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:17,617
But seriously,

108
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:18,959
I'm like, okay does this come off?

109
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,218
(Missy laughing)

110
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,090
Well anyways, good morning guys!

111
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,754
I'm gonna get these boys
some breakfast, and then I

112
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,792
actually have to finish getting ready,

113
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,884
'cause I am, like, right in
the middle of it right now.

114
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:32,467
(dramatic Christmas music)

115
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:51,219
All right.

116
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,408
We are off to school

117
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:55,369
and I've got to say you guys
it's a little chilly out today.

118
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,419
I just checked and it's like in the 40's

119
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,131
but it's weird 'cause I
checked the temperature

120
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:01,211
and it said it was gonna
be in the 80's today,

121
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,874
so I'm hoping it's not
going to be super cold.

122
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,556
'Cause we did not bring jackets.

123
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,870
I think he might have a spare
jacket in his classroom.

124
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,214
If it's still cold out he'll have a jacket

125
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:12,552
but I'm guessing it's going to warm up.

126
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,431
Allright.

127
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:15,008
One, two, three.

128
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,003
Look how cute he is.

129
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:18,629
I just love his little face.

130
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,462
Alright.

131
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:20,629
You ready for school?

132
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:21,462
Let's do it.

133
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,928
Ollie is off to school and now
it is girl's day or morning.

134
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,569
- Girls Morning.

135
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,707
(laughter) We've got our Starbucks

136
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:30,563
and we're getting pedicures.
- Yes.

137
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,363
But I actually also
really need my nails done

138
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:33,663
so I'm doing that actually later.

139
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,496
I'm coming back here later.

140
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,857
- Are you serious? (laughing)

141
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:38,194
- 'Cause it's really bad guys.

142
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,414
I'm not even going to show you.

143
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:40,247
Alright.

144
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,080
We're sitting down right now

145
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,140
and we're, like, in our own
private room. (laughing)

146
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,257
We always go to the same place.

147
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:46,678
This place is amazing,

148
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:48,316
and so we make appointments to come here

149
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:51,449
but we normally sit
out in the regular area

150
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,915
and, last time you were here, (laughing)

151
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:56,086
okay, first of all, Kelsey's
like the quietest person.

152
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:57,456
Way quieter than me.

153
00:04:57,456 --> 00:05:00,082
And we were talking and they
told Kelsey to be quiet.

154
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,921
- They told me I was
being too loud. (laughing)

155
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:07,177
- I think she was, like,
really embarrassed. (laughing)

156
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:10,410
And we came today and they were
like, you get your own room.

157
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,820
I think it's like on your record.

158
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,913
They must be like, "Oh
is it Kelsey coming?"

159
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,156
- Oh, (mumbles).

160
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:15,989
(Missy laughing)

161
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:18,439
- She's so loud. (laughing)

162
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,211
Alright, I had to do fake
little flip flops. (laughing)

163
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:25,593
But I really like it.

164
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:26,479
- Looks great.

165
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,060
- I think I'm going to wear these all day

166
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,904
'cause they just look so cute.

167
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:30,737
- So cute.

168
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:32,899
- Yeah, actually, I usually get gel

169
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,084
so I can just put on my
regular tennis shoes again

170
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,142
but she suggested I just do
regular polish this time.

171
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:41,054
But it was so nice actually
being able to talk.

172
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,470
- I know!
- That is the one thing.

173
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,348
- We're requesting that
room every time from now on.

174
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:47,980
- And that's the fun
thing about that place.

175
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,071
We love that place.

176
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:49,904
Oh my gosh, it's amazing.

177
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:52,635
- It's the best pedicure but
you have to sit in silence.

178
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:53,804
- They're like, "Shhh"

179
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:54,637
- Unless you go to the beach room.

180
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,260
- And we were not talking loud.

181
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,599
I just want to make sure,
like, last time we were there

182
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:00,397
we were not talking loud.

183
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:01,979
We were whispering quietly

184
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,479
but she was like, "Shhh." (laughter)

185
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,775
It's like a library!

186
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:06,530
- Well, howdy hey guys.

187
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,204
I probably look like a shaggy dog.

188
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:09,799
I am in desperate need of a haircut

189
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:12,854
and I'm actually taking
both Ollie and Finn

190
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:16,237
to my haircut place to get
a nice little haircut huh?

191
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:17,070
- Yeah.

192
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,903
- [Bryan] Yeah, what are you eating?

193
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:18,736
- Cheese.

194
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:19,569
- [Bryan] Cheese?

195
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:20,402
- [Finn] Yeah.

196
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:21,438
- [Bryan] `He's got cheese and apples

197
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:22,721
and turkey and peanut butter.

198
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,595
- Yum.

199
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,143
Can you take a bite of your turkey?

200
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:26,152
- No.

201
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,165
(laughing)

202
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,621
- We are whipping up some lunch.

203
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,168
I've got paninis on the panini press.

204
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,745
We're literally just microwaving soup.

205
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:36,427
I got this Panera Bread
soup from the grocery store,

206
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,592
actually Missy got it for me.

207
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:38,760
It's like chicken and wild rice.

208
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,766
It looks so good.

209
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,554
And then I made myself
a ham and swiss panini.

210
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:42,387
Food!

211
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:44,742
Isn't food amazing?

212
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:45,575
- Ah.
- Ah.

213
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:48,703
You know it's not polite to
talk with your mouth full.

214
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:51,167
Just picked up Ollie from school.

215
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,204
How was your day buddy?

216
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,037
- Good.

217
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:53,870
- [Bryan] And what is this?

218
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,135
- This is a present for Jesus.

219
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:57,181
- [Bryan] Really?

220
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:58,176
- Yeah.

221
00:06:58,176 --> 00:06:59,177
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

222
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,303
Did you decorate this?

223
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:01,175
- Yeah.

224
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:02,176
- Nice.

225
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:03,176
As for right now, I think we're

226
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:04,251
going to go get some haircuts right?

227
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,084
- Yeah.

228
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,051
- And I think Finn is
going to join us too.

229
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:06,884
- Yeah.

230
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,984
- Hopefully he does okay.

231
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:09,137
(laughs) I love you kiddo.

232
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,065
I missed you.

233
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:12,648
(upbeat music)

234
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:21,562
Look who just got here!

235
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,021
Finn is going to attempt a second haircut.

236
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:27,445
With Travis who is the best.

237
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:28,994
So we'll see what happens.

238
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:29,827
- Look.

239
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:30,923
Ollie just got his done.

240
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:32,171
- [Bryan] Ollie just got his hair cut.

241
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:33,299
- It looks so good.

242
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:34,302
- [Bryan] We got him in the chair!

243
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:36,334
Great success. (laughing)

244
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:37,505
You got this Finn.

245
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:39,011
He's like, "Oh no."

246
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:41,594
(upbeat music)

247
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:46,765
- What?
- I'm impressed.

248
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:50,355
- [Bryan] This is like night
and day from the last time.

249
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:51,387
He's doing so good.

250
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,000
Good job Finn!

251
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,669
- (laughs) He's so like,

252
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,974
not caring (mumbles) but thank you.

253
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,056
- He's doing so good.

254
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:00,518
- He is doing good.

255
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:03,101
(upbeat music)

256
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,832
I am so proud of Finn right now.

257
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:15,160
He's doing such a good
job getting his hair cut.

258
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,067
- Yeah, I'm so happy.
- This is awesome.

259
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,664
We have kids with gay
haircuts now. (laughs)

260
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,212
- At like the cutest
place and they love it.

261
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,796
Ollie loves it here.

262
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:24,051
I told him this morning

263
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:25,744
that he was getting a haircut
and he was like (gestures).

264
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:26,769
It was so hilarious.

265
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:27,644
(Bryan laughs)

266
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:28,568
- He loves Travis.

267
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:29,862
Travis does such a good job.

268
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:32,445
(upbeat music)

269
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,557
- He looks so cute!

270
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:41,075
- [Missy] Look at you!

271
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:41,908
Come here.

272
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,703
Ah!

273
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:44,757
Do you like it?

274
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,047
Yeah?

275
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,596
Say, "Thank you."

276
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,179
- Say, "Thank you."

277
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:53,203
- (laughs) Alright.

278
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:54,406
Good job.

279
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:56,538
So proud of you bud.

280
00:08:56,538 --> 00:09:00,451
- [Bryan] This is what
happens post haircut.

281
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,024
Kids just terrorize Travis. (laughs)

282
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:07,164
- It looks like I'm wearing
boots. (Bryan laughs)

283
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:10,623
- [Bryan] These are so in style. (laughs)

284
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,542
(Finn squeals)

285
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:15,125
(upbeat music)

286
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:18,814
Hey Maddy?
- Yeah?

287
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:20,599
- [Bryan] You have some
holes in your jeans.

288
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,988
- [Maddy] (laughing) I
get that all the time.

289
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:25,023
- We are with Maddy.

290
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,020
You guys remember Maddy?

291
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,853
- Hi!

292
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:27,686
- She sang on my EP.

293
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:29,005
Her mom cuts Missy's hair

294
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,256
so this is our salon.

295
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:31,545
It's good seeing you.

296
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:32,378
- You too.

297
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:33,211
- You're growing up so fast.

298
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,645
- I know! I'm 16.
- Look how big she's getting!

299
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,051
- [Bryan] She just turned 16

300
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,673
and we're going to go
see you in Annie right?

301
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:38,506
- Yeah!

302
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:40,158
- [Bryan] Next year we
get to see you in Annie.

303
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:41,615
- Yeah! So exciting

304
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,353
- [Bryan] Oh no.

305
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:44,644
Where is Ollie?

306
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:46,478
Where could he be you guys?

307
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:49,228
Oh, I see some freshly snipped...

308
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,023
hair right here.

309
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,487
(Ollie laughs)

310
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:55,104
Finn, I am seriously so proud of you dude.

311
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:57,610
You did such a good job at your haircut.

312
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,443
- Yeah.

313
00:09:58,443 --> 00:09:59,280
- [Bryan] Yeah.

314
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,203
So this is where we normally
go to the Star-lit Bazaar

315
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,286
but, check it out, the VAIL headquarters

316
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:05,500
is all decorated for Christmas.

317
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,082
Hey are you on stage?

318
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:08,170
- [Ollie] Yeah.

319
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,634
- [Bryan] Well if you're onstage
you gotta sing something.

320
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:10,951
Do you want to sing your Jingle Bells?

321
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:13,864
♪ Jingle bells jingle all the way ♪

322
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,234
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

323
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:19,401
♪ Oh what fun it is to ride
in a horse open sleigh ♪

324
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:21,594
- Hey!

325
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:24,114
♪ Jingle bells ♪

326
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:28,256
♪ Jingle bells jingle all the way ♪

327
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:31,011
- As you can tell, Ollie's
knowledge of the lyrics

328
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:35,065
is a little limited. (laughing)

329
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:38,148
- Hey Fred, I just ate all my dinner.

330
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,239
- [Bryan] Yes he did.

331
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:46,333
Of course Fred was up to no
good this morning wasn't he?

332
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,166
- Yeah.

333
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,534
- He colored on all of our
pictures this morning as you saw.

334
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,922
We just got done with dinner
and Ollie did so good.

335
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:53,132
Ate all his food.

336
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,341
I said, "You better tell Fred."

337
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,221
So he can tell Santa right?

338
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,054
- Yeah.

339
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:56,887
- [Bryan] Yeah.

340
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:59,055
- They're even over
here in these pictures.

341
00:10:59,055 --> 00:10:59,942
Look at this.

342
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:00,775
(Brian laughs)

343
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:01,608
Hey Ollie.

344
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:03,196
You wanna show mama what's in your bag?

345
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,029
- Yeah.

346
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,564
- Did you make this bag?

347
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,438
And you did that with?

348
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:07,730
Is that with your fingers?

349
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,604
- No.

350
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:11,365
No, I did it with a paint thing.

351
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,362
- Oh, like a paintbrush?

352
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:13,195
- Yeah.

353
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:14,413
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

354
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:15,581
- [Missy] Okay, show me what's inside.

355
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:16,675
I'm so excited.

356
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,508
(Bryan and Missy laughing)

357
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:20,128
- [Missy] So is this for
mommy or daddy or you?

358
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:21,332
- It's for Jesus.

359
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,201
- Oh it's for Jesus
- That's for Jesus.

360
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,165
It's for Jesus babe.

361
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:25,631
- [Missy] I think it might
have dropped out of your--

362
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:26,464
- [Bryan] Oh it fell.

363
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:27,633
Oh, here it is.

364
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:28,716
Look at that!

365
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,432
What is that Ollie?

366
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:33,017
- That is Rudolph.

367
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,017
- [Missy] Rudolph.

368
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:35,185
And is that your hands?

369
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:36,018
- Yeah.

370
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:36,851
- [Missy] Is that your hand?

371
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:37,820
Like turn it this way.

372
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,893
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, look at it.

373
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,393
- Oh! I love this.

374
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,406
I love that this is a little ornament.

375
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:44,862
You know this goes on our tree right?

376
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:45,737
- Yeah.

377
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:47,791
- And we're going to have this
forever and ever and ever.

378
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,207
When you're all grown up, we'll
be putting this on the tree.

379
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,476
- And we're going to remember
that you made it at preschool.

380
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,195
That's super cool dude.

381
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,488
- I love this.

382
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:56,736
I feel like we've been

383
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:58,158
wanting things like this though.

384
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,618
Things that we get to
have forever and ever.

385
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:02,626
Like, we have that at
my mom's house you know?

386
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:03,707
- Yeah.

387
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:06,457
("O Tannenbaum")

388
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:14,267
In case you guys are
wondering, no, we have not

389
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,309
caught anything in the
Christmas cage in a while.

390
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,736
If you guys missed the video
where we caught Buddy the Elf

391
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:22,322
and did a fun Christmas activity,
I'll have it linked above

392
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:24,489
in the iCards so you can check it out.

393
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:25,870
This is our Christmas
cage and it's actually

394
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,954
all lit up right now.

395
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,340
All these lights are on a timer.

396
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,974
So around this time all the
lights start lighting up

397
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,388
and it looks really cool.

398
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:32,555
I don't want to go inside of it

399
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:33,446
'cause it might actually trap me.

400
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:34,439
That's for sure.

401
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,539
But yeah, haven't caught
anything here in a while.

402
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,268
Maybe this week, in the
next couple days we'll

403
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:39,525
catch something cool.

404
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,857
But at least it looks Christmas-y.

405
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:42,312
Even when it's just
hanging there. (laughs)

406
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:43,685
I'm so excited you guys!

407
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:47,907
Our very first family Christmas
album is now available

408
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:50,984
swipe up to get it and
start listening so you can

409
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:54,643
start spreading that Christmas joy.

410
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,684
So on the album, I did a
cover of Mary Did You Know?

411
00:12:57,684 --> 00:13:01,996
and this is probably my
all-time favorite Christmas song

412
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:05,339
just because it embodies the
actual meaning of Christmas.

413
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,006
It was really emotional to sing.

414
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:15,565
♪ Mary did you know ♪

415
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:19,865
♪ Mary did you know ♪

416
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:23,158
♪ Mary did you know ♪

417
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:24,454
♪ Mary did you know ♪

418
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,835
- [Bryan] Advent calendar time!

419
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:27,094
What did you get Ollie?

420
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:27,927
- This.

421
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:29,800
- [Bryan] You got a Stormtrooper?

422
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,040
That is so cool.

423
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,867
Are you excited to see the
new Star Wars on Friday?

424
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:33,700
- Yep.

425
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,874
- The boys are opening
their Advent calendars

426
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:36,301
and, because Fred was so crazy today,

427
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,422
you're wearing him on your pjs now huh?

428
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:39,255
- [Ollie] Yeah.

429
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:40,088
- [Bryan] Who is that?

430
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:40,921
- Is that Fred?

431
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:41,754
- [Finn] Yeah.

432
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,712
- [Bryan] Oooh, what did you get?

433
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,341
You got a Minnie Mouse Christmas?

434
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:45,349
Ooh look at this.

435
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:48,020
It's like a Minnie Mouse Mrs. Clause.

436
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,484
That's cool.

437
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:50,698
Here you go buddy.

438
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:53,108
We also got a Sven Tsum Tsum.

439
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:53,983
That's cute.

440
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,863
But, of course, they didn't
just open up one thing

441
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,371
out of the Advent calendar,
they had to open up quite a few.

442
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,127
Because, well, Finn got to
them earlier this morning

443
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:02,937
so I had to hide them up high.

444
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:03,981
I don't know.

445
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,397
These kind of Advent calendars are hard

446
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:07,399
because the kids are literally
digging into them at times.

447
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,753
I'm sure we already have like
five future dates opened.

448
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:11,088
- They're like toys.

449
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:13,219
So it's like different for (mumbles)

450
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,966
and he just opened one.

451
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,557
He just opened one.
(Brian laughs)

452
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:17,887
- Tell me if that happens
with you guys with your

453
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:18,970
Advent calendars.

454
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,803
Do you guys just rip it open

455
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:21,083
like before the days even come up?

456
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,924
I feel like that's what happens.

457
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:25,388
But anyway, that is all for today's vlog.

458
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:27,352
If you guys enjoyed it be sure
to give it a big thumbs up

459
00:14:27,352 --> 00:14:30,394
and be sure that you go
get our Christmas album.

460
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:31,858
Link down below in the description.

461
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:33,449
- I love our music.

462
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:35,201
- [Bryan] It sounded good huh?

463
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:37,240
The boys listened to
it in the car all day.

464
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,646
- Oh my gosh yeah.

465
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,159
Finn has been loving it.

466
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,995
Every time he hear himself
sing or say something or laugh

467
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:44,947
or whatever: "Me!"

468
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:45,955
(Bryan laughs)

469
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:46,788
- It is so awesome.

470
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:48,238
So go check out our Christmas album.

471
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,485
Thanks for watching guys.

472
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:50,488
Thanks for supporting.

473
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:51,986
We will see you manana.

474
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:53,964
Ollie, you want to do Bye Boop?

475
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:54,995
Or do you want to do it Finn?

476
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:55,869
- Me.

477
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:56,702
- [Bryan] Okay.

478
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:57,535
Say, "Bye."

479
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,528
- Boo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

480
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:01,189
- [Bryan] Oh, we've got to do another one

481
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:02,571
with Mr. Ollie though.

482
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:03,695
You want to do Bye Boop?

483
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:04,528
- Yeah.
- Okay. Go.

484
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,361
- Bye-eee-eee-eee.

485
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:07,226
Boop.

486
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:08,227
- [Bryan] Oh.

487
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:09,351
What about mama though?

488
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:10,967
- Bye-eee-eee-eee.

489
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,380
Boop.

490
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,838
- Oh what about me though?

491
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:15,772
I should do, I never get to do Bye Boop.

492
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:16,790
Should I do Bye Boop?

493
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,623
'Kay.

494
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:18,584
Bye-eee-eee-eee.

495
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,417
Boop.

496
00:15:19,417 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat electronic music)
