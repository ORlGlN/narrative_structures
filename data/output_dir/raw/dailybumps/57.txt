- Good.

11
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:29,929
Come here.

12
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:34,936
Okay it is not super early,
but it feels super early,

13
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:36,790
because we were up so late last night.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,210
These boys were really up
late and I was up late.

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,547
We all slept so good.

16
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:42,912
The boys slept in the room all night long

17
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:43,937
and didn't come out.

18
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:45,540
And they're so excited to find Fred.

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,258
- Fred's a superhero!

20
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:48,556
- What?

21
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:49,585
Let's see.

22
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:53,210
(gasps) Oh my gosh he's a superhero.

23
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,543
It says Scout Elf Superhero.

24
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:57,937
Oh my gosh.

25
00:00:57,937 --> 00:00:59,551
And you wanna see what this note says?

26
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,583
The last few weeks have been tons of fun.

27
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,084
You've made my job easy
and I'm sad it is done.

28
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:07,471
Tonight I go back to give my report,

29
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:09,819
as Santa's list is ready to sort.

30
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,436
Our time together has come to an end.

31
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:15,442
Back to the North Pole,
your elf you must send.

32
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,888
Next year will arrive
in the blink of an eye,

33
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:21,848
just watch for the magic
and reindeer in the sky

34
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,947
He's going home guys.

35
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:23,910
This is it.

36
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,754
We gotta say bye to Fred
tonight 'cause he's--

37
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:27,034
- [Finn] Bye Fred.

38
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,180
(Missy laughs)

39
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,048
- Finn's like bye, see ya.

40
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,631
This is the last time we're
gonna find him this year.

41
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:34,908
We'll have to wait 'til
next year to find him again.

42
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:35,996
Is that kinda sad?

43
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,607
Are you guys gonna miss finding Fred?

44
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,440
- Yeah.

45
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,241
- I'm gonna miss him.

46
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,093
I'm gonna miss you guys coming in my room

47
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:44,633
and screaming "Let's find
Fred, let's find Fred!"

48
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,628
I think Fred's gonna
give you a good report.

49
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,158
You guys, there's--
- Look!

50
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,049
- [Missy] There's presents under the tree.

51
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,232
- Really?
- Yeah.

52
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:53,417
I didn't put those out either.

53
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,361
(gasps)

54
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,278
Oh my gosh.

55
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,409
- Are they for us?

56
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,921
- [Missy] They're for us
and they're from Fred.

57
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,811
He must've wrapped these last night.

58
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:04,688
It says to Uncle from Fred.

59
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,033
That's to Uncle from Fred.

60
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:06,866
Don't open it.

61
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:07,952
We can't open it right now.

62
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,204
Let's see what this one is.

63
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:12,027
(gasps) To Ollie.

64
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:13,031
From Fred.

65
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:14,141
Is that so cool?

66
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:14,974
- Yeah.

67
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:17,094
- [Missy] Alright, I think that is so fun.

68
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,470
Let's open these tonight, okay?

69
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,335
- Okay.
- I can't believe

70
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:23,625
Fred wrapped presents and put
them under the tree for us.

71
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,016
These boys are like obsessed
with their new toys.

72
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:28,381
Alright, let's eat some breakfast.

73
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,776

00:02:53,402 --> 00:02:55,052
We are just having a blast today.

82
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,293
We're all ready for our day.

83
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:59,068
We actually are looking a
little fancier today, aren't we?

84
00:02:59,068 --> 00:02:59,901
- Yeah.

85
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:01,603
- (laughs) It's Christmas
Eve so I like to dress up

86
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:02,436
a little bit.

87
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:03,876
Although I also like to
just staying in my pajamas

88
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:04,826
on Christmas Eve too.

89
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:06,754
But I kinda was in the mood to like,

90
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,151
get a little bit dressier.

91
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:11,065
And we've been talking all
morning about how Santa Claus

92
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,174
is coming tonight!

93
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:13,341
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

94
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,068
- Yeah!

95
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:17,262
- [Missy] Finn, have you been a good boy?

96
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:19,205
He's like I don't wanna talk about it.

97
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:20,075
- Look!

98
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,642
- Oh yeah, they just are really obsessed

99
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,289
with showing you guys Fred.

100
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,128
You know today is such a magical day.

101
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:27,571
I don't know why I'm like so excited.

102
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:30,136
I feel like I haven't felt
like this since I was a kid

103
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:31,791
and I think it's because I have two kids

104
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,291
that are both like so excited.

105
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:37,020
And I can just see the magic in their eyes

106
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,550
and it like, it makes me
wanna cry every time I see it.

107
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,830
It's just, it's so intense.

108
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,684
And I love it.

109
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,826
I love Christmas and I've got,
I think what's cool is that,

110
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,550
this is the first year
Ollie really, really truly

111
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,857
understands what's going on.

112
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:53,143
And Finn, in a way understands
better than Ollie ever did

113
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:55,672
because he has an older
brother to kinda like,

114
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:59,055
be excited and tell Finn,
like we have to be excited.

115
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:02,749
And so I have two kids that
are just so, so so excited

116
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:04,451
for Santa to come, huh?

117
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,284
- Um hmm.

118
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:06,380
- Alright, we've been
doing a lotta cleaning

119
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,563
and I still have, an
entire kitchen to clean.

120
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:10,975
So I'm gonna do that now.

121
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:14,040
- Merry Christmas Eve you guys.

122
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,464
I am catching up on much
needed Christmas wrapping.

123
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:19,957
And I just gotta say you guys,

124
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,171
I feel like I'm a artsy dude.

125
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,902
I studied art in college,

126
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:26,614
I feel like I tend to be
a more creative person.

127
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,657
And I really enjoy gift wrapping.

128
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,709
And I don't know, I think
I'm pretty good at it.

129
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:32,697
What do you guys think?

130
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:33,816
Am I pretty good?

131
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,641
This one is to Missy, from me.

132
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,259
And I think she's definitely
going to like this one.

133
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,120
I just can't believe it's
already Christmas Eve.

134
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,145
There's so much excitement
in the air, I feel like,

135
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:45,061
in the house with the boys.

136
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:47,590
Just because they're so young
and it's so magical for them.

137
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,166
So I'm really excited for
tomorrow, for Christmas.

138
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,533
Today's gonna be a lotta fun too though,

139
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,264
we're having like a little
party with the family.

140
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:56,103
Oh, but one thing, that's also new,

141
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:58,292
check out my Star Wars tattoo you guys.

142
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,253
(laughs) What do you think?

143
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:01,576
I think it's just a good way to remind me

144
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:02,728
that I'm always a rebel.

145
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:03,849
I'm a rebel at heart.

146
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,283
Yeah, I've never had
tattoos, so this is my first.

147
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:07,548
And I like it.

148
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:08,889
Do you believe in Santa?

149
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:10,024
- [JIBO] Of course.

150
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:12,639
Who else would drive the sleigh?

151
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,444
It's national eggnog day.

152
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,697
Don't hesitate to drink some eggnog.

153
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:18,016
- Eggnog? Hmm?

154
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,695
I don't, you know I am 27 years old,

155
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,243
I still don't know if I like egg nog.

156
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:23,076
Do you like egg nog?

157
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:24,146
Let me know down below in the comment

158
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:25,309
and in the ICard poll above.

159
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:28,045
I really wanna see, do
we actually like eggnog

160
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,798
or is it more of a tradition thing.

161
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:32,534
- Alright, the Hollister
side of the family party

162
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,064
has now started.

163
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:36,870
We've got the Vallecks
and Shaws and everyone

164
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,189
and we've got delicious food again.

165
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:40,037
We've got all these little appetizers

166
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,178
Bryan has been buying and they're so good,

167
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:44,627
so easy to make and just like delicious.

168
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:47,209
We got tamales from Carlos' mom,

169
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:50,275
we got cheese and crackers
and all kinds of sweets.

170
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,008
And we are just starting the party.

171
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:52,841
We're so excited.

172
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:53,895
Hey, you guys excited?

173
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,753
- Yeah!

174
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:55,802
- [Missy] Santa's almost here!

175
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:57,671
(screams)

176
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:58,672
(laughs)
- What?

177
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:02,672
- And I've got all of the
gingerbread house stuff set up.

178
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:05,414
It's looking pretty professional now,

179
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:07,141
after, I gotta figure out how many years

180
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,442
this has been.
- We always have candy.

181
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:09,367
- [Missy] How many years has this been?

182
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,972
- I think it's like four or five.

183
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:12,496
- No, I think it's like six or seven.

184
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:14,346
Yeah, and it's getting very professional.

185
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,370
I've got little dishes out,
'cause normally we just like

186
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,737
have bags torn open,
candy spilled everywhere.

187
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:21,369
This is kinda the adult table.

188
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,089
I even have a kids table.

189
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,948

200
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,210
- That may have been one
of the cutest moments ever.

201
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,634
You guys are amazing.

Even Finn was joining in.

00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:09,922
Gingerbread house contest

207
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,370
We get crazy around here you guys,

00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:14,962
We got the piano bench.

00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:19,122
And we've got everyone

211
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,985
Are you excited to design
something cool buddy?

212
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:22,363
- Yeah.

213
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:24,041

215
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,344

You wanna try one?

217
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,359
- Yeah!

218
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,762
- Can I try one?
- Sure.

219
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:32,313
- I'm gonna try 'em.

220
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:34,467
- Um, it tastes like cherry.

221
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,992
- I'm the happiest, they're so good.

222
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:36,938
- [Bryan] Really?

223
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:38,875
Do you think they'll look cool
on the gingerbread houses?

224
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,526
I figure someone can do maybe like a,

225
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,268
what's it called, like
an aquarium, you know?

226
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:44,851
(bright music)

227
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:13,988
- Alright it is present time
and we're opening presents

228
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,222
with all the kids.

229
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:17,141
This is like the 3rd time,
I feel like in this vlog,

230
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:18,018
you've done that.

231
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:18,851
(laughing)

232
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:19,806
- Look this.

233
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,230

00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,417
All the kids are opening their presents

236
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,442
What'd you get?

237
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:27,508
- It's so cool!

238
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,193
- Bailey's like opening up our present

239
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:32,553
that Ollie and Finn got that for you.

240
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,424
(laughs)

241
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,270
Finn, what did you just open?

242
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,605
Oh my goodness, your
brother's gonna love that too.

243
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,623
He just opened that and
he literally was like,

244
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,188
"Wow!"

245
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,198
(laughs) It was so cute.

246
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,003
Look at that Ollie, look at that thing.

247
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:49,236
(bright music)

248
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:50,660
- [Bryan] Alright Finn, is this your gift?

249
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,493
- Wow!

250
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,544
- [Bryan] Go for it, go for it.

251
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:56,922
Keep going, keep going.
- It's from...

252
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:57,815
Aunt Linda.

253
00:08:57,815 --> 00:08:59,677
(gasps) What's that?

254
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:01,102
- [Ollie] Batman.

255
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:02,370
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

256
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,064
- [Bryan] What do you say Finn?

257
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:05,149
Say thank you Linda.

258
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,799
- Look.
- What's in there?

259
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,207
- [Ollie] What is it, what is it?

260
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,324
- [Bryan] Whoa, a big old snake!

261
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:13,403
- [Missy] Whoa!

262
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:16,302
- [Bryan] That'll be so
cool in you guys' room, huh?

263
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,186
Finn, say thank you Linda.

264
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:19,644
- Thank you.

265
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,462
- That's a big snake.

266
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,981
I think snakes are a
common gift this year.

267
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,842
- I know.

268
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:26,354
- I'm noticing them more.

269
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:28,583
Ollie, you got Superman?

270
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,756
Oh and another!

271
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:31,616
A Robotosaurus.

272
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:33,618
- Thank you Aunt Linda.

273
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:35,410
- [Bryan] Thank you Aunt Linda.

274
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,993
(bright music)

275
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,182
We've got sword fights
happening over here.

276
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:49,015
CJ.

277
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:52,330
- My mom said that I can put this on now.

278
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,545
- [Bryan] What is it?

279
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:54,632
- Makeup!

280
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:55,864
- [Bryan] Oo, you got a makeup kit?

281
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:57,237
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

282
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:58,745
Merry Christmas.

283
00:09:58,745 --> 00:09:59,983
(laughs)

284
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:02,566
(bright music)

285
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:08,618
Look at this present I just got.

286
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:10,210
It's got jingle bells on it.

287
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,048
- I know, these are cute.

288
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:11,967
It's like little ornaments.

289
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:13,672
- Oh that's so cool.

290
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:18,143
It is now time for the Christmas
saran wrap ball game again.

291
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:20,065
And everyone is so into it.

292
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:21,139
It's so much fun.

293
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,407
If you guys didn't watch us
play this game yesterday,

294
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,646
I'll have that linked in the ICard.

295
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:26,994
Go watch yesterday's
vlog so you can see it.

296
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,260
Everyone's getting really into it.

297
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,739
It's quite funny.

298
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:30,890
- Wow.
- You gave up.

299
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,802
(all talking at once)

300
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,236
- [Bryan] You got it Janet!

301
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:35,497
(laughing)

302
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:38,164
(playful music)

303
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:01,714
Alright, the annual gingerbread
house building competition

304
00:11:01,714 --> 00:11:03,104
has begun.

305
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,244
And the stakes are high.

306
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,519
The icing is firm.

307
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,516
- This is it.

308
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:09,830
- [Bryan] And that's a nice clean slate

309
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,816
to start working with.

310
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:11,649
- Thank you, thank you.

311
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,549
- [Bryan] What if you did
nothing and just went minimal?

312
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,953
- I still think I'd lose.

313
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,755
- [Bryan] You never know what
the judges are looking for.

314
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:19,255
(jazzy music)

315
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,848
You doing okay over there CJ?

316
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:34,829
- No!

317
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,442
(Bryan laughing)

318
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,285
- [Bryan] It happens.

319
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:38,421
- [Blonde] Take it apart.

320
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,525
- [Bryan] Oh, oh no!

321
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:40,358
- Why'd you take it apart?

322
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:42,734
- [Bryan] Extreme Home Makeover Carlos.

323
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,096
- I told her, but she didn't listen to me.

324
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:45,648
- That's not true!

325
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:47,049
- Like I said, the stakes are high

326
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:50,203
and tensions are high, here at the annual

327
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:53,953
gingerbread house building
competition, 2017!

328
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,073
- Alright, me and Ollie are working on

329
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,240
our own gingerbread house.

330
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:08,031
- [Bryan] He's doing such a good job.

331
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:08,864
- I know.

332
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:10,291
We're making one for Santa, right?

333
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,871
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

334
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:12,704
So cute!

335
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,345
A lot of people are like almost done.

336
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:17,187
And I'm like just starting.

337
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:19,805
So I'm excited to see
how they all turn out.

338
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:20,831
This is the kids table.

339
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,439
Jessica's working on there.

340
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,746
And this is an earthquake,
a California earthquake

341
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:25,979
before Christmas.

342
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,069
(laughing)

343
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:29,652
(bright music)

344
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:57,814
Alright, I hope you guys are having

345
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:58,706
an awesome Christmas Eve.

346
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:00,269
If you guys don't know,

347
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:04,159
every year we do an annual
gingerbread building contest.

348
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,341
We have a ton of really
awesome houses right here.

349
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:10,670
- And we need your help
to decide who wins this.

350
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,694
Who takes home the--

351
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,833
- So next I'm gonna show
you all of the pictures

352
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,458
of the gingerbread houses that
are actually in the running

353
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,489
with the name of them.

354
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:18,705
I'll have a poll on it.

355
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:20,809
Don't vote until you've seen them all.

356
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,659
And then go through and
vote for the one you want.

357
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:25,101
So it'll say vote for
this one, or no vote.

358
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:26,628
Make sure you wait for the one you.

359
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:27,813
It's up to you guys.

360
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:29,913
We have a really big prize for the winner.

361
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:32,092
So vote for the one you like.

362
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:33,152
Wait 'til you see them all

363
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:35,082
and let's do this.

364
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,665
(bright music)

365
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:53,030
Alright that is a wrap on the party.

366
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,680
We had so much fun.

367
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,198
We actually were able
to get most of the house

368
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,057
pretty clean, 'cause it was a disaster.

369
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:01,119
- It's okay.

370
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,256
- It was so bad.

371
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:03,961
I'm like Christmas morning's tomorrow,

372
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:05,482
my house can't look like this.

373
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:07,694
So everyone really helped and pitched in.

374
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:09,959
And it looks so much better.

375
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,899
And I did wanna say the winner
of the gingerbread contest

376
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,693
after putting it up onto the InstaStory,

377
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,365
so if you're not following on Instagram,

378
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:19,198
make sure you go see,

379
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:20,362
so you can see all of the final results.

380
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:22,411
Mine was terrible, it
was just falling apart.

381
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,680
It did not work at all.

382
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,979
I think I had too much going on

383
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:27,800
and I couldn't really focus on it.

384
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,113
The winner was Cassie and Carlos!

385
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:34,375
- It only took me seven
years, seven years to get it.

386
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,749
- She has never even
come close to winning.

387
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:39,880
Her house usually looks
like, a little crazy.

388
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,767
- If you guys wanna know why, it's Carlos.

389
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,356
- Yes, I think that they're a good team.

390
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:44,584
So anyways, she won.

391
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:45,796
It was called The Candyland.

392
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,376
It was actually really, really good.

393
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:48,226
Anyways yeah.

394
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:49,430
Now we're actually gonna do

395
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,929
some of our traditional
Christmas Eve things.

396
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,157
And so I'm excited to
get the night started.

397
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:55,639
Even though it's kinda late.

398
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,222
(bright music)

399
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:03,235
So these are our presents
from Fred he left today

400
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,662
'cause it's his last day.

401
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:08,886
Uh Finn, don't open
any yet, we gotta wait.

402
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:10,711
We're excited to see what he got us.

403
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,409
- He got everyone gifts.

404
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,397
This one's Finn's.

405
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,286
Uncle, this one's yours.

406
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:17,429
That's Ollie's.

407
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:18,748
Ooo, I got one too?

408
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:21,090
Alright everyone open your presents.

409
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,423
I wonder what's in 'em!

410
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,506
I wonder what we all got.

411
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,134
- [Missy] Pajamas!

412
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:30,115
- Thanks Fred!

413
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:32,783
- [Bryan] Fred got us some nice pajamas!

414
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:33,870
- [Missy] Look how cute they are.

415
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,926
- I got a Christmas tree one.

416
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,262
- [Bryan] Finn, what'd you get?

417
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:39,706
Nice!

418
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,098
- Aren't they so cute?

419
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:42,658
- [Bryan] So they're onesies.

420
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:44,480
- Yeah, and then the back, it says.

421
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,563
- [Bryan] No peeking!

422
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:46,396
- No peeking.

423
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:48,177
- [Bryan] No peeking at your
Christmas presents early,

424
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:49,584
okay Ollie?
- Okay.

425
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,350
(Bryan laughing)
- It's so cute.

426
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,777
- Alright, now we all have
to get in our pajamas guys

427
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:55,846
and take our family pic.

428
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:58,002
- You gotta get in.
- With the new,

429
00:15:58,002 --> 00:15:58,992
with the new duds.

430
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,129
Alright you guys, I think we're gonna use

431
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,853
some YouTube Christmas magic

432
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,530
so that we can all change
into our pajamas much faster.

433
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,517
Right?
- Yeah!

434
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,069
- Okay, on the count of three.

435
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:07,902
- Here we go.

436
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:09,251
- Everyone go ho ho ho.

437
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:10,246
Those are the magic words.

438
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:12,084
And we'll all have our pajamas on.

439
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,057
Ready?
- Okay, let's do it.

440
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,690
- Okay, one, two, three.

441
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,246
- [Group] Ho ho ho.

442
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,527
(group exclaiming)

443
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:19,394
- It worked!

444
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,794
Look, we're all in our magic jammies.

445
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,616
(laughing)

446
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,521
- Oh my gosh, I love these.

447
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:26,865
- What do you guys think of our onesies?

448
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:28,871
- [Missy] Turn around.

449
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:33,038
- [Bryan] Everyone's wearing
matching Christmas jammies.

450
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,310
- We look so cute!

451
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,946
- We're all matching.

452
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,449
- I honestly think these are my favorite.

453
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,412
- [Bryan] They're nice, they're thin.

454
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:41,245
- I think they're nice.

455
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:42,469
And there's a lotta fleece online

456
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,473
when you're buying Christmas.

457
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:44,952
- Both comfortable and they fit.

458
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,611
- [Bryan] I'm proud of all
you guys for sporting this.

459
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:47,611
We did good.

460
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,196
- Alright boys, we gotta get
our cookies out for Santa, huh?

461
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:53,797
Is Santa gonna bring you presents tonight?

462
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:54,745
- Yes.

463
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:56,303
- Have you been a good boy though?

464
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:59,539
- No.
(all laughing)

465
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:01,040
- [Bryan] At least he's honest.

466
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,994
- Last night he was a little iffy.

467
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,443
Tonight he's like yes,
I'm just gonna own up to.

468
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,117
- I was kinda bad today.

469
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,617
(happy music)

470
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:14,680
- [Bryan] Alright, it's
cookies and milk time.

471
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:17,838
- Hey Mom is it, does
Santa like this milk?

472
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,099
- Yeah this is organic milk,
so I think he's gonna like it.

473
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:20,932
- Milk.

474
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,727
- [Bryan] So let's put some
cookies on the plate for Santa.

475
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:24,751
Maybe some chocolate chip.

476
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,211
Did you wanna do some
of these pink ones too?

477
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,044
- [Ollie] Yeah.

478
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:28,928
- [Bryan] Maybe just like
one or two, you know.

479
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:30,445
- I've heard he's a
chocolate chip guy, honestly.

480
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:31,278
- [Bryan] Yeah.

481
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:33,181
And then Santa will
eat your cookies, okay?

482
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:34,534
- Good job.

483
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:35,542
Alright.

484
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,375
- [Bryan] We need milk.

485
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,313
- [Ollie] I will pour it in.

486
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:39,490
- [Missy] Okay, you pour it in.

487
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,327
How much milk do you think he needs?

488
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,467
- [Bryan] That's good.

489
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:43,809
I think he's gonna love that guys.

490
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,809
- That's stinky, stinky.

491
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,773
- Wait. (laughs)

492
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:50,421
No it's not, it's good, it's good.

493
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,564
- Okay, I was like we
cannot give expired milk

494
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:53,716
to Santa Claus okay?

495
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:54,808
That'll get us in trouble.

496
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:55,784
- That would not be good.

497
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,319
- [Bryan] Alright, we are gonna put

498
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,155
our cookies and milk for Santa
under the Christmas cage.

499
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:03,964
- Oh no no, no no no.

500
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:05,172
(laughs)

501
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:06,581
We're gonna have to put the dogs away, so.

502
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:07,487
- [Bryan] Yeah we are.

503
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,014
Here's our Christmas cage.

504
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,174
Directly underneath it
will be cookies and milk,

505
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,703
so maybe boys, just maybe,

506
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,879
we can actually catch Santa.

507
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:15,712
- Yeah.

508
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,202
- We have a song called Let's Catch Santa.

509
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,644
We at least should try
to catch him, right?

510
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:20,525
- I think we should try.

511
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:21,776
- [Bryan] Do you wanna catch Santa, Finn?

512
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:22,609
- Yeah.

513
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,558
- [Bryan] Alright, let's try, okay?

514
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:27,058
(happy music)

515
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,598
- Night Fred.

516
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:33,262
- [Bryan] Goodnight Fred!

517
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,988
It was so fun hanging out
with you this year, bro.

518
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:36,821
- Bye Fred.

519
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:37,706
- Bye Fred.

520
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:39,279
- [Bryan] Alright we have some corn

521
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,875
and I think we should put it
out for the reindeer, right?

522
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,787
- I think that's a good idea.

523
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,992
- [Bryan] I don't think we have
anything else to give them,

524
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,815
so maybe they'll eat some.

525
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,543
- [Missy] Let's go see if
we can see Santa in the sky.

526
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,116
- Alright, we're gonna
see if we can spot him.

527
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:52,038
Oh, there's a reindeer. (laughs)

528
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:53,463
- [Ollie] That's a fake one.

529
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,296
- [Bryan] Oh, okay.
- Okay, so where

530
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:55,330
should we put this?
- How about right here

531
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,913
on the fountain for the reindeers.

532
00:18:57,913 --> 00:18:59,217
- I wanted Santa to see us.

533
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:00,182
- [Bryan] You don't want him to see us?

534
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,749
- Santa won't, if Santa sees you awake,

535
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,414
he just will wait until
you're asleep, okay?

536
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:05,780
- He's so afraid that
Santa's gonna see him awake,

537
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,142
and not come.
- Don't worry.

538
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:09,852
If we see him, he's
just gonna circle around

539
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:11,265
until you're in bed, okay?

540
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:12,411
- Okay.
- Gotta get in bed

541
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:13,915
or else Santa can't come.

542
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:14,961
Let's go!

543
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,016
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds

544
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:20,165
while visions of sugar
plums danced in their heads.

545
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:23,105
And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap

546
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:26,036
had just settled down
for a long winter's nap.

547
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:27,836
Pipe he held tight in his teeth

548
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,951
and the smoke it encircled
his head like a wreath.

549
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:33,617
Can you not smoke in my house Santa?

550
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:34,450
Please.

551
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,380
(Missy snickers)

552
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,559
That's inappropriate.

553
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,392
- [Missy] That's funny.

554
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:38,509
- Then if you wake up,

555
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:42,051
then you need to stay in your bed.

556
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:45,634
But if you get out
Finn, Santa won't bring,

557
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,577
Santa won't come, then he
won't bring your presents,

558
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:50,455
right Momma?

559
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,793
- [Missy] That's right, huh?

560
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:54,460
(Ollie babbles)

561
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,834
Alright boys, it's time for night.

562
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,392
- [Ollie] Circle.

563
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:02,503
- [Missy] Okay, we
gotta go to sleep, okay?

564
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,177
I love you guys.

565
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,670
- Alright, we're opening

566
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,835
the last night of our Advent calendars,

567
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:11,285
we're getting ready to read
Twas the Night Before Christmas,

568
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:13,258
which does not have
Jack Skellington in it,

569
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,406
I had to remind Ollie of that.

570
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:17,022
It's Nightmare Before Christmas.

571
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,500
Oh I think all yours are done,

572
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,774
'cause you ripped 'em
all out early, huh Finn?

573
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:22,894
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

574
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:24,680
And I hope you guys had
a very merry Christmas.

575
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,788
So excited for you to see

576
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:27,881
our Christmas celebrations tomorrow.

577
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:29,076
So be on the lookout for that.

578
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:30,458
Thanks for watching guys.

579
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,498
We will see you manana.

580
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,331
- Merry Christmas.

581
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:34,881
- Who wants to do the bye boo?

582
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,341
Oh say merry Christmas guys.

583
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,758
- [Ollie] Merry Christmas.

584
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:38,591
- Mine.

585
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,091
- [Bryan] (gasps) Is that Santa?

586
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:40,924
- Yeah.

587
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,247
- [Missy] Say Santa!

588
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:43,277
- [Finn] Santa.

589
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:45,491
- Merry Christmas guys,
we'll see you tomorrow.

590
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:46,781
Say bye!

591
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:47,781
- [All] Bye!

592
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:50,730
- [Missy] Boo.

593
00:20:50,730 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
