1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
- Morning.
- Morning.

2
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:05,103
♪ This is our life ♪

3
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:07,152
♪ Let's live it ♪

4
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:08,769
♪ Live it forever ♪

5
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,173
- How'd you sleep baby?

6
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:11,006
- Good.

7
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:11,839
- Good.

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:12,700
I'm so glad.

9
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,900
So, we have had a good morning.

10
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,793
At least this guy has.

11
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:16,610
Ollie on the other hand has had

12
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,760
kind of a bad morning.

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,820
I feel so bad for him.

14
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,270
He woke up with a fever.

15
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,410
And now his fever is gone
but he's just really like

16
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,950
tired and sluggish so

17
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,960
he crawled into my bed and
he's just asleep right now.

18
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,020
And I'm just so sad for him.

19
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,480
It's especially sad because
we actually have friends

20
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,180
coming into town and he is so excited.

21
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,610
But he's just sick right now

22
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,140
and I'm hoping it's not like something

23
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,000
too terrible.

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,910
I'm hoping it's just
like a quick little fever

25
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,150
virus type of thing.

26
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,670
He has no other symptoms

27
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,620
obviously other than a fever

28
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,410
and like just seems a little sluggish

29
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,000
and doesn't seem to feel
totally like himself.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,390
But no cough, no running nose,

31
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,670
no sniffles, yet.

32
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,470
I can kind of feel like

33
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,620
the sniffles are starting to come though.

34
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,210
He like, started doing a little sniff

35
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,980
earlier and I was like oh

36
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,349
please don't turn into like,

37
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,850
I mean a cold is not the worst

38
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,212
but I would hate if he had the flu.

39
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:08,650
Definitely, definitely a bummer.

40
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,640
He's still like,

41
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,990
but are our friends still coming?

42
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,830
I'm like, they're still coming.

43
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,190
So hopefully it doesn't
get too much worse.

44
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,180
But we are washing sheets right now.

45
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,130
We stripped his bed,
we're washing all of that.

46
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,810
And I'm going through all
his socks and underwear.

47
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,310
He is actually no longer in
the original size of underwear

48
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,470
from when we potty trained him,

49
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,750
he's now another size up.

50
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,583
So, I had to

51
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:30,570
throw away, well not throw away,

52
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,970
but I had to set aside all of his

53
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,170
first underwear that he ever had.

54
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,540
But Finn was so excited
'cause he got them.

55
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,350
Do you know where we put your undies?

56
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,400
- No.
- Where did we put them?

57
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,390
Show me.

58
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,020
He's not quite yet ready.

59
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,270
We practice like all the
potty training stuff but

60
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,050
haven't gotten to a good point yet.

61
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,680
But anyways,

62
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,390
put all their new

63
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,660
socks and undies up

64
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,650
and away.

65
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,280
And Finn is just being
kind of a crazy boy.

66
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,800
He's like where is my brother?

67
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,310
I have no one to play with.

68
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,810
How ya doing buddy?

69
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,910
Good?

70
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,124
How do you feel?

71
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,540
- Good.
- Good?

72
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,830
You just seem kind of tired.

73
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,690
Can I take your temperature?

74
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,959
Okay.

75
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,376
(soft music)

76
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,130
101.

77
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,250
Oh, you still got a fever baby.

78
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,080
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,030
I'll give you some more medicine, 'kay?

80
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,240
I guess he fell asleep.

81
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,420
He's not sick at all either.

82
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,180
I feel like I'm living
this weird life right now.

83
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,810
Ollie never acts like this

84
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,520
and he is just definitely,

85
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,530
definitely not feeling very good

86
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,010
and obviously he's got a fever.

87
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,180
Hoping it doesn't get any higher than that

88
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,471
and I'm hoping I can
control it with medicine.

89
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,370
I don't know I just feel so bad for him

90
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,500
and Finn's just taking a
nap in the playroom so,

91
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,333
pretty crazy.

92
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,540
So, my original plan was I
was planning on heading up

93
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,850
to the horse bright and early this morning

94
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,230
to go on a trail and stuff.

95
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,150
But Ollie had just woke up sick

96
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,340
so I haven't made it out there.

97
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,530
I might go out there in a little bit.

98
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,540
Maybe like when, Bryan's going
grocery shopping right now,

99
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,040
but I did just get a cool horse package.

100
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,360
And I honestly don't know what it is.

101
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,830
I ordered a pad

102
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,080
because I wanted to do a
different pad under his saddle.

103
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,400
But I also ordered a really, really, cool

104
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:30,040
bareback pad that I've
been waiting forever for

105
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,830
and it said that it was delayed.

106
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,260
So, I don't know, maybe this is it.

107
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,093
That would be so cool.

108
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:35,760
I don't feel like it is though.

109
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,980
It feels too light

110
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,210
but we'll find out.

111
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,820
Alright, let's see.

112
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,690
Oh, it's a

113
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:44,843
pad.

114
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:46,260
Oh my gosh, it's yellow.

115
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,830
I did not want yellow.

116
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,500
Shoot.

117
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,210
It's a new pad

118
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,060
but it was supposed to be sandy color.

119
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,720
That looks bright yellow to me

120
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,420
like the sun.

121
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,253
Well, shoot.

122
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,670
I've been really trying
to find the right pad

123
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,630
that would fit, or that would like,

124
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,550
look like a good color on him.

125
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,383
I don't know.

126
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:09,620
I might be kind of being silly.

127
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,380
I really like, like a deep red on him

128
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,740
but I haven't really found the right pad

129
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,590
that's deep red.

130
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,350
And so I was like, oh I bet tan,

131
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,540
like a creamy tan, or sandy color,

132
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,470
would look cool.

133
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,570
Look at this color.

134
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,890
This is like

135
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,800
bright yellow.

136
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,290
It's like mustard yellow.

137
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm gonna have to look at my order

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,860
'cause I am pretty
confident I did not order

139
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,130
mustard yellow.

140
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,480
Well, I am super bummed that
the wrong color pad came in.

141
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,100
I did go ahead and just
print a return label

142
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,070
so I could get the right one.

143
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,660
But look what my dad made me you guys.

144
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,670
I have been searching all
over the internet looking for

145
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,410
something cute to kind of put my,

146
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,080
all my tax stuff for the horse and like,

147
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,970
just like a nice little
like carrier for him.

148
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,110
I found a really cool one

149
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,470
but it was really, really expensive

150
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,530
and I was like I wonder
if my dad can make this.

151
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,300
And so he just showed me the first pieces

152
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,180
that are gonna go into the chest

153
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,140
that he's making and check it out.

154
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,307
Like, it's amazing.

155
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:03,400
Look at this.

156
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,440
So this is my little

157
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,700
what'd you call this?

158
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,590
- I don't know, it's just--

159
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,320
- It's like, so it's something I can carry

160
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
so I can put all my
brushes in and all that

161
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,700
and I can carry it around with me.

162
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,330
And then this one will
sit inside the chest

163
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,520
and it can actually slide
back and forth in there.

164
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,360
And it's so cute, I love it.

165
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,340
I can't believe my dad made this.

166
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,530
I can put everything in it.

167
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,510
I can pick it up and take it out.

168
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,343
And it's so cute.

169
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:32,294
He literally carved that
little handle for me.

170
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,740
He did this and it looks so pretty

171
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,360
and I'm so excited about it.

172
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,150
It's so fun when you
have something special

173
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,330
that your dad actually made you,

174
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,510
instead of just buying it.

175
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,140
- Alright our surprise birthday guest.

176
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,439
Ollie who's here?

177
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,646
- Carl and Jinger!

178
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:46,146
- Carl and Jinger!

179
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,432
And all the boys!

180
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,459
Thanks for coming guys!

181
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,620
- We're so excited,

182
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,453
it's gonna be so fun.

183
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,560
- Whoop, whoop.

184
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,410
Birthday weekend.

185
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,380
My birthday weekend

186
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,470
has officially begun.

187
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,080
And Carl and I are actually

188
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,000
gonna get ready and we
are gonna hit the town.

189
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,940
We have a little private show tonight

190
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,071
that we're going to in Hollywood.

191
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,087
- I'm gonna wear my Yeezy's.

192
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,450
- [Bryan] What, you got Yeezy's?

193
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,283
Let me see.

194
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:10,116
- Look at these.

195
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:11,410
- [Bryan] Oh, oh dude!

196
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,860
Yes, those ones.

197
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,420
Those are so sick.

198
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,180
- I gotta bust them out
for the concert, right?

199
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,013
- [Bryan] Dude, totally.

200
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:18,720
Totally.
- So awesome.

201
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,550
- So be sure you're
following us on Instagram

202
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,310
'cause I'm gonna be Instagram
storying a ton tonight.

203
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,360
Really fun private show

204
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,193
and we're so stoked

205
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:26,950
that Carl and Jinger are here

206
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,375
to hang for my birthday.

207
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,450
- Come to my room.

208
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,960
- Yeah, oh you gotta show him your room.

209
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,670
So what's really cool about
having the boys here this time

210
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,580
is that we have plenty
of room in their bedroom

211
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,130
for them to sleep and hang out.

212
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,120
What do you think, is it cool?

213
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,200
- That is so cool.

214
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,070
- [Bryan] Are you guys
gonna have fun in here?

215
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,608
- Look at that!

216
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,380
- [Bryan] What, what's up there?

217
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,743
- And we'll put an extra bed in here guys.

218
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:53,576
So you can--

219
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:55,350
- That's really cool.
- Plenty room to sleep.

220
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,200
- [Bryan] Yeah.

221
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,850
So we got a bed down here,

222
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,750
we got a bed up here,

223
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,760
we've got sleeping bags,

224
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,900
we've got a tent.

225
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,308
Who wants to sleep in the tent?

226
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:03,141
- I do.
- Me.

227
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:05,870
- [Bryan] Okay, one of you
guys can sleep in the tent.

228
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,750
You gotta give Luna hugs.

229
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,070
That's what happens.

230
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,193
- Alright guys,

231
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:12,480
so Carl and Jinger are in town.

232
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,400
And if you don't know,

233
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,070
Jinger is

234
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,740
horse lady.

235
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,930
She knows everything about horses.

236
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,940
So I've been dying

237
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,520
to get her out here to
hang out with Nacho.

238
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,025
Plus, she's Western which I'm

239
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,010
kind of around a lot of English riders

240
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,969
and so I'm really

241
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,660
just looking forward to
her kind of helping me

242
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,860
bridle him,

243
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,790
and just saddle him, and ride him.

244
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,870
'Cause then she can tell me

245
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,320
all the things we need to work on

246
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,110
and I'm just really
excited for her to be here.

247
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,320
So yeah, we're just getting his bridle on.

248
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,153
- By the way,

249
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:41,086
I have a crush on Nacho.

250
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,190
I love him so much.

251
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,960
- I know.
- He's such a sweet horse.

252
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,234
- He's so sweet.
- I just feel like

253
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,710
he just wants to be nice.

254
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,610
You know what I mean?
- Yup, yup.

255
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,670
Well, we're trying out this new bit.

256
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,830
It's a little bit different.

257
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,490
We're not sure how he's gonna

258
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,470
do with it but

259
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,545
I guess we'll find out.

260
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:58,545
- We'll ride him and see.

261
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,399
We're at the rodeo.

262
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,000
(laughs)

263
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,010
- [Missy] Don't buck us off.

264
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,407
He would never buck.

265
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:04,240
- No way.

266
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,648
- [Missy] You would never do that.

267
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:06,550
- There's not many horses

268
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,383
that have actually bucked me off.

269
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,216
So, if he bucks me off

270
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,840
that would be very alarming.

271
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,810
- I would be pretty alarmed too.

272
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,520
Yeah, I've only been bucked off once

273
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,700
and it didn't,

274
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,820
definitely got me a little nervous but.

275
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,340
- Nah, if you look at him, he's so chill.

276
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,076
- [Missy] I know, he's just like, okay.

277
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:25,516
(laughs)

278
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:26,880
- Kay see ya, sit.

279
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,820
- [Missy] Yeah.

280
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,789
He rolls over, you know.

281
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:31,347
- Roll over.

282
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:32,900
- [Missy] Alright, Jinger's giving him

283
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,320
a little try right now.

284
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,159
And I think she definitely
sees some things that

285
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,439
need to be worked on with him

286
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,610
but he's just mainly getting
used to the Western style

287
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,680
versus English style.

288
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,074
Alright Jinger, what do you think?

289
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:47,070
- I fricking love him.

290
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,060
I think he's a great horse.

291
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,380
I just think that he's really
like pressing all the buttons.

292
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,510
That's what I think.

293
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,490
I think he's still getting used to you.

294
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,800
- [Missy] The Western.

295
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,230
- He doesn't like this bit.

296
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,979
- [Missy] Yeah, he doesn't like any bit.

297
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:01,812
I haven't found it yet.

298
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,250
- But I think you made
a really good choice.

299
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,080
Personally, for your first horse,

300
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
like he's really good.

301
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,380
I think he's gonna end up
being a really good horse.

302
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,300
- Oh yeah.
- You just have to get

303
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,480
used to each other and stuff.
- Yeah.

304
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,313
- Totally.

305
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:11,920
- [Missy] He's just like, kind of,

306
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,321
doesn't understand the
whole Western stuff.

307
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,504
- Yeah, it's a little different,

308
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:17,080
like the way you hold your reigns,

309
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,180
the way the saddle feels.

310
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,143
- Yeah.
- The way you ride him.

311
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,120
- The way you ride, yeah.

312
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,830
I legit think he's like

313
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,080
why aren't you standing up?

314
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,420
Like, why do I have to
have all that weight.

315
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,507
- Take some of the weight, will ya?

316
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:28,938
- [Missy] I think that's
what he's thinking.

317
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,170
(laughs)

318
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,580
Like I don't wanna work that hard.

319
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,490
Plus, he's super out of shape so.

320
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,220
- Yeah, but I think he's gonna be fine.

321
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,230
- Yeah.
- Once you get the right

322
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,040
equipment, a little bit like,

323
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,443
you'll get used to him,

324
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:40,276
you guys are gonna be fine.

325
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:41,109
- Yeah.

326
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,070
He's a good horse.

327
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,920
Alright, go ride a little bit more

328
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,100
and then I'll get on you.

329
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,840
It's getting so cloudy

330
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,690
and so cold.

331
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,523
It's freezing out here.

332
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,010
I'm wearing like a really light sweater

333
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,690
and like, I'm so cold.

334
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,740
I think it's supposed to rain tonight so,

335
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:56,527
fun.

336
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:58,020
There she goes.

337
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,530
- [Jinger] We just have to appreciate

338
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,106
how pretty Missy looks though.

339
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:01,939
(laughs)

340
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:03,220
- Alright, I'm up.

341
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,260
- [Jinger] 'Kay, let's
show us all your skills.

342
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,190
Well, you get 10 points for looking cute.

343
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,232
That's all I have to say.

344
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:12,319
- Thanks.

345
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,986
(country music)

346
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,733
(laughs)

347
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,430
- [Missy] Ollie what is happening?

348
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,001
Are you having a sleepover?

349
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:06,834
- Yeah.

350
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:07,770
- Yeah, check it out guys.

351
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,810
We've got

352
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,380
a big 'ol bed here, a bed here,

353
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,656
someone in here.
- Hi.

354
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:14,040
(laughs)

355
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,350
Tonight, five boys will all
be sleeping in this room.

356
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,830
- Good thing it's a giant room.

357
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,480
- Yeah.
- With so many beds.

358
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,850
- Yeah, yeah there's plenty of room.

359
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,310
Each kid gets their own bed really.

360
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,110
I mean I think Gage is gonna sleep there.

361
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,250
Luke will sleep there.

362
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,470
Kyle's gonna sleep there.

363
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,400
Ollie and Finn are gonna share.

364
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,862
How are you feeling Ollie?

365
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:32,695
- Good.

366
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:34,050
- Good, you feeling a
little better right now?

367
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,410
- Yeah.
- Good.

368
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,460
But yeah, we had so much fun

369
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,760
up at the horse today.

370
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,436
Just so, so cool

371
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:43,340
to be able to hang out with someone

372
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,080
who knows horses so well

373
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,913
and--

374
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,270
- And he's a good horse.

375
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,530
- Yeah.
- So that made

376
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,540
a huge plus.

377
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,160
- Yeah.
- Because he's actually,

378
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,732
I think he's gonna turn
out to be perfect for you.

379
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:53,586
- Yeah, I'm excited.

380
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:55,340
I think he's gonna be in
the family for a long time.

381
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,810
Even if I end up getting

382
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,150
another one later on.

383
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,840
But anyways, it's gonna be
an awesome weekend, I know.

384
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,270
The husbands, dads, are gone tonight

385
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,570
'cause they're out at
a fun little concert.

386
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,820
But tomorrow it's Bryan's birthday

387
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,140
so make sure you leave us a comment.

388
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,071
Happy Birthday, Bryan!

389
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:13,580
- Happy Birthday Bryan!

390
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,710

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,140
