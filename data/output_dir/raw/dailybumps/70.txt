1
00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:02,417
- So, Ollie and Finn apparently

2
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:05,187
have not been able to
find Fred this morning.

00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:06,020

5
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:08,951
Ollie, Finn, did you guys hear that?

6
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:10,966
I just heard a twinkle
like magic somewhere.

7
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,363
Do you want to try and find Fred again?

(record screeches)

21
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:45,580
(solemn music)

22
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,566
- Good morning.

23
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:52,967
- [Kids] Good morning.

24
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:53,915
- We're starting the--

25
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:54,864
- [Finn] Momma.

26
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:57,018
- The vlog in front of our Christmas tree.

27
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:58,576
You guys love decorating this thing, huh?

28
00:00:58,576 --> 00:00:59,409
- Yeah.

29
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:00,342
- Yeah, it's so cute.
- Momma (mumbling).

30
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,175
(dings)

31
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:02,972
- I like to pull the ornaments off.

32
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:04,137
- Yeah, you like to take them off

33
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:05,869
and does Finn put 'em back on?

34
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:07,051
(laughs)

35
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,941
Good morning, guys.

36
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:11,353
We woke up this morning and we found Fred.

37
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:12,186
- [Finn] Momma.

38
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:14,573
- But we're pretty sure Finn
might have touched him, huh?

39
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:17,742
- Yeah, I think Finn just touched him.

40
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:20,693
Then, I think Fred just falled.

41
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:21,526
- [Finn] Momma.

42
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:22,359
- Yeah.

43
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,192
(mumbling)

44
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:24,830
- 'Cause he was on the
ground this morning.

45
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,371
So we hurried up and we sprinkled him

46
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:28,064
with a little bit of cinnamon, right,

47
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,892
next to him 'cause there's
a couple different ways

48
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:31,348
that you can do to help them

49
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:33,342
from basically losing their magic.

50
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,643
- And Fred just leave.

51
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:36,243
- And then he basically just disappeared.

52
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:37,854
We're hoping that he
was able to make it back

53
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:40,846
to the North Pole so that
he could see a doctor.

54
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:43,721
Then, hopefully we get to see
him a little bit later today

55
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,061
and he can let us know that he's okay.

56
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,149
We're kind of just waiting
around waiting for Fred

57
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,446
and hopefully he shows
up soon and he's okay.

58
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,479
(mumbling)

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,724
- Yeah, although, you know,

60
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:56,944
I told Ollie I don't
think it matters too much.

61
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,401
Finn doesn't know really

62
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,584
that he's not supposed to touch him.

63
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,688
I don't think he necessarily
even did it on purpose.

64
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,925
So I don't think that actually
takes away their magic

65
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,892
if it's someone who doesn't
know or if it's a little kid

66
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:09,600
who doesn't realize they can't touch him.

67
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,021
Just to be safe, we
went ahead and gave him

68
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:12,812
a little cinnamon so that
he could be all better.

69
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:13,645
- Hey, guys.

70
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:16,478
(Christmas music)

71
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:32,980
- You guys, I just went to
collect eggs from my chickens

72
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,669
and look what I got.

73
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,810
A teeny, tiny little egg.

74
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,509
That means one of the babies
are starting to lay eggs.

75
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,709
I think this is Moana
because she's super tiny.

76
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,356
I'm hoping these eggs get a little bigger

77
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:46,883
'cause this is like half
the size of a normal egg,

78
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,474
but I'm so excited.

79
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:52,641
I think I have only two of
the two hens that can lay

80
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,679
'cause I had six and then a bunch

81
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,714
of them ended up being roosters.

82
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,657
So, I forget what I had, but yeah,

83
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,033
I think I'm only gonna get

84
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,209
maybe two more eggs a
day than I already do.

85
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,521
That would be nice
though, but it is so tiny.

86
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,354
Look at that.

87
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,187
It's just little baby.

88
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,273
It's fun when you know for sure

89
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,341
that you're getting a new
egg and a new egg layer.

90
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:13,485
So exciting.

91
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,735
Ollie, what have you been doing?

92
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,140
- I was just playing.

93
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,973
- Playing?

94
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:19,128
You having a good day?

95
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:21,429
I feel like we still haven't found Fred.

96
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:22,879
Have you seen Fred anywhere?

97
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,712
- No.

98
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:24,545
- [Missy] No?

99
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:25,632
I know.

100
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:28,147
Have you been kind of
worried about him still?

101
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:28,980
- Yeah.

102
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,813
- Yeah.

103
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:30,646
We haven't seen Fred yet

104
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:32,542
and I know Ollie's been
kind of nervous about it,

105
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,644
so we're hoping we get
to see him soon, huh?

106
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:35,477
- Yeah.

107
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:37,088
- Hopefully, he shows up.

108
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,715
Say, "Fred, come back."

109
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:39,860
Fred, come back.

110
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,901
(hooting)

111
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,309
Maybe he needs you to sing
him a Christmas carol.

112
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:44,341
Do you want to sing him a Christmas song?

113
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,439
Maybe he'll come back.

114
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,272
- Yeah.

115
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:47,332
- [Missy] Okay, what do you want to sing?

116
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,805
- Dashing through the snow.

117
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:50,681
- [Missy] Okay, ready?

118
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,086

(laughs)

132
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,606
By the way, Christmas album is coming out

133
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:21,254
really, really soon so
you can hear Ollie sing

134
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:22,931
all over the album, huh?

135
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,133
- Yellow, guys.

136
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:26,322
So, Ollie and Finn apparently

137
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:29,095
have not been able to
find Fred this morning.

138
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:29,928
(dings)

139
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:30,761
(gasps)

140
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,305
Ollie, Finn, did you guys hear that?

141
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,319
- What?
- Yeah.

142
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,480
- [Bryan] What's up, guys?

143
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,209
Hey, Ollie, guess what I just heard?

144
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:39,042
- What?

145
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,547
- [Bryan] I just heard a
twinkle like magic somewhere.

146
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,061
Do you want to try and find Fred again?

147
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:42,894
- [Ollie] Yeah.

148
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:43,727
- [Bryan] Have you found him yet, babe?

149
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:44,560
- Nah uh, I haven't seen him anywhere.

150
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,704
- [Bryan] I haven't seen him.

151
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:47,169
Where do you think he could be?

152
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,278
- [Missy] Hmm.

153
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,258
- [Bryan] There he is.

154
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:51,238
Do you see him?

155
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:52,071
- Yeah.

156
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:52,904
- Oh my gosh.

157
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:53,737
What's up?

158
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:54,657
- He has a band aid on him.

159
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,967
- [Bryan] He's got band aids.

160
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:56,859
- [Missy] Oh no!

161
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:57,864
- [Bryan] Oh, Fred.

162
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,222
- [Missy] You want me to
read the letter to you?

163
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:00,277
- [Bryan] Oh, he's got a letter.

164
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:01,110
- He left a note.

165
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,809
It says: I was having
so much fun last night,

166
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:06,655
but when it finally came time

167
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:10,155
for me to find a spot to sit, I fell.

168
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:11,362
(gasps)

169
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:12,195
He fell.

170
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,028
- [Bryan] Oh no.

171
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,663
- So Finn didn't touch him.

172
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:15,783
He just fell.

173
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,477
He says, "Thank you so much

174
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:19,781
"for helping me to the North Pole.

175
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:22,345
"I feel so much better now.

176
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:23,278
"Fred."

177
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:24,623
- [Bryan] I think Santa Claus

178
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,824
put a lot of band aids
all over him though.

179
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:27,657
(laughs)

180
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:28,567
He looks so funny.

181
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,400
(laughs)

182
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,233
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

183
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,683
Well, at least he's better, huh?

184
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:32,516
- Yeah.
- Look, he...

185
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:33,835
- [Bryan] And he's not
afraid of band aids.

186
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,597
- Finn, did you touch him?

187
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:36,430
- No.

188
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,474
- He kept saying, "No."

189
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:39,303
Like I feel like you touched him though.

190
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:40,528
(laughing)

191
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:41,944
- [Bryan] So Fred's okay.

192
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:42,909
Alright, dude?

193
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,752
- Yeah.

194
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:45,770
- [Bryan] I thought I heard
that little twinkle in here.

195
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,603
- Yeah, okay, huh.

196
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:47,492
- [Bryan] He's just
hanging out in here now.

197
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:48,325
- [Finn] What?

198
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:49,992
- Feel better, Fred.

199
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,178
(dinging)

200
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:53,011
(laughs)

201
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:53,844
(whines)

202
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,353
- [Bryan] Alright, Finn
wants to ring the bell.

203
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:56,186
Oh.

204
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:57,019
(dings)

205
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:57,852
Was that the bell?

206
00:05:57,852 --> 00:05:58,685
(cheers)

207
00:05:58,685 --> 00:05:59,518
That must have been the
bell I heard, Ollie.

208
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:00,351
- Yeah.

209
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,184
- [Missy] Oh, yeah.

210
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:02,225
- [Bryan] So Fred must
have climbed up here

211
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,150
and rang the bell so we could find him.

212
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,233
- [Missy] So he was like, "Over here."

213
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,066
(dinging)

214
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:05,899
- [Bryan] Hey.

215
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:06,732
(laughs)

216
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:07,565
- [Missy] Come get me.

217
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:08,398
- [Bryan] I'm a little late.

218
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:09,231
(laughing)

219
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,064
(dinging)

220
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:11,180
- [Missy] That's okay, Fred.

221
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,597
(soft music)

222
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,425
- So I just wanted to
give you guys a little bit

223
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:21,278
of update about our little
family Christmas album.

224
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,281
You guys saw us finish up recording

225
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,315
I think like last week or the week before.

226
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:28,092
Everything has been sent to iTunes

227
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:31,033
and I'm really hoping that
it goes live really soon.

228
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,220
I think it's going up on iTunes

229
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,045
and Spotify and Amazon and stuff,

230
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,536
but it's kind of just
like in their hands now.

231
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:40,428
Normally, it takes like one
or two days to process that

232
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:44,157
and then it goes live, so
hoping midweek it goes up

233
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:46,660
so that I can at least have it
to you guys by this weekend.

234
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,389
I've been listening to it kind
of like from start to finish

235
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,528
multiple times and it just
makes me feel so happy

236
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:53,003
'cause I love my family.

237
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:55,509
I just love that they got
to like be a part of it

238
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:56,747
and it's like our thing.

239
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:58,716
I think it's gonna be
something that we cherish.

240
00:06:58,716 --> 00:06:59,936
I also wanted to show you guys

241
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,251
something really, really cute.

242
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:04,187
I just got an email from this girl.

243
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:05,518
Well, actually her mother.

244
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:07,616
This is Colette, age seven,

245
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:10,205
from Minnesota, sent us this photo.

246
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:12,664
She's actually holding our coloring book.

247
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:13,634
It says, "Hi, guys.

248
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,890
"Someone has been so excited
to get her coloring book.

249
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,723
"I couldn't make her
wait until Christmas."

250
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:20,416
I think that is so awesome.

251
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,496
Thanks, Jacob, for sending
me this photo of Colette.

252
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:25,201
She's so cute and I love
that she was just so excited

253
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:26,711
to color in our coloring book.

254
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:28,354
If you don't know, we have
these on our merch store

255
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:31,043
at www.dailybumpsmerch.com

256
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:33,646
I'm really excited to see
all your guys' coloring pages

257
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,634
after you actually color what we have.

258
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:38,015
It's cool 'cause when you
create a coloring book,

259
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:40,369
you're kind of creating half a book

260
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:43,661
and you guys are the
other half of the book.

261
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:45,260
It's kind of like finish it yourself.

262
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,093
You're like, "Wait a minute.

263
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,174
"I paid for this.

264
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,058
"I gotta work?

265
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:48,891
"I gotta work?"

266
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,724
(laughs)

267
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:50,757
A little bit, yeah.

268
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:52,217
If you guys wanted to get one of those,

269
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:53,813
I'll have our merch store link down below.

270
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:55,677
Thank you so much for watching, Colette.

271
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:56,510
Loved your photo.

272
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,756
Merry Christmas.

273
00:07:57,756 --> 00:08:00,030
- Alright, guys, today
has been the longest day.

274
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,431
(whining)

275
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:03,990
Finn's saying, "Morning."

276
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,823
(coughing)

277
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,622
We've been working so hard all day

278
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:09,718
and I had this plan to go out at one,

279
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:11,799
middle of the day before
anyone gets off work,

280
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,079
to go grocery shopping

281
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,841
'cause we are just like missing the milks

282
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:19,288
and all the regular foods
that you always run out of.

283
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:20,303
I was like, "I really need to go."

284
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:21,136
(muttering)

285
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:22,688
- 'Cause you know what,
when you don't have food

286
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:24,295
in the house, you just get hangry

287
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,085
and being hangry makes it
even harder to get work done.

288
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:29,752
Anyways, I had this plan
and now, look at it.

289
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:31,119
It's dark out.

290
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,644
(groans)

291
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:34,118
It's not like super late.

292
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:37,299
It's five o'clock, but
that's still just like uh,

293
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,233
right now I should be making dinner,

294
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:40,731
getting the kids ready for bed,

295
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:44,143
and instead, I'm going to
leave to go grocery shopping.

296
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:46,896
But you guys are excited to go
grocery shopping with Momma?

297
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:47,729
- Yeah.

298
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:48,963
- You guys gonna be good for Momma?

299
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:51,952
I don't know if she can
take anything else today.

300
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:54,076
I'm so tired and hungry.

301
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,502
Ollie, what are you doing?

302
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,007
- I'm sitting on a red little ball-y.

303
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:58,840
(shouting)

304
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,910
- [Missy] Are you talking
about Target balling?

305
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,743
- Yeah.

306
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:02,576
(gasps)

307
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,207
- [Missy] Do you want to do it too?

308
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,040
- [Finn] Yeah.

309
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,498
- Watch me jump on it.

310
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:08,183
- [Missy] Okay, go.

311
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:09,837
(laughs)

312
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:10,670
- [Ollie] Watch.

313
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,579
- [Missy] Are you Target balling too?

314
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:12,412
- Yeah.

315
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,245
- Yeah.

316
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:14,336
Ollie, who used to do this?

317
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,790
Throwback to if you guys
remember Target balling

318
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,971
and when it used to be a thing.

319
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,644
Shout out to Cullen and Katie.

320
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:22,734
We love them and we miss them a lot.

321
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:23,617
He used to do Target ball.

322
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:24,846
You guys will have to look it up.

323
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:25,679
(shouts)

324
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,512
Alright, let's go shopping.

325
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:28,237
We need a cart so I can
contain all these kids.

326
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:29,070
- There.

327
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,289
- [Missy] Alright,
we've got our Starbucks.

328
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:34,145
I got a hot chocolate and
the boys got, whoop, water.

329
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:34,978
- I got water.

330
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:35,811
- I got it.

331
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:36,775
- That's Momma's, huh?

332
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:37,806
You got your water?

333
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:38,639
Is it good?

334
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,472
- Yeah.

335
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:40,305
- Yeah.

336
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:42,478
I'm a little bummed because
they only had the biggest cart

337
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:44,980
available instead of the one
that has like the two seaters.

338
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,330
(shouting)

339
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,013
It's so hard because I
have to contain the kids

340
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,278
and there's no room for the groceries.

341
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:52,791
So, Ollie's gonna get switched to

342
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,535
and he'll end up having
to walk which will be fun.

343
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:59,035
(light music)

344
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,074
Alright, we're almost done,

345
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,257
but Ollie is so squished right now, huh?

346
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:20,164
- Yeah.

347
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:21,250
(laughs)

348
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,118
- [Missy] And Finn is being crazy.

349
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,602
Am I gonna have to get you out of there?

350
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,697
He's like, "Mom, I can't fit."

351
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:29,512
Okay, there we go.

352
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:30,345
(grunts)

353
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:31,178
Okay.

354
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,011
- [Finn] Momma.

355
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,285
- [Missy] Now, you're gonna
walk and you're gonna scream.

356
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:34,971
Okay, that's the order.

357
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:35,804
- [Finn] Momma.

358
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:36,637
(screams)

359
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,470
(laughs)

360
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,978
- [Missy] We did it

361
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:41,620
and no one started crying.

362
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,711
(whining)

363
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,963
Including Momma, yay.

364
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:46,287
Let's go home, okay.

365
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,120
Go see Daddy.

366
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,230

367
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,300

368
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,134
- Where's da da?

369
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:51,007
- Dah-ee.

370
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,185
Whoos da da?

371
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,683
- Well, I hope you guys enjoyed
me shopping with the boys.

372
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:56,516
(shouting)

373
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:57,799
Real life shopping.

374
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,196
(shouting)

375
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:00,353
Why are you screaming?

376
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:01,889
(groans)

377
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,478
Yeah, that was hard, but you
know what, we got it done.

378
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:08,431
I feel like you really got to experience

379
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,679
what it's like to shop
with these two crazy kids

380
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,508
or honestly, shop with any two crazy kids

381
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:17,761
'cause being a mom and grocery
shopping with kids is hard.

382
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,346
But you do it and it's fine.

383
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,356
You get through it and everyone's
good in the end, right.

384
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:23,306
We've got food.

385
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:24,759
Let's go home and eat dinner, okay.

386
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,592
- Yeah.

387
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:26,425
(shouts)

388
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:27,350
- Yay, it's 6:52.

389
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,183
It's--

390
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:29,016
(screams)

391
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:29,849
(laughs)

392
00:11:29,849 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
