- Good mornin'!

00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,320
(babbles)

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,680
Good morning, guys.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,945
How are you today, bud?

9
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:25,810
He's a little out of it.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,339
Had to do a few little tricks

11
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:28,900
to get him not out of it.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,859
I'll show it to you in just a second.

13
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:30,692
(sneezes)

14
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:31,525
Whew, bless you!

15
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:33,892
Ollie, how are you this morning, bud?

16
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:34,725
- [Ollie] Good.

17
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:35,558
- Are we getting back on track?

18
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:37,100
I'm just tryin' to get cleaned up.

19
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,700
It's just been one of those days,

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,280
one of those weekends,

21
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,560
one of those weeks.

22
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,540
We are excited for a fun, fun day, huh?

23
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,373
- Yeah.

24
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:46,280
- And I was saying Finn is a little

25
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,380
bit grouchy today, huh?

26
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,170
And everything I was trying
to do was not making him

27
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,003
in a good mood.

28
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:52,906
Look at this kid.

29
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:55,437
(growls)

30
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:58,160
Wow, wow, you are not
in a good mood, are you?

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,400
And there is only one way to get this kid

32
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,233
into a good mood.

33
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,240
Are you ready?

34
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,073
Are you ready?

35
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:03,906
- [Ollie] Yeah!

36
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:04,739
- Meow!

37
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:07,319
- Meow!

38
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,238
(both meowing)

39
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,488
(slurping)

40
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,604
(both meowing)

41
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,657
(Finn laughing)

42
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,047
(purring)

43
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:26,904
(meowing)

44
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,784
Ready, are you ready?

45
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:31,617
- [Ollie] Yeah.

46
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:34,700
(hisses, then meows)

47
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,429
(Finn laughing)

48
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,520
- [Missy] Show me your kitty cat.

49
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:43,648
Say meow.

50
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:47,393
(screams)

51
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:51,827
(screaming)

52
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:55,527
(laughter, growls)

53
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,881
This is a feral cat right here.

54
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:58,924
Feral cat.

55
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,127
(Finn meowing)

56
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:02,475
I love you, I love you, feral kitty cat.

57
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:03,943
I love you.

58
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:06,590
(screaming)

59
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,030
Oh my goodness, ow.

60
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,070
Woo!

61
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,160
That's the only way to
get him into a good mood.

62
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:14,180
Are you happy now?

63
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:16,650
Are you happy now?

64
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,110
And now I have a happy little baby.

65
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,870
So we are actually doing
something very special today.

66
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,810
I have a ton of books.

67
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,140
I love books, we love reading books,

68
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,390
and in the playroom we
have tons of books in here.

69
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,630
They're a little unorganized right now,

70
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,670
but tons of books in there,

71
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,822
tons of books in here,

72
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:35,510
and this doesn't even begin to tell you

73
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,390
how many books are actually
in their room as well.

74
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,871
But is finally time to go through them

75
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:41,840
and donate them, huh?

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,954
Where are we gonna donate them to?

77
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,402
- We're gonna donate them to kids.

78
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:48,500
- To kids, you're right.

79
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,260
Oh wow, Finn's just like,
"I don't like this book,

80
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,520
"I don't like that book."

81
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,230
So yeah, we have a lot of books

82
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,510
and I'm kinda getting bored

83
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,380
of a lot of the books that we do have.

84
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,210
The ones I've read a
lot I'll probably keep,

85
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,050
just 'cause obviously they mean a lot,

86
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,570
but there are some books
that it's just like

87
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,650
we don't ever read.

88
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,660
Oh, I remember reading this one to you.

89
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,390
This is like the first
book you ever laughed at.

90
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,622
You thought it was so funny when I said,

91
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,983
"Casper swiftly slides down the hill."

92
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,317
You thought that was hilarious.

93
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,260
Swiftly slides down the hill.

94
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,370
He thought that was so funny.

95
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,279
So, yeah, we'll keep this one.

96
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,655
Certain ones that we are

97
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,738
really attached to,
we'll keep and put them

98
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:21,703
in a special spot.

99
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,370
We definitely have a lot of books

100
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,100
that we could donate,
so we're gonna do that.

101
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,780
So we just went through all of these

102
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,121
and we're gonna keep these books

103
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,120
and so far we're getting rid

104
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,916
of some of these, but I will say

105
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,197
that whenever we go through books,

106
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:34,930
we get very sidetracked

107
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,250
and we just start reading all the books,

108
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,120
'cause we basically just
read all these, huh?

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,940
We also just went through
Baby's First Words

110
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,152
and Finn did really good on them, huh?

111
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:44,985
- Yeah.

112
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:45,818
- You said all the words.

113
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:46,964
Let's see if I can show you one.

114
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:48,890
All right, Finn.

115
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,338
Say spoon.

116
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:51,400
- Spoon.

117
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,404
- [Missy] Say table.

118
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,860
- Table.

119
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,654
- [Missy] Say bib.

120
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:56,487
- Bib.

121
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,984
- [Missy] Oh gosh, here's
another hundred words book,

122
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:02,680
but it's actually from our
cousin Alyvia and Casey

123
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,660
and Rose on Finn's first birthday,

124
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,830
so we obviously can't
get rid of this one, huh?

125
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,310
Oh wow!

126
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,150
Ollie found some of our books

127
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,370
that we have from when we visited.

128
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,910
This is one that we did in Seattle.

129
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,369
- [Oliver] Ooh, let's keep this.

130
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:18,202
- [Finn] Dada!

131
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:19,982
- [Missy] Dada!

132
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:23,176
Ollie, I guess we can't
get rid of this one, huh?

133
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,100
- Yeah, this one too.

134
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,933
- [Missy] That one too?

135
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,390
That one's when we went
to London, we saw Shrek,

136
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,130
and then this one is from the London Eye.

137
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,510
Look at that.

138
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,860
There we all are.

139
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,693
- [Ollie] That's a cute one.

140
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,530
Can we keep it?

141
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,002
- [Missy] You know, I
think we should donate it.

142
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:38,840
- No!

143
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,290
- [Missy] I'm not gonna donate our book

144
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,744
of a picture of us in it, you silly boy.

145
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:47,350
Aww, here's an even better picture of us.

146
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,787
Look at my babies.

147
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,690
Aww, my mom and dad.

148
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,523
That was such a fun trip

149
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:52,960
when we went to London.

150
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,899
So one thing about me is that I love books

151
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,540
and I love reading the kids books,

152
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,900
I love cycling through books,

153
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,114
and just going through these books,

154
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,273
these are all the books
we're keeping at this point.

155
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:03,188
(laughs)

156
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:04,041
And these are all the books

157
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,370
that we are getting rid
of, which is not a lot.

158
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,691
We need to, we need to get
rid of more books, bud.

159
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:11,860
I just found this book, though,

160
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,475
and oh my gosh, I read this book to Ollie

161
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:17,120
so many times.

162
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
I wasn't my favorite book,

163
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,196
but obviously it was
Ollie's favorite book,

164
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,803
'cause you ate some of it.

165
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:22,960
- Yeah.

166
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,056
- [Missy] So many books
have been eaten by Ollie.

167
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:27,146
- Because they taste like paper.

168
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:29,658
I like to eat, taste the paper.

169
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:33,153
- And I would like to
get a general opinion

170
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,860
about Where the Wild Things Are book,

171
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,460
because it is like my least
favorite book to read,

172
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,180
but Bryan loves this book,

173
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,390
and I'll definitely keep it around

174
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,840
because it's one of his favorites.

175
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,260
I don't know, I never understood it.

176
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,246
It was always so weird to me.

177
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:50,510
Now, the movie I thought was kinda cute.

178
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,790
I wasn't like a huge fan of it.

179
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,240
Bryan loved the movie, loves this book.

180
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,073
I'm not a big fan.

181
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,189
Do you like this book?

182
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,022
- Yeah.

183
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:57,855
- [Missy] Yeah?

184
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:58,688
- It's a cute one.

185
00:05:58,688 --> 00:05:59,521
- [Missy] All right, we'll
keep it around, then.

186
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:03,710
Maybe I'll get into it when
they are older and stuff.

187
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,550
So let me know down in the comments

188
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,590
if you guys like Where
the Wild Things Are,

189
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,080
if you like the book,
if you like the movie,

190
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,296
if you've ever heard of it.

191
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm not a big fan.

192
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,383
- Oh my gosh, What Does the Fox Say!

193
00:06:14,383 --> 00:06:15,950
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!

194
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,860
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!

195
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:18,700
- [Missy] Do you remember that?

196
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,533
- Yeah!

197
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,956
- [Missy] When you were a
baby, you loved this song.

198
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:23,789
- Yeah.

199
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,640
- [Missy] Loved it, it
was like the only thing

200
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,630
that would put you to bed.

201
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,120
- Yeah, can we read it?

202
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,040
- [Missy] We'll keep it.

203
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,462
I am very attached to this book.

204
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:33,200
It is the book to What Does the Fox Say?

205
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,204
Actually really, really
cool illustrations.

206
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:38,362
I don't know, it's such a fun book.

207
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:40,063
♪ Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! ♪

208
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:41,749
♪ Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! ♪

209
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,089
- [Both] ♪ Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! ♪

210
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,860
♪ Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! ♪

211
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,790
- [Missy] ♪ A-hee-ahee ha-hee! ♪

212
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,087
♪ A-hee-ahee ha-hee! ♪

213
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,380
(laughing)

214
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,600
So we will definitely be keeping this,

215
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,160
and I actually feel like we could find

216
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,872
some footage of Ollie
and Mimi and Papa dancing

217
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,952
to this song, 'cause they loved this.

218
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,190
Ahh, what are you doing?

219
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,187
(Finn growling)

220
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,092
Oh, it's a crocodile book.

221
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:07,080
I didn't know he'd ever read this one,

222
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,730
but he loves it right now.

223
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,770
Okay, so check this out.

224
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,796
We have tons of books here,

225
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,860
tons of books there,

226
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,780
and I'm telling you right now,

227
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,620
it goes up there, 'cause
we dropped the ones

228
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,870
that we're not reading right now

229
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,769
onto this one, and now
there's tons of books there.

230
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:22,510
Tons of books there.

231
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,010
You'd be surprised how many books

232
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,500
can be held in this thing.

233
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,650
And we've got books in here, even.

234
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,483
It's ridiculous.

235
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:29,923
We are a little obsessed with books.

236
00:07:29,923 --> 00:07:31,510
But we definitely cycle through them,

237
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,380
so I want to take the ones

238
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,213
that we're not reading

239
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:36,210
and bring them into the playroom

240
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,290
and then get rid of the ones

241
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,263
that we're not going to read again,

242
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,044
'cause there's, I think,
quite a bit of them,

243
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,640
especially in here.

244
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,405
You guys, I am now swimming in books.

245
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:44,729
So many books!

246
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,036
I am having a hard time letting go

247
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,884
of a lot of our books,
but we have to do this.

248
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,717
So right now I'm going through the books

249
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:52,877
that are all up on Ollie's bed

250
00:07:52,877 --> 00:07:55,040
and these are all the books

251
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,880
that we cycle through quite a bit.

252
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,360
How to Catch a Monster, one
of his absolute favorites,

253
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
or both of their favorites.

254
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,069
Dragons Love Tacos, we've
got Dragons Love Tacos

255
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:04,637
and Dragons Love Tacos Two.

256
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:08,000
Goodnight Moon is obviously the best one.

257
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,660
We end our night, almost
every single night,

258
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,493
reading this one.

259
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,357
Every single night, I
mean, I definitely can read

260
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:14,780
this in the dark because
I have it memorized.

261
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,607
In fact, I have a lot of
these books memorized.

262
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,680
This one, oh my gosh.

263
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,684
I could say this one by heart.

264
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:22,090
This one could literally --

265
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,610
yeah, I have been
reading this one to Ollie

266
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,443
since he was a little baby.

267
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:27,364
We both could do this by heart.

268
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:28,443
I've done it before,

269
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:29,696
and Bryan was laughing at me

270
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:31,650
'cause I was just saying it all.

271
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,950
All right, we've got all the books

272
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,339
that we like to read a lot

273
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,309
and a couple new ones

274
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,119
that we're gonna try and incorporate.

275
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,610
These are our favorites.

276
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,551
We pick three every night to read.

277
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,528
And these are the books
we're going to keep

278
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:42,998
but we're gonna take 'em to the playroom

279
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:45,450
because we just haven't
really been into them.

280
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,260
So while we were on our quest

281
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,240
for donating books, we
found this cool book,

282
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,941
which we actually haven't used a lot of.

283
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:53,520
And so I think it'd be fun

284
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,300
to show you what letter
you're learning this week.

285
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,340
Does that sound good?

286
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,173
- [Oliver] Yeah.

287
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:59,682
- So this week, he's going to be learning

288
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,970
the letter G.

289
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,922
Can you say G?

290
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:03,755
- G.

291
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,232
- [Missy] G, so this is the letter G

292
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:06,430
and tomorrow he goes to school

293
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,405
and you're gonna learn
how to do it, right?

294
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,238
- Yeah.

295
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:10,553
- [Missy] All right, so
I'm going to show him

296
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:15,553
how to draw the uppercase
G and the lowercase g.

297
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,031
And Ollie is getting so good

298
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:20,170
at holding his pen, look at that!

299
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,003
That's awesome.

300
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:22,331
You just gotta pinch it, right?

301
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:25,504
All right, you go ahead and try first.

302
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:28,087
(upbeat music)

303
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,410
Whoa, so you know that you have to start

304
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,286
with the dot and then
end with the dot, right?

305
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:37,136
- Yeah.

306
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:38,135
- Okay, let's show me how you do this one.

307
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,718
(upbeat music)

308
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,980
Wow, I'm so proud of you.

309
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,287
I'm sure the marker makes it
a little more slippery, huh?

310
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:55,935
Do you think you can
do it without the dots?

311
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:56,830
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,310
- Do you wanna try?

313
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,977
(Finn babbling)

314
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,047
That is pretty good, Ollie!

315
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:06,878
Awesome try!

316
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:08,860
All right, we've got all the books

317
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,486
that we are donating loaded up

318
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,970
and we are headed off
to go donate them, yay!

319
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,250
I think Finn's excited.

320
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,620
Finn's probably actually
gonna fall asleep.

321
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,472
Daddy's actually getting some work done,

322
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:20,820
so he's gonna stay home and do that

323
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,710
and we're gonna go donate some books

324
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,130
and maybe pick out a couple new books.

325
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,150
Hopefully not too many, though,

326
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,240
'cause we've got a lot of books.

327
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,073
Like, we're good. (laughs)

328
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:31,847
All right, we are getting ready
to donate all our books now.

329
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,324
Could you help Mommy carry them in?

330
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:35,491
- [Ollie] Yes.

331
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:37,516
- [Missy] Here, you grab one side.

332
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:38,820
You gonna open the door, Finn?

333
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,694
Open the door for Mama.

334
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:43,277
(upbeat music)

335
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,147
All right, you donated
all your books, huh?

336
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:54,070
- Yeah.

337
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,903
- [Missy] Good job!

338
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,569
I'm proud of you guys.

339
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:57,402
- Yeah.

340
00:10:58,337 --> 00:11:01,954
- [Missy] Now it's time to
go get some new books, 'kay?

341
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:02,787
- [Both] Yeah.

342
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,407
- [Missy] 'Kay.

343
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:05,300
We're now at lunch with Papa and Mimi.

344
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,810
(all cheering)

345
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,180
We are at the kids' favorite place.

346
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,013
Where are we at?

347
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:12,090
- Freebirds!

348
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,500
- [Missy] Freebird!

349
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,732
You got a quesadilla?

350
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:15,565
- Yeah.

351
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:16,398
- [Missy] Yum!

352
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:17,231
- I love quesadillas.

353
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:18,510
- [Missy] You do love quesadillas,

354
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,454
and you're getting a burrito?

355
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:20,440
- Yeah.

356
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,180
- [Missy] Yeah, you love burritos, huh?

357
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,530
I wanna see you take a big bite of that.

358
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,197
(Mimi laughing)

359
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,714
Good job!

360
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:31,297
(upbeat music)

361
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,670
All right, now that we
have donated all our books,

362
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,420
we are at Barnes and Noble

363
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,820
and we are gonna pick out some fun books.

364
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,653
- Look!

365
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:47,414
- [Missy] Did you find
the Harry Potter stuff?

366
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,360
- [Ollie] Yeah.

367
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,443
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

368
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,380
How cool.

369
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,965
Daddy needs to come here and see all this.

370
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:56,650
So we're gonna pick out some fun new books

371
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,630
for the boys in the kids' section

372
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,750
and hopefully find new ones

373
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,214
that we can, you know, get really into

374
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:05,197
and love, huh?

375
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:07,780
(upbeat music)

376
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:14,345
- Gonna do some dancing?

377
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:15,178
Maybe tell a story?

378
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:16,710
- [Missy] Can you sing Annie?

379
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,590
All right, Ollie, we've been looking

380
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,423
at all kinds of books,

381
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:25,120
and these are the ones
that we've got picked out.

382
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,180
What do you think?

383
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,143
You think that's a good selection?

384
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:27,976
- Yeah.

385
00:12:27,976 --> 00:12:28,809
- [Missy] Yeah?

386
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:30,566
All right, show me which
one is your favorite one

387
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:31,854
that you're the most excited to read.

388
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,090
- [Finn] This one.

389
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:33,950
- [Missy] This one?

390
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,783
- [Finn] Yeah.

391
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:35,810
- [Missy] What's Next Door,
this one actually looks

392
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,730
like a really fun one.

393
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,563
I think you're gonna like that one.

394
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:41,329
Also, you've been watching
the show of this one, right?

395
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:42,162
- Yeah.

396
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,130
- [Missy] So you know there's a book,

397
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,060
If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.

398
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,590
We just picked out a few books.

399
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,820
I really like this one.

400
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,400
We have the Ten Little Dinosaurs,

401
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,360
so that might be fun.

402
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,960
I'll Never Let You Go,
Pig the Winner looks

403
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,894
like a really funny, cute one.

404
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:56,299
And we love rhyming books.

405
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,281
Mama basically only wants to read books

406
00:12:58,281 --> 00:12:59,742
that are rhyming.

407
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:02,325
(upbeat music)

408
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:10,989
All right, we've got out books, you ready?

409
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:11,822
- Yeah.

410
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:12,655
- [Missy] We got lots of books.

411
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:14,124
You wanna carry it?

412
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:14,957
- Heavy!

413
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:15,790
- [Missy] It's so heavy.

414
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,843
- So I heard there's a couple of boys

415
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:19,056
in this bedroom

416
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:21,760
who did a good deed today.

417
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,593
Is that true?

418
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,230
Hello?

419
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:26,700
(boys giggling)

420
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,449
Hey you two,

421
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,084
you hanging out in your little tent?

422
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:30,917
- Yeah.

423
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:32,617
- Doin' some campin' in your room?

424
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,910
Ollie, did you and Finn
give some books away today?

425
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,743
- Yeah.

426
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:38,576
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

427
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:39,673
To the library?

428
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:40,506
- Mm-hmm.

429
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:41,660
- That's so neat, dude.

430
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,342
Now all those kids who use the library

431
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:46,570
to get books can go there
are read yours now, huh?

432
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,630
- Yeah.

433
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,800
- That's pretty neat.

434
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,130
I love that the boys are involved

435
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,960
with little giving practice like that

436
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,860
around the city.

437
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,750
We're always donating
toys or clothes or books.

438
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,831
I think it's really
good for them. (laughs)

439
00:13:56,831 --> 00:14:00,490
They also got a handful
of new books, didn't you?

440
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,731
We should read some new
books tonight for bed!

441
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:06,970
Luna, you gonna be here for reading time?

442
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,804
You ready for book time?

443
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:10,195
- Wait, smell her, guys.

444
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:11,449
- [Bryan] Does she smell good?

445
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:12,282
- Yeah.

446
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:13,271
- [Bryan] Ooh, give her a smell.

447
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:15,298
- She smells very good.

448
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:17,402
- Ooh, she does smell good.

449
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:19,333
I think she got a bath, didn't you?

450
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,197
- [Ollie] Yes, she did.

451
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:21,380
- [Bryan] Did you get a bath?

452
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,213
She's a spoiled little puppy.

453
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,958
(peaceful music)

454
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,099
- Miss Tracy haves this.

455
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:34,042
- [Bryan] Do you have that book at school?

456
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:36,675
- It's about, it has about these one

457
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,425
and same as this one.

458
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,042
- [Bryan] That's so cool,
what's that story about?

459
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,922
- It's about if you give a mouse a cookie.

460
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:46,470
- [Bryan] What do they need
if you give them a cookie?

461
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,520
- He wants a glass of milk.

462
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,554
- [Bryan] Of course he does! (laughs)

463
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,137
Such a cute book, I used
to read this all the time.

464
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:54,059
Oh, look at all the
different ones they have.

465
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,610
- If you give a cat a --

466
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,868
- [Bryan] A cupcake.

467
00:14:58,868 --> 00:14:59,790
- A cupcake.

468
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,017
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's cute.

469
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,948
So you read all of 'em in school?

470
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:03,950
- Yeah.

471
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,783
- That's so cool.

472
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:07,476
(babbling)

473
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:09,530
Is Luna giving you kisses, Finn?

474
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,640
I am so proud of you boys

475
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,610
