- Hey boys! You guys have to see

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,250
their shirts I put them in this morning.

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,083
They are so cute.

8
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,040
Stand up boys, let us see.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,623
It says Fuzzy and Fearless.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,390
And you've got Chewbacca.

11
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,400
- Yeah, this is from Star Wars.

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,780
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

13
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,140
I saw those shirts and I just
had to get 'em for your guys.

14
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,973
Do you know why?

15
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:27,806
- Why?

16
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,493
- Because you are fuzzy and fearless!

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,392
My boys are so brave, huh?

18
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:33,367
- Yeah.

19
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,128
- Do you boys know what it is today?

20
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:36,000
- What?
- Yes?

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,052
- It's Saint Patrick's Day.

22
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:38,885
- Yay!

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,537
- Do you know guys know what
happens on Saint Patrick's Day?

24
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:43,370
- What?

25
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,460
- [Bryan] You really gotta
be careful because there

26
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,157
could be leprechauns
running around, right?

27
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:49,990
- Yeah.

28
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,230
- And I've heard leprechauns are some of

29
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,264
the most craziest little
misfits, and they will turn

30
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:55,820
your house upside-down, right?

31
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,730
- Yeah.

32
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,840
- Yeah, so we have this
handy-dandy book called,

33
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,255
How to Catch a Leprechaun.

34
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:02,977
- Yep, leprechauns are bad.

35
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:03,910
- [Bryan] They are.

36
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,420
- But why are they bad?

37
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,700
- Cause they like gold.

38
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,680
They like to terrorize and hunt for gold.

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,422
Finn, what do you think
about the leprechauns,

40
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:12,712
do you think we'll run into one today?

41
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:13,790
(mumbles)

42
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,623
- [Bryan] Yeah, do you think

43
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:15,720
we'll run into one today, Ollie?

44
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,690
- I think so.

45
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,240
- [Bryan] Yeah, well, do
you want to read this book

46
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,633
and figure out how to catch a leprechaun?

47
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:20,730
- Yep!
- Okay.

48
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,563
Let's read it.

49
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:23,250
- Those are shamrocks, but they're also

50
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,839
called flowers too, guys.

51
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:25,860
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

52
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,810
- Oh, okay.

53
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,060
I am learning so much Saint
Patrick's Day stuff already.

54
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,010
The night is dark, the streets are quiet,

55
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,540
Saint Patricks's Day is near.

56
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,270
I tap my hammer so you'll
know the leprechaun is here.

57
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,460
The leprechaun's coming.

58
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,210
I'll pull out all your laces,
put glitter in your hair.

59
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,440
And when you walk around,

60
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,630
you'll find my gold coins everywhere.

61
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,463
- [Ollie] There's a gold coin.

62
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:48,790
- [Bryan] I know, the leprechauns
are taking over the house,

63
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,020
huh?
- Yeah.

64
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,330
- Bryan] I know you want my pot of gold,

65
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,940
that iron case was clever.

66
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,730
But I've been alive 200 years.

67
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,040
You won't catch me, ever!

68
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,726
Look it, the leprechaun put
that little boy in a cage.

69
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:00,559
- Oh.

70
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,340
- [Bryan] We can't let
him do that to you guys.

71
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,510
- No.

72
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm strong, so I can fight leprechauns.

73
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,669
- Yeah, well they are
not that very strong,

74
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,829
but they're really, really fast, huh?

75
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,663
- Yeah.

76
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,670
That is so cool, you guys;
How to Catch a Leprechaun.

77
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,680
Do you think that we can
actually have a leprechaun

78
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,580
in this house today?

79
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,261
- And I think we should make
a cake that we got yesterday.

80
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,031
- Oh, the Christmas Cage?

81
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:24,864
- [Ollie] Yeah.

82
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:29,550
- We could also try, I
have something, gold coins.

83
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,918
Should we put out some gold coins?

84
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,550
- Yes.
- Yeah.

85
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,800
- Yeah, I found these gold
doubloons just lying around.

86
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,320
And I figured maybe can set
them somewhere and we should

87
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,160
use them to see if we can trap one.

88
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,328
Alright boys, I'm gonna
set these gold coins

89
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,870
right on top of this wooden
log, and we will see if

90
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,752
anything comes by and steals them, kay?

91
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,585
- Yeah.
- Okay.

92
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:50,920
My wife is so cute, you guys.

93
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,660
Lookit, she left me a little
note on my office door,

94
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,070
that says today's going to be a good day!

95
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,970
- It's going to be Patrick's Day.

96
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,960
- [Bryamn] Yep, but it's also
going to be a good day, right?

97
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,793
- Yep.

98
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:01,840
- Alright, let's put those gold coins

99
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,240
on the table right there too.

100
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,160
- Yeah.
- Cause it seems like

101
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,050
a good height for a leprechaun, right?

102
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,740
- Yeah.
- We'll see if we got one.

103
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,571
Okay, come on, I got something
fun for you guys to do.

104
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:10,404
- Alright.

105
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,173
- [Bryan] We've got tattoos!

106
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,140
So go ahead and pick a
Saint Patrick's Day tattoo.

107
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,330
We've got some cute ones.

108
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,040
That one says Shenanigans.

109
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,950
- [Ollie] I want the rainbow one.

110
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,050

111
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,320
Oooh, you want the rainbow one?

00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,561
That is some good counting, Ollie.

143
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,800
He can do one through 10 now.

144
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,970
He gets close to like 13-14,

145
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,478
I think that's pretty neat, huh?

146
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:08,311
- Yeah.

147
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,144

Whoa!

155
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:29,380
Alright, Finny really
wanted one on his cheek.

156
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,690
Oh, he looks so cute.

157
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,183
Don't touch it, don't touch it.

158
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:34,470
(laughs) He always wants
to touch it afterwards.

159
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,419
- Take it off!

160
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,327

00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:37,460
Whoa!

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,770
You got a horseshoe

163
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,740
and a bunch of shamrocks,
that looks so good.

164
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,920
Alright, time to see daddy's.

165
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,293
You ready?

00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,270
Check it out.

167
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,677
I got a shamrock, what do you think?

168
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:51,610
- Good.
- Is that pretty cool?

169
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,882

171
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:58,188
(upbeat music)

172
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:05,272
(playful irish music)

173
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,450
All right, boys!

174
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,760
Let's go check on our coins

175
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,377
and see if anything got 'em.

176
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:25,210
- [Both] Okay!

177
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,320
- [Bryan] Do you think
they're still there?

178
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,235
- No.
- Yeah!

179
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:29,470
- Okay, let's go check and see
if our coins are still there.

180
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,303
Come on!

181
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:32,786
We know we left some over
here on the table, right?

182
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:33,829
(Ollie gasps)

183
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,120
- Where did they go?

184
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,953
- [Bryan] Oh, they're gone?

185
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:36,790
- What!

186
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,825
- [ Bryan] Do you think he
came in here and grabbed them?

187
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:39,658
- Yeah.

188
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:40,970
- [Bryan] Okay, well let's
go check your bedroom.

189
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,121
Go check your bedroom, Finn.

190
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:43,180
- Let's find 'em!

191
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,620
- [Bryan] Let's go see
if we can find the coins

192
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,558
in your bedroom still.

193
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:48,353
(upbeat irish music)

194
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:49,270
- What!

195
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,662
- [Bryan] What, they're gone?

196
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:51,790
- What, yeah!

197
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,160
- Whoa!

198
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,470
Ollie, I don't how to say
this: but we may actually

199
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,541
have a leprechaun loose in the house.

200
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,550
- Really?

201
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,075
- We may have to trap this thing.

202
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:03,220
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

203
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,053
That's crazy!

204
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,450
While we were getting
temporary tattoos apparently,

205
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,440
leprechaun came in and
started some mischief.

206
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,410
I bet he's running around
else in the house, huh?

207
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,243
- Yeah!

208
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:12,076
- [Bryan] I think I just heard something

209
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,363
inside the bathroom, Ollie.

210
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,321
- Really?
- Yeah.

211
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:16,315
You should go and investigate.

212
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:18,308
Finn, you wanna investigate?

213
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:20,270
- Come with me.
- I'll come with you, okay.

214
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,040
- Yeah.
- Okay, go ahead.

215
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,873
Open up the door.

216
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:24,220
I think I hear something.
(knocking)

217
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,700
There you go. (laughs)

218
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,649
Did you guys hear the leprechaun in there?

219
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:29,482
- [Both] Yeah.

220
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:31,210
- Well, let's go see if
he did anything, go see.

221
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,488
It's okay, it's okay.

222
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:34,820
Ollie's like legit scared
of this leprechaun.

223
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,750
Anything out of the ordinary?
- Oh!

224
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,439
See if he left you anything.

225
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,356
What is it?

226
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:41,692
- What?

227
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,082
- [Bryan] Whoa!

228
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:44,610
- Whoa, A rainbow!

229
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,910
- [Bryan] There's a rainbow,
and the water's green?

230
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,743
- What?
- Yeah.

231
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:49,810
- [Bryan] Do you think the leprechaun

232
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,210
used the toilet, Ollie?

233
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,363
- [Ollie] Yes.

234
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:53,948
(Bryan laughs)

235
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:56,400
- What did they do?

236
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,700
Why is it green?

237
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,881
- I don't know.

238
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,620
How did it turn green?

239
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,453
- [Bryan] Well, I don't know.

240
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,740
The leprechaun must
have been in here, huh?

241
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,727
And look, he left you guys a
clue, it's a little rainbow.

242
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,720
Do you think there's
going to be more things,

243
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,060
if we follow the clue?

244
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,460
- Yeah, but what is this black thing?

245
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,478
- [Bryan] Yeah.

246
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:13,710
- What is the black thing?

247
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,229
- I don't know how leprechauns work.

248
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,810
Kay, let's get outta here.

249
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,034
Smells like brimstone in here.

250
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:20,816
- Maybe that's the leprechaun smell.

251
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,220
- (laughs) Maybe he went potty, huh?

252
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,085
And then he made the
toilet green. (laughs)

253
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:27,748
- There's a leprechaun!

254
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,803
- [Bryan] There's a
leprechaun in our house?

255
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:30,900
- Yes!
- Go get it!

256
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,630
Oh, he's chasing you?

257
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,510
Oh, no, he's chasing you!

258
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,068
Run from them Ollie, go,
run, run, run, run, run!

259
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:39,716
(Ollie screaming)
Get him, Finny, get him!

260
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:41,170
(screaming)

261
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,540
There's a real leprechaun
in our house, Ollie.

262
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,373
Ah!

263
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:46,990
- Come on, daddy!

264
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,310
- [Bryan] Get him,
leprechaun, go catch him!

265
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,980
- This can't be a leprechaun in the house.

266
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,031
- Well, I think there is,
and he's coming right for us!

267
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:55,824
(all screaming)

268
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,740
(laughing)

269
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,940
- [Bryan] Oh, you cute little leprechaun.

270
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,420
- Nice leprechaun.

271
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,670
- Yeah, he's a nice leprechaun.

272
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,052
He's a nice, cute, little
leprechaun. (laughs)

273
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,288
- [Ollie] He can do tricks.

274
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,470
I think Finn can do tricks.

275
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,315
- Top of the mornin' to ya.

276
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,815
(Irish music)

277
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,630
Finn you're giving a new definition to

278
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,210
Fuzzy and Fearless in your
fuzzy slippers. (laughs)

279
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,520
Those are so cute.

280
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,570
Wait, Ollie, what's that?

281
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,707
Is that another rainbow?

282
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:35,674
- Yeah!

283
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:38,899
- Wait, is that just like the
one that's in the bathroom?

284
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,207
- Yes, in the toilet.

285
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,212
It's still there and now
there's one right there.

286
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:43,045
- Oh, that's --

287
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:45,158
- Let's see if there's
another one outside.

288
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,884
- Yeah, should we like, follow them?

289
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:48,717
What?

290
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:49,725
- Rainbows everywhere!

291
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,630
One right there, One right there!

292
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,730
- [Bryan] Whoa, there
is a rainbow right here.

293
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,440
- [Ollie] Come on this side, guys!

294
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,940
- [Bryan] Wait, there's one over there?

295
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,910
Come here, Finn!

296
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,358
Oh, Finn's struggling
in his fuzzy slippers.

297
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:01,530
(laughs)

298
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,310
Alright, we got Finn in some better shoes,

299
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,460
that he can walk in.

300
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,570
There actually Ollie's shoes,
he's like really excited

301
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,120
about them cause they light up. (laughs)

302
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,580
Alright Ollie, what are we gonna do?

303
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,300
So you want to follow these rainbows?

304
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,370
- Look guys, rainbow right there!

305
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,692
- Whoa, do you see, Finn?

306
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:18,370
- Two of them!
Whoa!

307
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,581
Okay, So there's a rainbow right here.

308
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:21,414
- There's a rainbow.

309
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:23,340
- [Bryan] Whoa, look at all these coins.

310
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,204
Do you think the leprechaun
dropped all of these?

311
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:26,110
- No.
- Wait.

312
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,960
- [Bryan] Well, pick 'em up!

313
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,510
Pick up those gold doubloons!

314
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,130
Those are worth money, you guys.

315
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,360
We can get toys with those.

316
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,210
- Look!
- What do you see, Finn?

317
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,347
- More!

318
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:36,580
- Anoth, Oh wow!

319
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,140
There's another rainbow over here, Ollie.

320
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,310
I think the leprechaun may want
us to follow these rainbows.

321
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,931
Hey boys, do you know what's
at the end of a rainbow?

322
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:46,764
- [Ollie] What?

323
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:47,873
- A pot of gold.

324
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:49,800
- A pot of gold?

325
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,250
- Do you think we can find a pot of gold,

326
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,670
if we keep following the rainbows?

327
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,970
- Yeah, and maybe we can
follow these coins too.

328
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,579
- [Bryan] Yeah, let's go!

329
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,246
(playful music)

330
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,940
- Guys, look at my pot of gold.

331
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,460
- [Bryan] Yeah, it's so cool.

332
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,080
Alright, we're looking
for the next rainbow,

333
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
so we know where to go next.

334
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,075
You're pretty good at this.

335
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:14,037
- No rainbows. (gasps)

336
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,098
I thought there's no rainbow over here,

337
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,777
but there's a rainbow right there.

338
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:18,973
Look at it, look!

339
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,890
- [Bryan] Wow, let's go see.

340
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,180
Oh, wow!

341
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,520
There's a rainbow right here too, Ollie.

342
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,860
- There's a rainbow over here.

343
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,510
- Yeah, let's go check it out, dudes.

344
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,450
We are following the rainbows
on our property right now.

345
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,330
There has definitely
been a leprechaun afoot,

346
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,810
causing some mayhem.

347
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,110
Oh, my goodness!

348
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,904
What is that, Ollie?!

349
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,790
- A rainbow.

350
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,387
- [Bryan] Rainbow, and what's over here?

351
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:43,893
- [Ollie] Whoa!

352
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,185
- [Bryan] What, a pot of gold?

353
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,152
- And look!

354
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:48,400
- [Bryan] What are those?

355
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,110
two Buzz Lightyear new
glow-in-the-dark blasters?

356
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,950
- [Ollie] Yeah, these
we could open these up.

357
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,248
- [Bryan] What is that, Finn?

358
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,081
- [Finn] Money.

359
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:57,914
- [Bryan] Is this gold?

360
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:58,964
- [Ollie] Yeah.

361
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:01,940
- [Bryan] Look at all of
this gold we just found.

362
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,020
I have never actually found a pot of gold,

363
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,483
at the end of a rainbow, have you, guys?

364
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:06,316
- [Ollie] No.

365
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,834
- [Bryan] No, and what did you get, Finn?

366
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,890
- [Finn] A toy.

367
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,056
- [Bryan] Another rainbow?

368
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:10,889
- [Finn] Yeah.

369
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:11,722
- [Bryan] Whoa!

370
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:12,555
(bubbling sounds)

371
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:13,520
- Oh, my gosh!

372
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,535
- [Bryan] It makes noise?

373
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:15,823
- Yeah.
(laughs)

374
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:16,940
- There's so cute.

375
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,320
A little leprechaun must have left those

376
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,031
toys for you to play with together.

377
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:20,864
- Really?

378
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:24,368
Finn, grab yours, I'm
gonna snatch this gold.

379
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:25,923
- See, this is full now.

380
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:28,537
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's
really full of gold, huh?

381
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:29,370
- [Ollie] Yeah.

382
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,951
- [Bryan] Look at this: This
is a real pot of gold, huh?

383
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:31,930
- Yeah.

384
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,440
- [Bryan] So you think this
is the leprechaun's gold?

385
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,273
- Yeah.

386
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:37,000
- So what do you do, when
you find a pot of gold

387
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,890
at the end of a rainbow,
in the middle of the woods?

388
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,030
Do we take it?

389
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,910
- Yeah.

390
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,100
- Or do you leave it?

391
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,230
- You take it.

392
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,010
- Maybe we should take it, and if we run

393
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,370
into the leprechaun, we
can give him his gold back.

394
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,203
- Okay.

395
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:49,620
- We may have a leprechaun
problem on our hands,

396
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,880
if we take all of his gold though.

397
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,647
You understand that, right?
- But leprechauns are bad,

398
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,320
bad remember guys?

399
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,540
- [Bryan] Well, they don't seem too bad.

400
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,051
Look, he left you guys toys,

401
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,067
that's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

402
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,860
(grunts)

403
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,280
- I'm going to grab this
very big pot of gold.

404
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,146
Okay, let's go!

405
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:05,800
You know what I could
buy with all this gold?

406
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,830
A lot of LaCroix.

407
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,700
We're out of LaCroix right now.

408
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,220
I'm pretty thirsty. (laughs)

409
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,606
That was a pretty epic
adventure, wasn't it, boys?

410
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,439
- [Ollie] Yeah.

411
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,470
- Yeah, you guys got toys.

412
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,400
Daddy got a pot of gold.

413
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,469
Whoa, show me your new
glow-in-the-dark blasters, Ollie.

414
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,850
(bubbling sound)

415
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,280
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

416
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,599
They make lots of noises,
and they light up.

417
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:28,182
(upbeat music)

418
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,850
Alright, Ollie's gonna
vlog, while I show you

419
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,270
how it works, okay?

420
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,373
- Okay.
So you put the little balls

421
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,627
right in there, just like that.

422
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:39,069
- [Ollie] I think you
are just attacking daddy.

423
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:39,902
(laughs)

424
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:42,600
And then watch this, you pull
this back, you push it forward

425
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,770
and then you fire! (laughs)

426
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,139
I got you, huh Ollie?

427
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,417
- Yeah.
(laughs)

428
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:51,740
- [Bryan] Now pull this part back, Finn.

429
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,573
Right here.

430
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:54,400
Can you do it, Ollie,
can you pull it back?

431
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,491
There you go, keep pulling.

432
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:56,420
- [Finn] Help me.

433
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,018
There you go, now push it back in.

434
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,520
There you go.

435
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,690
Now load it up with some balls

436
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,240
and then you can start shooting it, kay?

437
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,538
Let's see if it works.

438
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:04,371
(pop)

439
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:05,728
Whoa!

440
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:07,387
That's pretty neat, huh?

441
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,220
- Yeah.

442
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,641
- Hey Ollie, what do you
think of that blaster?

443
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,831
- Good.
Is that pretty fun?

444
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,720
- Yeah.

445
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,456
- [Bryan] Ah, here comes Finn! (laughs)

446
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:18,550
There are so cute.

447
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,910
They used to have the original

448
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,320
Buzz Lightyear Blasters,
but they don't sell those

449
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,950
anymore at Disneyland, which
I completely understand,

450
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,590
but it was a bummer'cause
they didn't make the

451
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,550
Buzz Lightyear Blasters.

452
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,470
When I bought them Star
Wars pajamas on the website,

453
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,840
I saw these and I was like,
oh, I they're gonna love these.

454
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,090
So, I talked to the leprechaun
and let him know where

455
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,290
he could grab them, okay?

456
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,970
- Okay.
(laughs)

457
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,866
- [Bryan] They're pretty cool, right?

458
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:41,699
- Yeah.

459
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:42,532
- [Bryan] Yeah.

460
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,110
Let's see your warrior pose, Ollie.

461
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,100
- Okay.
And Go!

462
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,663
Warrior Pose!

463
00:13:48,824 --> 00:13:50,130
The boys are so cute today, I love

464
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,780
having fun days like this
where I can just surprise them

465
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,180
and do fun things with.

466
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,630
And while I was doing it,
I got my own surprise.

467
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,463
Check this out.

468
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,884
So I was vlogging on
this camera, and I opened

469
00:13:59,884 --> 00:14:02,480
up the screen, and there's a little piece

470
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,587
of paper right here.

471
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:07,830
It says you got this! (laughs)

472
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,160
Just another little encouraging note

473
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,510
from my amazing wife, who
I love so much. (laughs)

474
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,560
Thanks for all the
encouraging messages, babe.

475
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,399
I love you.

476
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,982
(upbeat music)

477
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,530
- Alright guys, it is time for bed.

478
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,435
Ollie, you were just telling me

479
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:28,561
that someone was in our house.

480
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:29,400
- Yeah.

481
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,440
- Yeah, a little green man
was in our house today,

482
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,273
wasn't he?

483
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:33,682
- [Missy] And he was playing jokes on you?

484
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:34,753
- A leprechaun.

485
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:36,351
- [Missy] A leprechaun?

486
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:39,970
And then you followed the
rainbows to a pot of gold?

487
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,810
- Yeah, and we saw blasters.

488
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,070
- I gotta say: I mean, when I
was kid, Saint Patrick's Day

489
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,710
was probably like the
least coolest holiday.

490
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,467
I mean, you got it pretty good.

491
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,340
You got a pretty cool holiday.

492
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,470
- Yeah, I think Dada was able to make

493
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,236
Saint Patrick's Day cool even, huh?

494
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:58,069
(laughing)

495
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,560
You ever ran down a
rainbow to see if there's

496
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,810
an actual pot of gold?

497
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,643
I've done it.
- Nope.

498
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:06,909
- I've hopped on my bike, and
I biked for hours probably.

499
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:07,742
- [Missy] Hours?

500
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,170
- Trying to find the
end of a rainbow once.

501
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,610
Oh yeah, I believed.

502
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,810
- Oh, my gosh!

503
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,920
Now whenever you see a rainbow,

504
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,520
you're gonna need to follow it
to get the pot of gold, kay?

505
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,353
- Yeah.

506
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:18,330
- This kid is out though.

507
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,043
He is so done.

508
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:23,470
He made it through one book,
and he was like done; I'm out.

509
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,590
Anyways, we're going to go to bed.

510
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,824
Make sure you give a big thumbs
up for all the leprechauns

511
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,760
and Saint Patrick's Day.
- And let us know

512
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,098
if you had a leprechaun
living in your house,

513
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,620
what would you name him?

514
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,826
- You should name him Spicy.

515
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:36,659
(laughs)

516
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,420
- That's actually a pretty good

517
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,040
- That's pretty good.
leprechaun name. (laughs)

518
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,830
We will see you guys tomorrow,
and what do you say, Ollie?

519
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,663
- Bye!

520
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,723
Boop.

521
00:15:47,669 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
