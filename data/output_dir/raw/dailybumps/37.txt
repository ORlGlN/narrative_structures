- Good morning everyone and
welcome to today's vlog.

18
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,513
Happy weekend. We made it.

19
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:35,350
(laughs)

20
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,880
Missy right now is actually at the ranch,

21
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,890
riding her new horse.

22
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,810
If you guys have not
seen yesterday's video,

23
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,080
I'll have it linked in the iCard
so you can go check it out.

24
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,120
We basically reveal
Missy's brand new horse

25
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,050
that she just got.

26
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,350
His name, what kind of horse
he is, like all that fun stuff.

27
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,230
So be sure to go watch that
video it's super special.

28
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,430
Me and the boys met the horse
for the first time that day

29
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,300
and it was really, really cool.

30
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,030
But I also wanna share one
more thing with you guys

31
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,480
before we get going on today's vlog.

32
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,400
I know a couple of days ago
we told you guys a story

33
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,330
about little Henry who lost
his battle with cancer.

34
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,760
Make-A-Wish had contacted us, you know,

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,290
he wanted to meet us and we
wanted to like sing to him

36
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,330
and hang out with him.

37
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,400
Unfortunately, we never made it.

38
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,800
And it's been like really just like

39
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,560
weighing on my heart a lot this week.

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,220
I think this has been a really hard week

41
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,430
for both Missy and I.

42
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,690
So we've been kind of using this week

43
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,030
to reflect on all that.

44
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,310
I wanted to let you guys know

45
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,100
that the family does have a GoFundMe page.

46
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,390
I'm gonna link it down
below if you guys, you know,

47
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,080
feel at all called to help
or donate or anything,

48
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,330
feel free to do that there.

49
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,370
We definitely wish that we

50
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,220
would have been able to meet little Henry.

51
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,090
He sounded like such an amazing little boy

52
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,090
and it would have been so fun

53
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,190
just to hang out with him
and sing our songs to him,

54
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,820
but that wasn't able
to happen and you know,

55
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,232
sometimes that's just
the way life works out.

56
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,440
We don't really get all the answers.

57
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,696
So anyway, I'm gonna
have their GoFundMe page

58
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:50,965
linked down below if you guys would like

59
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:52,549
to help along with us as well.

60
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:53,862
But for now, I'm just waiting for Missy

61
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,298
to get back from the ranch,

62
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,568
so that we can have a
fun Friday with the boys.

63
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:59,522
- Good morning guys!

64
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:01,639
Good morning my puppies!

65
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:03,200
Each of my puppies are here.

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,990
As soon as I say hi to them
they just like jump up.

67
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,170
Good morning, Ollie.

68
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,350
- Good morning.

69
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,301
- Mornin'

70
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,134
(Finn babbles)

71
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:12,560
We are actually eating lunch right now.

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,660
The boys are having some
peanut butter and jelly's,

73
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,710
and I actually just got
back about an hour ago,

74
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,410
I got back from riding Nacho.

75
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,243
Not for the first time,

76
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,640
I did ride him when I was
looking to purchase him,

77
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,580
but the first time as him
being mine, and it was awesome.

78
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,190
I didn't bring the camera
'cause I just wanted to

79
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,620
really focus on him and it
did take a while to kind of,

80
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,490
you know, get my saddle all figured out,

81
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,727
'cause it's brand new and I've never done

82
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:40,350
this kind of a saddle
and style just 'cause

83
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,250
there's some new like technologies on it,

84
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,320
'cause it's kind of a fancy
little saddle I guess.

85
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,970
I had so much fun,

86
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,740
I just kind of rode around in the arena

87
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,330
and it was really good.

88
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,740
He's so awesome, like
he just really, really

89
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,700
listens to me as a beginner,

90
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,670
like slows down if he notices that

91
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,270
I'm a little wobbly or unbalanced,

92
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,470
and he was just like so, so awesome.

93
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,560
So patient with me, even
saddling him, oh my gosh,

94
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,070
it took us forever to figure
it out, and he was so patient.

95
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,510
Oh, I just love him!

96
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,560
So yeah, it was a really,
really awesome little time

97
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,580
and I'm excited to go back.

98
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,290
Probably a little later with the boys,

99
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,860
'cause they really wanna see Nacho, huh?

100
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,693
- Yeah.

101
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,927
- [Missy] You wanna see Nacho?

102
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:21,249
(laughs) Hopefully soon
you get to ride him, okay?

103
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:22,082
- Okay.

104
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:23,660
- I've been looking at
all kinds of fun stuff

105
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,440
that I can get like the
little buddy saddle,

106
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,690
so Ollie can sit behind
me while I'm riding.

107
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,240
That would be so fun, huh?

108
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,240
- Yeah. I also wanna go in the tree house.

109
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,879
- Oh yeah they have a
tree house at the house.

110
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,712
- And the trampoline.

111
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:37,840
- And a trampoline, he really
wants to go back and do that.

112
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,320
It was just an awesome
trip and I'm excited.

113
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,579
It's been a fun day, so I actually haven't

114
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,490
been feeling the best
today, so I've been kind of

115
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,910
laying low, and I even have sweats on now,

116
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,920
but I'm hoping that with
a little bit of medicine,

117
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,870
I'll feel a little bit better

118
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,324
and we can head back up
there in a little while.

119
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:55,160
(Finn babbles)

120
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,872
And play. Sound good?

121
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,004
- Yeah.

122
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,710
I've actually been
sitting here with the boys

123
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,730
and we've been talking
about all the horse rules

124
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,410
and how to stay safe around the horse

125
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,320
'cause with little kids
it is very nerve-wracking

126
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,817
and they are a little bit crazy.

127
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,530
I've just been going
over some of the rules

128
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,620
so I thought I'd let them say,

129
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,660
what is the number one rule, Ollie?

130
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,070
- The one about you
can't go around the back.

131
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,840
- [Missy] Okay. So you can't
go around the back because...

132
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,927
- It'll kick you.

133
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,163
- [Missy] Good.

134
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:27,550
(laughs)

135
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,780
Is that right, Finn?

136
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,534
Alright, I'm gonna let
you finish eating, okay?

137
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:31,367
- Yep.

138
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,350
- Alright you guys so
there has been a present

139
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,450
that we've been wanting to
get the boys for a while now.

140
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,610
We first planned this present when it was

141
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,510
Finn's birthday in October, and we said,

142
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,210
"You know what? We're gonna get them this.

143
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,330
They really enjoy things like this.

144
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,200
We think they'll really
enjoy it for the party."

145
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,240
It never showed up. It never
came, it was never delivered.

146
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,250
It just got stuck.

147
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,120
They ended up canceling my
order and I was like "Ugh."

148
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,130
So then Christmas rolls
around and I'm like

149
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,420
"You know what, this is
my chance. Redeem myself.

150
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,800
Let's get the boys an
awesome Christmas present.

151
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
They'll like it as a Christmas
present, it doesn't matter."

152
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,730
I order it, plenty of time in advance.

153
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,480
Still doesn't come in time, you guys.

154
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,270
Still does not come in time.

155
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,180
Then I get it-- (laughs)
and it's missing parts.

156
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,210
I'm missing like four parts.

157
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,500
I have to call the
company, order more parts,

158
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,540
they sent them to me.

159
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,690
Finally we get it done.

160
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,530
So now we have a combination
birthday, Christmas present

161
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,830
that is ready for the
boys to finally open.

162
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,663
It's here.

163
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:26,200
It is finished.

164
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,459
Alright boys, Happy Birthday!

165
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,292
- Happy Birthday!

166
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:31,405
- Oh, Merry Christmas!

167
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:32,238
- Merry Christmas!

168
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,540
- Well what is it? Is it your
birthday? Or is it Christmas?

169
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,590
- No it's not Christmas or my birthday.

170
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,061
- It's not either but you know what, boys?

171
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:41,894
- [Both] What?

172
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,485
- Mommy and Daddy have a present for you.

173
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:44,440
- You got a present?

174
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,840
- Yeah, come here!

175
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,130
We wanted to surprise you guys

176
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,710
with something really,

177
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,124

00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:51,957
- Okay.

179
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,381
- Okay, you guys wanna go see what it is?

180
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:54,214
- [Both] Yeah!

181
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:55,047
- Okay. You excited?

182
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,342
- Yeah.

183
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:58,925
(upbeat music)

184
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,230
Alright, come on out boys!

185
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,217
Come on out!

186
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:20,080
(screams)

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,660
Whoa it's a giant present!

188
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,670
Rip it open!

189
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,240
Come here, Finn, rip it open!

190
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:29,300
(laughs)

191
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,050
Tear it off, Ollie!

192
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,664
Tear it!

193
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:34,128
(paper ripping)

194
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,231
Get it, Finn, get it!

195
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,314
Get it, Finn!

196
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,042
Go, go, go, go, go!

197
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:39,875
Whoa!

198
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:43,260
(laughs)

199
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,952
What is it, Ollie?

200
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:46,514
- Wow!

201
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:48,030
A volcano!

202
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,235
- [Bryan] It is kind of
like a big volcano, huh?

203
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,480
- It's got a trampoline!

204
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,511
- [Bryan] That is so cool!

205
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,344
(laughs)

206
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:55,327
You guys wanna know what it is?

207
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:56,160
- [Ollie] What?

208
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,545
- It's a rock climber.

209
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:58,378
- Rock climber?

210
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:00,640
- [Bryan] Yes, so it has all
different types of climbing

211
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,720
on every single side of it.

212
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,940
Over here there's some ropes,

213
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,610
some handhelds, and guess what?

214
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,870
- [Ollie] What?
- You guys can make it a game.

215
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,100
The first kid to the top of the volcano,

216
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,374
you grab this flag, and
then you're the winner.

217
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:17,487
You guys wanna play capture the flag?

218
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,720
- [Ollie] Yeah.
- [Bryan] Yeah?

219
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,140
- Alright boys, as soon
as Mommy says "Go!"

220
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,240
You have to race to the
top as fast as possible

221
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,780
and capture the flag, okay?

222
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,613
- Okay.

223
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,650
- [Missy] On your mark, get set, go!

224
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,828
(suspenseful music)

225
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,050
- [Bryan] Whoa!

226
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,910
Ollie!

227
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,010
You are a good climber!

228
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,035
Oh, Finn, look at you buddy!
- [Missy] Look at you!

229
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:38,680
(Bryan yelling)

230
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,850
- [Bryan] And he's the winner!

231
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,710
Good job!

232
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,100
Pound it, bro!

233
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,953
Hey Finn, you did such
a good job, pound it!

234
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,390
Pound it!

235
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,380
(laughs)

236
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,816
Ollie already got the flag, buddy.

237
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:53,102
Get it, Finn, yay!

238
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:55,370
(Missy yelling!)
- [Ollie] Yay!

239
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,240
- [Bryan] This is the
coolest climber ever.

240
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,280
It seriously is like a little volcano.

241
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,165
I think it was when we
took Ollie rock climbing

242
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,650
that one day he loved
it so much, I was like,

243
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,020
"We gotta get them a good climber."

244
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,950
So now you can climb all
the way to the top, Ollie.

245
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,120
Here, try on this side.

246
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,670
Come on this side right
here and try to climb up.

247
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,780
Go Finn, go!

248
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,320
See, you guys can be creative
and find your own way

249
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,083
to the top of the mountain, huh?

250
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,650
- [Ollie] Yeah.
- [Bryan] Yeah.

251
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,920
And then you guys could even
like, hang out up here, huh?

252
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,580
- [Missy] And you can
even play under here.

253
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,515
(Finn babbling)

254
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:24,790
- [Bryan] Yeah, and there's a really cool

255
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,450
play area all under here.

256
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,710
Finn or Ollie can have the top and then

257
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,270
the other one can have the bottom.

258
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,270
So what do you guys think?

259
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,644
Is this a good Birthday
slash Christmas present?

260
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:36,089
- [Both] Yeah!
(Missy laughs)

261
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:38,590
- [Ollie] Thank you Mommy and Daddy.

262
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,409
- [Bryan] You're welcome, Ollie!

263
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,079
- [Ollie] And Finn.
- [Bryan] And Finn.

264
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,404
We love you guys.

265
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:44,690
(Missy kisses Finn)

266
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,290
Have fun, okay?
- [Ollie] Okay.

267
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,849
- [Bryan] Whoa, that's kind of cool, huh?

268
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:49,682
- Yeah.

269
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,043
- [Bryan] It's like your own little fort.

270
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:53,626
(upbeat music)

271
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,736
- It is such a beautiful
day today, you guys.

272
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:35,090
You know how yesterday I was like

273
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,480
"It's kind of chilly,
it's like 50 degrees."

274
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,540
It's gotta be like 80 degrees today.

275
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,320
I actually had to put these down and then

276
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,260
we moved the little play
thing into the shade

277
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,870
'cause we're like "It's so hot."

278
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,930
It feels good in the shade,

279
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,720
but it's definitely a warm day today,

280
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,260
which also makes it harder when

281
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,456
you wanna like ride horses and stuff.

282
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:55,039
(Finn babbles)

283
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,751
Finn's playing over there.

284
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,594
Ollie's having a blast.

285
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,450
They're both just having a great time,

286
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,370
and I'm just sitting here
enjoying the weather.

287
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,160
I just went and checked on my chickens

288
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,510
and they're doing good.

289
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,088
Got four eggs, so that's pretty nice.

290
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:12,317
(soft electronic music)

291
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:16,030
- [Bryan] How are our fishies doing today?

292
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,370
Look at their nice, beautiful,
(dog barks) clean tank.

293
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,500
Karma!

294
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,110
Karma you're gonna scare the
fish with your barking, okay?

295
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,240
Just say hi.

296
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,430
Our fish have been doing so amazing and

297
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,660
I don't know if you guys can really tell,

298
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,090
but they're getting bigger,

299
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,140
and our coral is getting bigger too.

300
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,870
Look at that one, that
one is doing so good.

301
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,040
Oh, and there's Pearl.

302
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,390
She's our designer clown fish that we got

303
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,223
when we first started.

304
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:39,210
Ella always looking at dudes like,

305
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,240
"Hey pay attention to me, please."

306
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,830
Look how big she is though!

307
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,620
She's like, double in size, it's crazy.

308
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,490
So yes, our fish are doing very well.

309
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,330
- [Missy] Alright, Finn got a little owie,

310
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,240
so Ollie is helping him
make, help him feel better.

311
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,890
You checking his heart?

312
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,850
Does it sound good?

313
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:00,162
Is that better?

314
00:11:00,162 --> 00:11:00,995
- Yeah.

315
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:02,320
- [Missy] Yeah?

316
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,915
Oh he's gotta check one more thing, baby.

317
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,498
(mellow music)

318
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,380
- Blood pressure.

319
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,240
- [Missy] Okay, he's gotta
check his blood pressure.

320
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,323
(laughs)

321
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,380
How's it look?

322
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,000
- Looks goo, great.

323
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,833
- Ollie has been so cute.

324
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,010
Finn has been really
sad for like 15 minutes

325
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,764
and so Ollie was like officially-

326
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,820
- I need this flashlight.

327
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,410
- Well it's not good to
point that into his eyes.

328
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,900
I know that's sometimes what doctors do,

329
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,410
but you can check his mouth.

330
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,460
Say "Aah."

331
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,210
How's it look?

332
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,740
- Good.

333
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,340
- [Missy] Alright, so
now what do you think?

334
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,560
What's your diagnosis?

335
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,610
But what's your diagnosis?

336
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,330
He just needs a Band-Aid?

337
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,163
- Yeah.

338
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:43,290
- [Missy] And you already
gave him a little medicine?

339
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,123
- Yeah.

340
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:45,133
- [Missy] Are you feeling better, Finn?

341
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:45,966
- Yeah.

342
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,610
- [Missy] Yeah, okay let's
get you your Band-Aid.

343
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:50,749
- It's gonna be okay, Finn.

344
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:51,866
- Okay.

345
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:53,040
(Missy laughs)

346
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,500
- You have a sweet big brother, huh?

347
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,394
- I've got a surprise for you.

348
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:58,977
It's a surprise grass scorpion.

349
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,437
(Missy gasps)

350
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,803
- [Missy] Is he giving you the scorpion?

351
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:05,420
- Yeah, it's for him because he likes it.

352
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,620
- [Missy] Alright, Ollie really wants to

353
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,120
put his Band-Aid on, it's
on the back of his heel.

354
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,318
Looks good, that feel better?

355
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:14,151
- Yeah.

356
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,444
- [Missy] Okay, you want
a hug from Momma, too?

357
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,277
- Yeah.

358
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:18,110

359
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,020
- [Bryan] Alright the boys are
coming outside one last time

360
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,780
'cause they love this thing so much.

361
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,250
It's kind of been amazing.

362
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,230
It's been preoccupying
them for much of the day.

363
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,060
Which is always fun
and they're just having

364
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,710
so much fun playing on it.

365
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,582
You guys like it?

366
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:33,415

367
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:34,470
- [Bryan] Okay.
- Thank you.

368
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,570
- [Bryan] You're welcome.

369
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,100
They're so cute about it too.

370
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,030
But anyway, I think that's
all for today's vlog.

371
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,520
We're gonna put these kiddos to bed.
