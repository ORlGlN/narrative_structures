13
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:25,042
- Good morning, guys.

14
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:28,092
I've had a really, really crazy morning.

15
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:29,198
I was actually planning

16
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:30,684
to go up to my horse,

17
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:31,652
because he needs a little medicine today,

18
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:33,718
take Ollie to school, and
I'm actually also headed

19
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:35,733
all the way an hour and a half

20
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,596
to a doctor's appointment for Finn,

21
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:39,793
which I'll tell you more
about in a little bit,

22
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:42,980
but I basically did not
have time for anything

23
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,344
and I forgot my camera,
so I'm using my phone

24
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,565
right now to vlog.

25
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:47,749
Ugh, I'm so bummed.

26
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:50,249
So my dad ends up taking Ollie

27
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,158
to school and then he's taking,

28
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:55,664
he's actually gonna take care of my horse

29
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,434
and give him his medicine,

30
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,702
which I'm super bummed
that I'm not able to do,

31
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:01,603
but, yes, I am off to a quick

32
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,209
little doctor's appointment.

33
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:04,628
Well, it's not quick.

34
00:01:04,628 --> 00:01:05,461
It's gonna take me a while,

35
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:06,294
and I got my mom with me.

36
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:07,139
I totally forgot my camera.

37
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:08,972
I forgot my camera, Mom. (laughs)

38
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:09,890
- Such a nube.

39
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,138
- [Missy] I know.

40
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,371
We're driving to San Diego, Finn.

41
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,358
- Yeah!

42
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:14,191
- [Missy] You ready for the drive?

43
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,024
- Yeah!

44
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:15,950
- Yeah!

45
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,410
All right, we have made it

46
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,566
to Rady's Children's Hospital,

47
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,201
which is down in San Diego

48
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:25,614
because Finn has a little
doctor's appointment, huh?

49
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:26,492
- Yeah.

50
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:27,638
- Are you gonna be good for the doctor?

51
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:28,694
- Yeah.

52
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:30,122
- So if you guys don't
know, he's had a couple

53
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:32,323
little issues since he was born.

54
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:35,195
One is a slightly enlarged kidney,

55
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,576
and he hasn't had an ultrasound for this

56
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:38,679
in maybe a year?

57
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,205
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe a year.

58
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:41,365
- He goes for it like once a year now.

59
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:42,931
- Yeah, really, really interested to see

60
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:43,863
if it's cleared up yet.

61
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:45,785
It usually clears up at a young age,

62
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:48,095
but if it doesn't, he
could end up having surgery

63
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:49,845
if it gets worse or--

64
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,039
I don't even know, if
it stays where it is,

65
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,034
I don't know if they'll--

66
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:54,957
- If he's not having
issues, they just watch it.

67
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:56,721
- Yeah, but it is annoying,

68
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:57,731
because when they have to watch it,

69
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,384
you have to literally come down here

70
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:02,512
to get these ultrasounds, and not fun

71
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:03,348
as they get older.

72
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:04,199
- Yeah.

73
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,589
- I don't know how you're gonna do today.

74
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:09,550
And then he also actually a little heart

75
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,299
issue that we have to keep an eye on too.

76
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,744
But today is just about his kidneys,

77
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:16,484
so we're gonna go see the urologist

78
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,726
and do an ultrasound on his kidney

79
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,886
and see if it's enlarged or anything.

80
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:21,860
- Yeah.

81
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,818
- I hope it's all better.

82
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:23,720
- Yeah.

83
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,742
- He hasn't had any issues with it.

84
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:26,248
He hasn't had any UTIs.

85
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:27,972
When he was first born,
he had a UTI, right?

86
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,580
- [Mimi] Early on, like, yeah.

87
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,002
- Like super, super early, he had a UTI.

88
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:35,516
He hasn't had any issues,
so I hope it's all better.

89
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:37,394
It is really scary coming
to the hospital, though,

90
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:40,320
because I feel like
hospital is full of people

91
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,721
with the flu, and I
really don't want anyone

92
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:45,405
to get the flu, so let's
keep you nice and safe, 'kay?

93
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:50,238
I got my baby carrier so I can
not let him touch anything.

94
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,348
Finny, are you getting nervous?

95
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:55,181
- Yeah.

96
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,014
- Don't be nervous.

97
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:57,597
It's gonna so fine, huh?

98
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:58,430
- Yeah.

99
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,619
- Yeah. (laughs)

100
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:04,202
(upbeat music)

101
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:22,318
I'm home!

102
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,656
And I have my camera again.

103
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,279
Uh, it's so hard vlogging

104
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,692
with a phone, you guys.

105
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:30,841
I am home and Ollie's home, oh,

106
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:31,679
I was gonna show Ollie.

107
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,512
Ollie, hi.

108
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:34,196
- Hi.

109
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:35,038
- [Missy] How was school?

110
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:35,871
- Good.

111
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:36,779
- [Missy] Are you watching Coco?

112
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:37,612
- [Ollie] Yeah.

113
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:39,237
- [Missy] You had a good
day at school, though?

114
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:40,245
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:41,098
- Good.

116
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:43,258
He's home and Finn is taking a nap.

117
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:44,920
Bryan has been working all day,

118
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,619
so that's why you guys
haven't really seen him much.

119
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,434
My mom and dad are here and
my sister's coming over,

120
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:50,225
but I have to go run up

121
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:51,275
and see my horse.

122
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:52,348
I need to see how he's doing,

123
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:53,881
make sure he's okay.

124
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:55,256
I'm really excited to see Nacho.

125
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:56,524
I miss him.

126
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,692
I mean, I saw him yesterday, but (laughs)

127
00:03:58,692 --> 00:03:59,610
I do miss him.

128
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,746
You gonna hang out here for a little bit

129
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:01,851
while I go check on Nacho?

130
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:02,684
- Yeah.

131
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:03,537
- Okay, be good.

132
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:04,881
All right, I've got Nacho out

133
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:07,213
and I've just been kinda cleaning him up

134
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,482
and looking him over.

135
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,364
I've got him saddled right now

136
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,183
and an English saddle.

137
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,450
I have been riding English
the past couple days.

138
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,546
I think that he prefers English,

139
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,798
but I'm actually just going to lunge him

140
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,201
to see how his foot is.

141
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:19,957
But I was telling you guys,

142
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,362
he has these hives on him,

143
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,265
and he still has them,

144
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:24,275
even after my dad gave him medicine.

145
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,350
I can show you.

146
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,143
See those little lumps right there?

147
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:27,976
Poor bud.

148
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,692
So the vet should be here tomorrow

149
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:31,689
to take a look, and hopefully

150
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,945
it's nothing too bad, huh?

151
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm actually using a
different bridle right now

152
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,343
because I'm gonna lunge him

153
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,841
and my other bridle just doesn't really

154
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:39,778
give me that option very easily.

155
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:40,978
And yeah, I'm using a saddle,

156
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,408
I'm just borrowing it right now

157
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,144
to see if I wanna actually
make the investment

158
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:47,394
into my own English saddle.

159
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,992
'Cause he definitely prefers English,

160
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:51,612
and I'm just not 100% sure

161
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:55,172
that his Western saddle
is fitting properly,

162
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,242
so I just don't wanna risk it.

163
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:57,576
Let's go give you a little exercise

164
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:00,159
and see how you're doing, 'kay?

165
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:02,707
(laughs)

166
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:03,921
All right, so I just lunged him

167
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,636
and he's looking pretty good.

168
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:06,763
He is still definitely off

169
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:09,363
when I lunge him like one side,

170
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:10,997
so, like I said, the vet's coming.

171
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:12,283
I'm giving him a little ride

172
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:13,775
just to see how he's doing.

173
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:15,558
They actually have these jumps out.

174
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,717
He keeps looking at them
like, "I wanna jump that."

175
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,040
(laughs)

176
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,578
He actually has tried a couple times

177
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:22,563
to line himself up, and I'm just not

178
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:24,505
there yet to jump him,

179
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:26,488
but I think he would be
super fun to jump eventually,

180
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:29,674
but he looks at them
like, "Hmm, I wanna jump

181
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,605
"over that thing," so I do
know he's actually jumped

182
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,272
over, I think, up to three feet.

183
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:38,085
I think it was like either two foot six

184
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,943
or something, but I think
he's done pretty good,

185
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:43,171
so he would be really fun,
eventually, to do that.

186
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:45,267
But first, I gotta get an
actual lesson in English.

187
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:46,683
I'll show you guys a little bit

188
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:48,706
of my English riding,
but have not even had

189
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:49,636
a single lesson in it.

190
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:50,842
I'm gonna start, hopefully, next week

191
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:51,959
if he's feeling better.

192
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,122
But I've just gotten tips and tricks

193
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:55,333
and kinda people saying what to do

194
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,237
and of course reading up on it.

195
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,245
I haven't done any lessons on it,

196
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:00,680
so I'll show you guys what I can do

197
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,097
in English style.

198
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,365
You guys can critique me
and tell me everything

199
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,198
I'm doing wrong.

200
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,004
Let's give it a try.

201
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:10,504
(piano music)

202
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:30,581
Good trotting.

203
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:32,839
We are still working on it,

204
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,476
still practicing, huh?

205
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,611
All right, bye Nacho!

206
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:37,444
See ya later!

207
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,540
Goodbye. (laughs)

208
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,641
Oh, hello, ladies.

209
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,141
How are you doin'?

210
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,058
As you can see, Pam has integrated

211
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:48,967
back into the group pretty dang well.

212
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,066
If you guys don't know, a few vlogs back,

213
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:51,793
she had a little owie on her head

214
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:52,903
and we just treated it

215
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:55,398
and it's actually looking
very good, very healed.

216
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:57,982
It hasn't gotten infected, so,

217
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,148
we are good to go.

218
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:00,500
Hoping to just maybe get some hair back

219
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,254
on her poor little head.

220
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,947
Chickens are pretty happy, huh?

221
00:07:03,947 --> 00:07:05,397
You guys wanna come out for a little bit?

222
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:07,534
Come out and get some fresh air,

223
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:11,609
fresh grain, fresh grass while you can.

224
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:14,420
We just gotta watch them around Luna,

225
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,493
'cause Luna can be a little crazy.

226
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:17,639
Come on, girls.

227
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,222
(gentle music)

228
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,398
- What up, you guys?

229
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:36,779
Today I wanted to introduce you

230
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:37,992
to a friend of mine.

231
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:38,930
This is actually Dallas.

232
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,245
He's a good buddy of mine.

233
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:41,432
Sometimes we work together.

234
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:44,133
And today we're going
on a little man date,

235
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,863
so we're going to eat sushi for lunch.

236
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:46,722
- Man date!

237
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:49,003
- [Bryan] Man date in his new ride!

238
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:50,680
Check this out, you guys.

239
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,228
So what is it, Dallas?

240
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:55,728
- It's a 1964 convertible Pontiac Tempest.

241
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:58,619
- [Bryan] And it's beautiful.

242
00:07:58,619 --> 00:07:59,709
- Gorgeous.

243
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:02,545
- And we just YouTubed
how to take the top down,

244
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:05,026
because we had no idea how
to figure it out, yeah.

245
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,203
- Because we're dumb kids.

246
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:07,968
- [Bryan] Basically,
all right, so let's take

247
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:08,801
this top down.

248
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:11,588
Let's show the kids at
home how this works.

249
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:12,477
- Yes.

250
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:14,644
- [Bryan] In the old days.

251
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:18,795
A button?

252
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,416
- Original leather interior.

253
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,704
- Look at this, this is so cool.

254
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,287
Yeah, all original.

255
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:27,579
This is really dope, so we're gonna hop

256
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:29,051
in the convertible and go get some sushi.

257
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,801
(exciting music)

258
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,301
Bro, you got some
hardware in here. (laughs)

259
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,431
- The old club, dude.

260
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:41,058
- [Bryan] Can't have
anyone stealing your ride.

261
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:41,890
- [Dallas] No.

262
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,641
- [Bryan] The key is on the left?

263
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
- What is this, Britain?

264
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:50,848
- [Bryan] Look at this, kids.

265
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,595
You gotta crank that window down.

266
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,166
You gotta work for it.

267
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,156
- By the end of this, our
forearms are gonna be huge.

268
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:56,156
- Basically.

269
00:08:57,315 --> 00:08:58,720
Dang, dude, like buttah.

270
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,095
Let's do this.

271
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,558
This is literally an
airplane seatbelt, you guys.

272
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,171
Actually, the seatbelts on the airplane

273
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,303
might be safer, Dallas.

274
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:07,363
- No doubt they're safer.

275
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,625
That's what I love about this, though.

276
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,650
It says park.

277
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,733
- [Bryan] Oh.

278
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,766
We haven't even left
the house and it's like,

279
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,099
this is so cool.

280
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,346
- It's so rad!

281
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:20,096
(exciting music)

282
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,285
- [Bryan] On a scale of one to ten,

283
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,118
how happy are you right now?

284
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,460
- Eight point five.

285
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,433
- [Bryan] Yeah, yeah.

286
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,363
- Only point five because
I'm scared it's gonna

287
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,629
die out on us again.

288
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:44,724
- We had a little bit of trouble.

289
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:45,939
- [Dallas] Yeah.

290
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:46,938
- When we made the turn onto the road,

291
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:47,789
but we're good.

292
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:48,645
Now we're crusin' along.

293
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:50,105
This is seriously really cool.

294
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:52,155
I don't think I've ever
driven in a car like this.

295
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:53,800
This is rad, thanks dude.

296
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,043
- I've never driven a car like this.

297
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:57,527
- [Bryan] This is yours!

298
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:58,581
This is your baby now!

299
00:09:58,581 --> 00:09:59,740
- [Dallas] It's my car now.

300
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,323
(gentle music)

301
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:06,652
- [Bryan] Sweet ride, bro.

302
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:08,856
- I love it.

303
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,777
- [Bryan] All right,
Missy got long hair today.

304
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:18,924
- Yeah, what do you think?

305
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:21,055
- [Bryan] It's really beautiful.

306
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,527
- And it actually, look at this,

307
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:24,688
this is a high pony.

308
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:26,538
You can't see anything.

309
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,052
- [Bryan] Yeah.

310
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:30,506
- Like a low pony, it's really good.

311
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,893
I'm gonna take it off and how fast it is

312
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,799
to put it back in.

313
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,192
Okay, so it's like a
little tiny fishing line.

314
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,254
Okay, ready?

315
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:38,225
- [Bryan] Mm-hmm.

316
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:40,392
- I'm gonna get a haircut.

317
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,443
(Bryan laughs)

318
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:43,540
- [Bryan] Wow.

319
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,795
- So this is what it looks like.

320
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:47,367
- [Bryan] That is so funny.

321
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,394
- Yeah, and so you can see
this little fishing line.

322
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:50,811
It basically just

323
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,458
sits like this, but underneath my hair.

324
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,440
- [Bryan] Yeah, yeah.

325
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,776
- Makes it all long and like the color,

326
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:58,359
which is perfectly.

327
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,166
- [Bryan] That's awesome.

328
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,607
- I think I should just keep it like this,

329
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:03,686
'cause then I don't have to do anything.

330
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:04,917
(Bryan laughs)

331
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,723
- [Bryan] That's awesome,
babe, I'm happy for you.

332
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:08,556
That's cool.

333
00:11:08,556 --> 00:11:09,994
Alexa, good night.

334
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:11,888
- [Alexa] Nighty-night.

335
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,013
Get some good rest.

336
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:14,330
(screams)

337
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,927
(laughs)

338
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,232
- Oh, hi, Finn.

339
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:19,324
Oh, hi, Ollie and Finn.

340
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:20,867
Hey, did you guys have fun today?

341
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,069
- Yeah.

342
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:25,011
- Finn, I am so proud of how well you did

343
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:26,100
at the hospital today.

344
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,933
- 'kay.

345
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,248
- You were such a good boy.

346
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:30,571
You did everything they needed to, huh?

347
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:31,404
- Yeah.

348
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:34,995
- But anyway, I think that
is all for today's video.

349
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,792
If you guys enjoyed it, be sure to give it

350
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,125
a big thumbs-up.

351
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:41,547
Thumbs-up, thumbs-up!

352
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:45,529
Thanks for watching, we'll see ya mañana.

353
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:46,460
Oh, Ollie, do you wanna
ask 'em a question?

354
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,751
- Yeah.

355
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:48,913
- To leave in the comments below?

356
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:51,748
Okay, what question do you wanna ask them?

357
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:53,676
- What did you eat for dinner tonight?

358
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:54,509
- That's what you wanna ask 'em?

359
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:55,369
- Yeah.

360
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:56,920
- Okay, let us know what
you guys ate for dinner

361
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,474
down below in the comments

362
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:02,427
and anyone who needs dinner
