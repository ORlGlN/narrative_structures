1
00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:01,971
- Ollie, should we tell them the big news?

2
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:02,812
- Yeah!

3
00:00:02,812 --> 00:00:03,764
- Yeah!

4
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:06,657
- All right, I think we're
going to tell you the big news.

5
00:00:06,657 --> 00:00:07,907
- We're moving!

6
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:10,731
♫ This is our life

7
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:11,972
♫ This is our fun

8
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:14,394
♫ This is who we are

9
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:15,491
♫ This is our dream

10
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:16,716
♫ This is our team

11
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,249
♫ Shot among the stars

12
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:20,372
♫ Take this shield

13
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:21,636
♫ And we'll be fine

14
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:22,670
♫ Take this hand

15
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,493
♫ And watch us shine

16
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:26,205
♫ This is our life

17
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,059
♫ Let's live it

18
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,134
♫ Live it forever

19
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:31,384
- Good morning!

20
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:33,935
- Good morning.

21
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:34,897
- Good morning guys.

22
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:37,064
We are up quite early today.

23
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:38,665
Well, I wouldn't say up any earlier,

24
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:41,475
but we have left a lot earlier today,

25
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,281
because today is a very special day,

26
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:45,377
and I don't think Ollie
even really knows why,

27
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:46,786
but it's a couple reasons.

28
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:48,313
One, it's a school day.

29
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:49,289
So that's always good.

30
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,151
Next, it's share day,
and the letter is "B",

31
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,032
so what are you bringing to school

32
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:55,545
to share with your friends?

33
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:57,074
- Buzz Lightyear.

34
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:58,873
- Buzz Lightyear!

35
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:00,487
- And he has a laser.

36
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:02,475
- Yeah, and not just any Buzz Lightyear,

37
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:05,857
I went ahead and got the ones
down that we usually have

38
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,252
up as decoration,
because it's kind of like

39
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:10,532
a really nice one, and so
I thought that would be

40
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:12,144
fun to show his friends and share.

41
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:14,715
The other reason it is an exciting day,

42
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:17,566
is because today at his school,

43
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:21,566
they're celebrating everyone's
birthday, including yours.

44
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:24,486
They're going to have like a
little birthday celebration

45
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:26,672
at school for all the kids.

46
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:30,197
My job is to bring mini cupcakes,

47
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:31,712
and I went to the store yesterday,

48
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:33,013
and I forgot the mini cupcakes,

49
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:34,673
so now I have to leave extra early,

50
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:36,959
go to the store, get those mini cupcakes.

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,150
So, we're going to go get cupcakes,

52
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,134
and then head to school,
and then they're going have

53
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,255
their little birthday celebration.

54
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:45,006
I'm excited for you. (laughs)

55
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,368
All right, we're headed into the store.

56
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:47,663
What kind of cupcakes do you want?

57
00:01:47,663 --> 00:01:49,134
- I want fire ones.

58
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:50,223
- Fire ones?

59
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:51,752
I don't know if they're selling fire ones.

60
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:53,502
I think I found them.

61
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:57,533
All right, so I ended up going
with win these mini ones,

62
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,280
because they seemed more mini,

63
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,608
but I only needed 12,
and 12 comes in this,

64
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:03,054
and I didn't want to get just one flavor,

65
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:05,475
so we got triple chocolate cupcakes,

66
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,826
and red velvet cupcakes.

67
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,536
All right, you got your Buzz?

68
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,819
Pretty excited to share him?

69
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,911
- Yeah.

70
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,408
- [Missy] Show me what this guy does.

71
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,712
(Buzz makes laser sounds)

72
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:16,625
His little head moves.

73
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,704
Pretty cool, huh?

74
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,738
- Buzz Lightyear,
reporting for sector duty.

75
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:21,082
- Oh my goodness!

76
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:24,136
So I officially feel so silly.

77
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:26,464
I spent all morning
getting these cupcakes,

78
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:28,057
and the party isn't until next week.

79
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:31,559
So, yeah, now I've got 24 cupcakes.

80
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,883
Hopefully they'll last until next week,

81
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:34,095
or maybe I'll have to buy some more,

82
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:35,739
but I did want to tell
you guys this cute story.

83
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,109
I just dropped off Ollie,

84
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:40,463
and his teacher was so
excited to pull me over

85
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:43,440
and show me this picture
that she took of Ollie.

86
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,094
I think I can show you guys it right here.

87
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:48,597
She goes, "He was so excited to show me

88
00:02:48,597 --> 00:02:51,854
"that he drew an H," and she was like,

89
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:55,079
"I can't believe he actually drew an H."

90
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:59,366
I don't think most preschoolers
are just drawing H's.

91
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:02,242
And then the little boy
next to him saw Ollie do it,

92
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:04,062
and so that little boy did it too,

93
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:05,902
and he was so proud of himself,

94
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:09,735
and she was so proud of him,
and I'm just like, "Oh!"

95
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:12,740
He actually drew an H the
other night at the restaurant,

96
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,073
and I posted it on my
Insta-Story, and I was like,

97
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:16,019
"Oh my gosh."

98
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,555
He didn't do it on accident.

99
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,169
He's like, "Look Mama, I made an H."

100
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,893
And I was like, "Oh my gosh, you did."

101
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:22,147
It's just pretty cool.

102
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:24,418
It's really fun to see
him going to preschool,

103
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:25,450
is actually like...

104
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,932
Things are clicking. I don't know.

105
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,330
I think he's actually going
to learn things in preschool,

106
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,600
which, I just always
thought preschool was like,

107
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,978
more fun, and kind of get them
into the routine of things,

108
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:36,297
I didn't really think of it
as like, "Oh, he's going to

109
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:38,779
learn like, things," and he really is,

110
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:40,307
so it's really, really cool,

111
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:41,591
and I'm just really proud of him.

112
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:44,313
Anyways, I'm now off to Kelse's house.

113
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:45,857
I think we're going to
do a little workout,

114
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:47,997
and then we have not a...

115
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,565
We actually have a pretty nice day.

116
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:50,661
I don't think it will be super busy,

117
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:51,852
so I'm going to go do that.

118
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:55,627
I'm home with my other little baby boy.

119
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:56,972
How are you this morning?

120
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:58,116
- Oh, Mama.

121
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,139
- Yeah, Mama.

122
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,347
I've gotta be honest.

123
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:03,812
I have been loving taking
Ollie to school in the morning,

124
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:06,082
and spending that time with him and stuff,

125
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:08,268
and then coming home and
getting to spend like,

126
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:09,876
one-on-one time with Finn.

127
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:13,611
It's just been really, really
neat, and pretty cool huh?

128
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,085
You get time with Mama?

129
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:15,918
- Yeah.

130
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:16,844
- Yeah. (laughs)

131
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:18,481
But I think me and him
are actually going to go

132
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:21,884
in the hot tub, because
my body is so sore,

133
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:23,694
I'm just like, "Ow, ow, ow!"

134
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,177
It hurts so bad.

135
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:28,292
It is a chilly, chilly day today,

136
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,771
and we're all ready to go swim.

137
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,220
It's actually weird, oh it's sprinkling.

138
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,520
I mean, it's not...

139
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,781
It's misting, I guess you can say,

140
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:37,022
because I can see it on the water,

141
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:38,413
but it feels really nice.

142
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:39,558
And then check out over here.

143
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:40,691
We got this fixed.

144
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,958
I think Bryan showed this to
you guys yesterday, but, yay!

145
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,707
Looks like it's still drying.

146
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:48,663
Don't get paint on your foot.

147
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,922
Finn, you just look so
cute right there. (laughs)

148
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,285
I'm just watching him.

149
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:57,372
This hot tub just feels
so good on my muscles.

150
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:58,426
Oh, they hurt so bad.

151
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:00,411
We're just going to hang out
in here for a little bit,

152
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:03,324
then we're going to go get, actually,

153
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:04,677
you're going to go take a nap.

154
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:05,510
Sound good?

155
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,343
- Yeah.

156
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,176
- Yeah.

157
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:10,052
All right, me and Kelse are
off to get our hair done,

158
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:13,308
but first we're actually
picking Ollie up from school,

159
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:16,427
because Bryan is working
really hard trying to get

160
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:18,221
stuff done, and everyone else is busy,

161
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:22,315
so he has to be picked up,
and come to the salon with us.

162
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:24,054
- Yay! It's going to be so fun for him.

163
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:25,109
- He's going to love it.

164
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:27,021
He actually loves the salon, so he might,

165
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,037
actually, be excited.

166
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:28,870
- Oh, good.

167
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,081
- I'm excited to see him.

168
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,998
(upbeat pop music)

169
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,922
- Um, okay, I tried everything
to get this kid to wake up,

170
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,176
and he is so out.

171
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:39,372
- (Kelse laughs)

172
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:44,196
- So I guess I'll just
carry him to the car myself.

173
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:45,571
Look who's up!

174
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,586
You were sleeping so good at school, huh?

175
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:48,921
You got your Buzz?

176
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,603
Did everyone like your share toy?

177
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:51,539
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,443
- Did they all want to play with it too?

179
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:54,276
- Yeah.

180
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,914
- So I am going to get my hair
done at Michelle's new place,

181
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:59,515
which is actually the same
place that Ollie gets his

182
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:02,270
haircut done with Travis, huh?

183
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,901
So he walked in, he was so excited

184
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:08,382
because he gets to see Travis,
and he's just hanging out

185
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:11,101
on the couch with his
Buzz, happy as can be.

186
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:12,853
He hasn't even come to sit next to me.

187
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:14,869
He's like, "I'm just going
to sit next to Travis."

188
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,077
So, pretty cute.

189
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,150
Love you.

190
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,454
And this is such a cool salon.

191
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:21,717
Michelle works here now, too.

192
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:23,013
And it's so fun.

193
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:25,846
(deep dance beat)

194
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,334
- And we're done!

195
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,878
- Yay! Fresh hair.

196
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:30,711
- Yeah.

197
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:32,348
I went a little bit darker,

198
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,461
kinda just like, rich-ed
it up a little bit.

199
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,366
- [Kelse] It looks nice.

200
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,223
- Yeah, I feel like it just
makes it feels a little more

201
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:38,574
healthier, and look healthier,

202
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:41,990
so I'm happy, and Ollie was so good.

203
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,933
You were so good.

204
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:43,766
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:45,107
- You just played with your Buzz,

206
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:47,423
he didn't watch a movie,
he didn't make a peep.

207
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,582
He just loved the fact that he was there,

208
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:51,712
and Travis was there,
and he would just go over

209
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,030
and talk to him randomly.

210
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,070
It was so cute.

211
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,614
So I think now, we're going
to go get some ice cream

212
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:57,205
real quick, and then
we're going to head home.

213
00:06:57,205 --> 00:07:00,122
(bright pop music)

214
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,046
- Oh hey guys.

215
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:09,979
So I have been working all day,

216
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,774
and Missy and the boys just got home.

217
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:14,438
I'm looking for them.

218
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:15,467
What are they doin'?

219
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,325
You guys hanging out in my office?

220
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:18,158
- Yeah.

221
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:19,252
- We're watching this movie.

222
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:20,558
- [Bryan] What's the
movie you're watching?

223
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,933
- Secret Life of Pets.

224
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,190
- [Bryan] That's right.

225
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,262
Cool shirts, dude.

226
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:27,884
Can you show me?

227
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:28,859
- It's a dinosaur.

228
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,949
- [Bryan] Whoa, you've got
a dinosaur with a city!

229
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,789
And you've got Batman and Robin?

230
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,217
Finn is wearing a Lego
Batman shirt that Ollie was

231
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:36,998
originally wearing when he got home,

232
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,182
and he could not even cope,

233
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:39,806
so we had to put it on Finn, and look.

234
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,142
It actually kind of fits.

235
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:43,827
It's kind of like a dress, but yeah.

236
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:45,198
You boys are so cute.

237
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,060
Boys are home!

238
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,052
I've missed them.

239
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,469
I've missed you guys.

240
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,327
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:50,413
- [Bryan] Love you.

242
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:52,782
So we may actually have a
little surprise for you guys.

243
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:54,406
Ollie, should we tell them the big news?

244
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:55,526
- Yeah.

245
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:56,368
- Yeah!

246
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:59,225
- All right, I think we're
going to tell you the big news!

247
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:00,475
- We're moving!

248
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:03,487
- Ha!

249
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:05,512
Yes.

250
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:07,960
Well, as in, we're...

251
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,170
They are. (laughs)

252
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,975
- [Missy] I mean, it's moving day.

253
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:13,800
- It's moving day for the family.

254
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,568
- So yeah, we have had a
top-secret project going on.

255
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:19,985
My parents have moved, and it's so crazy.

256
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,331
I'm actually really excited about it.

257
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,750
They're going to have a lot more room,

258
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,184
so we can hang out more.

259
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:27,017
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:27,850
- Because the other house was just

261
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,544
a little bit more cramped,
and there really was

262
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:31,465
no room for the kids,
and they really wanted

263
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:34,634
a space that so that
the kids can come over

264
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:35,472
and spend the night--

265
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:36,852
- Look at how much room there is, though.

266
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:37,685
- [Missy] Yeah, look at this.

267
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:40,743
We're going to have to do
like, a full house tour soon.

268
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,977
It literally is moving day today.

269
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:44,848
- Today's the day.

270
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:46,656
- So they're unpacking.

271
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,783
I'm going to unpack some boxes,

272
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:49,952
and get everything set up.

273
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,282
I'm so excited, you guys.

274
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:52,614
This is crazy.

275
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:55,226
Look at this! (gasp)

276
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:56,904
Oh, and what's in here?

277
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,576
(gasp) Kids!

278
00:08:58,576 --> 00:08:59,829
- Aah!

279
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:02,494
- Finn's the police officer
and he got me in here.

280
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:04,944
- [Missy] Oh, is this
your guys's play room?

281
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:05,814
- Yeah!

282
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:07,153
- Yeah, it's so cool.

283
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:08,902
- This is literally a cupboard
under the stairs right now.

284
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,406
- [Missy] I know.

285
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,239
It's so cute.

286
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,502
I love it.

287
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,383
You get your own little play room.

288
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:16,014
- I'm actually tied up.

289
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,121
- [Missy] Oh, you are tied up.

290
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,551
- I seriously love these floors.

291
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:19,995
- [Missy] I know! This is my favorite.

292
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,336
- Can we do this in the house?

293
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,328
- I want this in our house for sure.

294
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,192
- That would be so fun.

295
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,135
- [Missy] So nice.

296
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:25,064
- [Bryan] Is this real wood?

297
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,422
- No, it's not.

298
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:27,571
- It looks so good.

299
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:30,008
- I know, it even has the grains.

300
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:30,841
It's really nice.

301
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:31,768
This house is so fun.

302
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:35,077
We're excited to make it a home, I guess.

303
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:38,025
But, super fun, and it's moving day

304
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,536
so we've got to start unpacking.

305
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,536
(subdued pop music)

306
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,006
- Let's go check out the upstairs.

307
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:49,183
So, what's really cool about up here is,

308
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:51,273
there's a fun little loft space,

309
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,974
which actually goes out
to a little balcony,

310
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:55,080
which is cool, but this
will be a cool place

311
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,953
for the kids to hang out as well.

312
00:09:56,953 --> 00:10:00,225
Someone's reunited with the kitty!

313
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,891
(Ollie and Finn scream excitedly)

314
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:02,724
- Who's your best friend?

315
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:03,985
Who's your best friend?

316
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,266
- Kitty.

317
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:06,480
- [Missy] Is this Zuri?

318
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,472
- Yeah, this is our best friend.

319
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:11,016
- [Fynn] Yeah, I love-love!

320
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,566
- [Bryan] (laughs) I
don't know if that love

321
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,702
goes both ways, bro.

322
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:16,256
She's like, "Stop touching me."

323
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:17,946
- She only has eyes for one person,

324
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:19,408
and that person is my brother.

325
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:20,902
- [Bryan] That is Uncle.

326
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:22,409
She loves him. (laughs)

327
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,897
- [Missy] She adores Jimmy, and--

328
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:26,080
- [Bryan] Ollie, not so much.

329
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,154
- She tolerates everyone else.

330
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:28,071
- [Bryan] Yeah, basically.

331
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:29,511
I can't believe she's
even letting you hold her.

332
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:30,677
- [Missy] I know. She's not happy.

333
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,010
- [Jimmy] She's actually not...

334
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,783
She doesn't scratch like
crazy when you hold her,

335
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,048
she just looks really uncomfortable.

336
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,662
- She's just like, "I just
want you to let me go."

337
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:39,369
She's got the most personality though.

338
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:40,285
- [Bryan] Yeah, she's so soft.

339
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,438
- [Missy] My brother takes her on walks.

340
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,271
- [Bryan] (laughs)

341
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:44,104
- [Missy] Like, actual walks.

342
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:46,287
She's got toys, and she
runs around this house

343
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,360
like she owns the place,

344
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,217
but she will only come to my brother.

345
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:50,246
- [Bryan] Aww.

346
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:53,163
(bright pop music)

347
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:58,192
- [Bryan] What did you find, Ollie?

348
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,039
- Treats for kitty cat.

349
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,088
- [Bryan] Nice.

350
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:03,742
Who's got a little treat for you?

351
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:05,538
- [Missy] Aww.

352
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:06,955
Oh, she ran away.

353
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:10,163
- [Bryan] There you go.

354
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,600
Say hi.

355
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,433
- Hello.

356
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:15,567
- [Missy] Say, "We're going nigh-night!"

357
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:16,652
- 'kay!

358
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:17,853
- [Missy] Come read a book.

359
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:19,201
- 'kay.

360
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,317
(burbles)

361
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:22,220
- [Ollie] I have the Star Wars toy, Finn.

362
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,996
(Finn makes baby talk)

363
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:26,740
(Ollie makes whispering monster noises)

364
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,319
- [Bryan] That is some
pile of books there, boys.

365
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,065
- I told them three books.

366
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,256
- [Bryan] That's five.

367
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:33,609
- And this is like, 10.

368
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,078
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

369
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:37,368
Finn, you're just doing some
light reading before bed?

370
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:38,201
- Yeah.

371
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:39,280
- [Bryan] We've got Goodnight, Moon.

372
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,883
We've got Words.

373
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,253
My Little Animal Book.

374
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,465
Lookit, this one's got animals.

375
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:45,298
- What?

376
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:47,321
- Yeah. Isn't that cool?

377
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,208
- Be bear? Aah!

378
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,125
- You guys, sorry my Ninjago robot,

379
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:56,837
um, just broked.

380
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,465
- [Bryan] He did break, huh?

381
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:00,298
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:01,131
- [Bryan] Aww.

383
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:03,497
Looks like it could be
an easy fix, though.

384
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:05,816
Yeah, not too bad.

385
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:06,649
- [Missy] Come on, Ollie.

386
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:08,013
Let's come read these books.

387
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:08,971
- [Bryan] Hop on there.

388
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:09,804
Read a book with Mama.

389
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,214
- You want me to read to you, Bub?

390
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,047
- Yeah.

391
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,880
- Okay, come sit down.

392
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:18,273
- [Missy] Come on heaters, warm up.

393
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,288
It's so cold out here.

394
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:23,449
The kids are in bed, and it
is not even nine o'clock.

395
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:26,528
Yay! Luna is out here playin'.

396
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:27,600
She's having a blast.

397
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,933
It's 60 degrees!

398
00:12:31,194 --> 00:12:33,831
I know that everyone's going
to say, "That's not cold!

399
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:35,433
"You shouldn't say how it's cold!"

400
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:38,252
I know it's not freezing, but it's cold.

401
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:39,374
It's chilly.

402
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:40,750
My heaters are turning on.

403
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,929
It's a nice night.

404
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,105
When it's freezing outside,
the pool looks really nice.

405
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:46,090
I think I might actually
get in the hot tub,

406
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,559
or me and Bryan might get in the hot tub.

407
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,713
So, by the way, if you guys don't know,

408
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:53,359
our brand new song now has a lyric video

409
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,241
up on our channel.

410
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,417
Make sure you go check it out.

411
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,335
It'll be linked up in the iCard,

412
00:12:57,335 --> 00:12:58,751
and we are so excited.

413
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,178
Now you guys can know the words,

414
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,049
you can memorize it, and
sing it along with us.

415
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,376
It's just such a fun song.

416
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:04,736
I mean, every time we get in the car,

417
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:05,936
Ollie makes me put it on.

418
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:08,981
He's so cute though, because
he sings all the words,

419
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:10,529
and he loves when his part comes

420
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:12,338
because he screams it and yells it.

421
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:13,171
It's so cute.

422
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:14,161
I'll have to vlog it some time.

423
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,584
Anyways, for now we're going
to go ahead and end the vlog.

424
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:17,720
You want to help me end it?

425
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,363
Say, "Give the video
a big thumbs up, guys.

426
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:24,979
"Yeah, thumbs up, and we'll
see you guys tomorrow.

427
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:26,282
"Bye!"

428
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:27,561
Boop.

429
00:13:27,561 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat pop music)
