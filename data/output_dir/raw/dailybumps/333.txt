1
00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:01,737
- What's that sound?

2
00:00:01,737 --> 00:00:02,570
- [Missy] What is it?

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,759
Where did it go?

4
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,568
- How bout that was a T-Rex just roar!

5
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:07,435
- [Missy] Whoa.

6
00:00:07,435 --> 00:00:08,398
- Roar.

7
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:09,279
(Missy laughs)

8
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,862
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:16,090
♫ Wherever you are

10
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,418
♫ That's where I wanna be

11
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:20,500
♫ All it took was a laugh

12
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,163
♫ In that soft sunset

13
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:26,961
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

14
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:30,111
♫ This is home

15
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:31,424
♫ Just runnin' around

16
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,054
♫ You've never looked so cute

17
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:34,069
♫ Huggin' you tight

18
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:37,705
♫ Cuddlin' all I could to you

19
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,799
♫ I am home

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,966
♫ Home's here right when you're with me

21
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:50,647
- [Ollie, Missy And Bryan] Good morning.

22
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:52,858
- We are at breakfast

23
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:54,534
which is actually basically lunch

24
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:57,116
because we slept in, right?

25
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:57,949
- It was nice.

26
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,159
We needed some sleep.

27
00:00:59,159 --> 00:00:59,992
- [Bryan] Yes.

28
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:01,169
If you're wondering why Finn is half-naked

29
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:02,873
it's because he's eating oatmeal.

30
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:04,943
- Oatmeal is like the
messiest meal we can give him

31
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:06,532
but I also really want him to eat.

32
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:07,557
- [Bryan] And he does that.

33
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:08,781
- We're at a restaurant

34
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:09,754
although it's not a restaurant.

35
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:10,716
It's like a cafe.

36
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:11,549
- [Bryan] Yeah.

37
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,382
- And I took his shirt off

38
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:13,678
cause I was not about to risk that.

39
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:15,070
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

40
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,903
- Oh my gosh.

41
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:16,786
It's in your eyeball.

42
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:17,910
It's in your eyelashes.

43
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,332
(laughs)

44
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:20,599
And some was on his back.

45
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,607
I was like how?

46
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:22,993
How does this get on your back?

47
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:24,963
- [Bryan] I know, after like
less than five minutes too.

48
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:26,240
- Hey Ollie, what are
we going to do today?

49
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,211
- We're going to find dinosaurs.

50
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:30,474
- We're gonna find some dinosaurs.

51
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:31,307
That's for sure.

52
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:33,971
We have been at Walt Disney
World for three days now

53
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,114
and this is our third day

54
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:38,597
and there's on park that
we haven't touched on yet

55
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,044
and that is Animal Kingdom.

56
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,837
So we are heading to Animal Kingdom.

57
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:44,223
We got a FastPass for a quick safari ride

58
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:45,779
and then we might check out some dinosaurs

59
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:46,612
and then call it a day

60
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,519
because we've actually
done Animal Kingdom before

61
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,482
and it was super-fun

62
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:50,823
but we're pretty worn out

63
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:52,672
after three days of Disney.

64
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:53,779
- We're really just tryin' to have a

65
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:55,276
relaxing slow day,

66
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:56,393
which is still fun day,

67
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:57,936
but calm down a little.

68
00:01:57,936 --> 00:01:59,369
- [Bryan] So we're gonna
go see some dinosaurs

69
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,602
and some animals

70
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:02,028
and meet up with our friends, okay?

71
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:02,861
- Yeah.

72
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,355
- [Bryan] We are waiting
in the lobby of our hotel

73
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,398
which I've just got a chance to look at

74
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:07,997
and it's like amazing.

75
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:09,526
- It's Pluto!

76
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:11,714
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh, did you
just find that on your own?

77
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,547
- Yeah.

78
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,380
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

79
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,367
Pluto's hidden in there.

80
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,333
- [Missy] Can you find anyone else?

81
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,817
- Yes I can.

82
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:19,650
- [Bryan] I bet there's other
characters hidden in here.

83
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's see.

84
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,833
- Mickey!

85
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,232
- [Bryan] No.

86
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:24,065
What?

87
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:24,915
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

88
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:25,755
- [Bryan] There's Mickey.

89
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:27,960
Can you find anyone else?

90
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,345
Who's that?

91
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,586
- Um, I don't know.

92
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:31,899
- [Bryan] That's Goofy.

93
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,029
- It's Goofy.

94
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:33,862
(Bryan laughs)

95
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,767
- [Bryan] Yep and I
think Minnie's over here.

96
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,405
- [Oliver] Oh yeah, that's Minnie.

97
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,238
- [Bryan] Minnie.

98
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:39,331
Is Donald Duck anywhere?

99
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,653
- I find Donald Duck.

100
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:42,111
- [Missy] How does Donald Duck talk?

101
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,788
- Quack quack quack quack.

102
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,111
(Bryan laughs)

103
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:46,107
- That is Donald Duck

104
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:46,940
also hidden there.

105
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,141
That's so cool.

106
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:49,854
I bet there's like a ton
of hidden things like that

107
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:52,478
in this lobby but check
out this hotel you guys.

108
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:53,594
This is where we've been staying,

109
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:55,276
at the Grand Floridian.

110
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,530
A beautiful hotel.

111
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,532
It's been a lot of fun.

112
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:00,947
We are entering Animal Kingdom now.

113
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,887
Regrouped with all of our friends.

114
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:05,164
Cal's taking an advantage of the stroller.

115
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:06,371
(laughs)

116
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:07,204
He's a happy boy.

117
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:08,037
This one passed out.

118
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:08,870
- Finn's asleep.

119
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,810
Taking his nap.

120
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,587
- [Bryan] Ollie, what do you see?

121
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:14,337
- I see a fish and a triceratops.

122
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:17,812
- [Bryan] Yeah.

123
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:19,011
- You saw a dinosaur, Ollie?

124
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:19,844
- Yeah!

125
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:21,795
- You see the dinosaur?

126
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:22,628
He see's the dinosaur.

127
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:23,792
- I see a triceratops.

128
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:24,999
- He gets so excited

129
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:27,267
when he sees this triceratops statue.

130
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,616
So we just walked into Animal Kingdom

131
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,290
and I could actually see
where they're building

132
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,651
the new Pandora section based
off the World of Avatar.

133
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:35,161
It's so cool.

134
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:36,133
Check it out.

135
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,025
You could get a little
glimpse of it, right here.

136
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:40,546
That's so cool.

137
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:41,379
This is my favorite thing

138
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:42,837
about walking in to Animal Kingdom.

139
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:45,165
Seeing the Tree of Life.

140
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,748
(upbeat music)

141
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,134
Look at this big old tree, bro.

142
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:53,638
- [Missy] Is that Rafiki's
tree in Lion King?

143
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:55,023
- Yeah.

144
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:56,212
Oh yeah.

145
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:57,480
- [Bryan] What do you see, Ollie?

146
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,827
- I see otter, inside
pretty bad right there.

147
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:01,889
- [Bryan] That's pretty bad?

148
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:02,722
- Yeah.

149
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:03,555
- [Bryan] That's a ram.

150
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,535
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

151
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:07,785
- [Bryan] Look at that ram.

152
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,375
Ollie, what is this?

153
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,772
- It's a crocodile.

154
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:16,409
- [Bryan] That's a big one.

155
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:18,326
- Papa, I push his eyes

156
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,279
- [Missy] Oh, you touched his eyeball.

157
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,112
- [Bryan] There you go papa.

158
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:24,652
He's touching the crocodile
in the eye, aren't you?

159
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:25,485
Poke him in the eye.

160
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:27,189
Poke him, poke him, poke him, poke him.

161
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,601
- Look at his teeth.

162
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,915
- [Bryan] Wow.

163
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:30,929
- So he could bite.

164
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:33,512
(upbeat music)

165
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:00,484
- Oh my gosh.

166
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,713
Dude, we must got like three million steps

167
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:06,932
because we just walked
all the way to Africa!

168
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,937
We're gonna go on a safari.

169
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:09,061
What are you looking forward to seeing?

170
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:09,894
- I'm ready.

171
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:10,811
Lions and--

172
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,602
- Tigers.

173
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:13,435
- A giraffe.

174
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:14,268
A giraffe.

175
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:15,101
- Bears.

176
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:15,934
- Bears.

177
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:16,767
Is there bears in Africa?

178
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:17,600
- I don't know.

179
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,433
- Lions.

180
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:19,266
- Yes, the African Bear.

181
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,099
- Yes, let's go.

182
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:21,860
- I ain't a lion.

183
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,128
- Ohhh.

184
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,711
(upbeat music)

185
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,600
- We are getting on a safari.

186
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,507
Gonna go see some wild animals.

187
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:38,340
You ready Ollie?

188
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,173
- Yeah.

189
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,350
- Hey Finn, are you ready for the safari?

190
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,068
Ya ready buddy?

191
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:45,490
- It smells good, huh?

192
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,912
Yep.

193
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:49,495
(tribal music)

194
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,248
- Ollie, what are those?

195
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:17,931
- Birds and hippos.

196
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:19,424
- Birds and hippos, yep.

197
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,351
That's pretty cool.

198
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:22,351
Oh, look at those birds.

199
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,024
You cannot have a crocodile, silly.

200
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:30,857
(laughs)

201
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,203
Those crocodiles can bite

202
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:34,749
up to two thousand pounds per inch.

203
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:37,280
That's a strong mouth.

204
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,935
You don't want that to bite you, do you?

205
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:39,924
- No.

206
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:42,507
(tribal music)

207
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,061
- Hey Carl, that's a pretty horny cow.

208
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,870
(Carl laughs)

209
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,985
Thanks for laughing, Ginger.

210
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:14,902
I was just looking out for the monkeys.

211
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,290
- Monkey point.

212
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,056
- She's obsessed with monkeys.

213
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:19,110
Probably cause she has a monkey climbing

214
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,006
all over her all day.

215
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,610
- I definitely have a monkey right here.

216
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,031
I don't need a monkey any more.

217
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:25,387
- [Bryan] Hey look, an elephant.

218
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:26,267
See the elephant?

219
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,100
- Yep.

220
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,194
- [Bryan] It's big, huh?

221
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:29,027
- Yes.

222
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:36,825
Elephant, ewe.

223
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:38,652
That stinks, that stinks.

224
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:39,921
- Does it smell like poo-poo?

225
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:40,767
- Yeah.

226
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:44,850
- Apparently the elephants
smell like poo-poo.

227
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,241
- They stink like some poo-poo.

228
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:49,824
(gentle music)

229
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:12,157
- [Bryan] That, Ollie, is
the king of the jungle.

230
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,283
That is so beautiful.

231
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,293
Ollie, who is that?

232
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:25,924
- Simba's dad?

233
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,056
(tribal music)

234
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,621
- I want the zebra to talk to me.

235
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:36,204
- [Bryan] He can't talk to you.

236
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:42,785
Alright Ollie, next stop Dino land!

237
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,634
That's where we're headed.

238
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,546
- Maybe we could go to Dino land.

239
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,704
We could see a pterodactyl.

240
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:55,537
- [Bryan] Where?

241
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:57,010
- Right there.

242
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,385
- [Bryan] That is a pterodactyl.

243
00:08:58,385 --> 00:08:59,661
There's lots of dinosaurs.

244
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:01,218
Look at that brachiosaurus.

245
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:02,051
- Yeah.

246
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:03,217
- [Bryan] That's huge.

247
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:04,050
- Yeah.

248
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,035
And it's got teeth for bite us.

249
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,776
- Watch out, Gage, it's gonna bite you.

250
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:10,409
- I know the name of this dinosaur.

251
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,363
- What is it's name?

252
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:12,196
- Bryan.

253
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:13,298
(laughs)

254
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:15,048
- That's an old joke.

255
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:19,579
Watch out Finn.

256
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:20,813
You gotta be careful of these ones.

257
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:22,079
They're meat eaters.

258
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,222
You got lots of meat.

259
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:25,742
You got lots of meat on there.

260
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:28,492
(dramatic music)

261
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,133
Oh.

262
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,295
- [Zookeeper] Touch it nice an gentle.

263
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,852
- [Bryan] My gosh.

264
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:45,327
- [Zookeeper] Hand cleaner
when you're all done.

265
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:46,494
- [Bryan] Wow.

266
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:49,096
- [Missy] Is that a cool snake?

267
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:50,588
- Yeah.

268
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:53,171
(tribal music)

269
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:03,320
I wanna touch the teeth.

270
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,041
- [Bryan] You already did, remember?

271
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:05,874
- No I didn't.

272
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:06,822
- [Bryan] Yeah, the
last time you were here

273
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:08,897
this dinosaur almost ate you.

274
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:09,730
- [Carl] Come up here.

275
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,942
- [Bryan] Uh oh, who remembers this?

276
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:13,775
- Ow

277
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:15,944
- [Bryan] Ahhh.

278
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,617
Say thanks Carl.

279
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:20,450
- Thanks Carl.

280
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,189
- [Carl] Alright, you're welcome dude.

281
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,052
- [Bryan] He survived, Finn, he survived.

282
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:24,885
- He's like we good.

283
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:26,067
- [Bryan] Look at, he looks
a little traumatized though.

284
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:28,900
- He's like, nah, didn't scare me.

285
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,755
- [Bryan] What Ollie?

286
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,260
- I think I see something!

287
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,093
- [Bryan] Let's go see it.

288
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,676
Come on!

289
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:37,509
Whoa!

290
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,118
- I see a squirrel!

291
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:42,374
- [Bryan] Okay, he cares
about the squirrel?

292
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,856
Look at this dino head.

293
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,679
- Oh it's a little scary
touching the teeth.

294
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,512
Touch the top teeth.

295
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:50,929
- [Bryan] Oh, that is creepy.

296
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:53,131
(laughs)

297
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,581
- We better get away.

298
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:56,601
- [Bryan] We better get away, go, go, go.

299
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,735
- That is a big brachiosaurus.

300
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:00,821
- [Missy] That's a brachiosaurus?

301
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:01,654
- [Ollie] Yeah.

302
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:03,990
- [Missy] Whoa, you're right!

303
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,277
- Let's go under it.

304
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:06,807
- [Missy] Okay, we'll go under it.

305
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,271
- He's gonna poop on us.

306
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:10,777
- [Missy] You think
he's gonna poop on you?

307
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:12,194
- Ewe, ewe, yuck.

308
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:15,308
Ahhhh.

309
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:19,093
(Missy laughs)

310
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:19,926
- You're a silly.

311
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,383
Alright, let's go.

312
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:22,687
Alright so all the big kids have gone

313
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,722
on a big ride called Dinosaur.

314
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:26,052
It is actually a ton of fun.

315
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,132
I've been on it before

316
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:28,600
but I am taking my little boys

317
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,719
to the Boneyard Fossil Fun Site

318
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,502
and we're gonna go look for some bones.

319
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:34,335
Are you excited?

320
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:35,168
- Yeah.

321
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:36,066
- Okay, are we ready?

322
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,982
- Yeah, and that, yes.

323
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:40,277
- He's like yeah, let's do this.

324
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:42,860
(upbeat music)

325
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:58,964
Ahhh!

326
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:01,609
Ahhh!

327
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:05,612
Ahhh!

328
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:09,311
Oh, what kind of dinosaur is that?

329
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,687
- A triceratops.

330
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,758
- [Missy] Wow that is so cool.

331
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:14,392
And are those the horns?

332
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,225
- Yeah.

333
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,475
- [Missy] Yeah.

334
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:26,185
Alright Ollie.

335
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,018
What do you have to do?

336
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:28,777
- I'm going down this slide.

337
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:30,313
- [Missy] Oh, it's high.

338
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:31,457
- No, it's not high.

339
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:32,290
- [Missy] You're not scared?

340
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,123
- No.

341
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,373
- [Missy] Okay.

342
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,389
Ollie, how was it?

343
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:41,850
- There was a dinosaur.

344
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,225
There was a T-Rex down there.

345
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:46,671
Then it just roared!

346
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,379
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

347
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:49,753
Was the slide fun?

348
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:50,586
- Yeah.

349
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:51,419
- [Missy] Yeah?

350
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:52,252
Let's go check out the T-Rex.

351
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:53,085
- Yeah.

352
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:53,918
- [Missy] Let's go.

353
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,304
- That's the T-Rex.

354
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:56,662
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

355
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:58,079
Look at his head.

356
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,063
Oh my gosh!

357
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,590
- He's eating me!

358
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,976
- [Missy] Say ahhh.

359
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,346
- Ahhhh.

360
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,087
(Missy laughs)

361
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:07,920
Leave me alone T-Rex.

362
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,181
Don't bite me up.

363
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,842
I want you to be a nice T-Rex.

364
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:12,883
(Missy laughs)

365
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:13,716
Grrr.

366
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:17,230
(gentle music)

367
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:21,820
- [Missy] Does that feel good?

368
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,668
Yeah?

369
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,909
Woo, it's hot.

370
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,323
- What's that sound?

371
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:26,156
- [Missy] What is it?

372
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,266
Where did it go?

373
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,008
- How bout that was a T-Rex just roar?

374
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:30,841
- [Missy] Whoa.

375
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:31,808
- Roar!

376
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,860
(Missy laughs)

377
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,094
- [Missy] Ollie, what are you standing on?

378
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:36,446
- A bone T-Rex.

379
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,012
- [Missy] A bone T-Rex?

380
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:39,649
Wow.

381
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,926
- Mama, look at all these footprints.

382
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:45,352
- [Missy] Whoa, what kinda
dinosaur do you think that is?

383
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:47,874
- I see a dino print,

384
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:49,448
a T-Rex one.

385
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:51,328
- [Missy] I'm kinda thinking raptor.

386
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:54,288
- Raptor, yeah, you're calling it.

387
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:57,038
(dinosaur roars)

388
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,462
What was that sound?

389
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:01,295
Let's use this shovel.

390
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:03,577
- [Missy] Let's use the shovel.

391
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,453
Oh, it's stuck there.

392
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,038
- I can't get it.

393
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:09,945
- Oh that fan feels amazing.

394
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:11,023
That feel good Ollie?

395
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:12,084
- Yeah.

396
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,622
- It really is not that hot of a day

397
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,105
but it is kinda humid.

398
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,786
And by the way Ollie always
gets a very red face.

399
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:18,861
He looks like he's got a sunburn

400
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,183
but he doesn't.

401
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:21,921
He gets like tomato face

402
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:23,542
when he just gets a little bit warm.

403
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,333
But yeah, the kids are having so much fun.

404
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,320
Aren't you Finn?

405
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,922
I don't think anyone's coming down that,

406
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:30,568
but it's a little scary.

407
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:31,487
Come here.

408
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:34,070
(upbeat music)

409
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:56,662
- Hey Ollie, I got you
something really cool.

410
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,829
You wanna see?

411
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:01,625
- What is that?

412
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,705
- [Bryan] It's a rock and
it's got a dinosaur on it.

413
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:04,945
What kind of dinosaur is that?

414
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:05,909
- A T-Rex.

415
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:06,884
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

416
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,908
- Yeah and I want T-Rex.

417
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,741
- [Bryan] You got one right there.

418
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,176
Look, let me show you.

419
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,759
It's a little baby T-Rex, huh?

420
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,271
- Well it's not a toy.

421
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:17,422
- [Bryan] No, it's just cool.

422
00:15:17,422 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
