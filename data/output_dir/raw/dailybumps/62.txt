1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,520
- [Bryan] We came home to Finn sleeping.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,770
He's so cute when he naps.

3
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:07,640
Awww.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,440
Honestly, though, if you've
ever taken a nap on our couch,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,240
that's just what you look like.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,140
That's what everyone looks like

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,692
when you take a nap on our couch.

- Good morning!

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,967
- Morning boys, did you guys sleep good?

21
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:39,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,877
- Who's here with us?

23
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:41,710
- Uncle.

24
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,950
- Uncle!

25
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,360
Yeah, we actually all went
to breakfast this morning.

26
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,400
And now we are headed out,

27
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,060
well, me and Bryan are headed out

28
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,360
to go ride Nacho.

29
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,193
- Yeah.

30
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:54,730
- The boys are gonna hang out
with Uncle for a little bit.

31
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,770
- Happy.

32
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,656
- Happy?

33
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:57,489
- Yeah.

34
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,640
- I think Finn's saying he's happy.

35
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,370
But yeah, I'm excited I'm
finally gonna get Bryan

36
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,210
on the horse and I think it's gonna be

37
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,043
a really fun time.

38
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,170
It's just gonna be me
and him so super low-key.

39
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,580
No ones gonna be around,
like, making anyone nervous.

40
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,950
So it'll be really cool.

41
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,220
So you guys are gonna hang out with Uncle?

42
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,053
- Yeah.

43
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:13,980
- [Missy] Okay.
- Yeah.

44
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,150
- See you guys in a little bit, OK?

45
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

46
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,293
- Yeah, be good for Uncle.

47
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:19,605
- Okay.
- Okay.

48
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:21,284
- Hey, were back down at the barn.

49
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,380
- Yeah.
- This is me and Bryan

50
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,530
and we've got Nacho already out.

51
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,480
- So sweet.
- I haven't read comments

52
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,545
today to see what people
suggested for a name.

53
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:30,780
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- For a second name.

54
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,860
- We're still calling him Nacho.

55
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,740
- Yeah, Nacho's for now.

56
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,140
Maybe I'll end up connecting with it.

57
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,020
It does feel like his name
- Yeah.

58
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,520
- After I call him that for so long.

59
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,150
- I definitely feel a lot more comfortable

60
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,983
with him today.

61
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,540
Like, I've never been a big horse guy.

62
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,373
- [Missy] Yeah.

63
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:45,550
- They've always kind of
really intimidated me,

64
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,220
but he's a sweetheart.

65
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,550
- [Missy] He really is nice and this'll be

66
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,330
a great horse to get
him, like, comfortable

67
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,669
so that he kinda understands
the mannerisms of a horse.

68
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:55,200
- It was nice, too, just walking him.

69
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,033
- [Missy] Yeah.

70
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,260
- He keeps his head,
like, right next to you.

71
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,470
- [Missy] Yeah, he doesn't, like, pull

72
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,350
or walk away from you.

73
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,180
He's a great, good horse.

74
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,619
- Alright, we're gonna saddle you up.

75
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,900
- We're gonna saddle him
and get him all ready.

76
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,940
- I haven't been on a horse in so long.

77
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,770
- I'm gonna make Bryan do a bunch of stuff

78
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,615
so he can really, like,
get to know how it goes.

79
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:15,198
(bright music)

80
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,094
- So, hang on.

81
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,510
I'm working at a horse salon.

82
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,957
And obviously, what I'm doing
is brushing and cleaning.

83
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:30,207
(laughter)

84
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:34,324
- [Missy] Brushing his tail.

85
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:38,355
(laughter)

86
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:39,355
Didn't pull.

87
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,100
- Are you loving this, Nacho?

88
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,010
Is this awesome?

89
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,140
- [Missy] He says, "I'm a boy.

90
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,100
"Leave me alone."

91
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,800
- Yeah, he goes, "I wanna play."

92
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,070
He's so soft.

93
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,800
Alright, we are now cleaning Nacho's feet.

94
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,750
Apparently, these are his nails?

95
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,440
- Yep, his nails.

96
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,980
- [Bryan] So weird.

97
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,050
He's got a lot of gunk in them.

98
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,883
- He's so great.

99
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:03,160
He just picks it up for you.

100
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,440
- [Bryan] Alright, you
want me to try this one?

101
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,530
- [Missy] Okay, you want to do this one?

102
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,363
He's ready.

103
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:08,530
He's like, already leaning over.

104
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,620
- [Bryan] Okay, what do I do?

105
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,660
- [Missy] Come on the side of it.

106
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,350
He just picks it up.

107
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:14,954
And you just...

108
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:17,860
Look at that.

109
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,370
Keep going, you can
really dig that nail in.

110
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,260
See the grooves?

111
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,093
- Mm Hmm.

112
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,683
It's so weird.

113
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:29,011
So weird, man.

114
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,511
This not who I am.

115
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,260
I am a city boy.

116
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,116
And I married a country girl.

117
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:37,000
This is really kinda funky.

118
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,167
- [Missy] Good job, though.

119
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,584
That looks clean.

120
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,300
Oh, here's Rolly.

121
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,160
He's out.

122
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,620
- [Bryan] Alright, so Missy's
putting on his bridle.

123
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,840
And apparently he's
really stubborn sometimes.

124
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,640
- It's probably my fault, too.

125
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,320
I'm not, like, the best at doing it here.

126
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,640
- [Bryan] Come on, dude, you got it.

127
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:03,320
Hey, good job.

128
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,590
- It's not his fault.

129
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,423
It's my fault.

130
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm not the best at it.

131
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,513
- [Bryan] Yeah.

132
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,950
So check this out, you guys.

133
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,670
We have the horse all saddled.

134
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,660
Missy showed me how to do everything.

135
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,470
And I've probably been walked through that

136
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,950
maybe once before in my life,

137
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,300
like when I was little.

138
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,260
But it's cool, like, we did it.

139
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,760
- We've got one little strap.

140
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,593
- [Bryan] Yeah.

141
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,740
So this is the one that I got you

142
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,160
for Christmas, too.

143
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,068
- Yeah, and it's really
special's why I put it on.

144
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:30,901
- [Bryan] Aww.

145
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:31,734
- [Missy] It looks good

146
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:32,567
hanging a little low,

147
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,030
not, like, choking him.

148
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,863
- [Bryan] Okay.

149
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,260
- It's nice and comfortable.

150
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,290
- [Bryan] So you put this
one on to get him ready,

151
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,020
and then you put this one on
when you're about to ride.

152
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:43,820
- Yeah.

153
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,360
- [Bryan] So he gets,
like, an outfit change,

154
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,370
basically halfway through.

155
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,340
He's basically ready by now.

156
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,872
- Yeah.

157
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,010
Alright, I've got Bryan on the horse.

158
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,720
What do you think, Nacho?

159
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,980
He's like, "He's definitely a beginner."

160
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,789
He's like, "I can do whatever I want."

161
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,480
(laughter)

162
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,960
But Bryan's starting to kinda understand

163
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,960
how to give him rein.

164
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,810
Try and have him go left,
er, yeah sorry, right.

165
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,293
Turn his head.

166
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,126
There ya go.

167
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,280
Use that for pressure.

168
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,757
See?

169
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:16,240
And just tell him keep
going, you don't wanna stop.

170
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,860
Yeah, just do, like, a small
circle around me basically.

171
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,210
Just, there ya go.

172
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,410
Now tell him turn right.

173
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,120
You're doing it.

174
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,873
Ya starting to get it?

175
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,492
- A little bit, yeah.

176
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:38,150
(laughter)

177
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,330
- [Missy] A little
nervous, but, Nacho's like,

178
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,279
"I'm just trying to teach you what to do."

179
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,890
(laughter)

180
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,354
You look good up there.

181
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:48,187
- Thanks.

182
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:49,070
- [Missy] You look like a cowboy.

183
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,903
- Oh, do I?

184
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:50,736
- [Missy] Yeah.

185
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:51,810
Have him turn right.

186
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,890
You're doing it.

187
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,643
I'm proud of you.

188
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,893
(laughter)

189
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,475
He is kinda magnetic to me, huh?

190
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:02,308
- Yeah.

191
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,638
- [Missy] He just keeps
walking back to me.

192
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:04,471
- He's pulled to Missy.

193
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:05,345
- [Missy] Yeah.

194
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:06,178
It's actually kinda cute.

195
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:07,011
I love it.

196
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm not gonna complain yet, but...

197
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,340
Alright, keep going a little bit more.

198
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,370
Good job.

199
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:13,950
You're doing it.

200
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,680
It's actually really cool to see Bryan

201
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,370
on my horse, but on a horse at all.

202
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,410
And maybe, if he gets comfortable enough,

203
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,760
and figures now we can
go trail riding together,

204
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,350
it should be really, really fun.

205
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,640
Come on. (clicks)

206
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,331
You're doing a pretty lazy walk.

207
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:32,440
(laughter)

208
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,076
- I feel like he's going 30 miles an hour.

209
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:36,392
(laughter)

210
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:37,225
- [Missy] You gotta go...

211
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,716
- Look at that, my hips
are going back and forth.

212
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:40,549
(laughter)

213
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:41,680
- [Missy] You could totally get him up to,

214
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,100
like, an active walk.

215
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,260
Just a little faster.

216
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,300
- No, not today, whoa.

217
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,620
- [Missy] He's like, "Okay, I'm back."

218
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,430
You're doing so good.

219
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,053
♪ They'll be coming around
the mountain when they come ♪

220
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:55,886
Yeehaw!

221
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,960
You really are doing so good.

222
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,499
Like, I really am proud of you.

223
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:03,666
- Thanks babe.

224
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,810
Nacho's had enough of doing pony rides

225
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,346
so Missy's gonna jump on him
and give him a little trot.

226
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,179
- He was great.

227
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:12,720
He would so have done
that a little longer.

228
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,010
- Yeah, he did good.

229
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,630
No, that was cool.

230
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,110
Saddle's definitely a little small for me

231
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,420
so it was a little painful, but, yeah.

232
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,610
Alright.

233
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,080
- Once I get you on one
of the other horses,

234
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,560
you'll have a more comfortable saddle.

235
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,582
- [Bryan] Yeah.

236
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,165
(upbeat music)

237
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,730
- We just got back from the horse ranch

238
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,690
and now we are eating
some lunch, aren't we?

239
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,197
Say hey.
- Stop.

240
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:51,321
- [Bryan] What'cha eating?

241
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,011
- Um, a peanut butter.

242
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:56,110
- Yep, we made sandwiches
because we were starving.

243
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,110
Missy actually ended up
going on a little trail ride,

244
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,930
which was really cool because
she got to take him out

245
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,060
for the first time ever.

246
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,760
And we came home to Finn sleeping.

247
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,890
He's so cute when he naps.

248
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:09,770
Awww.

249
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,570
Honestly, though, if you've
ever taken a nap on our couch,

250
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,360
that's just what you look like.

251
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,280
That's what everyone looks like

252
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,900
when you take a nap on our couch.

253
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,810
- It's so nice.

254
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,370
It's just about sunset.

255
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,510
The sun's, like, just starting
to go over that mountain.

256
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,850
And it's just such a nice time.

257
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,890
I'm actually just getting ready.

258
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,260
I put my shoes one, got my hat on.

259
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,190
I was gonna head out, do a
little bit of grocery shopping.

260
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,700
Like, we have stuff for dinner

261
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,240
but I kinda wanted to grab
a few more ingredients

262
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,100
even for the dinner and
just stuff for the week.

263
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,110
And I just walked out here with the boys

264
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,789
and I was like, "I don't
want to go anywhere.

265
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,469
"Let's just stay home and hang out

266
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,270
"and enjoy our evening, not leaving."

267
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,089
So, now we're not leaving,
we're gonna hang out, OK?

268
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,030
- Yeah.

269
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,360
- I mean, I was going to leave the boys

270
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,242
with Bryan anyways and go by myself,

271
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,770
and I was like, "I just
wanna hang out, too."

272
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,261
So now we're all just gonna hang out.

273
00:08:57,261 --> 00:09:00,410
And Luna got the little flag that goes

274
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,790
on the top of the mountain.

275
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,210
And I think she chewed
off the part that goes in.

276
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,123
So now it's like, too fat
to actually fit in the hole.

277
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:08,133
- It can't.

278
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,422
- [Missy] Dang it, huh?

279
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:13,172
(cheerful music)

280
00:09:46,917 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat pop music)
