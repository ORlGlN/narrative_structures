1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,764
- [Bryan] Fin keeps grabbing the suckers.

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:05,581
- You already had one, no more suckers.

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:06,496
- [Bryan] No more suckers buddy.

4
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:07,329
- [Missy] Okay?

5
00:00:07,329 --> 00:00:09,483
- [Woman] There's a whole
jar of them though Mother.

6
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:10,641
- [Missy] I know.

7
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:15,454
- [Bryan] Oh look, he's
going back inside the house.

8
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:17,067
And then he's back at it.

9
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,445
(laughs)

10
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:20,278
Fin.

11
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:26,001
Fin I really really
appreciate your determination,

12
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,275
but you already had a sucker today.

13
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,358
He's opening.

14
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:31,570
Let me try it.

15
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,403

- [Both] Good morning lalala.

28
00:00:57,914 --> 00:00:59,181
- What is that sound?

29
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:00,014
- Fin.

30
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:00,847
- That Fin?

31
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:02,388
- Yeah.

32
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:03,515
- Good morning guys.

33
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:06,066
We've had kind of a fun morning.

34
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,952
We basically just got up and got ready,

35
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:10,083
are we're getting ready to go to

36
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,596
- CJ and Bailey's house!

37
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:12,695
- Nope breakfast.

38
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:14,133
(laughs)

39
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,404
Gotta go to breakfast first.

40
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:17,497
Yeah we have a super fun day planned.

41
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:20,945
We have to eat first, and Momma
is getting a little hungry,

42
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:22,823
and it's possible so is Fin.

43
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:23,856
Let's go see what he's doing.

44
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,717
He's making a lot of noise in here.

45
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:29,550
Finley J, what's going on in here.

46
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:35,392
We can't eat chocolate for breakfast bud.

47
00:01:35,392 --> 00:01:39,351
Finley do not pull a
terrible two on me, okay?

48
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:43,161
Hey bud, what if we go get breakfast

49
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:45,860
like pancakes and waffles,

50
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,912
- I want waffles!

51
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:48,752
- Does that sound good to you?

52
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:50,461
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

53
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:52,608
And eggs, whoa whoa.

54
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:56,691
Alright, well we're gonna
save this for later, K?

55
00:01:57,593 --> 00:01:59,284
Hopefully a meltdown doesn't go down.

56
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:01,814
Anyways the house is
kind of a mess right now.

57
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:04,283
Oh my goodness, everyone
is kicking around things,

58
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:06,372
but I will say Luna is doing good.

59
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:08,231
I feel like a lot of people
have been worried about her.

60
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:09,172
She's doing really good.

61
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:12,171
She's taking her medicine.

62
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:13,504
Uh oh come here.

63
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:15,405
Come here.

64
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:18,412
She's taking her medicine,

65
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:20,152
and she's in her crate right now resting

66
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:22,894
because we're getting ready to leave

67
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,917
and I don't want to leave her out.

68
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:25,750
What?

69
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,168
Is that her medicine?

70
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:28,660
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

71
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,158
Alright boys let's go get in the car.

72
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,179
Daddy's finishing up a
couple of things for work

73
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:33,298
even though it's Saturday,

74
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:35,556
but he's never done working.

75
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,520
So he's gonna finish a couple of things

76
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,706
while I put the kids in the car,

77
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:43,408
and then it's time to go and
have a fun day not working.

78
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,101
- Ollie is choosing a toy

79
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:48,104
because we are headed to breakfast,

80
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:51,363
and he has a bag full of toys
and I said you can bring one.

81
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:52,493
Oh you're bringing your firetruck?

82
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:55,743
- Yeah cause I'm gonna call this a gun.

83
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:59,306
- Oh okay, but it's a ladder.

84
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:01,359
- I know. I'm just gonna call it a gun.

85
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,192
- Oh okay.

86
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:03,025
(laughs)

87
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,898
We are at Richie's dinner,
and we were gonna grab

88
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:07,555
some breakfast, but we have
about a 10 minute wait,

89
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,107
and Fin fell asleep on the ride over.

90
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:13,173
So he is getting a little 10 minute nap.

91
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:16,797
It's the triumphs in
parenting, the little triumphs

92
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,925
in parenting that you celebrate.

93
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:21,425
(funky music)

94
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:26,399
(sirens wailing)

95
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,232
Whoa.

96
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,229
It makes some cool noises huh?

97
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,647
- Yeah look at this part.

98
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,477
(honking)

99
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:37,419
Oh yeah. Look at this chocolate milk.

100
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,662
We're cheers-ing.

101
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:39,871
Cheers!

102
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,688
Happy Saturday guys.

103
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,521
How is it?

104
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:48,059
Definitely thumbs up for a chocolate milk.

105
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:51,291
I was definitely feeling
chocolate milk this morning.

106
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,864
Hey where are we going to today Ollie?

107
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:56,364
- Um CJ and Bailey's birthday!

108
00:03:57,427 --> 00:03:59,524
- He's so excited for CJ and Bailey's.

109
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:02,927
Although, in reality,
it's just CJ's birthday,

110
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:04,276
but they're like together.

111
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:07,359
(funky upbeat music)

112
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:29,934
Nice balancing skills dude.

113
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,785
- It's on the firetruck.

114
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,517
- I know it's so cool.

115
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:36,350
(music continues)

116
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,586
- We're at CJ's birthday party!

117
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:14,277
- [Bryan] Yeah!

118
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:15,163
- Hi.

119
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,466
- [Bryan] Hi Bailey!

120
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:18,355
(laughs)

121
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:20,438
Where's the birthday boy?

122
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:47,564
Alright so Fin keeps grabbing the suckers.

123
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:50,216
- You already had one.

124
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,556
No more suckers.

125
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:52,389
- [Bryan] No more suckers buddy.

126
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,222
- [Missy] Okay?

127
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:56,600
- [Woman] There's a whole
jar of them though Mother.

128
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,267
- Oh look, he's going
back inside the house.

129
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,889
And then he's back at it.

130
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,289
(laughs)

131
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,122
Fin.

132
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,017
Fin I really really
appreciate your determination,

133
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:14,405
but you already had a sucker today.

134
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,327
He's opening.

135
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,577
K that one's Daddy's, okay?

136
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:19,829
Let me try it.

137
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:20,662
No Fin!

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,339
You already had one.

139
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,097
Do you see him?

140
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:32,675
Do you see what he's doing guys?

141
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,636
Finley J, no more suckers.

142
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:38,204
(laughs)

143
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:39,454
Oh my goodness.

144
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,342
- Happy birthday CJ.

145
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:50,431
- [Bryan] Happy birthday CJ.

146
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:51,913
Should we show him his present Ollie?

147
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:52,746
- Yeah.

148
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,572
- [Bryan] Okay, you want to show him?

149
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:57,644
- [Missy] Tell him what you got?

150
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:59,813
- We got a trampoline!

151
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:04,060
- [Bryan] You get a trampoline
for your new backyard!

152
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,828
Are you so excited?

153
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:06,878
- [Woman] You can jump on the boxes.

154
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:08,017
That's it, just the boxes.

155
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:08,855
- [Bryan] Yeah this is
actually a trampoline.

156
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:10,188
Go jump go jump.

157
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,179
You can practice on that.

158
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:14,037
(cheers)

159
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:15,446
- [Woman] You got your dad a job to do.

160
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,324
- [Bryan] All you gotta
do is put it together CJ.

161
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:18,186
- What?

162
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:21,001

the Hollister Lannings.

163
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,048

Happy birthday dude.

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,421
- [Missy] Hey CJ, now you gotta get him.

187
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,863
- CJ is living his best life right now.

188
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:25,946
Look at that.

189
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,313
Alright we are driving home
from CJ's birthday party,

190
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:32,201
but we had so much fun didn't we Ollie?

191
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,101
- Yeah!

192
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:37,352
- Yes I am so excited that
CJ now has a big trampoline

193
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,319
all for himself.

194
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,662
Well he probably has to share with Bailey

195
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,302
and his friends and
stuff, but I'm so excited

196
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:46,409
because they actually just
moved so they have a new house,

197
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:49,050
and they have a backyard,
and they're able to put

198
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,143
a trampoline in it now,

199
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,456
and I think the kids are gonna love it.

200
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:52,357
- [Missy] So exciting.

201
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:54,578
- Yeah so happy birthday CJ.

202
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,167
We had a blast hanging out with you,

203
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,760
and now we are headed home.

204
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,843
- How is the trampoline going to fit?

205
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:06,122
- It's not as big, their
backyard is big enough for it.

206
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:07,567
It should fit pretty easy.

207
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:08,677
- Maybe we'll go there in a few weeks,

208
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:10,438
and we can go jump on it.

209
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:11,855
- [Bryan] Yeah you wanna
go jump at their house?

210
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,168
- Yeah.

211
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:14,429
- [Bryan] That be fun Fin?

212
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,505
- Yeah.

213
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:17,508
- Just picked up some
food from the taco shop

214
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:19,569
because we've been craving
carne asada all day.

215
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:21,721
So we're heading home to go eat dinner.

216
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,554
Put these kids to B-E-D.

217
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,698
Always like does he know
how to spell that yet?

218
00:09:29,698 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat dance music)
