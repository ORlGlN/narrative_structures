2
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:03,874
- [Missy] Alright, give him a kiss!

3
00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:04,707
- [Bryan] And then give him a kiss,

4
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:05,540
just like you did in the clip!

00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,103
- [Missy] Aw, Finn's giving him a kiss.

00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:08,370

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,359

21
00:00:32,758 --> 00:00:33,728
- Ow, ow, ow!

22
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:34,860
- [Missy] What are you doin'?

23
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,734
- Oh, ow!

24
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:38,174
- [Missy] Did you throw
your toys down there?

25
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:39,007
- Yeah.

26
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,661
- [Missy] Yeah, did he throw
your toys down there Ollie?

27
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:43,549
- No, I have my toys right here.

28
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,950
- [Missy] He keeps his
toys extra protected.

29
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,829
Finn just throws them down there.

30
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:49,738
So, that's where his toys are.

31
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,238
- Good morning guys!
- Morning!

32
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:56,771
- Good morning guys, we are
up at our cabin in Idlewild,

33
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,539
and we are so happy Luna's happy.

34
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,834
And we are enjoying this beautiful view,

35
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,703
and beautiful morning!

36
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:06,818
We've got bluebirds flyin' around.

37
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:08,985
My dad set up this
little trap for the boys,

38
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,133
so they could try and
catch a bluebird, huh?

39
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,025
Haven't caught one yet though, huh?

40
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:14,649
Takes patience, huh?

41
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,064
Do you have patience Ollie?

42
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:18,040
- [Finn] I see a black bird!

43
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,281
- There's a bluebird!

44
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:20,201
- [Finn] Hey, come back here!

45
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:21,836
- Come here, come here bluebird!

46
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:22,943
But yeah, it is a beautiful day.

47
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:26,097
We are wearing sweaters, but
it is a pretty warm day today.

48
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:29,198
It's probably like in the
70's and not cold at all.

49
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:30,975
But it's nice, last year it snowed,

50
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:32,372
the year before that it snowed,

51
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:34,423
and then this year, we're just gonna have

52
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,572
a little bit warmer
weather, but it feels nice.

53
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:37,655
Hi little Lu.

54
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:41,158
Hi, are you having a good vacation?

55
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:42,602
Do you miss your Karmy?

56
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,397
If you don't know, Karma is at home

57
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:46,194
with some friends of ours
that are watchin' the house.

58
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:49,923
And so he is enjoying life
with no Luna and no kids,

59
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,519
and sittin' around havin' a good time.

60
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,013
- Good morning from the cabin!

61
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:57,674
Missy's already started on the cabin life.

62
00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:58,519
- Yeah!

63
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,766
- [Bryan] Puzzles!

64
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,343
- I know, and I'm like,
don't touch my puzzle!

65
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:02,567
- [Bryan] Yeah, Ollie remember when

66
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,566
you messed up mama's puzzle that one time?

67
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,808
- Yeah, watch out my dragon.

68
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:07,104
- [Bryan] Wow!

69
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:09,475
- [Missy] Let's not talk about that.

70
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:10,692
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

71
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:11,525
(laughing)

72
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:12,705
What is this a puzzle of?

73
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:14,409
It's like a cat puzzle, oh gosh,

74
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,852
now I don't know what it looks like.

75
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,932
- [Bryan] Oh, a hundred pieces?

76
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:19,271
- Look over the edge of the porch.

77
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,254
- Hey, mama!
- Yeah

78
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:22,996
- A kitty cat puzzle.

79
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:25,361
- I know, isn't that cute?

80
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:28,444
(instrumental music)

81
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,943
- Another cool thing about the cabin,

82
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:35,598
all the amazing blue jay's.

83
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,166
You just put peanuts everywhere.

84
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,799
(laughing)

85
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:42,502
Here's some more for you guys!

86
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:44,790
Uh-oh, this one fell.

87
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,215
Let's put this one right there.

88
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:48,535
Then, you go inside, and you try and get

89
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,562
a glimpse of 'em through the window.

90
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,645
(instrumental music)

91
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,056
There he is!

92
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:58,886
Look at that blue jay!

93
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,308
(laughing)

94
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:02,012
He stole my peanut and ran.

95
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:03,713
Look it, they're fighting over 'em now.

96
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:05,662
These are the blue jay's
that live outside the cabin.

97
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:07,494
They are so pretty.

98
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:09,731
Look at those birds, Ollie.

99
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,047
There's some more peanuts up there,

100
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:11,996
you think he'll get 'em?

101
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:14,738
- [Ollie] I think that
bird is gonna take them.

102
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:17,237
- [Bryan] Yeah, he took the peanuts!

103
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:19,532
- He's goin' to tip toe out there.

104
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,228
- [Bryan] Oh, 'cause he's gotta be quiet?

105
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:22,113
- Yeah.

106
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:23,028
(laughing)

107
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:26,117
- Hey Ollie, why do you think
they're called blue jay's?

108
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:27,053
- Why?

109
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,299
- [Bryan] 'Cause it's blue!

110
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:29,188
- Blue?

111
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:30,356
- [Bryan] Yeah, but guess what!

112
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:31,189
- What?

113
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:32,688
- [Bryan] It also has the
same middle name as Finn!

114
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:33,521
- Finn?

115
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,387
- [Bryan] Yeah!

116
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:35,612
Got your flashlights?

117
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:39,375
- Yeah we have, no,
these are search lights.

118
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,035
- [Bryan] Oh, okay.

119
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:43,618
(upbeat music)

120
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:56,713
Puzzle time is growing to the extreme!

121
00:03:56,713 --> 00:03:58,368
Cassidy and Carlos are here,

122
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,653
and we are puttin'
together a big puzzle now.

123
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:01,996
How many pieces is this one?

124
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:04,076
- 500, we finished the 100--

125
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,455
- [Bryan] So you graduated from 100,

126
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,297
you moved on to 500, okay.

127
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:10,406
- I wish there was a 250,
but we just gotta go for it.

128
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:11,278
(laughing)

129
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:12,334
- [Bryan] And the kids
have been running around

130
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,037
and just playing and having so much fun.

131
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,446
And I just watched a little clip

132
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:17,831
of when we were here
with them two years ago,

133
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:19,313
and I'm gonna try and recreate it.

134
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:20,322
- [Missy] Hi!

135
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:21,350
- [Bryan] Hi, cutie!

136
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,005
- [Missy] I knew you'd smile!

137
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,673
- [Bryan] Show it to him.

138
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:25,923
- [Missy] Yeah!

139
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,661
- [Bryan] You share your toys with him?

140
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:29,533
- [Missy] He says ah!

141
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:30,381
(laughing)

142
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:31,608
Bless you!

143
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,680
Careful, don't bite his nose.

144
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,225
- [Bryan] You put Ollie up on the couch.

145
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:37,538
Ollie, you need some brother time, okay?

146
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,887
- [Missy] Can you give
him a kiss real quick?

147
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:40,806
Aw.

148
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:43,390
- Good job.
- Good job.

149
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,049
- [Bryan] Alright, we're
recreating the scene.

150
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,826
Alright Finn, you sit there.

151
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:48,001
Ollie, come over here!

152
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:48,873
- I can't!

153
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,943
(laughing)

154
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:50,826
- [Bryan] He's stuck.

155
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:53,272
Sit right there next to your brother!

156
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:54,651
(laughing)

157
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,347
- [Missy] Alright, give him a kiss!

158
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:57,615
- [Bryan] And then give him a kiss,

159
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:59,008
just like you did in the clip!

160
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,115
- [Missy] Aw, Finn's giving him a kiss.

161
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:01,379
- [Bryan] You guys are--

162
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,647
- [Missy] Give him a kiss Ollie!

163
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:03,999
- [Bryan] the cutest kids
on the internet still.

164
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,655
- [Missy] Ollie, give him a kiss.

165
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:07,968
- [Bryan] Give him a kiss Ollie!

166
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,347
Aw!

167
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:11,397
(laughing)

168
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:12,274
- [Missy] They both like--

169
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:13,476
(laughing)

170
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:15,485
- [Bryan] Alright, are you cuddling

171
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,957
or are you tackling him now?

172
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:19,887
- That is so crazy, he
was like a month old.

173
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:20,761
- [Bryan] I know.

174
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:22,066
- Look at that same pillow.

175
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:25,545
- [Bryan] Wow, who has the last piece?

176
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,141
- Well, if Jimmy would move his fingers.

177
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,011
(laughing)

178
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,799
- [Bryan] Look how close they
are you guys, that is crazy.

179
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,449
- Oh no, we only have two pieces left.

180
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,325
- [Bryan] What?

181
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:35,947
- Oh no, we're good, we're good.

182
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:36,839
Put it in!

183
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,596
- [Bryan] It creates a
portal that you can jump into

184
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:40,009
to travel to the place!

185
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,252
- Yeah!
- Hurray!

186
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,836
- No missing pieces either!

187
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:44,387
- Yeah, and this piece was
throwin' us off for a while.

188
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,082
- You guys ever see someone
finish a puzzle before?

189
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:48,196
'Cause you just did, on Daily Bumps.

190
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:49,364
- How long did that take us?

191
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:50,236
- [Bryan] I know, right?

192
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:51,470
- [Jimmy] So the flat piece was an

193
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,303
extra piece that just
didn't belong anywhere?

194
00:05:52,303 --> 00:05:53,403
- [Bryan] Was that so relaxing Missy?

195
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,305
- Oh yeah, that was so fun.

196
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,636
Alright, we've made it
to the town of Idlewild,

197
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:59,528
TJ and Bailey are gonna get to meet

198
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:02,593
Mayor Max for the first
time, are you guys excited?

199
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:06,070
Yep, make sure you shake
his hand really nicely.

200
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,629
Give him a good pet.

201
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,500
(laughing)

202
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,944
He's like, the sweetest dog.

203
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,155
Luna!

204
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:12,321
- [Bryan] Luna Lu!

205
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,938
- [Missy] Are you gonna
get to meet Mayor Max?

206
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,114
- You wanna meet Mayor
Max, he's so fun and cool!

207
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,474
Come on, let's go see him.

208
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:19,695
- [Missy] Come on!

209
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,112
Aw, you're meeting Mayor Max!

210
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,065
- [Bryan] Okay Max, look here.

211
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,446
- [Missy] Look at me Bailey!

212
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:28,448
(laughing)

213
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:29,917
Luna's turn!

214
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:33,488
Mayor Max, it's so good to see you!

215
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:34,639
- [Bryan] Hi Max!

216
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,902
(laughing)

217
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:38,403
Luna, see Max?

218
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:39,301
- [Missy] Say hi!

219
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:40,759
Finn just woke up, and he said

220
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,694
he wanted to meet Mayor Max, huh?

221
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,723
- Where's Mayor Max?

222
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,490
Where is he?

223
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,061
Oh my goodness!

224
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:51,492
- [Missy] He's posin'
for pictures right now.

225
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:54,325
Alright, come say hi to Mayor Max!

226
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,686
- And see you pet him,
look how pretty he is.

227
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:00,665
- [Bryan] He does selfies.

228
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:01,712
He knows how to do a selfie.

229
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,667
- [Missy] Alright, we're gonna selfie it!

230
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,500
Mayor Max!

231
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,573
(laughing)

232
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:08,406
Good job!

233
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,110
You're such a sweetie,

234
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,490
I've known Mayor Max since he was a baby!

235
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,701
Finn, give him a kiss!

236
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:17,534
- No!

237
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:19,485
(laughing)

238
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:21,193
- Look these pretty deer!

239
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:23,474
- They are so cool looking!

240
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:26,141
This is where Santa sits, Ollie!

241
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,257
You gonna see Santa?

242
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:32,040
He's gonna sit here, that's
where he sits under that,

243
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,353
'member you talked to him?

244
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,020
(holiday music)

245
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:46,524
Hi Santa!

246
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,293
Santa and Mrs. Clause!

247
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:54,530
Ollie, look it's Santa!

248
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,402
Say hi Santa!

249
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:56,632
- Hi Santa!

250
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:57,789
- Hi!

251
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,826
- [Bryan] Hi Mrs. Clause!

252
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:00,699
(laughing)

253
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,025
- We're kinda cheating.

254
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:05,192
- [Bryan] All the kids are like, what?

255
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:09,134
(holiday music)

256
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:15,225
We have, Olivia, Bailey,
Ollie, and Patence,

257
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,011
hogging the giant snowman.

258
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,185
Okay, let's not beat him up guys.

259
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:20,643
Ollie.

260
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:22,289
Say you're sorry.

261
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:23,622
- Sorry snowman!

262
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:28,165
(holiday music)

263
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:46,800
- And now what we have
all been waiting for,

264
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,509
we are gathered around this giant tree,

265
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,508
and they are going to light it up

266
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,866
with colorful Christmas lights.

267
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,321
- And every year I make this joke,

268
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:57,497
because I truly believe that we all should

269
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,406
just hold hands and sing--

270
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:03,406
♪ - Aroo dory, la who flory, ♪

271
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,459
♪ Welcome Chris-- ♪

272
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,333
Yeah.

273
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,231
- Anyways, we should sing that.

274
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:12,560
This is a cute little small
town, we love it here!

275
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,572
- Yeah.

276
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:17,739
- [Crowd In Unison] Six,
five, four, three, two, one!

277
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,853
(cheering)

278
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,984
- [Bryan] Merry Christmas!

279
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,224
- [Missy] Merry Christmas!

280
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:37,487
- [Bryan] Merry Christmas, Ollie!

281
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,404
- Merry Christmas dada!

282
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:43,239
- [Bryan] Merry Christmas, Finn!

283
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:46,908
(holiday music)

284
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:58,274
- Wow!

285
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:01,531
Finn are you gonna jump?

286
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,442
Wow!

287
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,141
Aw, it's a little too much for Finn.

288
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:05,019
Jump, wow!

289
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,726
Now jump from the bed to the couch, Ollie.

290
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:08,559
- Okay.

291
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,276
- [Bryan] Wow!

292
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,580
Alright, you ready?

293
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,319
Now jump to the couch, wow!

294
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:16,152
(laughing)

295
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:17,675
- I'm flying like a bird!

296
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,756
- Wow, Finn's gettin' closer.

297
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:21,819
This is what happens around bed time.

298
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,535
The kids have a little bit of energy left.

299
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:25,919
Go Finn, go!

300
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,819
Oh, he doesn't even get close.

301
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:30,020
(laughing)

302
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,257
It's a big jump.

303
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,507
Wow, oh, Ollie!

304
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,614
You're such a bug.

305
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:38,048
(laughing)

306
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,039
Try again Finn, try again!

307
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,872
- Come on Finn!

308
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,892
- [Bryan] Jump!

309
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:41,879
- Can I jump with--

310
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,330
- [Bryan] No, oh my goodness,

311
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,399
- Alright guys, I am ending
the blog today with my boys.

312
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,663
