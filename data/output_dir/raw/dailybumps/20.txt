00:00:04,258 --> 00:00:05,290
(laughing)

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,322
- You guys are so cute!

8
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:15,150
Good morning!

9
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:17,225
Good morning, Finn.

10
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,328
- Meh!

11
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,161
(laughing)

12
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:22,470
- So we are headed off to a
doctor's appointment today.

13
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,490
We've been looking
forward to this doctor's

14
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,350
appointment for a little while now.

15
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,950
And I'm definitely hoping
for some good news.

16
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,783
Now I don't think we're gonna get

17
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:31,030
any like bad news necessarily.

18
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,850
But I'm just hoping for like good news.

19
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,420
I'm headed in right now, and I'll give you

20
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,368
more information on what we're doin'.

21
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,840
But we're almost late,
actually, so I gotta head in.

22
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Really quick, I was kind
of rushing this morning

23
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,580
and I grabbed these shoes
and I figured they probably

24
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,210
were a little small, but
they're so small that we can't

25
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,170
even close this.
(laughing)

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,444
You've got little, chubby feet, huh?

27
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:51,277
- Yeah.

28
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:52,110
- Yeah.

29
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,900
So, if you guys watched a few weeks ago,

30
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,271
we went to the hospital and
had his kidneys checked,

31
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,530
and we actually don't have
the results for that yet.

32
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,750
But now we are checking his heart.

33
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,583
And if you guys don't know,

34
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,745
it's the same kind of scenario.

35
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:07,570
He has an enlarged aortic valve.

36
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,250
It's just like slightly dilated.

37
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,190
It's not really like a big deal,

38
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,860
but we've just been keeping an eye on it.

39
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,030
We checked me and Bryan,

40
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,410
and we don't have any issues.

41
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,230
So we're just making sure that this one

42
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,680
doesn't have any issues.
(laughing)

43
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,070
Actually Ollie had it
when he was in my belly.

44
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,588
It ended up fixing itself before,

45
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:25,500
yeah, by the time he was born.

46
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,519
Finn just still has it,

47
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,050
and we need to make sure it's all better.

48
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,633
(upbeat music)

49
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,323
- [Man] Look, look.

50
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:40,156
- [Woman] Look!

51
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:40,989
Smile.
- Picture time.

52
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:41,822
- Say cheese.
- Say cheese.

53
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:43,294
- Say, daddy, look how big I am.

54
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:44,295
- [Man] Yeah.

55
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:46,906
- [Woman] It is givin' your arm a hug?

56
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:47,739
(laughing)

57
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,787
- Yeah it says, I love you.

58
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:52,370
(gentle music)

59
00:01:57,628 --> 00:02:00,550
Finn, you did so good, huh?

60
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,130
Was that easy?

61
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,090
Yeah, you did so good.

62
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,070
He's literally a pro, guys.

63
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,031
He got a little impatient there

64
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:07,330
'cause it definitely took longer

65
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,900
than like when we did
the kidney ultrasound.

66
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,470
But overall, he did very, very good.

67
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,380
He mostly just like watched
a show, they got a movie on.

68
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,312
He watched YouTube and he did great.

69
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:20,210
He got comfy.

70
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,630
He took all his shoes and socks off even.

71
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,490
You're like let's get comfy, huh?

72
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,050
All right, we are out
and it went really good.

73
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,440
Normally his aortic valve, on a scale,

74
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,320
it was like considered like moderate.

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,870
But there hasn't been much of a change.

76
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,148
So because of the scale
changes with like his age

77
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:40,440
and all that, it's actually
now considered mild,

78
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,650
which is awesome.

79
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,530
So if his aortic valve just kind of like

80
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,930
stays the same and doesn't
really keep growing

81
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,030
at a faster rate than like that,

82
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,180
then we'll be fine.

83
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,420
But we're basically just watching that

84
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,195
it's not growing faster than he's growing

85
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:53,660
and getting too large.

86
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,520
Everything looks really, really awesome.

87
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,780
Yay!

88
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,340
So that is just really,
really good news to hear,

89
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,040
but I will say that, I
don't know about you guys,

90
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,900
but I have extreme anxiety
when it comes to ultrasounds.

91
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,100
Whenever I walk into a room
with an ultrasound machine,

92
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,810
I instantly, like I didn't
even feel it before I went

93
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,755
in there, but as soon as
I walk into that room,

94
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,900
my anxiety level just went whoosh.

95
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,390
And my heart starts
beating like really hard,

96
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,980
and obviously it's because of just like

97
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,155
past like situations that I've been in,

98
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:24,160
usually always involving a ultrasound.

99
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,750
It just kind of all comes back to like

100
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,890
my losses and any bad news has always come

101
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,320
from an ultrasound for me.

102
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,990
So I don't like ultrasounds.

103
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,400
But the really frustrating
part is that I already have

104
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,330
this like anxiety, but as soon as he put

105
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,260
the wand on his heart--
- Mm hmm.

106
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,488
- And he could see it, he
literally said, hmm that's weird.

107
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,180
(laughing)
- It's like, what the heck?

108
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,013
- And like did you--

109
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,210
- Yeah, I immediately, was just like

110
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,030
staring at the machine--
- What?

111
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,884
What's weird?
- Like the screen.

112
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:50,717
- I like, I mean

113
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:53,340
at this point, like I literally got hot.

114
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,270
Like literally, like I
felt like I was on fire.

115
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,110
My heart was beating.

116
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,270
I felt like I was gonna cry.

117
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,790
They're not allowed to say anything,

118
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,170
like as far as like if
something looks bad,

119
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,470
or good, or anything.

120
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,840
I don't know what he was saying was weird,

121
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,800
whether like his computer
screen was weird,

122
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,960
or his little wand was weird,

123
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,099
or something was actually
weird on the screen.

124
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,210
But like it just stressed me out

125
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,290
for the rest of the time.

126
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,180
I was totally freaking out.

127
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,279
Obviously it was nothing.

128
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,112
- There was nothing.

129
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:18,946
- It was literally nothing.

130
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:19,959
- It was like his wand

131
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,959
was being weird.
- Something was weird.

132
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,660
Something was weird, but not his heart.

133
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,220
Ultrasound techs need
to be extremely careful,

134
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,779
because even if you don't have my past,

135
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,162
I'm sure most parents
go into a room like that

136
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:32,570
scared of what they're gonna find out.

137
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,402
I just think they need to be so, so, so,

138
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:35,780
so, so, so careful.

139
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,797
Everything's fine though, so that's good.

140
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:40,888
(upbeat music)

141
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:41,840
- All right.

142
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,387
So we have been running around
all day, getting stuff done,

143
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:48,030
and now it's time to
do a little unplugging,

144
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,580
and play a card game.

145
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,786
So we got Mimi and Papa here,

146
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:54,810
and we are gonna have a
little family game day.

147
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,440
- Thank you so much Mattel
for sponsoring this video.

148
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,530
Today we are playing DOS by UNO.

149
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,780
- UNO is probably one of
our favorite card games,

150
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,526
so when we learnt they were launching DOS,

151
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:08,075
we had to try it out,
and I think it's gonna

152
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,844
be a regular on our game nights now.

153
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:10,677
- I know!

154
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,554
It's so fun!

155
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:13,310
- DOS is so easy to learn,

156
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,710
but Missy is pretty much the
game master in this family,

157
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,610
so I'm going to leave
it up to her to explain.

158
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,038
- So, like UNO, you must
match numbers and colors,

159
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,830
but doubles the fun with two cards

160
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,640
in the center instead of just one.

161
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,720
Players also match numbers first,

162
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,490
with an added bonus if
there's a match for color.

163
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,210
- And don't forget to yell DOS,

164
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,460
when you only have two
cards left in your head.

165
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,710
- DOS!

166
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,889
- Which I just forgot to do,

167
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:38,510
so now I have to pick up DOS cards.

168
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,780
- My favorite way to
unplug is playing games,

169
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,760
and we had so much fun playing DOS.

170
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,500
- DOS by UNO is available
at Target right now,

171
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,860
and we're also gonna
have a link down below

172
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,890
in the description for
you to check out more.

173
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,925
Oh, hey, guys!

174
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:52,380
- Hi.

175
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,572
- Say, hi, boys.

176
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:54,720
- [Boys] Hi!

177
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,360
- Finn did so good at his
appointment, I just heard.

178
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,193
Didn't you?

179
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,026
- Yeah.

180
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,859
- Yeah.

181
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,760
They are now snacking on some Pop-Tarts,

182
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,540
and I am taking both
the boys to swim class,

183
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,251
because it's time to
get our swim on, right?

184
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,680
- [Boys] Yeah.

185
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,730
- It's been one of those mornings

186
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,920
where I'm like rushing, rushing,
can't get anything done.

187
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,960
I didn't even eat breakfast today,

188
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,710
so I actually made myself a shake

189
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,240
in like my little blender bottle.

190
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,520
It's like a green one, and it's ...

191
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,680
Tastes interesting, but it will definitely

192
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,730
at least fill me up for breakfast.

193
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,700
'Cause you got to have breakfast.

194
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,375
Okay, come on!
(upbeat music)

195
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,708
(upbeat cheerful music)

196
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,220
Finn, you did so good!

197
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,610
Oh, you got a tattoo of a cow!

198
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,335
What does a cow sound make?

199
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,168
- Moo!

200
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,660
- [Bryan] Good job!

201
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,830
You did so good, too, Ollie!

202
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,750
I'm so proud of you boys and your school,

203
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,587
your swim school.

204
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:03,420
- Yeah.

205
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,450
- Doing good.

206
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,360
Ollie actually begged to go
swimming in our pool today

207
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,370
this morning when he woke up,

208
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,430
and I was like, Well, you're in luck,

209
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,580
'cause you're going to swim school.

210
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,940
It's also still like 60 degrees out,

211
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,520
so it's probably not swimming time.

212
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,291
Not yet, but it's almost summer, right?

213
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,055
- [Boys] Yeah!

214
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:21,114
- [Bryan] Finn, are
you excited for summer?

215
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:21,947
Yeah.

216
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:22,780
- I'm excited for summer.

217
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,290
- [Bryan] Yeah, 'cause it's
gonna be your birthday!

218
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,420
Do you know how old you're going to be?

219
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,500
- Yeah, five!

220
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,300
- [Bryan] Oh, one more,
there you go, five!

221
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,546
That's crazy!

222
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:32,340
- I'm gonna have a Harry Potter birthday!

223
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,373
- [Bryan] You are?

224
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:34,206
- Yeah.

225
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:37,220
- He does want a Harry
Potter birthday right now.

226
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,130
We'll see if it changes
in a couple months or so,

227
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,250
but yeah, it's so crazy
that Ollie's gonna be five.

228
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,590
He has been in swim school

229
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,490
since he was six months old, you guys.

230
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,320
We are huge advocates for swim safety.

231
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,280
This is California.

232
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,113
It's hot.

233
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:51,070
Everyone's got a pool.

234
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,840
We have to teach our kids
to be safe around the pool,

235
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,190
so that's what we're doing.

236
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,230
That's what we're still doing.

237
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,430
Finn's still getting there.

238
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,770
He's uh, he's doin'
pretty good for his age.

239
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,360
I feel like Ollie was a
little bit more advanced,

240
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,193
but we'll see.

241
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:02,950
He almost floated on his back,

242
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,200
on his own the whole time.

243
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,760
A couple of times he got
a little water in his nose

244
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,950
and he got like upset,
but he tried it again.

245
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,250
He actually tried laying
on his back again,

246
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,830
so I was super proud of him.

247
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,970
These boys, I love my boys.

248
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,190
You guys are awesome.

249
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,127
Okay, you guys wanna go eat?

250
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,970
- [Boys] Yeah!

251
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,140
- All right, we are back,
and it is now lunchtime.

252
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,660
What are we eatin' Ollie?

253
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,170
- Mexican food!

254
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,860
- Yeah, the boys really
wanted quesadillas,

255
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,250
so I stopped at Del Taco
and got 'em quesadillas.

256
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,440
And check out what I'm eating!

257
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,240
This is actually a steamed pork bao bun.

258
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,330
I've never had one of these,

259
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,360
and I've always wanted them,
and I also got some sushi

260
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,570
'cause I've been craving sushi.

261
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,010
I have no idea how to eat this,

262
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,325
so please don't murder me in the comments

263
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,440
(laughing)
if I'm doing this wrong.

264
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,390
I'm just going to take
a bite like a sandwich.

265
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,840
(upbeat music)

266
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,010
Oh my gosh, it's so good!

267
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,277
It's like so fluffy.

268
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:52,110
- Wait, I want to

269
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,943
see what's in it.
- And it's got

270
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:53,776
roasted pork in it.

271
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,408
- Why is it smoke coming out of it?

272
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:56,560
- Smoke's comin' out because it's probably

273
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,600
just a little bit warm.

274
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,890
These are so good, you guys.

275
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,510
Nothing like eating a little sushi

276
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,290
in front of our fish.
(laughing)

277
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,680
Sorry, guys, I'm hungry.

278
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,250
I promise I will never eat
you guys, though, okay?

279
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,850
- You are funny dada.

280
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,888
- [Bryan] Well, thanks!

281
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:13,836
- Hey, dada, what about
a marmalade quesadilla?

282
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,428
- [Bryan] A marmalade quesadilla?

283
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:16,440
- Yeah.

284
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,710
- That's not one of the
craziest things I've ever heard.

285
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,810
I mean, would you still have the cheese?

286
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,643
- No.

287
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,246
- [Bryan] No, so you
would take the cheese out?

288
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:24,190
- Yeah.

289
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,628
- [Bryan] I think that
could be yummy, huh?

290
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:26,461
- Yeah.

291
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:27,419
- [Bryan] Do you wanna try it?

292
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:28,252
- No.

293
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:29,085
- Maybe we should make one.

294
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,370
It's just tortillas and marmalade.

295
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,318
- Yeah!

296
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,949
- Yeah!

297
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,366
- I'm so excited!

298
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,660
- He's so funny.

299
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,200
These boys seriously love marmalade,

300
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,374
ever since they started
watching Paddington.

301
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:41,240
- Quesadillas!

302
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,440
- [Bryan] So yeah, grab some tortillas.

303
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,450
We're gonna need those.

304
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,740
Here grab these ones, there we go.

305
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,070
And now we need the marmalade.

306
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,300
All right, let's see if
the marmalade is in here.

307
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,260
Marmalade, there it is!

308
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,093
- [Ollie] There it is!

309
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:52,960
- [Bryan] Strawberry marmalade?

310
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,810
- Yeah.

311
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,150
- [Bryan] All right, so
we have our tortilla,

312
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,690
and we have our marmalade,

313
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,160
but one thing about quesadillas, Ollie,

314
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,450
is they're warm.

315
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,300
So maybe we should heat up
the tortilla a little bit,

316
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,130
and then put the cold
marmalade in the middle.

317
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,090
Would that be yummy?

318
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,923
- Yeah.

319
00:10:05,923 --> 00:10:06,756
- [Bryan] Okay.

320
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,120
- This is going to be so cool!

321
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,580
- I know he is so excited,

322
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,940
and I'm like, yeah, sure,

323
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,500
I'll let you guys create
your own lunch masterpiece.

324
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,320
So we're just going to toss the tortilla

325
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds.

326
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,910
How does that feel, Finn?

327
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,743
Is it hot?

328
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:23,576
- Hot.

329
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:24,409
- [Bryan] Okay, all right, Ollie,

330
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:27,240
so now go ahead and scoop some marmalade

331
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,085
and put it right in the
middle of the tortilla.

332
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:30,918
- No.

333
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,490
- Finn's like, no, he's
eating a real quesadilla.

334
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,820
He's like, this, I'm not so sure about.

335
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,240
I think it's gonna be yummy.

336
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,073
- Yeah.

337
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:39,060
- Okay, put that in the middle.

338
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,920
There we go, and that
should honestly be plenty.

339
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,029
We'll just spread it around on this half

340
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,326
of the tortilla, okay?

341
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:47,159
- [Ollie] Yeah.

342
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,992
- [Bryan] Okay.

343
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:48,870
- This is going to be mine

344
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,820
because I really want to taste it.

345
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:54,649
(upbeat music)

346
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:55,624
- All right, we have our marmalade

347
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:58,470
on half of the quesadilla now.

348
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,870
I'm just going to flip that over,

349
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,940
and sandwich it together just like that.

350
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,190
Ollie's gettin' so excited!
(laughing)

351
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,920
Yeah, all right, I think we're gonna

352
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,090
try it in the microwave just a little bit.

353
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,509
- It's going to be so fun, guys!

354
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,980
(laughing)
- I don't think

355
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,070
I've ever let Ollie really do this,

356
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,792
create like his own lunch before,

357
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,560
so this should be pretty interesting.

358
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,290
- I never tried marmalade before.

359
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,910
- Well, you've tried marmalade
but you've definitely never

360
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,437
had a marmalade quesadilla, have you?

361
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:26,270
- Yeah.

362
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,660
- Yeah, and honestly, I
don't know if we should

363
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,801
really be calling it a quesadilla,

364
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:29,730
'cause there's no cheese.

365
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,708
Um, okay, things are still gettin' crazy!

366
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,432
Finn is about to dip his quesadilla

367
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:34,930
into the marmalade.

368
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,924
Go ahead, you can try it!

369
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:40,280
(upbeat music)

370
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,113
How is it?

371
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:42,064
- Good.

372
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:42,897
- [Bryan] Do you like it?

373
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:44,050
- Yeah.

374
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,850
- [Bryan] All right, let's cut up this

375
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,720
little marmalade
quesadilla for you, Ollie.

376
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,490
So it's easy to eat.

377
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:54,770
(gentle music)

378
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,530
All right, we have two quesadillas here.

379
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,470
We're got your traditional
one with cheese,

380
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,420
that Ollie's been eating.

381
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,724
And we have our marmalade quesadilla,

382
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:04,594
that he just invented all on his own, huh?

383
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:05,427
- Yeah.

384
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:07,040
- That's your first invention, dude!

385
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
Okay, let's give it a try.

386
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,900
Let's do the taste test.

387
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,315
(upbeat music)

388
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,719
- [Bryan] Oh, there's
marmalade everywhere!

389
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,520
(laughing)

390
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,659
What do you think?

391
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:17,492
- Good.

392
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:18,699
- [Bryan] You like it?

393
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,280
Oh, goodness, he's dripping
marmalade everywhere.

394
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,270
It's okay, Ollie.

395
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,930
We'll change your pants.
(laughing)

396
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,120
Here Finnie, you try
one, a bite, too, kay?

397
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,503
What do you think?

398
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:30,350
- Yay!

399
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,427
- [Bryan] Is it good?

400
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,560
- Yay!

401
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,393
- [Bryan] I'm not sure if it's good,

402
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:34,710
but it's very messy!

403
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,543
Do you like it?

404
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:36,376
- Mm hmm.

405
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,290
- [Bryan] You definitely
like marmalade on tortillas?

406
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,950
That's awesome!

407
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,580
And you are now eating your own quesadilla

408
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,950
dipped in marmalade, yeah?

409
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,040
- So we're outside having
some fun family time,

410
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,240
and you have to see it's so cute.

411
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,265
Take him for a ride.
(laughing)

412
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:55,015
(peaceful music)

413
00:12:57,368 --> 00:12:58,560
You guys are so cute!

414
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,014
Ollie, pull, pull!

415
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,220
We're just playing with the kids,

416
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,290
and they're being so cute.

417
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,330
Here, let's pull him this way,

418
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,080
and see if you can get him to turn.

419
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,949
What do you think of that Finn?

420
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:11,782
- Yeah.

421
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:12,615
- Good?

422
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:13,660
They are just so cute.

423
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,946
We're just havin' a fun time out here,

424
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:17,680
hanging out as a fam.

425
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,950
Hanging out with the
doggies and the chickens.

426
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,430
Oh, my gosh, you have a new.

427
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,200
He's trying to pull him on the bike.

428
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,191
I see.

429
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:27,157
(laughing)

430
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:29,200
That was just silly, huh?

431
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,310
And, go!

432
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,540
Go, Ollie, go!
(laughing)

433
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,456
I know, it's too hard.

434
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:39,960
You've got to push it with your hands.

435
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,740
Oh, already coming up
with crazy stunts, huh?

436
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,634
(gentle guitar music)

437
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,610
- [Bryan] Look, you guys, we have fruit

438
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,590
in our fruit trees in our backyard!

439
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,296
That's so cool!

440
00:14:09,296 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
