00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:02,784
- [Missy] Finn's hair is a little wild.

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:05,280
Do you think it's time
for a little haircut bud?

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,113
- [Finn] Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:07,799
- [Missy] Yeah, I think so too.

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,901
You just twirl this thing into knots.

6
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:13,335
And I think it's time to relieve
those knots with a haircut.

29
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:52,266

We're so excited though
'cause we had so much fun.

00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,946
- Vote it video!
- Yeah, we had so much fun.

36
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:06,041
Do you remember that?

37
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,208
- We fought monsters!
- Ooh, get ready!

38
00:01:11,243 --> 00:01:13,170
It's fun huh?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,736
- [Bryan] Yeah, we're
just hangin' in my office

40
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,486
with Miss Luna Lovegood.

41
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,541
Do you like Luna, Ollie?
- Yeah.

42
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,829
- [Bryan] Yeah, can you give her a hug?

43
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,047
She needs some puppy love.

44
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,126
She needs some puppy love.

45
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,205
No, give her a real hug. (Ollie laughs)

46
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:27,038
Pet her.

47
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:29,966
She needs love. (laughs)

48
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,892
Aww, they're gettin' to
be best friends, huh?

49
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:33,725
- Yeah.

50
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:35,051
- [Bryan] What is this
thing she's chewin' on.

51
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,340
Is that your toy?

52
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,209
- No, that's Finn's toy.

53
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,661
- Uh-oh Luna,

54
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:41,679
you're supposed to be chewing on that?

55
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:43,954
She's goin' be in trouble. (laughs)

56
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:44,787
Good morning guys.

57
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:49,107
It is a B-E-A-Utiful day here
in sunny Southern California.

58
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:52,278
- Lovegood scared me like a bam-pire.

59
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,135
- [Byran] She's scaring
you like a vampire?

60
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:54,968
- Yeah.

61
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:56,969
Dogs can be scary sometimes like vampires.

62
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,417
Today is a really fun day
because it's a big day for Finn.

63
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,250
Finally!

64
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,053
And also it's iPhone 10 release day.

65
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:06,057
So my iPhone 10 is on the
way and I'm really excited.

66
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:07,750
And of course I'll show it to you guys

67
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,032
and we can have some fun with it.

68
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,454
Hey what do you want to do today kiddo?

69
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:12,533
It's Friday.
- Friday?

70
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,298
- Dude, it's Friday!

71
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:15,834
What do you want to do?

72
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,251
- I want do is go

73
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,317
to Billy Beez.

74
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:21,977
- He always wants to go to Billy Beez

75
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:23,626
and play at the indoor playground.

76
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:25,449
Maybe, okay?
- Okay.

77
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:28,616
(upbeat music sting)

78
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:30,791
- Ready? (Ollie laughs)

79
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,708
Kisses, kisses, not me, him, Karma!

80
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:36,673
Kisses, kisses,

81
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,142
eww, eww!

82
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:39,866
Oh not me! (Missy laughs)

83
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,272
- [Missy] Did he kiss you on the mouth?

84
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:42,105
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:43,385
- [Missy] Eww!

86
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:46,938
Ollie, you are lookin' so
handsome today. (laughs)

87
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:49,423
Ollie is gettin' in the
car and Finn is in the car,

88
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:52,290
and Finn's hair is a little wild.

89
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,786
Do you think it's time
for a little haircut bud?

90
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:55,684
- Mm-hmm

91
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:57,297
- Yeah, I think so too.

92
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:59,434
You just twirl this thing into knots.

93
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:03,487
And I think it's time to relieve
those knots with a haircut.

94
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:06,599
Me and my mom are headed
out, and as you guys can see,

95
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,154
Finny is forward-facing, aren't you baby?

96
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:12,349
You get to see mama?
(kids yelling)

97
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:13,846
And so is Ollie.

98
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:15,959
It's pretty cool that I can see them both.

99
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,219
But I will say, this is not
necessarily my preference.

100
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,149
I think I've did rear-facing with Ollie

101
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,798
'til he was two and a half.

102
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:25,631
- [Mimi] Yeah.

103
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:29,601
- I did it as far as I could
pretty much take it. (laughs)

104
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,645
But Finn, it has been has
been kind of torturous

105
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,315
and I've just wanted to
make sure I make it to two.

106
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,171
But as you guys know, every
time we leave the house,

107
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:40,894
Finn screams, he cries,
he gets super car sick.

108
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:44,412
He often throws up, which is really hard.

109
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:47,953
And I kinda just held it
out as long as I could

110
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:49,939
and once he reached two I was like,

111
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,668
"I think I'm just gonna turn him around."

112
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:53,294
'Gain, it's not my preference.

113
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:55,198
I'd prefer him to be rear-facing

114
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:57,392
'cause I know it is actually a lot safer.

115
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:59,949
And if you don't know
about that, rear-facing,

116
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:03,795
extended rear-facing is a lot
safer than forward-facing,

117
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:05,780
and it does give me a
little anxiety with him,

118
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,639
forward-facing,

119
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,578
but think it was just
kind of the right decision

120
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:09,924
for our family at this time.

121
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:10,843
But it is pretty cute.

122
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:12,167
I love being able to just turn around

123
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,036
and see your face, huh?

124
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:16,288
- Ya.
- Yeah, ha ha!

125
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,529
And he has been a lot happier in the car

126
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,934
'cause he can see me and talk to me

127
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,725
and he knows that I'm listening to him.

128
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,792
Are you ready to go?
- I wanna talk.

129
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,963
- Yeah, say stop talkin' mama.

130
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:29,250
And now when we take the truck,

131
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,628
they can both watch the movie, huh?

132
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:34,868
Finn, where we headed?

133
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:37,096
- What we gonna do?
- D'er!

134
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:38,571
- [Missy] Are we gonna cut your hair?

135
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:39,404
- Ya.

136
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,237
- [Missy] Yeah!

137
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:42,484
Are you excited to watch your
brother get his hair cut?

138
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:43,317
- Yeah.

139
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,015
- [Missy] Yeah, you love haircuts, huh?

140
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:45,848
- Yeah.

141
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:46,681
- I am a little nervous

142
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:49,920
because Ollie's first few haircuts

143
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,940
were not his favorite.

144
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,018
He would cry, he would move a lot,

145
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:55,388
and it was a little stressful.

146
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:57,803
But now Ollie loves getting his haircut.

147
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:00,566
And I'm hoping that maybe Finn
will, since Ollie loves it.

148
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,481
- And I'm hoping that the curls stays.

149
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:03,561
- Yes, we are hoping that--

150
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,093
- Pretty sure that he has curly hair.

151
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:06,227
- [Missy] I think his curly hair.

152
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:08,374
I feel like this is a little too long,

153
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,323
and just the fact that he
can twirl it into a knot,

154
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:12,824
I don't like either.

155
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:15,645
But hopefully you still
got your curly hair after.

156
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:18,978
(upbeat, playful music)

157
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:41,251
- [Hairdresser] Gonna fly!

158
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:42,418
- [Missy] Yay.

159
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:50,861
He was totally fine and then
he freaked out. (laughs)

160
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,848
Poor baby.

161
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,530
We're gonna try sittin' with Mimi.

162
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,030
- Yup, no problem.

163
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,189
- [Missy] What's that?

164
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:28,042
Finn, you're doin' so good, high five.

165
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,191
High five.

166
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,967
Yeah, knuckles.

167
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,683
Good job dude.

168
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,614
- Put your arm up here
please. (razor buzzing)

169
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:37,403
- [Missy] You're doin' so good.

170
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:39,934
I'm so proud of you bud.

171
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,517
You getting your first haircut?

172
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:57,609
(gasps) You got a haircut!

173
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:58,776
It's so short.

174
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:01,592
I miss it already.

175
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:04,575
But it definitely still has it's curl.

176
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,352
You've got curly hair.

177
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,852
Check it out guys.

178
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,495
What do you think of your hair?

179
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:13,236
Do you like it?

180
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:14,815
He's like, "I don't know mom,

181
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:15,648
"I gotta go play."

182
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:18,981
(upbeat, playful music)

183
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:25,148
And they also sent me home
with this cute little thing

184
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:26,379
that says my first haircut

185
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,565
and it's got his cute
little curly hairs in it.

186
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:31,798
So cute.

187
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:32,994
I was actually really surprised,

188
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,722
'cause he was just sittin'
in that chair, totally cool.

189
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,701
And then last second he
totally freaked out. (laughs)

190
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:40,120
- Crocodile tears.

191
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,896
- I know, he was like,
"Get me out of here.

192
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:42,883
"I'm not doing this."

193
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:45,101
So he sat with Mimi.
- Now walk, walk.

194
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:49,520
- He sat with Mimi, and he
did a really good job, so yay!

195
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,603
(upbeat music sting)

196
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,731
- I may have embarrassed
Corbin a little bit

197
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:57,763
because I was running after the UPS man.

198
00:07:57,763 --> 00:07:59,946
- He literally heard the
breaks squeaking (Bryan laughs)

199
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,269
and ran out that door.

200
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,266
- Yeah and I chased him down.

201
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,530
iPhone 10 is here!
- Yeah!

202
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,134
- I'm so excited to try out
this new Apple iPhone 10.

203
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:11,157
- Yes.
- It just came.

204
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,897
It's early too, it's noon,
so I'm really excited.

205
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:15,999
Corbin's gonna vlog me unboxing it.

206
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:19,574
♫ Doo-dah-doo-doo

207
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:20,836
Whoa, look at that dude.

208
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:23,471
- [Corbin] Oh shoot, that is so cool.

209
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:25,349
- All Screen iPhone.

210
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:26,746
- [Corbin] Dang, it's all glass too huh?

211
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:27,987
That is so cool.

212
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:28,820
- [Corbin] The front and back.

213
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,702
- It's all glass too.

214
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:32,605
And you know what, it's so
much smaller than the Plus.

215
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:33,438
- [Corbin] Oh really?

216
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:34,897
- I might love it.

217
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:35,730
- [Corbin] That's cool.

218
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,929
- I might love being
on a smaller phone now.

219
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,641
- [Corbin] Yeah something the
big phones are just too big.

220
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:40,475
That's cool

221
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:41,308
- Take this off.

222
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:42,140
Oh it's turning on.

223
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,010
This is so weird.

224
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,486
It doesn't feel like an iPhone.

225
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:46,565
- [Corbin] No?

226
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:47,471
- It feels like--

227
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:49,421
- [Corbin] It looks way small.

228
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,536
- Dude look at that.

229
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:51,871
- [Corbin] That is so cool.

230
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:53,264
- Oh, oh my goodness.

231
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:54,182
- [Corbin] The screen's all white.

232
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:55,834
- Yeah, this is gonna be
perfect, look at that.

233
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,020
- [Corbin] Whoa, it looks
so crazy. (Bryan laughs)

234
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,853
Oh my God.

235
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,480
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

236
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,384
- [Corbin] Quick start,
that is really cool.

237
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:05,752
- Okay I finally have my iPhone activated

238
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:08,179
and now I'm going to set up Face ID.

239
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,431
Okay I'm really excited about this.

240
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:12,498
Okay, position your head
in the camera frame,

241
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,109
move your head in a circle.

242
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:16,576
Move your head slowly
to complete the circle.

243
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:18,062
- [Corbin] This is so weird.

244
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:19,895
It's the future, dude!

245
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,177
- [Bryan] Done, first face
ID scan complete, cool.

246
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:24,201
(phone beeping)

247
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:28,938
Okay, I'm gonna try and use
Anemoji on the new iPhone 10.

248
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:29,843
Tap to start.

249
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:32,593
Okay, I definitely wanna be poop?

250
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:34,893
- [Corbin] Poop,

251
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:36,147
rabbit,

252
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:36,980
unicorn?

253
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,504
- [Bryan] Look I can be
one of Missy's chickens.

254
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:39,456
- [Corbin] That is so cool.

255
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:41,894
- Oh hey! (chuckles)

256
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:42,765
- [Corbin] That's awesome.

257
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,085
- Hey babe, what would you
do if one of your chickens

258
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,003
just came into the house

259
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,441
and started talking to you like this?

260
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,623
Would you freak out?

261
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:52,831
Or would you be like?

262
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:55,710
Sending Missy an Anemoji
now for the first time.

263
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,825
She's gonna be so jealous

264
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,251
that she can't do this on
her phone. (Corbin laughs)

265
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:02,316
Hey babe, what would you
do if one of your chickens

266
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,350
just came into the house

267
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,741
and started talking to you like this?

268
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,144
Would you freak out?

269
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:08,977
Or would you be like?

270
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:12,227
(upbeat, lively music)

271
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:18,512
Alright so I have met up
with Finn and the boys,

272
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:20,335
and Kelsey and Corbin too.
- Aah!

273
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:23,121
- We just ate a ton of
pho, which was so good.

274
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:25,223
I love Finn's new haircut.

275
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:27,092
He looks so different.

276
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:27,925
- He looks like a grown up.

277
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,019
He looks like a man.
- He's a little boy.

278
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,796
He's a little boy. (smooching)

279
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,862
He's like, "I know."
(Missy and Bryan laugh)

280
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:35,231
Oh he doesn't like the blue? (laughs)

281
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:36,647
He's like, "Give me somethin' better."

282
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,889
- Alright, we are back home.

283
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,596
We actually did a little bit of shoppin',

284
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,995
some fun stuff with
Kelsey and Corbin today.

285
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:45,408
But now the kids just
finished eating their dinner

286
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:49,274
and I've got cookies in the oven, mm-mm!

287
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,586
They were so good today,

288
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:52,734
and we had promised them all day

289
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:55,346
that we were gonna go to a
playground and do something fun,

290
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:58,458
and then our whole day just
ended up getting swept away.

291
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,355
And so these boys ate their
dinner like a good boy.

292
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:03,873
Did you eat all your dinner?
- Yeah.

293
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,290
- [Missy] I'm so proud of you.

294
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,323
Finn?

295
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,320
Did you eat all your dinner?

296
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,153
- Aah!

297
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,460
- [Missy] You're so cute
with your little haircut,

298
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,653
you know that?
- Aah! (Missy laughs)

299
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:13,568
Yeah I know.

300
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,379
- Yeah, you look like a little man.

301
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,179
And since they ate all their dinner

302
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,700
they are gonna get a cookie.

303
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,698
So I'm pretty excited about that.

304
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:22,229
And I though I would break
out one if Finn's toys

305
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,133
that he got for his birthday,

306
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:27,419
that we kind of put away
for a day when we're like,

307
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,951
"Ooh, let's play with something fun."

308
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:33,700
And so I'm gonna break out
the Marvel Mr. Potato Head.

309
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,244
It's Spiderman versus Iron Man.

310
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,614
It's got two Mr. Potato heads

311
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:41,429
and then all kinds of fun
little do-dads that go with it.

312
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:42,262
So I'm pretty excited.

313
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:43,936
I think the boys are
gonna be super excited.

314
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,353
I don't remember who this is from.

315
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:46,467
I feel really bad.

316
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:48,302
But I know they are gonna
be so excited, ready?

317
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:50,113
(gasps)
(box bangs)

318
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:52,354
What do you think of that?

319
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:55,012
(growling)

320
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:56,719
That look fun?
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,704
- [Ollie] Which one is the bad guy?

322
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:00,060
- [Missy] I don't even
think there is a bad guy.

323
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,251
I think this just a bunch
of fun stuff to play with

324
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:03,415
and they're both good guys.

325
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,218
So lets open it up 'kay?

326
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:06,051
Da da da!

327
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:08,132
Spiderman.

328
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:09,583
What's Spiderman's theme song?

329
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:13,890
♫ Spiderman, Spiderman, does
whatever a spiderman can

330
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,970
I don't know. (laughs)

331
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,803
I think that's it.

332
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:18,163
And then Iron Man, I don't
know Iron Man's song.

333
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:19,695
- Iron Man doesn't have a song.

334
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:20,528
- [Missy] Oh, okay.

335
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:21,553
Well you would know.

336
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:23,678
- [Finn] His gear kit comes off.

337
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:24,511
- [Missy] Wow,

338
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,288
alright let's open all the
little special toys, 'kay?

339
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,320
Cookies are done.

340
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,980
Oop.
(alarm beeping)

341
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,767
Ooh yeah, those look delicious.

342
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:37,610
Don't worry, we've packed your angry eyes.

343
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,862
Look at these things. (laughs)

344
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:41,720
The boys are having a blast right now.

345
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,881
Putting them all together.

346
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,620
Look at that guy, he looks scary.

347
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,140
Oh you're gonna put his
eyeballs in his ear slot?

348
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,973
- [Finn] Yeah.

349
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,897
- That just looks weird. (laughs)

350
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:54,230
(bouncy, playful music)

351
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:02,401
Alright, and guess what boys?
- What?

352
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:03,724
- Cookies are done.

353
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:05,582
Tell me how they are? (Finn whines)

354
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,648
Careful, careful, they're gooey and hot.

355
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:08,635
There you go.

356
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:11,793
Whoa, look at that, all over me.

357
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:15,427
How is it?
- Good. (Missy laughs)

358
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,260
I mean--

359
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,784
- [Missy] Does mama make
the best cookies ever?

360
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,897
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right.

361
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:23,914
And I would say that these
cookies turned out amazing.

362
00:13:23,914 --> 00:13:27,710
Because as you can tell, I
went a little bit crispier.

363
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,402
I am more of a crispy,
crunchy, cookie girl.

364
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:34,990
Bryan is more of a
chewy, gooey, cookie guy.

365
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,556
So let me know down in the Comments,

366
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:39,207
do you like your cookies chewy and soft,

367
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:40,844
or do you like 'em a little crunchy?

368
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:41,677
Let me know.

369
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:43,538
- Oh, look at my little elf.

370
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:44,699
Look at my little elf.

371
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,099
He's so cute, wearin' his
Christmas jammies. (Finn laughs)

372
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:50,538
Finn did you like your
first haircut today?

373
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,071
- Ya.
- You did?

374
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:54,682
- Ya.
- His hair looks so good,

375
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:55,832
doesn't it you guys?

376
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:59,679
- On-gia-on-da-y-e, gia.
- Oh really?

377
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,201
- Oh.
- Oh! (laughs)

378
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,868
(Finn gurgles)

379
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,916
- He is so cute now with his new haircut.

380
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:06,749
I just love it.

381
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:08,145
But anyway that's all for today's video.

382
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,097
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

383
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,556
If you did be sure to give it a Thumbs Up.

384
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:13,548
Yay, Thumbs Up if you
enjoyed today's video.

385
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,080
We'll see you manana.

386
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,845
Finn, you wanna do bye, boo?

387
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:17,678
Say bye.

388
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,703
- [Finn] Boo!

389
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:20,536
- [Bryan] Poop!

390
00:14:20,536 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat, energetic music)
