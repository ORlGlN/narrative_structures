1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,043
- Goodnight to the old lady whispering,

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:03,876
hush.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,753
Goodnight stars.

4
00:00:06,753 --> 00:00:08,366
Goodnight air.

5
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:10,699
Goodnight noises everywhere.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,050
(gentle guitar strumming)

7
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:24,375
♫ This is our life

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,807
♫ This is our fun

9
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:27,809
♫ This is who we are

10
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:29,123
♫ This is our dream

11
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:30,518
♫ This is our team

12
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:32,990
♫ Shine among the stars

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,121
♫ Take this shield and we'll all be fine

14
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:38,246
♫ Take this hand we'll all just shine

15
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,113
♫ This is our life

16
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:41,754
♫ Let's live it

17
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,928
♫ Live it forever

18
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:45,544
- Say good morning.

19
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:46,627
Good morning!

20
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:48,587
Good morning!

21
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:50,890
Good morning!

22
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:56,437
Good mornin', good mornin',
good mornin', mornin', mornin'.

23
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:57,779
Hi Finn!

24
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:58,941
Say hi!

25
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:00,255
Say hi!

26
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:01,088
Say hi!

27
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,973
Say hello.

28
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:03,930
Good morning guys!

29
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,418
I don't know why Finn's being so shy!

30
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,064
Are you shy?

31
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:10,392
(chuckling)

32
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:11,733
Aw.

33
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,173
Good morning guys!

34
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,439
I'm hangin' out with Finn,

35
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,281
in my bedroom, that's the office.

36
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:17,241
Look at this.

37
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,776
We got a project goin' on.

38
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:21,429
Check out this new console I have.

39
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,431
I had like some cool shelves down here

40
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,525
but it was all exposed so you could

41
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:25,660
see all of these wires.

42
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,612
All these ones.

43
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:28,091
So I bought this,

44
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:29,951
and it had a brown iron.

45
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:33,408
So we painted it white to
match the white iron my office.

46
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:34,399
And I have to set it all up.

47
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,081
But I'm super excited because
this has way more storage

48
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,555
for all of my office stuff.

49
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:40,642
So it's not gonna be so cluttered in.

50
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,485
And I'm like really into
the '70s vintage thing.

51
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,522
I love the white too.

52
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,355
Looks cool.

53
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:47,869
Hey Finn, I'm gonna get you!

54
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:48,973
Ima' gonna get you!

55
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,383
Ima' get you!

56
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,917
Ima' get you!

57
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:54,584
Ima' get you Finn, Ima' get you!

58
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,795
Ima' get you!

59
00:01:58,238 --> 00:01:59,120
- Finn!

60
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,526
I heard you went and
made videos with auntie.

61
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:02,595
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:03,837
Was that fun?

63
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:06,626
(baby talk)

64
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,185
- Yeah, he's sayin' somethin'.

65
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:11,071
(baby talk)

66
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:12,245
- Oh really?

67
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,454
- What are you sayin'?

68
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:16,287
He's like...
(baby talk)

69
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:17,204
Oh really?

70
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,126
And then what did you do?

71
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:20,937
- Baba.
- Baba.

72
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:23,625
But anyways, I wanted to show you guys

73
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,488
the dogs right now, they're outside.

74
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:28,833
Mostly because the carpet is super clean

75
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,635
and I'm like, can we just keep it clean

76
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:32,612
for 24 hours before you guys come in

77
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,854
and like trample all over
it with your dirty feet.

78
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,706
But they're so funny
because they literally

79
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:38,155
can open doors.

80
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:39,623
And they worked together as a team

81
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:40,692
to make it happen.

82
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:41,966
I'm gonna unlock it for them.

83
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:44,177
They can't unlock the door.

84
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,668
Let's see if they can open it.

85
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,283
Come here Karma.

86
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:49,198
Come inside.

87
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:50,031
Come on boy.

88
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,342
He's like looking at the handle.

89
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:53,175
Come on.

90
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,377
Come on Karm.

91
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,294
Oh my gosh.

92
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,009
Bad dogs.

93
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,486
Karma Chameleon!

94
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,667
You just opened that door.

95
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,713
You guys are bad!

96
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:06,450
Come here, come on.

97
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,737
Back outside.

98
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:08,932
Back outside.

99
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:09,825
There you go.

100
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:10,844
Luna come.

101
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:12,488
Is that not hilarious?

102
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:13,968
Like he does that all day long.

103
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,996
He just opens the door
so that he can come in.

104
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,911
Now if it's locked, he
can't do it but like,

105
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,488
you guys are crazy!

106
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:21,360
I love my dogs.

107
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,677
They're so smart.

108
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,942
They're such good doggy's huh?

109
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:25,922
Yeah.

110
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:28,257
Also it is freezing outside.

111
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:29,424
It is so cold!

112
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:31,776
So cool.

113
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:33,442
All right Finn is down for a nap

114
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:34,757
and Ollie's still at school.

115
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,420
So me and my mom are
getting our nails done.

116
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,832
I am missing nails guys, I
have not been in, in a while.

117
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:43,139
So, I'm excited to get a fresh set.

118
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,946
And I'm excited to have nails
that don't look ridiculous.

119
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:49,943
Look who's up from his nap.

120
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:51,572
Hey baby.

121
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:54,248
I just got home, just in
time for him to wake up.

122
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:56,990
And our nails are done, and look.

123
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,735
I did like almost white.

124
00:03:58,735 --> 00:03:59,778
Which I don't normally do,

125
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:01,163
'cause it's like fall time

126
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:03,421
so I wanted to do more
of like a darker color

127
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:05,078
but I never can decide on a color

128
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,118
and white just seemed easy to pick.

129
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,105
You let my nails--
- If you don't like

130
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,885
you just paint over it.
- Yeah.

131
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,912
But anyways, Finn's up from his nap.

132
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:18,293
And Ollie asked me today if
Natalia could pick him up

133
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:19,784
so he could play with Payton.

134
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:21,899
And so I asked her so, I think she's gonna

135
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,933
pick him up today.

136
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,836
So he's pretty excited I'm sure.

137
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,488
But we'll go pick him up in a little bit.

138
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,155
Look where we're at.

139
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,037
Ollie!

140
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:33,230
We've missed you all day!

141
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,620
Are you so excited that Tal picked you up?

142
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,866
And you got to come here.

143
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,954
Have you played Doctor Kitty Cat?

144
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:41,640
Did you really?

145
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,793
Good.

146
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,070
He's been asking to play that all,

147
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,320
for like weeks.

148
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:49,074
We have just been hanging
out at the Johnson's.

149
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:51,035
And Ollie's hiding from me right now

150
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,875
'cause I think he knows it's probably

151
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,191
almost time to go home.

152
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,679
And he's like no.

153
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,646
What are you so afraid of bud?

154
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:02,813
Finn's having a blast too.

155
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,161
Ollie what are you so afraid of?

156
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,642
What's wrong?

157
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,289
Ollie, are you just
worried I'm gonna tell you

158
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,659
it's time to go home?

159
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,209
Yeah.

160
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,292
Well you can't live here!

161
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:18,828
He's just having such a blast.

162
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:20,127
But it's almost time to go

163
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:23,872
and they are like, no, let's stay forever.

164
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:25,851
I mean I guess if they wanna live here.

165
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:27,009
I'm gonna tell Tal and Jess.

166
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:29,561
Hey Ollie would like to
live here now, is that okay?

167
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,436
- Yes.

168
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:31,308
(laughing)

169
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:33,935
- [Missy] He doesn't want to leave.

170
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,827
All right, they said you can live here.

171
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:37,105
Do you wanna live here?

172
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:37,979
- No, no!

173
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:38,857
- [Missy] Oh!

174
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:41,107
He doesn't wanna live here.

175
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,338
No?

176
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,577
You can sleep in the girls bed.

177
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:48,324
- Just with you to live here.

178
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:51,124
- [Missy] You want me
to live here, with you?

179
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:52,871
- All right you guys are movin' in!

180
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:54,897
- All right we're movin' in!

181
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,308
So you want me to live
here and you live here?

182
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:58,322
- [Ollie] Yeah.

183
00:05:58,322 --> 00:05:59,197
- Oh my goodness.

184
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:00,692
He wants it to be a big old happy family

185
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:01,709
at the Johnson's.

186
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,249

I really liked my old house
'cause it had soft stairs.

203
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:38,047
with mommy to go see daddy.

204
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,260
