1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,550
- [All] Good morning!

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,627
- [Missy] Happy Saint Patrick's Day, Finn!

3
00:00:05,627 --> 00:00:06,460
- Yeah.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,470
(laughter)
- Happy Saint Patrick's Day!

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,818
- Yes, we have Auntie over

6
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:11,200
today.
- Hey!

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,410
- Are you guys excited
to do a fun challenge?

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,243
- Yeah!
- Yay!

- [Missy] Alright, we
are going to make some

14
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,800
delicious pancakes.

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,513
And look what we have here!
- Woo!

16
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:30,330
- [Missy] We've got
some little leprechauns!

17
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,163
I guess you guys are like

18
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:32,470
viking leprechauns? (laughs)
- Leprechaun vikings?

19
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,120
- Yeah I don't know,

20
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,520
but you guys look so cute!

21
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey look, and I've got a little
leprechaun over here, too!

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,290
And I'm wearing a little
green bow and a necklace

23
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,950
that says lucky 'cause
I'm so lucky to be a mama

24
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,654
of these cute little boys, huh?

25
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:49,887
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)

26
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:52,470
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,000
- Alright, if you haven't guessed yet,

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,410
the challenge that we are
doing is a Saint Patrick's Day

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,667
pancake art challenge!
- Woo!

30
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,000
(cheering)
- Woo!

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,300
- We've done a few of these, actually.

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,800
We've done a Halloween one, I
think we did a Christmas one,

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,970
we've done other random ones.

34
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,630
So I'll have a link up
here that you can click on

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,550
to go check them all out.

36
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,010
Auntie is going to help us.

37
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,646
Are you guys gonna make some fun art too?

38
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:38,479
- Yeah!

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,660
- [Missy] We gotta make all
the Saint Patrick's Day stuff.

40
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,680
- Yeah!
(Finn babbling)

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,770
- [Missy] And so we've got
red and yellow and orange.

42
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,210
We've got a couple different greens here.

43
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,043
We have brown.

44
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:50,727
The only color that we're
missing that I think we need is

45
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:52,130
- Black.
Black.

46
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,963
- Obviously!

47
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:55,520
- So, we actually don't have
any black food coloring,

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,270
so we're going to attempt ourselves

49
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,777
to make black. (laughs)
- We're just going to mix all

50
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:01,390
the colors together and
hope it makes a black.

51
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,422
- So we are gonna ahead
and mix a few drops of red.

52
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:07,255
One, two, three, four.

53
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:11,490
- [Auntie] We're gonna try to
make it as even as possible.

54
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,334
- And then four drops of blue.

55
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,184
Two, three, four.

56
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:19,520
Four drops of green.

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,802
- [Auntie] How do you guys
think it's gonna turn out?

58
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:21,635
Do you think it's going to be black?

59
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:23,247
- Yeah!
- I think it's gonna be

60
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:24,755
yellow.

61
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:25,957
(Auntie laughs)

62
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,420
- [Auntie] Oo, and this is what color?

63
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,711
- [Missy] Green.

64
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:31,880
Two, three, four.
(Finn babbling)

65
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
- [Auntie] Alright,
let's hope for the best.

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,953
- [Missy] See what we got.

67
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:36,850
- [Ollie] Can I have this please?

68
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,291
- No.
- Wow!

69
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,787
(Auntie laughs)
- Oh God.

70
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:42,410
- Wow, it's...
(Finn babbling)

71
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,732
Wait for it!
- It looks like cotton candy.

72
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,300
- [Auntie] Ew, it looks... (laughs)

73
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,635
- Well, that's gray.

74
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,633
- Gray is close, okay?
- That's like a gray.

75
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:52,010
We get the hint, right?

76
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,723
- Maybe if we just add a few
more drops of everything,

77
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:56,666
we'll get black.

78
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,478
Alright, we are all set up
and we've got all our colors.

79
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:02,720
We basically made a gray?

80
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,553
This is black.

81
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:04,678
- It's like a dust. (laughs)

82
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,790
- Does this look like black to you?

83
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,720
- No, it looks like dirt.

84
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,960
- Dirt, okay.

85
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,120
We're gonna work with that, what we have.

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,390
We've got all our colors now
and so we're gonna go ahead

87
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,223
and do a challenge.

88
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:17,680
It's going to be Missy
versus Auntie and Ollie.

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,513
- Woohoo!

90
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:19,710
- Are you going to help out?
- Yeah!

91
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,502
- Finn went ahead and checked out,

92
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,147
(laughter)
which was fine with me.

93
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:24,998
He was like, "I don't want to do this."

94
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,090
So we've got our grill

95
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,200
all ready to go.
- Hot!

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,920
- We are going to make some
fun Saint Patrick's art,

97
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,753
right now!

98
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,098
You ready?
- Yeah!

99
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,000
- Woo!
- Yay!

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,210
What should be the first
thing that we make?

101
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,950
- A Patrick's Day spider.

102
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,500
- No, that's Halloween!
(laughter)

103
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,270
How about for the first
thing we're going to make is

104
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,660
a pot of gold?

105
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,493
- Yeah!

106
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:45,368
- You wanna make--
- Yeah,

107
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,201
that sounds good.
- A pot of gold?

108
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,877
Okay, so we're gonna go
ahead and make a pot of gold.

109
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:49,040
Are you guys ready?

110
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,660
- Yeah.
- Get set, go!

111
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:55,002
(traditional Irish music)

112
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,012
- No, I want to do it on you!

113
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:00,033
- No, no!

114
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:03,693
My team player is not working with me.

115
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,254
- Alright, I'm done with mine,

116
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:22,752
We just gotta flip it.
(Auntie groans)

117
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,887
What is happening here? (laughs)

118
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:26,520
- I don't know!

119
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,430
Leave me alone.

120
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,907
- Alright, are you ready?

121
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:32,219
- Yep.
- Ready for this masterpiece?

122
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,469
- [Ollie] Flip!

123
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:35,514
Woohoo!

124
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:36,516
- All good?
- Yeah.

125
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:37,797
- Okay, woo!

126
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,660
Yeah, I flipped it.

127
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,320
I feel like Cassie just realized why

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,745
she hates doing this game with me.

129
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:45,030
- This is why I don't like this game.

130
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,220
I remember now.

131
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,510
I think I'm just at a
disadvantage sometimes.

132
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,800
- How are you at a disadvantage?

133
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
- I think we were raised differently.

134
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,770
- I mean, we've got a rainbow and what's

135
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,210
at the end of a pot of
gold or of a rainbow?

136
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,350
A pot of gold.

137
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,479
- Well, mine is, kind of looks like a boat

138
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,060
from this direction.

139
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,972
What do you say?

140
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:03,073
- It looks good?
- Yeah.

141
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:05,194
- Who do you think's
better, Mommy's or mine?

142
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:06,850
- Mommy and yours.

143
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,070
- Aww! Alright, guys, leave down below.

144
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,730
Who do you think did better on this round?

145
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,600
Round one, pot of gold.

146
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,365
- Don't choose Missy, choose Ollie.

147
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:16,490
Not me,
(laughs)

148
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,390
you're not voting for me,
you're voting against Ollie.

149
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,540
- Round two, what should we make?

150
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,340
- A four leaf clover.

151
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,010
- A four leaf clover?
- Yeah.

152
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,425
- Okay, if I make a four leaf
clover, you have to eat it,

153
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,265
kay?
- No!

154
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,570
(laughing)

155
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,123
- It's going to be hot!

156
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,838
- We'll let it cool down, okay?

157
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:33,969
On your mark,

158
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:34,802
get set,

159
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:36,474
go!

160
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:43,950
- That's a three leaf clover!

161
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,192
Shoot!

162
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:46,471
[Woman] -Missy's got an eight leaf clover,

163
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,413
so we're good.
- Hold on, this is one.

164
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:50,940
- This is not working for me.

165
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,747
This is not working for me!

166
00:05:56,927 --> 00:06:00,040
- You know, I had a better
intentions, I'm not going to lie,

167
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,873
but, you know it is

168
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:02,026
what it is.
- Four leaf clovers are

169
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:03,790
really, really hard to do.

170
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,670
- Is it just hard because you
didn't nail it the first time?

171
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,370
- I don't even think that I know how to

172
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,210
draw a four leaf clover at all.

173
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,680
- I even looked it up beforehand

174
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,293
and I still didn't do what I was hoping.

175
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:21,210
- I just keep making mine bigger. (laughs)

176
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,290
Go big or go home.

177
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,226
What is that?
- What is that? (laughs)

178
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:27,820
- It just looks like 'splat!'

179
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,948
- [Woman] It's Nickelodeon Splat.

180
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:29,781
- Leave me alone!

181
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,970
- She's just creating pancake slime.

182
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,803
- Yeah.

183
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:40,404
- Son of gun, no, no!
- No!

184
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,230
- Thank you for dramatic effect.

185
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,063
It broke.

186
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,265
- Now we can, oh!

187
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:51,745
It still fell apart.

188
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,078
- It fell apart.

189
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:55,972
- Oh it fell apart!

190
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:56,805
- Shoot.

191
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:57,638
Okay, you know what?

192
00:06:57,638 --> 00:07:00,220
That was just an extra anyways, okay?

193
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,452
- In a way, yours might
be a little bit better.

194
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:05,650
(laughter)
Just by a little bit though,

195
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,630
alright?

196
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,780
- Okay, we'll just take
the stem off, you know, no

197
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,613
one needed the stem.

198
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,516
It was just extra, it
was just extra points.

199
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:12,349
- Yeah, whatever.

200
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,860
Okay, here we go.

201
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,650
- Okay, who's four leaf clover is better?

202
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,010
I mean, these both really suck, so

203
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,020
you really don't have
a lot to choose from.

204
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,040
- No, Missy's won.

205
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,873
- Alright, round two.

206
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:26,310
Let us know down in the comments,

207
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,820
who do you think did a better job?

208
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,060
I mean, if all the comments say Missy,

209
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,960
then I won't be upset.

210
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,233
No.

211
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,066
Alright guys, it is time for round three

212
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:37,130
and I'm just going to
give Ollie the chance,

213
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,620
do you want to stay on
Auntie's team at this point?

214
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,430
Or would you like to come to Mommy's team?

215
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,153
- Your team!
- Oh! (laughs)

216
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,080
Do you want to switch teams

217
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,930
because you know she's
gonna lose? (laughs)

218
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,719
- Go, I don't want you
on my team anyways now.

219
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,220
- Woohoo, alright, you can
stand between us actually.

220
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,901
That sound good?
- Yeah.

221
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,635
Your team and your team, Mama.

222
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:02,626
- Alright, you can be on both our teams.

223
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:03,459
Muah!

224
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:06,270
For round three, we are
going to make a hat.

225
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,550
A leprechaun hat.

226
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,320
You guys know what that looks like?

227
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,210
- That was my cheat sheet.

228
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,412
- Wow, she's cheating already.

229
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:14,050
- Don't give away my cheat sheet.

230
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,143
Who's team are you on?

231
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,330
- He's like, this is what it looks like.

232
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,872
Okay, on your marks,

233
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,040
get set,

234
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
go!

235
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,050
- I got a good bace.

236
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,573
- Just put a flower on
it, cause that's a thing,

237
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,772
you need to put a flower on it.

238
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:32,693
And a belt.
(laughs)

239
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:37,693
- No, you have to do a belt on
it, just like what Auntie is.

240
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,960
- Wow, changing your color up, huh?

241
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,594
- Yeah, are you jealous?

242
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:44,208
- Aw, thank you.

243
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,959
- Thanks, buddy, you're so sweet.

244
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:51,860
- What if?

245
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,447
- Okay, that looks like nothing. (laughs)

246
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:55,280
- I mean, when you flip it,

247
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,724
it's definitely going to come apart.

248
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:59,150
- Cassie! (laughs)

249
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,242
- I'm just gonna go
- No my gosh.

250
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:02,265
through with it.

251
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:03,710
- Oh, That looks good!

252
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,232
- Thank you.
- It fell apart.

253
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:06,444
- It's a little off.
- It fell apart,

254
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,126
but that's okay.

255
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:08,959
- Whoo!

256
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,015
That was awesome!
- Yay!

257
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:13,848
- What do you think, bud?

258
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:14,681
- Good.

259
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:18,380
- Alright guys, here
is our leprechaun hat.

260
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,490
This one's mine and this one's Auntie's.

261
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,910
Let us know down below,
who do you think won?

262
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,430
This was a good one.

263
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,263
This was good.

264
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:26,570
- This was not that bad, okay.

265
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,770
- Honestly, the color on
Cassie's is pretty good.

266
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,090
Shape on mine is better.

267
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,923
- Yeah, but...
- I mean, whatever.

268
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:34,140
- You know what? I couldn't
really control the color,

269
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,070
though, whereas I could
have controlled the shape if

270
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,000
I had known how to do it,

271
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,833
so.
- Yes.

272
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,457
Alright, guys, it is the
last and final round.

273
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,813
Round four!

274
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,679
Do you know what the next
one we're going to do is?

275
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,512
- Yeah.

276
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:47,659
- What is it?
- A horseshoe.

277
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,302
- A horse shoot?
(laughs)

278
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:52,460
We're going to do a horseshoe, okay?

279
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,270
- Now, is this a shoe
that goes on a horse?

280
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,310
- Yeah.
- Okay, just making sure.

281
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,233
- Alright, on your marks, get set, go!

282
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,132
- Is that red?

283
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:16,339
It looks a little bit red.

284
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,550
- That's a lot of yellow.

285
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,103
- And the red looks like barbecue mustard.

286
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:30,936
- Like ketchup, kind of?

287
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,533
- Ketchup, yeah.
- Yeah.

288
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,220
- Cassie, is your hand cramping?

289
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,150
- Yup.

290
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,636
I'm just pushing through it, though.

291
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,264
- We're going for it.
- Woo!

292
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:43,097
- Woo!

293
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,770
- Ready, oh!

294
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,772
Whoo!
(clapping)

295
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:47,605
Oh, wow!

296
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:50,745
- Oh yeah, okay.

297
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:52,130
- Don't touch it, hot!
- It's okay, it's not.

298
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,860
- That is pretty dang good.

299
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,990
- I think they both did really good.

300
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,700
This is going to be another tough one.

301
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,233
- I know, you guys, this
might be like our tiebreaker?

302
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,328
This might actually be a tie.

303
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,180
Alright, here's round four, horseshoe.

304
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,690
This is mine and this is Auntie's.

305
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,920
Let us know down below, round four.

306
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,800
Who won?

307
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,130
And let us know, overall,
who did the best job?

308
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,020
These look really, really good.

309
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,853
Do you think these look good?

310
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:17,686
- Yeah.
- Okay,

311
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:19,960
if you had to pick someone,
who do you think did better?

312
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,200
- You and you.

313
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,277
- No, you have to actually
choose, which one?

314
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:25,763
Which one is your
favorite of all of these?

315
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:26,868
- The rainbow one.

316
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:29,682
- Awww, that's me, yay!
- Aww!

317
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,987
- And yours! (laughs)
- Thank you!

318
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:33,960
- See, he doesn't want to
hurt anyone's feelings.

319
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,760
- Look who decided to join us!

320
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,657
Do you want to pick your
favorite pancake, Finley?

321
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,030
(whines)
Which one's

322
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,150
your favorite of all of them?

323
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,290
Which one's your favorite?

324
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,290
You've got pot of gold,
four leaf clovers, a hat,

325
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,549
or the horseshoe?

326
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,510
- This.
Which one,

327
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,130
this one or this one?
- That one.

328
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,900
- This one or this one?
- That one.

329
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,647
- This one?
- That one?

330
00:11:58,647 --> 00:11:59,862
You like Auntie's?

331
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:01,413
Woohoo!

332
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:02,981
- But, do you like Mama's, too?

333
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,360
- No.
(laughter)

334
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,193
- Auntie's won!

335
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,026
Finn's point.

336
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,100
Alright, I think Finn wants
to start making his own

337
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,146
pancake art, huh?
(mumbles)

338
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:12,140
- [Auntie] You want to make something?

339
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,790
- I just want to use this
one and make pancakes.

340
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,290
We're going to go ahead
and end this video.

341
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,123
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

342
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:18,610
Make sure you give it a big thumbs up.

343
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,441
I hope you guys have an
awesome St. Patrick's Day

344
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,252
and we are going to go ahead
and make some real pancakes

345
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,680
and eat them for dinner.

346
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,530
Does that sound good?

347
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,070
- Yeah!

348
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,460
- He's like, I just want to make this.

349
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,550
Do you want to make this one?

350
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,383
- Yeah.

351
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,840
- Alright, give the
video a thumbs up, guys!

352
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,673
- Woo!
- Woohoo!

353
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,500
