00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,093
- [Missy] See,

2
00:00:01,093 --> 00:00:02,740
and this is the problem
right here, Karma Chameleon.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,780
Stop digging!

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,600
No, no digging!

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,930
Oh, look at this hole.

6
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,726
No, no!

12
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,840
- Good morning, guys!

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,950
And welcome to today's vlog.

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,240
It is actually a B-E-A-utiful day here

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,470
in sunny southern California.

16
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,180
We have blue skies and clouds.

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,250
And last night, it poured rain.

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,660
And it was supposed to rain
and be cold all day today.

19
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,260
And it's still cold.

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,260
But look at these beautiful
blue skies, clouds.

21
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,410
It's amazing out here.

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,790
It's cold, let's go back inside.

23
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,610
Shut the door.

24
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,070
Before we get on to today's
vlog, I just wanted to say

25
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,260
a huge thank you to
each and everyone of you

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,860
for all your love and support.

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,519
We put up a vlog recently
of me going to the doctor

28
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,380
for the first time, who gave me a referral

29
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,530
to go see a neurologist
because she definitely thinks

30
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,490
that it's not something simple.

31
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,420
I joked in that vlog.

32
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm definitely on this journey
of "what's wrong with Bryan?"

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,250
And hopefully, we figure it out soon.

34
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,050
And yeah, just seriously, thank you guys

35
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,240
for all the love and support.

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,430
I have been getting like,
so many amazing tweets.

37
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,100
You guys have been filling
out the comments section

38
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,250
with so much love and positivity.

39
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,900
And it's exactly what
the world needs today.

40
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,970
So, thank you guys so
much for all that you do.

41
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,820
We appreciate each and every one of you.

42
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,130
So, today, Missy is,
of course, at the barn.

43
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,190
She's got a riding lesson.

44
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,900
She's doing some English lessons.

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,020
And I'm hanging out in
the house with the boys.

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,540
But I just found something
pretty incredible.

47
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,910
I'm not sure what it is.

48
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,150
I don't want to get my hopes up,

49
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,310
but I'm gonna show the boys
and see what they think.

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,230
So you know that, right?

51
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,460
That's our starfish, Patrick.

52
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,872
Do you know what this is?

53
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:57,210
- No.

54
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,900
- [Bryan] It's a baby starfish!

55
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,733
- Really?

56
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:02,116
- [Bryan] There's a baby
starfish in our tank!

57
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,290
- Whoa.

58
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,650
- [Bryan] I know, isn't that crazy?

59
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,953
We got a picture of it.

60
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,430
- I'm gonna go see it.

61
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,460
- [Bryan] Okay, so I came over
here and there was definitely

62
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,090
something on the glass of the fish tank.

63
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,470
And I have to say our starfish
has been acting really weird.

64
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,550
It's been all over this thing.

65
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,960
And there was definitely
something on the glass.

66
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,210
I'll show you the picture I took.

67
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,210
I doubt you can even see
but there is a baby starfish

68
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,120
in the sand right now.

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,510
That is crazy.

70
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,180
So this is what it
looked like on the glass,

71
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,370
and it must have fallen off or something.

72
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,210
I'm not sure if it's going to last

73
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,730
but that is definitely a
baby starfish in our tank.

74
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,190
I'm not really sure how that happened.

75
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,650
Oh, hi, Luna.

76
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,483
What Ollie?

77
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,380
- I thought it was a flower.

78
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,640
- [Bryan] No, it's a cute baby starfish.

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,824
Isn't it cute?

80
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:52,657
- Yeah.

81
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:54,800
- Look, it's got like,
legs and everything.

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,440
Okay, I'm going to sit
down and do some Googling

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,440
and see what we can find
when we Google baby starfish.

84
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,232
Let's check Google images
just to see if I'm seeing

85
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:09,370
what is actually a baby starfish.

86
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,760
Oh my gosh, look, okay, right there.

87
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,200
ReefSanctuary.com.

88
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,800
New rock equals baby starfish.

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,850
And look at all of these, yep.

90
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,630
Baby starfish, this is so tiny.

91
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,600
Oh my gosh.

92
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,960
I have a baby starfish about the size

93
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,500
of a pinkie fingernail,

94
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,820
came off of a piece of live coral.

95
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,930
Um, that actually is a huge possibility

96
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,748
'cause we just had our fish tank worked on

97
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:33,350
and we got a ton of new coral and stuff,

98
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,390
so it could've been something

99
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,539
that was actually hiding inside.

100
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:37,300
Or, it could've been that our starfish

101
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,730
actually gave birth.

102
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,563
I think that'd be amazing.

103
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:41,890
But that actually looks like it.

104
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,970
That is really, really
exciting and I feel bad

105
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,270
that it already fell off the glass.

106
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,720
But I'm really glad I took a
picture so I can show Missy.

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,450
I love that we have the salt water tank

108
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,478
and we get surprises like
this every now and then.

109
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:53,800
It's like, really, really fun.

110
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,960
Yeah, baby starfish!

111
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,830
You guys see that?

112
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,700
Look at this picture
of this baby starfish.

113
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,340
That is adorable.

114
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,040
Let us know what we should name it

115
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,950
down below in the comments.

116
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,910
Maybe Squishy.

117
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,120
Maybe he'll be my Squishy.

118
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,953
(laughing)

119
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,090
- Hi, I just got back from the barn.

120
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,300
I had a very eventful time
and Ollie is telling me what?

121
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,200
- There's a baby starfish.

122
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,050
- [Missy] We have a baby starfish?

123
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,883
- Yeah!

124
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:16,956
- How crazy!

125
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,269
I wanna go check it out.

126
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,459
I'm actually exhausted.

127
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,499
I don't know if I can honestly
get off this couch right now.

128
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,650
I did lessons and then
we had a horse get out.

129
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,020
Kick one of Maria's horses.

130
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,182
He was hurt pretty bad and it was so sad.

131
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,640
- [Finley] The starfish was right here!

132
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,954
- [Missy] He was right here?

133
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:31,787
- [Finley] Yeah.

134
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:34,040
- Hm, gotta keep your eyes open.

135
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,610
See if you can see him.

136
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,030
Tell me if you see him.

137
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,650
But anyways, how cool
that we have a starfish,

138
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,550
a baby starfish?

139
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,090
I hope that it gets nice and big.

140
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,923
Um, but, yeah.

141
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:49,549
I'm hurt, there was a lot of craziness.

142
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,860
It was just, it was sad.

143
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,460
He was just gushing blood
and we had to stop it.

144
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,148
And my dad actually came out to help out,

145
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:57,680
which was really nice.

146
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,970
And so yeah, it's just been
kind of a crazy morning,

147
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,970
and I just wanna sit down.

148
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,480
We were gonna like, go do stuff

149
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,400
and go places but think I
might just need to relax

150
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,950
for a little bit for I go out.

151
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,480
Luna, you're being crazy.

152
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,910
You're being crazy, Luna.

153
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,030
You wanna go outside.

154
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,350
Alright, I'll get up again.

155
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,250
So, I've had a little time to rest

156
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,660
after a kind of long, stressful day

157
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,490
and I wanna show you guys
some really cool changes

158
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,490
that we're making in the backyard.

159
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,680
So first of all, as you can see here,

160
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,280
this is my little egg apron
that Bryan got me for Christmas.

161
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,095
And I've used it a few
times but, to be honest,

162
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:28,928
I always, I never know where it is.

163
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:33,330
So I was like, can we hang it
back here so that I can like,

164
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,030
easily grab it if I need it but then like,

165
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,970
easily put it back, so like,
it's not like way down there

166
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,500
or way in there.

167
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,333
So we're just testing out this.

168
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,500
Obviously, we need to hook it onto here.

169
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,990
But this is perfect and
I was hanging it on here,

170
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,120
but Luna kept grabbing it and
dragging it out to the yard.

171
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
And doing what she does best.

172
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,320
Finny, you playing?

173
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,340
- Yeah.

174
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,210
- [Missy] Oh my goodness!

175
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,446
Are you playing with Spider Man?

176
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:56,390
- [Finley] Yeah.

177
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,180
- How cool.

178
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,320
And then we're actually
doing a few other things.

179
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,350
This summer, we're actually
making a lot of changes

180
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,710
with the yard and something really big

181
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,460
and exciting we're doing is
stuff to my chicken coop.

182
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,150
So you guys know we had this put in here

183
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,840
and we literally just like, set it here.

184
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,170
And now, we're just kinda trying to like,

185
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,050
raise up the dirt so it's all level.

186
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,040
And we wanna bring it
all the way down there

187
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,150
so that the kids have a place to play.

188
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,120
And we can like, garden over here.

189
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,640
And I just kinda wanna
clean up all of this.

190
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,460
And we've thrown out
lots of different ideas

191
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,200
with doing a pond back
here and things like that

192
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,010
but we just wanna keep it kinda simple.

193
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,660
Just like, a nice area
that I can get down here

194
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,000
for the chickens and the
kids can play over here

195
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,530
without putting a lot of,

196
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,990
a lot of this stuff ends
up getting in the grass

197
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,830
and then ruining the grass.

198
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,750
So we want a nice spot.

199
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,240
So we're kind of raising this up.

200
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,610
Got a pretty big drop right now

201
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,740
but we'll either add
like, stairs or a gradual.

202
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,220
Up, see, this is the problem
right here, Karma Chameleon.

203
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,670
Stop digging!

204
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,050
No, no digging.

205
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,060
The digging is ridiculous.

206
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,588
I thought it was Luna but I
actually think it is Karma.

207
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:55,373
Ah, you're stepping in the mud!

208
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,330
Look at all these holes, you guys.

209
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,160
Hole, hole, really big
hole, even bigger hole.

210
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,728
Oh, look at this hole.

211
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:05,400
No, no!

212
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,910
That hole and that hole and that hole

213
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,670
and that hole and that hole.

214
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,460
They are literally ruining our yard.

215
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,160
I thought it was Luna 'cause
we never had a digger before

216
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,510
until we got Luna but
every time I turn around,

217
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,780
I see him digging.

218
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,460
So if you guys have any suggestions on how

219
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,290
to make your dog stop digging,

220
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,590
please let us know in the comments.

221
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,170
We've been sticking like, rocks in there.

222
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,530
Or even like, dog poop so
that if they start digging,

223
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,610
they're like, ew, that stinks.

224
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,443
I don't want to touch it.

225
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:32,160
Any other suggestions, please let us know.

226
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,790
'Cause we're doing a lot of landscaping

227
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,430
and we don't want the
dogs tearing it all up.

228
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm so excited to see how
this is gonna turn out.

229
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,290
It's going to be so cute!

230
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,540
And then check out this little spud.

231
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,900
We went ahead and put these bricks here

232
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,610
and we got like, a tall plant.

233
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,720
Isn't that so pretty?

234
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,710
- Yeah.

235
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,050
- Yeah. We got little plants here.

236
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,260
And it's just so fun.

237
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,790
You guys need to be careful.

238
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,920
Don't ruin our plants, okay?

239
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,410
As you guys know, me and
Bryan aren't like, really good

240
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,930
at this stuff so my dad helps me a lot.

241
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,530
This is Bobby, he does a
lot of our grounds work.

242
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,490
He's a green thumb and he knows how to do

243
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,760
everything when it comes
to plants so I'm like,

244
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,870
"can we do something like this?"

245
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,093
And then he basically was
like, "sure, let's do this."

246
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,220
So I love it.

247
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,270
It looks so cool.

248
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,901
You're all muddy!

249
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:16,734
- Yeah.

250
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:18,047
- That's so dirty!

251
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:20,810
Yeah, me and Bryan are really
good at having a vision

252
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,700
but we're not really good
at making things happen

253
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,477
so that's how it often works with, like,

254
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:27,190
if we have a fun idea for
the videos, we're like,

255
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,520
"we really wanna do something like this."

256
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,240
And then my dad always like,
builds it or makes it happen.

257
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,900
My dad and Bobby and me
and Bryan have all just

258
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,080
kind of been working
together to figure out

259
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,400
how we can make this yard just like,

260
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,419
fun and beautiful, relaxing, exciting.

261
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,329
Just like, something to do
in every part of the yard.

262
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,754
You know, swim, relax, play,

263
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:49,220
have a chicken coop, have a garden.

264
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,053
It's just amazing.

265
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,460
And we have big, big plans
for other parts of our yard.

266
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,510
It's just so exciting, huh?

267
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,920
We love our house.

268
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,287
And that's my little apron, huh?

269
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,120
- Yeah.

270
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,953
- [Missy] Yeah.

271
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:00,786
- Apron.

272
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:01,619
- Yeah.

273
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:02,490
You guys, I think I see the starfish!

274
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,110
I've been waiting to see it
all day and I finally see it.

275
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,080
And I think we have
found a second starfish,

276
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,922
like baby starfish.

277
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:12,420
Let me show you.

278
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,936
Do you see the baby starfish?

279
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:14,769
- Yeah.

280
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,660
- Alright, so that's
the big mama starfish.

281
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,743
And look over here, in this corner.

282
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:23,812
That little tiny one.

283
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:24,645
Look at that.

284
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,740
That is the craziest
thing, that is such a baby.

285
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,560
And I swear I counted like all
the little lines right there.

286
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,300
It has like, seven legs.

287
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,133
That is insane.

288
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,770
And then, if you look down here.

289
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,040
Okay, it's kinda far away
but if you look straight

290
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,040
in the middle, there's a little
tiny, it looks almost white,

291
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,410
like tan-ish.

292
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,910
You can see like, a black star-ish.

293
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,090
I'll have to try and point
it out through the video

294
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,380
but that thing is moving and
it does look like a starfish.

295
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,920
And it's tiny, tiny, even
tinier than the one up there.

296
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,350
But, yeah, it is totally
moving and it is so small

297
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,340
and you can barely see
it but that's a starfish.

298
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,770
Another one, that's two.

299
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,070
And check this out, in just
the short amount of time

300
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,210
that we've been talking,

301
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,111
that thing moved from over
here to all the way over there.

302
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,160
That is the craziest thing ever.

303
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,180
I cannot believe we have baby starfish.

304
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,400
How neat.

305
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,320
Alright, guys, that is all for this vlog.

306
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,153
It's so, so late.

307
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,303
It's time for bed, huh?

308
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:25,225
You got those sleepy eyes on, huh?

309
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,058
- Yeah.

310
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,070
I'm gonna take my morning eyes off

311
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,278
and put my sleepy eyes on.

312
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:33,660
- Aww, his sleepy eyes.

313
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,510
Alright, guys, it is time for bed.

314
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,440
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

Please give a big thumbs up if you did.

316
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,345
Hey look, that's my
hair hanging down there

317
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:45,380
and also that's hair a little bit cut out

318
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,720
because this guy got scissors, huh?

319
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,553
- Yeah.

320
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:51,810
- Yeah, he feels really bad.

321
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,710
He got in a little bit of trouble, huh?

322
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,610
But yeah, bunch of hair there and my hair.

323
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,910
So yeah, that happened.

324
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,720
Anyways, I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.
