1
00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:03,497
- The boys are hopping on
the pony rides right now,

2
00:00:03,497 --> 00:00:04,914
and it's so cute.

3
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:08,164
Ollie is so excited to
ride a mechanical bull.

4
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:10,751
He saw it, and was like,
I need to jump on there.

5
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:13,388
It is actually Friday the 13th,

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:17,742
the spookiest day in the
spookiest month of the year,

7
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:19,950
so we're hoping that we don't
run into anything too crazy

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,226
in the pumpkin patch,

9
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:24,976
but you never know, and
it's Friday the 13th.

10
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,806
♫ Let's live it

11
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,963
♫ Live forever

12
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:30,807
- Good morning.

13
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:31,663
- Good morning.

14
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:32,496
- [Missy] Where are we at?

15
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:34,153
- Music class.

16
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:34,986
- Yeah!

17
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:38,805
(guitar strumming)

18
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,785
(percussion joins guitar in melody)

19
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:53,677
- Good morning, guys!

20
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:56,077
Today is gonna be a fun day,

21
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:59,058
because we are taking the
boys to a pumpkin patch,

22
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,461
and there's just something
about pumpkin patches

23
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,722
that just makes you feel super festive.

24
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:06,175
It's October, it's
getting to be Halloween,

25
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:07,252
it might a little scary,

26
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:09,692
we're hoping we don't run
into anything too scary.

27
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:10,525
But yeah, I'm really excited

28
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:11,388
to take them to the pumpkin patch.

29
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:13,832
It's something we do every
single year for them,

30
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:16,655
and it's a B-E-A-utiful day

31
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,127
here in sunny Southern California.

32
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:21,438
Blue skies for days, you guys.

33
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:23,136
And look who's joining us!

34
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:25,551
We got Carl and Jinger in the house.

35
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:26,477
You guys must've missed your kids,

36
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,068
so you're like, we'll
come hang out with yours.

37
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:29,343
- That's exactly what happened.

38
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:31,055
- [Bryan] We're gonna run
around a pumpkin patch.

39
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:31,888
- That sounds so fun.

40
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:33,161
Let's go do it right now.

41
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:33,994
- [Bryan] And look at you,

42
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,234
you're all like festive, and --

43
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:36,257
- I'm pumpkin patch-y.

44
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:37,752
- [Bryan] Yeah, gonna pick out a pumpkin?

45
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:38,911
(laughing)

46
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,477
Finn's climbing in his car seat.

47
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:41,740
Ollie, where are we going?

48
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,123
- Pumpkin patch!

49
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:45,226
- [Bryan] That's right, we're
going to a pumpkin patch.

50
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:46,334
The boys are in the back.

51
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:48,413
This is why I love having an SUV,

52
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:50,614
because we can all fit in here.

53
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:51,591
- Well, let's put your buckles on.

54
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:54,758
(inspirational music)

55
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,989
(upbeat music)

56
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,253
- All right, Ollie,

57
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:26,428
while we're at the pumpkin patch today,

58
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,146
I thought it would be
a perfect opportunity

59
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,563
to do another #AskDailyBumps.

60
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,978
Do you wanna answer some
questions while we're here?

61
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:35,811
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:36,644
- Okay.

63
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,372
REXANDME asked on YouTube,

64
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:41,355
Ollie, what is your favorite movie?

65
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:42,188
- Um.

66
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,029
Ninjago.

67
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,363
(upbeat music)

68
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:04,529
Katie on Twitter asked,

69
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:07,068
what is your favorite Halloween movie?

70
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:10,716
And I have to say for me,
hands down, Hocus Pocus.

71
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:12,840
Hey, Ollie, you know this an outhouse?

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,673
- Really?

73
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:14,568
- [Bryan] Do you know what an outhouse is?

74
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:15,401
- What?

75
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,235
- [Bryan] In the old days,

76
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:18,737
this is where people went potty.

77
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:19,570
- Really?

78
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:22,530
- [Bryan] And you're
standing right on top of it!

79
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,280
Ew, get out of there.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,583
(upbeat music)

81
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,956
Look at this giant pumpkin, bro.

82
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:35,618
Whoa!

83
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,057
There's so many big pumpkins here,

84
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:38,925
and little cute ones,

85
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,067
and we're actually looking
for a white pumpkin like this.

86
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,473
Hopefully a little bit bigger,

87
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,724
so that we can we do a
Jack Skellington pumpkin

88
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,018
later when we get home.

89
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:46,851
That'd be cool.

90
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,485
Jessica Karr asked on Twitter

91
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:52,126
What do you love about fall and Halloween?

92
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:53,771
- I love the baking.

93
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,985
The house just smells amazing.

94
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,568
(upbeat music)

95
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,008
- [Bryan] All right,
Ollie, what do you think?

96
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,355
First back massage.

97
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:04,507
- Um, it's tickles.

98
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:05,741
- It just tickles?

99
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:08,912
Finn, can you give him a massage?

100
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,416
There we go.

101
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,702
Whoa.

102
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:13,095
All right, Ollie got the extendable one,

103
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:16,223
and he's now massaging my back with it.

104
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,612
That feels good, dude.

105
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:18,611
Thank you.

106
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,329
Ashley on Twitter asked
are you guys planning

107
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,057
another Halloween skit?

108
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:25,848
I watch your previous skit and
Finn and Ollie are so cute.

109
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,618
Yes, we are planning
another Halloween skit.

110
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,742
We have something really
exciting planned this year.

111
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:32,204
Ollie is definitely
the one who has decided

112
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:33,745
what the skit's gonna be about,

113
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:34,943
so it's gonna be really fun.

114
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,072
And if you guys wanna watch any

115
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:37,062
of our previous Halloween skits,

116
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:39,191
I'll have all of them in the i-card,

117
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,194
so you can check 'em out right now, too.

118
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:43,213
All right, Ollie, Mads on Twitter asked

119
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:45,745
What are you gonna carve
into your pumpkin this year?

120
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,765
So what do you want to make
your pumpkin into this year

121
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,264
when we carve it?

122
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:50,814
- Um, Jack Skellington.

123
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:51,964
- [Bryan] Really?

124
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:52,920
All right.

125
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,048
Then we gotta find a white
pumpkin to do it, right?

126
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:55,881
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,723
- [Bryan] All right, let's go
find a white pumpkin, buddy.

128
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,298
All right, so Maisie
left a YouTube comment,

129
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:02,473
and asked why did you call
your channel Daily Bumps?

130
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:05,798
- So my previous channel was
called Bumps Along the Way,

131
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:07,911
cause I was going through all
kinds of bumps in the road,

132
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:10,055
through pregnancy, I had a bump, you know,

133
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:11,528
in my belly.
- [Bryan] Yeah.

134
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:12,779
- And so then when we
started our daily channel,

135
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,654
we wanted it to connect somehow,

136
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:16,607
so we called it Daily Bumps.

137
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,491
- [Bryan] Yeah.

138
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,507
- Pretty cute.

139
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:20,276
- We going on a pony ride!

140
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,301
- [Bryan] Pony ride time!

141
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:22,704
You read, Finn?

142
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:23,537
- I'm ready.

143
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:24,438
- You're ready?

144
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:25,890
Finn, I think you're going on a pony

145
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,336
whether you're ready or not.

146
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,919
(upbeat music)

147
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,597
They boys are hopping on
the pony rides right now,

148
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,014
and it's so cute.

149
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:48,846
Hi, Finn!

150
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:51,852
He's all shy up on his horse.

151
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,408
He's got Smokey.

152
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:55,408
And Ollie is on Diamond.

153
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,560
And they're off!

154
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,132
(upbeat music)

155
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,315
Hi, Ollie!

156
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:02,148
- Hi!

157
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:05,963
- [Bryan] Good job, Finn!

158
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:08,546
(upbeat music)

159
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:12,920
What did you think, Finn?

160
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,954
- Did you like that?

161
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:14,787
- Yeah.

162
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:15,620
- [Bryan] Yeah.

163
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,651
Hey, Ollie, how was riding a pony?

164
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:18,503
- It was good.
- [Bryan] Good.

165
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,528
Hey, guess who's here?

166
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:20,361
- What?

167
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:23,608
- [Bryan] Kelsey and Corbin and June!

168
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:24,967
It's baby June!

169
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,585
Come say hi, Finn!

170
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:27,418
- Hi Finn!

171
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,023
- [Bryan] What's up, dude?

172
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,077
- What's going on?

173
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:31,447
We heard there's a pumpkin
patch and pony rides.

174
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:32,360
- [Bryan] Yeah.

175
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,178
Hi, baby June.

176
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,434
You ready to ride a pony?

177
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:37,201
Has she ever ridden a pony, Kelsey?

178
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:38,918
Oh my gosh.

179
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:40,173
- I don't know if she can --

180
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,350
- [Bryan] I think she can, yeah?

181
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,076
- I don't know, actually.

182
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:43,909
- [Bryan] All right, Ollie.

183
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,583
What are you gonna do?

184
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,863
- I'm gonna ride a bull!

185
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:49,622
- Ollie is so excited to
ride a mechanical bull.

186
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:52,081
He saw it and was like,
I need to jump on there.

187
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:53,290
And I was like, really?

188
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,453
He's like, yeah.

189
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,009
You're brave, huh?

190
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,580
Are you strong enough to do it?

191
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,413
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:06:58,413 --> 00:06:59,978
- [Bryan] Lemme see your muscles.

193
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:00,811
Whoa!

194
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:09,947
Oh my goodness.

195
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:13,306
Our four year old is riding a bull.

196
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:15,889
(upbeat music)

197
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,849
This kid has no fear.

198
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,129
He just sees a bull, and he's like,

199
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:24,076
I wanna jump on top of that and do that.

200
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:24,909
- Whoa!

201
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,133
- [Missy] Uh-oh, uh-oh.

202
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,207
- [Bryan] Uh-oh, are you falling off?

203
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,056
Hang on!

204
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:33,405
Next up on the bull is Finn himself.

205
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:36,779
(upbeat music)

206
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,446
Uh-oh, you slipping?

207
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:41,587
Oh, and he's off.

208
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,755
Whoo!

209
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,583
Good job, dude!

210
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,166
(upbeat music)

211
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,107
Ooh, these goats are hungry.

212
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,223
(laughing)

213
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,585
(upbeat music)

214
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:01,741
Ollie, what happened with that one?

215
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:04,357
- That one scratched at me.

216
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:05,248
- [Bryan] Did he?

217
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,393
He's hungry, huh?

218
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:08,976
(upbeat music)

219
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:14,469
We are now making our
way to the pumpkin patch.

220
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,127
We're gonna go pick out some pumpkins

221
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,697
that we can carve and take home,

222
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,030
and set around the house and stuff.

223
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,531
But for those of you who don't know,

224
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:23,031
it is actually Friday the 13th.

225
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:26,318
That's right, it is the spookiest day

226
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:28,983
in the spookiest month of the year.

227
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:31,494
So we're hoping that we don't
run into anything too crazy

228
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:32,832
in the pumpkin patch,

229
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,942
but we're not really
sure what's out there.

230
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:36,419
But I bet it's just pumpkins.

231
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,308
But you never know,

232
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,370
and it's Friday the 13th,

233
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:39,203
so anything can happen, so.

234
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,331
We're gonna head out,

235
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:41,525
look for some pumpkins.

236
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:44,108
(upbeat music)

237
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:00,407
Oh my gosh, you guys,

238
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,701
there is a real vampire and a werewolf

239
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:05,886
taking over this pumpkin patch.

240
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:07,245
Are you a nice vampire

241
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,109
or a scary vampire?

242
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:09,942
- I'm a nice vampire.

243
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,012
- [Bryan] Okay.

244
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:12,137
Whoa, where'd he go?

245
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,804
He's invisible, wow!

246
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:17,226
And there is the cutest little werewolf

247
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:18,496
that you ever did see

248
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:20,996
running around these pumpkins.

249
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:23,451
(wolf howling)

250
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:25,466
(upbeat music)

251
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,641
(growling)

252
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,413
This werewolf is all talk.

253
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,246
Look at, he's so cute.

254
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:32,885
How do those pumpkins feel?

255
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:33,718
- Mm.

256
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:35,919
(laughing)

257
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,502
(upbeat music)

258
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:41,735
All right, Ollie.

259
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:44,877
Vampire Ollie, we gotta
pick out a white pumpkin

260
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:48,086
for our Jack Skellington design.

261
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,836
Which one looks good?

262
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:57,819
Ooh, that's a good one.

263
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:58,804
You think that one?

264
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:00,013
- [Missy] Ooh, that's a cute one.

265
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:01,223
- [Bryan] All right, Ollie.

266
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:03,631
We got quite a lot of pumpkins, didn't we?

267
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:04,513
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:05,709
- [Bryan] Did you have
fun at the pumpkin patch?

269
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:06,542
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,537
- [Bryan] Finn, did you have
fun at the pumpkin patch?

271
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:09,370
- Yeah!

272
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,656
- Yeah.

273
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:12,378
Kids are obsessed with Halloween.

274
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,787
Yeah, we got a lot of
really cool pumpkins,

275
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,520
and actually, this one's really cool, too.

276
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,597
It's a little fairy tale,

277
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:19,810
so I'm just gonna do this one also.

278
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,688
Oops, you guys.

279
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,763
I may have bought too many pumpkins.

280
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:24,475
Is that too many?

281
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:27,058
(upbeat music)

282
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:35,404
So they have a rock climbing wall here.

283
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:37,634
Ollie is getting geared up.

284
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,200
He's got his vampire costume on.

285
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,046
He's gonna rock climb.

286
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:43,068
Are you gonna make it
all the way to the top?

287
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:43,901
- Yeah.

288
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,072
- [Bryan] Yep.

289
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:46,087
There he goes.

290
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:47,351
Put your feet on the rocks like steps.

291
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:48,184
There you go.

292
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:49,699
And push up.

293
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,398
Whoa, dude.

294
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:52,377
Keep going!

295
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:53,462
Pull yourself up,

296
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:54,805
use your muscles.

297
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,909
You're halfway up there, dude.

298
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:58,409
Keep going, buddy.

299
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,197
He's got his little cheerleading squad.

300
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:02,334
(cheering)

301
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,167
Go, Ollie!

302
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:05,544
Woohoo!

303
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:08,711
(inspirational music)

304
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:15,096
Missy, he is really close
to the top right now.

305
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:16,651
- He's gonna, get that button, Ollie!

306
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,508
- You can do it, buddy!

307
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:21,091
(upbeat music)

308
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:23,822
Oh my gosh, Missy.

309
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:25,102
Look at that.

310
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,053
- [Missy] You got it, bud!

311
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,008
- [Bryan] You did it, dude!

312
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,258
(cheering)

313
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,517
He's not coming down.

314
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:35,600
There you go.

315
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,968
Did you see your brother
went all the way up there?

316
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,564
- Oh my god, that was amazing!

317
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:44,731
- [Bryan] Good job, Ollie!

318
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,591
Four years old and he
just climbed a rock wall

319
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:49,063
all the way to the top.

320
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:49,896
- That was great.

321
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,056
I'm gonna take him rock climbing with me.

322
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:52,291
- Yeah.

323
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,102
You earned yourself a sticker.

324
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:56,522
You climbed all the way up there.

325
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:57,552
Do you see that?

326
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:58,928
That was you.

327
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,095
I am so proud of you.

328
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,491
That was awesome.

329
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:04,096
You conquered your fear,
and you did it, huh?

330
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,186
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:07,899
My legs are still shaking.

332
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:08,732
- They're shaking?

333
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,201
Are you sore?

334
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:11,171
He's sore.

335
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:13,504
He's like, I need a massage.

336
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,557
And the pumpkin patch was a success.

337
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:17,814
Did you guys have fun?

338
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:19,749
We got pumpkins.

339
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:20,979
The boys got toys.

340
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,014
Be sure you check out that i-card

341
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:24,158
and check out both Carl
and Jinger's channel

342
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,153
and Steps to Wander,

343
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:26,986
go check 'em all out.

344
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,054
They had fun here, too, as well.

345
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:29,869
So there's gonna be a couple
of fun pumpkin patch videos

346
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,394
hitting your sub box.

347
00:12:32,394 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
