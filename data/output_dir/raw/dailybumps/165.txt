1
00:00:00,685 --> 00:00:02,340
- Shh, Finn's sleeping.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,173
- [Bryan] He is?

3
00:00:03,173 --> 00:00:04,006
- Yeah.

4
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,839
- Look at this cuteness right now.

5
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:09,718
- He's so cute.

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,621
- [Bryan] He is cute, huh?

7
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:12,247
- Yeah.

8
00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:14,830
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,871
♫ Wherever you are

10
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:23,696
♫ That's where I wanna be

11
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:26,308
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

12
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:30,960
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,283
♫ This is home

14
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:36,993
♫ Just runnin' around
you've never looked so cute

15
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:41,160
♫ Huggin' you tight
cuddlin' all I could sayin'

16
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:45,084
♫ I am home

17
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:49,167
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

18
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:54,166
- [Both] Good morning.

19
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,064
- [Bryan] Good morning my little birdies.

20
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,457
Do you know why I'm calling
you a little birdie?

21
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:01,092
'Cause it looks you guys
are sitting in little nests

22
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,766
in your playroom.

23
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:03,599
(yelling excitedly)

24
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:04,632
Ollie do you remember

25
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:05,991
those little birdies we found in the yard?

26
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:07,096
- Yeah.
- It's kind of like that,

27
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:09,279
it's kinda like you
got your own nest, huh?

28
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,509
Do you like your new beanbags?

29
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:11,941
(affirmative gibberish)

30
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,304
Yeah, look at them.

31
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,673
They're all dressed.

32
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:15,873
They're all dressed and clean!

33
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:17,867
All dressed and clean this morning!

34
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:20,029
(excited gibberish)

35
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:21,829
Good morning guys!

36
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,881
Today we have a really fun day.

37
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,233
I have a surprise for both of these boys.

38
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:28,261
You guys excited?

39
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,344
- Mhm.
- Yeah.

40
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:33,819
- Finn's like, I don't
know what it is but yay!

41
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,126
- Mo!

42
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:36,022
- You wanna watch a movie?

43
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:36,928
- Yeah.

44
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:38,866
- The boys have been amazing this morning,

45
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,126

Kids are happy and I'm happy.

00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,973
The wife happy, I'm happy.

50
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,070
I'm happy I'm happy.

51
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,874

54
00:01:57,303 --> 00:01:58,419
Isn't that so cool?

55
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,252
- Yes.

56
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,085
- Yes?

57
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:00,918

- Yes.

59
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,046
- Can you sing a little bit of it?

60
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,424
(singing)

61
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:06,257
- What?

62
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:08,424
(singing)

63
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:11,383
- Finn, can you sing the song?

64
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,300
Say, this is our tribe.

65
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:15,081
Right?

66
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:16,727
- This our tribe.

67
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:17,560
- Yeah!

68
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,154

73
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,591
But, we're so excited for you all

74
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,924
to hear our new family song.

75
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,531
Missy to the rescue.

76
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:39,588
Yes, that is right, I
have still not finished

77
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:40,849
this Lego Mack.

78
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:42,779
And Ollie every single night is like,

79
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:45,017
dada can you finish this tonight?

80
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,672
He wants to wake up and play with it.

81
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:47,525
- I know.

82
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:49,629
- I feel so bad, look
how much I did though.

83
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:50,775
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

84
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:52,564
- It just needs legs.

85
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:54,160
- Finish it up for ya.

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,993
- Missy is a Lego pro.

87
00:02:57,965 --> 00:03:02,586
This is that cool Fire Mack
from the new Ninjago movie.

88
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:05,288
Kinda got a theme going on today because

89
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:07,217
we are surprising the boys

90
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:09,880
and we are taking them
to an early screening

91
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,836
of the Lego Ninjago movie,
and I am so excited to see it

92
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:14,435
because I love Lego movies

93
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,185
and Ollie loves Ninjago,
he literally told me today

94
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,619
he wants to be Ninjago for Halloween.

95
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,289
- I know, he loves
Ninjago and he loves Legos

96
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,057
so like, perfect thing.

97
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:25,170
- I think they're gonna love it.

98
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,561
But I thought we could finish this

99
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:30,139
and not take it there 'cause
he will destroy it probably.

100
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:30,972
- Yeah.

101
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:32,104
- Maybe we should glue it all together.

102
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:34,005
- I know, I feel bad 'cause he's actually

103
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,536
not the one that usually breaks it.

104
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,334
- Breaks them.
- It's usually Finn.

105
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:39,772
- Yeah, that's true.

106
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:41,174
Finn does not have patience.

107
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:42,628
By the way we're hanging out in our office

108
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,111
and we're watching them on the Nest Cam

109
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,012
in the playroom 'cause they are playing.

110
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:49,031
Sometimes technology makes parenting easy.

111
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,604
Easier.

112
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:51,774
- Finn's sleeping.

113
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:52,649
- [Bryan] He is?

114
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,737
- Yeah.

115
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:56,570
- Look at this cuteness right now.

116
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:02,157
He fell asleep in his new
beanie bag, it's so precious.

117
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,002
- It's so cute.

118
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,038
- He is cute, huh?

119
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:04,871
- Yeah.

120
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:09,210
What are you doing, are you scheming?

121
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,877
Don't mess with him.

122
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:15,153
You're such a good big brother.

123
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:16,149
- That was a kiss.

124
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,917
Going to Ninjago!

125
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,404
- Yay, we're in the car headed out

126
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:24,103
to go see the new Ninjago movie
and we are so excited, huh?

127
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,114
- Let's do this.

128
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:28,697
(upbeat music)

129
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,185
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie.

130
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,263
He isn't really sleeping,

131
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:51,021
I'm trying to wake him up right now.

132
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:54,253
Hey Ollie, you wanna see Ninjago?

133
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,086
Yeah.

134
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,379
- A Lego knight!

135
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,292
- [Bryan] Yeah dude!

136
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,632
Look at this guy.

137
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,687
- I see that dragon right there.

138
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:03,394
- [Bryan] This is a dragon
tail, looks like he busted

139
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:04,227
through the whole building.

140
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:06,248
Come look dude!

141
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:08,831
Oh my gosh he's looking at you!

142
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,833
- He looks like a baby one.

143
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,998
- [Bryan] He's a baby dragon?

144
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:16,746
Ollie is not scared at all.

145
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:19,028
Wassup Lego knight dude?

146
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,324
We just checked in at Legoland,
now we're getting ready

147
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:25,113
to go see Ninjago, you wanna
go see the new movie bro?

148
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:27,030
- I give the man a hug.

149
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,260
- Aw that's so nice of you.

150
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,687
- [Bryan] Who is that?

151
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:33,252
- It's Ninjago!

152
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:35,092
- [Bryan] Aw, go give him a
hug, go give him a hug Finn!

153
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:38,282
That's a friendly Lego ninja.

154
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:39,318
- He has a sword!

155
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:40,615
- [Bryan] Yeah, isn't that cool?

156
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,448
- Yeah.

157
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:44,629
- [Bryan] Wow, that is so cool you guys.

158
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,408
Are you excited to see Ninjago?

159
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:47,241
- Yeah.

160
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,608
- [Bryan] Are you excited to see Ninjago?

161
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:49,856
- Yes.

162
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:52,631
- [Bryan] Give me your
best ninja warrior pose.

163
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:54,048
Raaah, woah dude.

164
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:59,234
(upbeat music)

165
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:10,798
What up, Liv?

166
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,623
Building Legos, that is so cool

167
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,696
- I found a big Lego Six!

168
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:22,266
- [Missy] Yeah look how big it is!

169
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,027
The kids are in heaven right now.

170
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:26,610
(upbeat music)

171
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:44,148
- [Bryan] Ollie we got Ninja
Kai, that's pretty cool huh?

172
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:46,392
- I'm steering the ship.

173
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:50,277
- [Bryan] Yeah you are, so we
are in this huge play area.

174
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,195
It's like a castle, it's incredible.

175
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:54,788
Look at this tree, babe.

176
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:56,855
How many of these trees have you built?

177
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:57,708
- So cool.

178
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,618
- [Bryan] You wanna give Kai a hug?

179
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,868
Give him a hug.

180
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:05,316
(yelling excitedly)

181
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,700
- [Bryan] Woah!

182
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,508
There's a big troll right there.

183
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:11,669
We get private access to Legoland, Ollie,

184
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,556
you are so special, you know that?

185
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:14,389
- Yeah.

186
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:15,683
- [Bryan] You're a lucky kid.

187
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,824
Check this out, you
guys, Legoland shut down.

188
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:20,713
We get to go ride the Ninjago ride.

189
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:24,199
And then we get to go see
the new Ninjago movie.

190
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,159
Look how close it is,
babe, that's the hotel.

191
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,867
And this is the entrance.

192
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:28,700
- That's pretty cool.

193
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,723
- [Bryan] Yeah.

194
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:32,971
Look at all the Ninjago characters.

195
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:33,804
- Hi Jay!

196
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,091
- [Bryan] There's Jay,
he's a cool one, huh?

197
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:38,924
- Yeah.

198
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:42,421
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, show me your muscles.

199
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,171
- My muscles pop out.

200
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:49,406
(oriental music)

201
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:06,973
- That's the one Kai has,

202
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:09,185
that's a sword Kai.

203
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:10,667
- [Bryan] Really?
- Yeah.

204
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,957
- [Bryan] That is so
funny that he knows that.

205
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:17,045
He's in Ninjago heaven right now you guys.

206
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:18,546
There's Kai.

207
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:19,982
- He's the fire one.

208
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:21,232
- [Bryan] Yeah.

209
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,786
Alright, we're gonna take a family picture

210
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,330

211
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,163
- Yeah.

212
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,589
- You can be, you have the

213
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:32,422

00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:33,255

219
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,009

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,138
Alright kids, come on.

Go, go, go, get 'em!

225
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,143
They look so cool in these masks.

226
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:03,090
- So cute!

227
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,840

228
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:14,631

229
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,385
What'd you get, Ollie?

230
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:27,920
- I got a Lego compass.

231
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,964

235
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:38,129

Woah, a big Lego batman set?

244
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,820
- Come see Ninjago!

245
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,554
- We had such a fun time hanging
out at the Legoland Hotel

246
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:10,105
and now we are here for
a special early screening

247
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:13,488
of Ninjago, think it'll be good?

248
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,842
- I'm so excited.

249
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:16,305
- Yay, you excited Finn?

250
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:17,361
- Yeah.

251
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,488
- Say, let's do this!

252
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,470
- Let's do this.

253
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,053
(upbeat music)

254
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:27,706
- Alright Ollie, how'd you like the movie?

255
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:28,539
- Good.

256
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:29,372
- Good?

257
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:32,134
It was actually super cute, I loved it.

258
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:32,967
- Cool.

259
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,350
- It was cool.

260
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,183
- Awesome.

261
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:36,300
- Awesome.

262
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,547
- What was your favorite part, Ollie?

263
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:39,547
- The ninja.

264
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:41,655
- [Bryan] Oh, the ninjas?

265
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:43,269
- [Missy] Which ninja?

266
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,561
- Kai.

267
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,394
- He loves Kai.

268
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,346
- He's obsessed with the red one.

269
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,679
- I'm like, that's not even
the main character, bro.

270
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,226
- It's not, I actually have always thought

271
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:52,074
that Kai was the main
character 'cause I'm like,

272
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:53,147
of course he is.
- I think Kai's

273
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:54,679
Kai's the main character on the show.

274
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,724
- Oh is that what it is?

275
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:56,557
- The movie's about Lloyd.

276
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:57,685
- Oh, okay.

277
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,858
It was super cute and I can definitely see

278
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,351
that we are going to be
watching that a bazillion times

279
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:04,191
once it's out. (laughs)

280
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:07,623
We had a really fun time,
we had a really fun day,

281
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,860
thank you Lego for inviting us out,

282
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,942
it was so much fun.

283
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:13,226
For now we're gonna end the
vlog, Finn's already asleep,

284
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:15,334
he's like peace out
guys, I'm going to bed.

285
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:18,682
I'm actually surprised he's up though.

286
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:19,565
Ew.
- He's like, I wanna

287
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,414
fall asleep in my bed.

288
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,625
- Yeah.
- That's so cute.

289
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,208
- Yeah, I like falling asleep in my bed

290
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,117
rather than in the car.

291
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:27,327
- Cool pajamas, bro.

292
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:28,813
- He's got Spiderman on.

293
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,146
Can you give this video a big thumbs up?

294
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:36,574
And we'll see you guys
tomorrow, what do you say?

295
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,407
- Bye.

296
00:11:39,683 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
