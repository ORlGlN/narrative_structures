1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:02,004
- Hey guys.

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:06,314
So today is going to be a
little bit different of a vlog.

3
00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:08,533
We did not expect this today,

4
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:11,012
we actually had a lot of different plans

5
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:14,604
and not really sure any
of those plans right now

6
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:16,981
because we just recently, kind of,

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:20,833
received an email and a
lot of things have changed,

8
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,178
and I'll let Bryan kinda explain

9
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:23,751
what we're gonna be doing.

10
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,229
- Yeah, so,

11
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:27,222
we got an email

12
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:28,055
and it's,

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,643
(sniffs)

14
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:38,572
- You okay?

15
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,595
(Bryan crying)

16
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:45,899
- This is gonna be a
really difficult thing

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:46,777
for us to talk about

18
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:49,481
and it's gonna be a really sad vlog

19
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:51,227
and it might even be something

20
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,847
that you guys won't wanna watch, so.

21
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:57,219
- So we had a phone call
today with Make-A-Wish,

22
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,552
and there's this little boy,

23
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:02,028
he's five,

24
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,195
and he watches our channel

25
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:09,138
and he likes our videos,

26
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:12,400
- Likes our music.

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,272
- And he's not doing very well.

28
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:15,150
- Yeah.

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,400
He has Leukemia

30
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:21,422
and in typical Make-A-Wish situations,

31
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:22,897
we would go and, you know,

32
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:24,635
do a meet and greet,

33
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:25,604
hang out,

34
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:26,437
- Maybe, like,

35
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:27,270
get to spend the day with him.

36
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,327
- Yeah.
- You know,

37
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:29,625
like bring him some happiness.

38
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,458
- Yeah,

39
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,659
and this is just a really

40
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,401
much different situation.

41
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:37,568
He's basically looking at end-of-life,

42
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:40,446
doesn't have very long.

43
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:42,986
And so--
- So we had these plans,

44
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:46,379
and we're kinda just stopping everything

45
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,212
and like,

46
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:48,864
just talking

47
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:49,781
and praying

48
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:51,480
and crying.

49
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,347
- This is more important, obviously.

50
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,590
Nothing else matters.

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,646
If you get a request like this,

52
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:58,534
you know,

53
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,617
you drop it all, and you,

54
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:04,070
obviously we're heartbroken.

55
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,446
We wanna, like, help this family.

56
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:09,529
- So Henry's final wish is to meet us

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,450
and sing him our theme song.

58
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,770
I'm not sure if it's
Tribe or This is Home.

59
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,095
Honestly, I don't know

60
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:22,916
if we're really gonna be able
to get through any of them.

61
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,964
It's one of those things
that you kinda have to

62
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:26,714
remove yourself from.

63
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:29,400
And there's, like,

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,758
a lot of thoughts go in
your head that are, like,

65
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:33,158
They can be really selfish,

66
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:35,652
they can be very confusing.

67
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:36,485
I think it gets hard,

68
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,803
because we have this platform

69
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:41,344
and we never thought we'd
have to do something like this

70
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:44,336
and it's especially hard because

71
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,634
this boy is five.

72
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,703
- Yeah.

73
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:50,104
- It's a five-year-old boy.
- Yeah.

74
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,815
- We have a four-year-old boy, you know?

75
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:52,827
- I know.

76
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:56,522
- I can't imagine what this
family's going through,

77
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:57,533
but at the same time

78
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,581
if we can bring them any joy

79
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:01,208
or any peace or any happiness.

80
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,295
- Comfort.

81
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:04,238
- Then like, we have to.

82
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:08,224
I feel like it's our duty
as the people that we are.

83
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:09,057
- Yeah.

84
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:12,147
I wanna just talk about
how we're feeling right now

85
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:13,966
'cos it's hard to even imagine

86
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:15,044
how they're feeling.

87
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:15,877
But, you know,

88
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:17,553
the first thoughts that
come into your mind

89
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:19,243
when you're asked something like this

90
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:22,410
as selfish as it is, it's like no way!

91
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,526
And then you start to realize that

92
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:29,886
we know these things happen
every day, all the time.

93
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:32,903
We're all, a lot of us are in a situation,

94
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:34,687
where we don't have to think about it.

95
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,651
It's not happening to us.

96
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:39,751
And so, it's easy to just
take yourself out of it.

97
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,695
But, the truth is that, I
think that all of us would love

98
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:45,073
to help someone in this situation,

99
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:47,213
but there's never really
anything for us to do.

100
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:50,998
And in this situation right
now, there's not just a child,

101
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,620
there's a whole family, that needs us.

102
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,862
- We can impact, you know,

103
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,912
- That we can help and there is, actually,

104
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:58,410
something for us to do.

105
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,341
And so, obviously that is
extremely important and,

106
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,681
nothing else matters at that point.

107
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:09,748
- We're, kinda just like,
we're stopping everything,

108
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:12,775
you know, we have everything
booked to go to CES,

109
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:15,025
and do that, and we may end up out there.

110
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,767
I don't know what the rest of
the week's gonna look like,

111
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:20,089
but today, we have to get through today.

112
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,777
And, it's gonna be hard, but.

113
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:23,589
- We're gonna have some support,

114
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:26,106
we have Jeffrey coming with us, who is,

115
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:29,750
we're super close with and
he can also even help us get

116
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,381
through a song, if
that's what we're doing.

117
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,642
He can play guitar and stuff,

118
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:37,667
and then we've got my
Aunt Chrissie coming.

119
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,801
Who's a huge support.

120
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,097
He's actually done a lot
of stuff like this before.

121
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:41,930
- Yeah.

122
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,974
- And so, she'll be able to,
kinda, help us get through it.

123
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:47,706
I think, what we're kind of,
obviously there's a lot of

124
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:51,233
prayer going on in, I think,
we're praying a lot for

125
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,897
this family and care.

126
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:55,582
The heartbreak that's
going on is so unbearable.

127
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,884
But we also are praying for ourselves,

128
00:04:57,884 --> 00:05:02,042
to be able to, like, know
what to say and how to,

129
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,527
and how to, like, comfort them.

130
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:07,235
I'm praying that, 'cos
we are like devastated,

131
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:10,519
in this whole situation, but
I'm just praying that when

132
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,536
we enter that room, that
there's some sort of, like,

133
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:16,122
peace that comes over us and,

134
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:19,341
helps us, really guide us through, like,

135
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:22,494
how to navigate this situation.

136
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:27,035
And this is definitely,
like, our worst nightmare.

137
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,225
It's not even just a nightmare.

138
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,925
- As a parent, you know what I mean?

139
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,625
It's what every parent thinks, so,

140
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,667
- But, it's not our nightmare,

141
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,439
the truth is, it's not our nightmare,

142
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,693
it's someone else's nightmare.

143
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:40,693
And, we just wanna, like, help them.

144
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:42,455
- In any way we can.

145
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:43,299
- In any way.

146
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:47,870
And we're debating how to
go about this vlog, exactly.

147
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,037
And, again, this is not about
us, this is about the family.

148
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:56,255
But we did want to share
with you, what we're gonna be

149
00:05:56,255 --> 00:06:00,434
going through today, and
maybe why things are gonna be,

150
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:02,610
I couldn't imagine, I can't
imagine making a vlog today

151
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,443
about anything else.

152
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,057
- Yes, I think it's hard to explain that.

153
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:10,020
We can't, we can't, like,
make a fun vlog today.

154
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,853
- Yeah.

155
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:11,847
- It's not gonna be a fun vlog.

156
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,821
- It's not, it's, yeah,
it's gonna be hard,

157
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:17,335
it's gonna be sad and, you
know, there might not be

158
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,247
much to it either.

159
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:22,538
I don't think we'll vlog
a lot of this situation.

160
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:24,702
But, we wanna talk about
what we're going through,

161
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:29,139
and share with you, you
know, just Henry's story.

162
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,809
And maybe, you know, we
can all just, kind of,

163
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:35,161
pray that this family has
comfort during this time.

164
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,856
And know that this is not the only family

165
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:37,862
going through this.

166
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:41,618
I mean, there are an unbelievable
amount of people who are

167
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,575
dealing with this kind of a situation.

168
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:47,498
And it's just so easy for
people to just kind of like,

169
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:50,231
"I don't want to deal with
that, I don't wanna see it.".

170
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:51,958
But sometimes you're just faced with it,

171
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,771
and that's what we're going
through right now, so.

172
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:57,373
(sniffs)

173
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:01,540
I think we're gonna be,
heading there really soon.

174
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:04,895
(sniffing)

175
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,812
