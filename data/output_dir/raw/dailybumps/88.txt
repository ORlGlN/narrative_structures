(Bryan laughs)

3
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:05,257
- What was that?

4
00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:06,090
You're like

00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,923
(Bryan laughs)

6
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,055
- [Bryan] This is what
it's like trying to get

7
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:09,510
two kids to take a picture.
- Grab it, grab it.

8
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,452
- [Blonde Woman] Ready,
one, two, three, go.

00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,646

21
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:35,175
- [All] Good morning.

22
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:37,637
- It is time for school,
or almost time for school.

23
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,470
We gotta get ready.

24
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,303
- [Ollie] Fred!

25
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:41,277
- [Missy] And they just walked out here.

26
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:42,205
What?

27
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:43,709
Why are you guys yelling Fred already?

28
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,236
- Look up.

29
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:47,718
- [Missy] (gasps) Oh my gosh!

30
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:49,368
What is he doing?

31
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,150
- [Ollie] He's flying!

32
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,317
- He is like sliding down this string.

33
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,622
What is he gonna do with this tree?

34
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:00,178
Why is he swinging to the tree?

35
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:01,511
That's so crazy.

36
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,824
He look like he's like on a mission

37
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:09,709
and he's flying with Buddy, our reindeer.

38
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,129
Finn's just like um, come here, Fred.

39
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:14,738
I'll catch ya, huh?

40
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:16,301
Well, that was a fast finding Fred.

41
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,151
That's so funny.

42
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:18,903
All right, let's get
you boys some breakfast.

43
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:21,052
Mama is cold and tired.

44
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,239
But it's school day so I gotta

45
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,822
get you all ready for school, right?

46
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:24,655
- Yeah.

47
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:26,048
- [Missy] Let's go.

48
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:28,792
All right, Ollie is all ready
and he's off to school, right?

49
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:29,625
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,460
- [Missy] And who's taking you?

51
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,956
- [Ollie] Papa!

52
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:33,320
- Papa's taking you.

53
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,916
He's so excited for Papa to take him.

54
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,068
Okay, you have a good day.

55
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:38,377
You just have a quick little short day

56
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:40,429
and then we're gonna
pick you up real early.

57
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:41,367
Is that exciting?

58
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,200
- [Ollie] Mm-hmm.

59
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,033
- [Missy] Yeah.

60
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:43,866
All right, see ya later.

61
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:44,699
Finn, give him a hug.

62
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:45,597
Say bye.

63
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:46,430
- Bye bye.

64
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:52,221
- Good job.

65
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:55,471
Yeah, the school just has a half day today

66
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:58,608
because the kids actually
have a program tonight

67
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:00,972
and I am so excited.

68
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:03,259
Ollie will be getting up in front of stage

69
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,253
and singing a song with all of his friends

70
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,229
or all of his classmates and stuff

71
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,636
and I'm so excited.

72
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:11,640
But we have a really, really busy day

73
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,859
before that, basically.

74
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:16,276
So my dad offered to take Ollie to school

75
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:19,977
and we have to get going with our day, so

76
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:22,167
now you're riding the big horsie?

77
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,000
- [Finn] Ya.

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,833
- [Missy] Okay.

79
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,976
Can you even control it?

80
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:28,286
Wow, that's actually pretty good.

81
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:29,277
Go Finn, go.

82
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:30,277
Go Finn, go.

83
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:33,138
- Good morning, you guys.

84
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:34,257
Today is such an exciting day because

85
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:38,747
Ollie has his very first
performance at school.

86
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:40,897
They're doing like a
little Christmas program

87
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,558
with all the other preschoolers

88
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,988
and he learned a song,
a couple songs I heard.

89
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,498
He's gonna get to perform on stage

90
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:48,107
and it's gonna be the
first time that Missy and I

91
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:49,735
are getting to see anything like this.

92
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:52,577
So I'm super excited
to just be that parent

93
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:56,005
in the audience filming it
and it's gonna be really fun.

94
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,855
So super excited for that.

95
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,785
Also, where did the days go?

96
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:01,447
It's six days 'till Christmas you guys.

97
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,564
Are you ready?

98
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:03,703
Better be ready.

99
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:06,087
- We have been working
all day on the boys' room

100
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:07,426
and we're super excited.

101
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,007
It's not necessarily a surprise.

102
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,366
They've kind of heard us
talking about it here and there

103
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:14,708
about like them sharing a room and stuff,

104
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,327
but today we're doing it all.

105
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,197
Ollie's not home.

106
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,484
He's basically at school,

107
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:19,907
and then he's going to Mimi and Papa's

108
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:21,748
until it's time for his program.

109
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:22,727
Finn's seen a little bit,

110
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:24,177
but he's mostly been hanging out out here.

111
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:26,137
We're now eating some lunch,
taking a little break,

112
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:27,468
and look at his face.

113
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:29,657
Finn, let me see your face.

114
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:31,248
Oh my goodness.

115
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:33,126
He's been eating spaghetti

116
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,187
and I'm having some
leftover spaghetti as well

117
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:38,567
because we needed some food
before we get back to work, huh?

118
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,400
- Yeah.

119
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,233
- [Missy] Yeah.

120
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,107
- All right, you guys.

121
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:42,987
We have acquired one Ollie.

122
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:44,244
Hi, Ollie.

123
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:45,077
- Hi.

124
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:45,964
- [Bryan] How was school, buddy?

125
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:46,797
- Good.

126
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:47,630
- [Bryan] Good?

127
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,547
And now we're back at school.

128
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,440
- Yay.

129
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,046
- So today is Ollie's Christmas program

130
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:56,406
and I am so excited to hear him
go up on the stage and sing.

131
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:57,977
Are you excited to sing on stage?

132
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:59,037
- [Boys] Yeah.

133
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:00,404
- [Bryan] You too, Finn?

134
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:01,237
- Yeah.

135
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:02,617
- I don't think Finn's going yet.

136
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,676
But yeah, you're gonna go up there

137
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,537
and sing in front of everyone.

138
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:05,534
That's gonna be cool, huh?

139
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:06,367
- [Boys] Yeah.

140
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,175
- Hey Ollie, did you know
that daddy's done that before?

141
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:09,466
- Really?

142
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,757
- [Bryan] Yeah, lots of times.

143
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:12,587
You got nothing to be afraid of, kay?

144
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:13,436
- Kay.

145
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,047
- You're gonna have a lot of fun.

146
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,569
I am so excited to hear him.

147
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:18,666
It's gonna be really, really
cool, so should be interesting

148
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,558
to see how it all goes.
- I know.

149
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,736
- [Missy] You know, I
was a little nervous,

150
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:22,737
but then he was like, "why
do I have to do it again?

151
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:23,767
I already did it today."

152
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,076
So I think they really walked
them through everything

153
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,528
and he's like, "what, I can do that.

154
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:28,361
It's not a big deal."

155
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,194
- [Bryan] Yeah.

156
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,096
- I feel like he's gonna
be excited and do good.

157
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:33,288
- All right, we just dropped Ollie off

158
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:35,276
and we are so excited.

159
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,946
We are headed to grab a seat.

160
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:37,779
You ready, Finn?

161
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:38,612
- Yeah.

162
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,776
- We gotta get a good spot so
we can see your brother, huh?

163
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:41,307
- You gotta cheer really
loud for him, okay?

164
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,974
(Festive music)

165
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:07,447
- [Bryan] Woo!

166
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,697
(Applause)

167
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,795
- [Bryan] Yes, he did it.

168
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:16,462
(Festive music)

169
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,768
- [Children] Merry Christmas!

170
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:41,530
(Applause and cheering)

171
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,063
- Christmas program just
ended and they did so good.

172
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,031
Good job, buddy.

173
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,555
Proud of you, dude.

174
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,079
Didn't he do so good, babe?

175
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,942
I actually heard him singing
- He was so cute!

176
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,545
- [Bryan] When I was sitting in front

177
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:54,588
I said, "make sure you sing
really loud so I can hear you."

178
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,451
And he did.

179
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,284
- Yeah.

180
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:57,117
- [Bryan] So cute!

181
00:05:57,117 --> 00:05:58,284
- He loves it.

182
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,080
- The boy of the hour is here
and he got his candy cane!

183
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,386
- You got the rainbow
candy cane that you been

184
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:05,754
Talking about
- He's been talking about this

185
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:08,339
- [Bryan] Rainbow candy can for a while.

186
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,411
You deserved it, buddy.

187
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,076
- Was that your prize for
singing and doing good?

188
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:12,909
- Yeah.

189
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:15,210
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, what
did you tell your teacher?

190
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,544
- That I have a Christmas album.

191
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,484
- [Bryan] Really?

192
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:20,504
- You told him that you sing on an album?

193
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:21,496
Aww.

194
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:22,481
- [Bryan] That's so cute.

195
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:26,648
Finn, give your brother a
hug and say, "good job!"

196
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:28,914
- [Gray Shirt Woman] Oh, good job.

197
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:29,970
- [Bryan] Give your brother a hug.

198
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,803
Oh, aww.

199
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:34,575
Good job, Ollie.

200
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:37,902
- [Man] Where you going?

201
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:38,735
(Bryan laughs)

202
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:39,568
- What was that?

203
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:40,401
You're like

204
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,234
(Bryan laughs)

205
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,413
- [Bryan] This is what
it's like trying to get

206
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:43,741
two kids to take a picture.
- Grab it, grab it.

207
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:44,730
- [Blonde Woman] Ready,
one, two, three, go.

208
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,618
- [Bryan] Smile, oh.

209
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,922
(Bryan laughs)

210
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:48,755
Finny.

211
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,295
Smile, boys.

212
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,202
Look here and smile.

213
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,272
- All right, we are home now.

214
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:56,694
And Ollie is home for just a little bit

215
00:06:56,694 --> 00:06:58,253
We have to get his jammies and stuff

216
00:06:58,253 --> 00:06:59,983
before he actually is gonna
go spend the night with

217
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:02,023
- Mimi and Papa's house.

218
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,030
- Yay.

219
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,973
He's really excited.

220
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,994
He can't sleep in his room yet

221
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:07,709
'cause it is still a surprise

222
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,546
so hopefully tomorrow he gets to see.

223
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,477
Are you ready to open up Advent calendar!

224
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:13,265
- [Boys] Yeah.

225
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,284
- We have two, because we
didn't do one yesterday.

226
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,678
So it is actually six days till Christmas

227
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:19,512
but we get to open up this one.

228
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:20,595
There you go.

229
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:23,423
What's in there?

230
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:24,791
- I saw one.

231
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,185
- [Missy] What is that?

232
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,127
- Storm trooper.

233
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:30,932
- [Missy] Nice, good one.

234
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,987
Kay Finn, what is it?

235
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:34,247
This one right here.

236
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,164
What is it?

237
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:39,369
Oh, it's another little spaceship.

238
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:41,050
Let's hand that to uncle to put together.

239
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,062
All right, now it is the sum sum turn

240
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:47,579
and you get to open up,
Finn, actually not that one.

241
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,416
So handsy.

242
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,389
Oh, you actually have to open this one.

243
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:51,222
Seven.

244
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,604
- [Ollie] What's the (mumbles)

245
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:54,790
- [Missy] Yeah, what is it?

246
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,870
(gasps)

247
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,120
Oh my goodness.

248
00:07:58,403 --> 00:07:59,997
Who is that?

249
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,152
Is this Baloo?

250
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,399
I think it is.

251
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,232
- Ya.

252
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,559
- Yeah, is that Baloo?

253
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,592
Here, let's open it.

254
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:06,911
Look at that.

255
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,390
Baloo, he's so cute.

256
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,568
Go show Mimi and make sure it is Baloo.

257
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,168
I'm just like not 100 percent sure.

258
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,626
All right, and then Ollie,
you get to open up the six

259
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:17,743
'cause it is six days 'till Christmas.

260
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:18,731
- [Ollie] What'd I get?

261
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,314
- What is in there?

262
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:22,565
(gasps)

263
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,341
- Gingerbread

264
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:26,808
- [Missy] Oh, it's a sleigh.

265
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:29,225
- And also a reindeer collar.

266
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,520
- Oh my goodness, let's check it out.

267
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,149
All right, these boys got all their toys.

268
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,806
Oh, the storm trooper's
already taken apart.

269
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:39,876
Bye, Finn.

270
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:43,089
And then we've got this little boat.

271
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,049
We never know what these are, exactly.

272
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,983
I think they're like ships but

273
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:47,816
Finn's pretty

274
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,055
excited about it.
- This is not

275
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,170
- [Bryan] A boat, Missy.

276
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,003
- [Missy] What is it?

277
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:51,981
- They do not have boats

278
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,293
in Star Wars.
- That's true, that's true.

279
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,637
- [Bryan] They fly around in space.

280
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:55,609
- Okay, I guess it's just another

281
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:56,988
spaceship?
- So it's a spaceship

282
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:59,086
- [Bryan] It goes (makes
flying sound effect)

283
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:01,513
- So many spaceships now and pieces.

284
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:03,875
- [Ollie] No, that is a boat.

285
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,285
- [Missy] Oh, that one is so you're wrong.

286
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,593
All right, boys.

287
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:11,590
They're in their jammies and
they're all ready for bed.

288
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,069
- [Finn And Bryan] Ho, ho, ho.

289
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,315
- Anyways, we had such a fun day.

290
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:15,612
It was kind of a busy one

291
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:18,721
and it was just so fun
getting to see you perform.

292
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,554
- [Bryan] Yeah, dude.

293
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:20,411
I'm so proud of you.

294
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:21,244
High five.

295
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:22,077
- [Missy] You did so good.

296
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:23,243
It was so cute.

297
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,333
At one point, he was
like starting to zone out

298
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,569
and he was just like looking around like

299
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,798
why are we still doing this?

300
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,418
I was laughing so hard.

301
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:32,749
But then he got into again
and it was just so cute.

302
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:34,789
He even blew me a kiss from the stage.

303
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:35,622
- Oh, he did.

304
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:37,680
- Yes, isn't that cute?

305
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,725
Anyways, all right boys.

306
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:39,758
We gotta end this video.

307
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,964
So can you give it a big thumbs up?

308
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,513
- Thumbs up for the video.

309
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:44,713
Thumbs up!

310
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:46,057
- [Missy] Thumbs up, oh!

311
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:47,533
- He just went like

312
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,426
- [Missy] Yeah.

313
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:50,306
And we'll

314
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,526
(Ollie speaks)

315
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,109
- [Missy] Oh no.

316
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:56,784
You're giving the little
candy thing a thumbs up?

317
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:57,626
- [Ollie] Yeah.

318
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:58,681
- [Missy] All right.

319
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,241
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

320
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:01,562
What do you say, boys?

321
00:10:01,562 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Boys] Bye. Boop.
