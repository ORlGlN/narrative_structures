1
00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:04,238
- [Missy] Finn just slid into
action and posed like this.

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:05,599
He even held his pose for me.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,566
Wow!

4
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:08,566
Kay, do it again.

5
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:09,983
Oh, look at that!

6
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:15,168
(playing "Tribe" by Daily Bumps)

7
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,677
(holiday pop music)

8
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:49,412
Good morning, stinky boy!

9
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:53,986
- Keep pushing!

10
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:54,819
Ahh!

11
00:00:56,526 --> 00:01:00,009
Finn's been getting his hand
stuck in this all morning.

12
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,000
- We have just been hanging out with Finn.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,967
Ollie's actually at a sleepover
with Mimi and Papa today

14
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:08,757
and so Finn has just been
keeping us super busy.

15
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,090
- [Bryan] Oh no!

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,073
Ahh!

17
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,178
- We're getting some final
touches done on the room

18
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,132
and we're just so excited for the day.

19
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:20,965
We're gonna have a fun Christmas day.

20
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:21,952
- Wanna go look at Christmas
lights today, Finn?

21
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:22,927
- Yeah!

22
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:24,094
- He's like, "Yeah!"

23
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:26,828
You like Christmas lights?

24
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:27,681
- Yeah!

25
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:29,286
- Christmas lights, Christmas cheer!

26
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:31,103
- [Bryan] Luna and Karma are so funny.

27
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:34,251
They literally will just play
out here together for hours.

28
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,979
It's so cute.

29
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,112
They also both have been so dirty

30
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:39,718
because they've been kind of naughty.

31
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:41,355
And I understand, they really don't have

32
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:42,684
a lot of dog toys right now.

33
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:43,935
We haven't bought any in a long time

34
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:44,939
and I think we just threw out

35
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,145
the last thing that was shredded apart.

36
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:50,863
So, hopefully Santa brings
you guys some dog toys, okay?

37
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:52,283
Hi, girl.

38
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:54,123
You want some puppy toys, karma?

39
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:56,094
You too, maybe some games?

40
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:57,546
It is such a beautiful day though

41
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:59,072
and the dogs are just
playing in the backyard.

42
00:01:59,072 --> 00:01:59,945
They're so cute.

43
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:02,729
I'm so glad that we got Luna, you guys.

44
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,078
She is such a good dog

45
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:05,837
and I think she's such
a good friend to Karma.

46
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,117
Karma was definitely getting lonely.

47
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:08,437
He's a social dog.

48
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:09,819
So, he likes to be social.

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,652
Hi!

50
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,420
The dogs just freak out
whenever I talk about them.

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,395
I gotta go back inside.

52
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:14,818
Kay go play, Luna, go play.

53
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:15,812
Go play with Karma!

54
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:17,601
So, as Missy told you guys this morning,

55
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:20,434
we are still working on
the boys shared room.

56
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,730
It's definitely taking some time

57
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,874
and it's a really big project.

58
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,134
And it's one that I've been, like,

59
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:27,200
designing for a really long time.

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,033
We've been thinking about it,

61
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,247
we've been slowly buying everything.

62
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:32,136
So, everything's like ready and today,

63
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:34,201
we've just been putting
everything in that room.

64
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,367
So, we're hoping we get to share that

65
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:36,850
with the boys really, really soon.

66
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,010
But, because Finn and Ollie
are gonna be in a room,

67
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,206
Finn is no longer gonna be in this room.

68
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:43,951
- I know, it's kind of sad.

69
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:46,969
I'm packing up a lot of his
little baby stuff that, like,

70
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,776
really when they're
sharing a room, you kind of

71
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:49,821
have to minimize a lot.

72
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:50,654
- [Bryan] Yeah!

73
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,307
Which is also one of
the reasons I am excited

74
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:54,332
because I'm excited to,
like, have all their clothes

75
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:57,247
in one closet, you know,
have all their toys.

76
00:02:57,247 --> 00:03:00,872
It's no longer Ollie's toys,
it's Ollie and Finn's toys,

77
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:03,392
you know, Ollie and Finn's books.

78
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,541
- Yeah, I'm really excited about it.

79
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,596
I think, especially with their clothes,

80
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:07,801
it'll be nice to just to,
like, minimize their clothes

81
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,471
because they're not
going to have a dresser.

82
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:11,864
So, I'm a little freaked out about it

83
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:13,051
but I think it's going to be good

84
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:16,111
because I think that
minimizing their clothes,

85
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,928
so we're just like these are the options,

86
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:18,761
will be really nice.

87
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:20,061
- [Bryan] And soon they'll
be wearing the same clothes,

88
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:20,894
which is cool.

89
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,141
They're already wearing the same pajamas.

90
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:23,141
- They basically wear the same clothes.

91
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,522
- [Bryan] Yeah, they
wear the same clothes,

92
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:25,793
same sizes, I mean.

93
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:26,960
So, are you, like, going through,

94
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,146
like, stuff we need to
get, or, like, donate?

95
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:30,209
- Yeah, so what's weird is usually

96
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,226
when I go through their clothes,

97
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,270
I usually just get rid of all
the stuff that they don't fit.

98
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,146
Well, now I'm not only getting

99
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:35,314
rid of stuff that they don't fit

100
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:37,133
but stuff that they do fit in still,

101
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,176
but I'm kind of just like,
well, we don't really wear that,

102
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,209
and I don't really need that, like,

103
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,196
we don't need all these clothes.

104
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:43,391
So, I'm getting rid of even
clothes that they fit in

105
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,263
which is really weird.

106
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:45,959
- [Bryan] It's okay, we're
gonna give them to some kids

107
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,290
who need 'em which is always nice.

108
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,795
- And I'm gonna keep a
few for the next baby

109
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,262
because you never know if
it's gonna be a boy too.

110
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,944
- [Bryan] I think we know what
the next baby is gonna be,

111
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:54,861
right guys?

112
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:59,245
- And if it is a girl then, you know,

113
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:00,876
they can wear a few boys clothes too.

114
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:02,461
- [Bryan] Yeah, it's really
cool because we found

115
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:05,325
a couple of things in this room
that we want to incorporate,

116
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,151
and in Ollie's room, so it's kind of like

117
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:08,971
a mixture of everything which is neat.

118
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:12,361
- Yeah, and actually a
lot of Finn's room decor

119
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,299
actually matches which is kinda nice.

120
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,291
- What's really cool is not only will this

121
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,749
not be Finn's nursery anymore

122
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:22,235
but this is gonna be the
nursery for our next baby

123
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,186
when we have a baby, when we decide that.

124
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:27,159
We're kind of cleaning out
that room and picturing it.

125
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:28,715
What is this room gonna look like,

126
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:31,386
ya know, in six months, in a year?

127
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:32,290
We don't know.

128
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,123
It's really exciting to have,

129
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:35,145
like, cool things like
this with your family.

130
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,303
When things change in your family

131
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:38,437
and you get to see your
family grow and stuff.

132
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:40,703
So, it's exciting.

133
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:43,485
- We are having such a fun little day

134
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:47,915
doing some organizing with
the boys' rooms and now,

135
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:48,810
the boys are actually home.

136
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,521
My dad actually ended up
taking Finn to go get Ollie

137
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,646
and some lunch and they're almost here.

138
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,849
So, I'm super excited to see them.

139
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,124
Let's see if Ollie had
fun at Mimi and Papa's.

140
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:00,824
Ollie, did you have fun?

141
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:01,657
- Yeah!

142
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:02,714
- [Missy] I missed you!

143
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:04,170
- I missed you too.

144
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,378
- [Missy] Are you excited to be home?

145
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:06,384
- Yeah.

146
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,473
- [Missy] Cool, alright,
let's get in the house.

147
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:13,049
And look even Finn fell asleep
on his little adventure.

148
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:13,882
- Mama?

149
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:14,715
- [Missy] Yeah?

150
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,548
- Is my bed ready now?

151
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:21,855
- Not yet, almost though, almost, okay?

152
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,257
- Okay.

153
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,589
- [Missy] Finn wants
to show you something.

154
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,172
Ollie, follow Finn.

155
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,558
What is he doing?

156
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:29,790
(inaudible speech)

157
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,623
I know!

158
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:34,659
I woke up to him this
morning and he was fishing.

159
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,816
He's fishing for our real fish.

160
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,154
Isn't that so funny?

161
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:40,800
- He didn't catch one did he?

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,627
- [Missy] No, not yet,
I'm hoping he doesn't.

163
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,525
- That would be not good, huh?

164
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,658
- [Missy] I know, luckily I
don't see any bait on there

165
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:50,413
so I don't think that
they'll take the bite.

166
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:54,903
Yeah, he's just in here
fishing for our fish.

167
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:56,028
I don't know what his plan is.

168
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,669
What do you think he'd
do if he catches one?

169
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:01,291
- Maybe he will eat it?

170
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,445
- I hope not, that'd be so sad!

171
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:04,919
What if he took the fish and,

172
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,979
like, took it back to the North Pole?

173
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,937
- Maybe he would turn it in snow.

174
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,579
- [Missy] Turn it in snow?
- Yeah.

175
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,716
- [Missy] You're so funny.

176
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:16,186
Well Fred, you are a mischievous one.

177
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,107
We don't know what you were
trying to do with that fish

178
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:20,261
but I think they're all safe.

179
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:22,363
Maybe he was just kind of teasing us, huh?

180
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:23,196
- Yeah.

181
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:33,822
- Finn was Fred fishing
in the fishing tank?

182
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:34,655
- Yeah.

183
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,949
- That's silly elf on the shelf, huh?

184
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:39,177
He's trying to catch my fish.

185
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:43,850
Those are your fish too
buddy, they're are friends.

186
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,457
That is seriously so funny.

187
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:48,918
Fred, I don't know if
that hook's gonna work

188
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:52,697
but he better be careful because
Dude actually might bite it

189
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:55,147
and get him in the tank.

190
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:56,731
For those of you who
don't know, this is Dude.

191
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:58,148
He's our big guy.

192
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:01,808
He basically runs the tank.

193
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:03,303
Hey Fred I'm pretty sure you don't have

194
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:05,700
a fishing license to fish here.

195
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,373
You're gonna have to go elsewhere.

196
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:08,625
- Alright, boys...

197
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,898
We have been playing, oh my goodness...

198
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,056
We've been playing, mommy and daddy

199
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:17,544
have been basically working
on their room all day

200
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:21,192
so it's just kind been one of
those days, but guess what?

201
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:25,408
I finally have finished
peanut butter balls

202
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:27,876
and I really want the boys to
try them for the first time.

203
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:29,882
I think Ollie's gonna be a little hesitant

204
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,412
but of course he's gonna love
them once I make him try 'em.

205
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:36,058
Finn is going to love
them and be very excited.

206
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:38,539
Are you guys excited to
try my peanut butter balls?

207
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,254
- Yeah!
- [Missy] Are you?

208
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:41,416
- Yeah!

209
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:45,166
- Kay good, lemme turn
the light on, hang on.

210
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:47,922
These are what we have so far.

211
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:50,321
Now, they're not all done yet.

212
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:53,145
This is all mommy's done
done but we're gonna try one.

213
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,576
Have you had one of these before?

214
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:56,358
- Yeah.
- [Missy] Have you?

215
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:57,525
Mkay, show me.

216
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:01,843
Is it good?

217
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:02,676
Yay!

218
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:04,067
Oh, and he just put it right in his mouth.

219
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,045
You like it?

220
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:05,878
- Mhmm.

221
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:07,828
- [Missy] You were like so
nervous to try it yesterday.

222
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,769
You said you didn't want
one but they're good?

223
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,354
- Yeah.

224
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:12,187
- What have I done?

225
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,517
I've now probably created a monster.

226
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,930
He's just gonna ask me
for a peanut butter ball

227
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,071
every five seconds today.

228
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:18,431
But they're pretty good, right?

229
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,098
Mm they are so good.

230
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:25,848
Mm I actually bought tons of little tins

231
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:28,340
to put them in for gifts and stuff.

232
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,656
So, I think I'm gonna package
up a few and give them to,

233
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,716
like, Kelsey and Corbin tonight

234
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:36,464
because she helped me a
ton make these and so,

235
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:38,019
I'll probably be giving her a lot more

236
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,677
but I wanted to have
some, like, right away.

237
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:42,489
So, yay, I'm gonna go package
some of these up for them

238
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,847
and give them to 'em.

239
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,533
We're gonna be doing
something really fun later

240
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,045
and we're so excited.

241
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:48,642
Oh, where's Ollie?

242
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,032
Ollie's gone.

243
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:51,448
Alright, I'm gonna eat
my peanut butter ball.

244
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,611
Finn just slid into action
and posed like this.

245
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,141
He even held his pose for me, wow.

246
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,038
Very, very good.

247
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,083
Do you wanna do it again?

248
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:00,916
- Yeah.

249
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,431
- [Missy] Kay do it again.

250
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,848
Oh, look at that.

251
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,011
Oh and look at Ollie's pose.

252
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:08,553
You guys are so cute.

253
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:11,286
Alright I just got these packaged up.

254
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:13,942
I got these cute little containers

255
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:15,291
and it says Merry Christmas

256
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:19,103
and then I put to K and C from M and B.

257
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,322
I think I'm actually gonna cut it

258
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:22,696
because I think I want you
to be able to see inside,

259
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,597
those peanut butter balls.

260
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,918
And there we have them.

261
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:28,144
Look how delicious those look.

262
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:29,920
I was actually debating,
like, maybe wrapping them

263
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,358
in a little bit of,
like, ribbon around them

264
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,422
but I think they're going to want

265
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:35,812
to get into them pretty quickly.

266
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:38,706
Oh, and Ollie is still
showing us his moves.

267
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:40,363
Very cool, dude.

268
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,862
We are on our way to see
some Christmas lights

269
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:46,193
and our boys even got their hats on!

270
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:47,526
Nice hat, Ollie.

271
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,246
Nice hat, Finn.

272
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:51,343
Missy's even got a hat.

273
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,928
Where's my hat?

274
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:55,691
I'm rockin' this jingle
bells light up necklace

275
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,186
which is actually pretty cool.

276
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:58,019
What?

277
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,368
(unintelligible speech)

278
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:00,438
- He says, where's my hat.

279
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:02,859
- [Missy] Where's your hat, huh?

280
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:03,843
Oh, where's your shoes.

281
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:05,606
- [Bryan] Where's your
shoes and how come he can't

282
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,920
keep 'em on for more than ten minutes.

283
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,762
- I checked the forecast and it says that

284
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:13,046
there was a zero percent chance of rain.

285
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,123
- [Bryan] And what's it doing right now?

286
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:17,140
- Well, I think someone left
the sprinklers on, okay?

287
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,295
- [Bryan] It's raining, it's raining.

288
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:22,637
- It's sprinkling, it's misting.

289
00:10:22,637 --> 00:10:24,006
- It's just raining a little bit.

290
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:25,013
- [Bryan] I know.

291
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:27,930
We have found the Christmas lights!

292
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:31,075
There so cool, huh?

293
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:31,908
- Yeah!

294
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:33,281
- [Bryan] Do you remember
doing this last year, buddy?

295
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:35,448
Whoa, that's so cool, huh?

296
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,368
(unintelligible speech)

297
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,540
Yeah!

298
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,247
So, this is Bainbridge Lane.

299
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,929
It's like a famous road
in our area where they all

300
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,810
do Christmas lights that are
animated and move to music.

301
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,003
Hey Finn, look what's he doing?

302
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:51,294
He's riding in the carrier.

303
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:52,819
- Yeah, he's like, get me out.

304
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,392
- [Bryan] Yeah, he's like what is this?

305
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,475
I am an adult, excuse me.

306
00:10:57,863 --> 00:10:59,268
- [Missy] See all the lights?

307
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:01,015
- [Bryan] Aren't the cool?

308
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,018
Say Christmas!

309
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:04,278
- [Missy] Oh look, Santa's
looking at us right now!

310
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:06,629
- [Bryan] There's Santa!

311
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:09,433
He's checking to see if you've been nice!

312
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,766
(pop music)

313
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,839
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, look
who's up on this house!

314
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:33,756
Who is that?

315
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:36,040
- Yeah!
- [Bryan] Jack Skellington!

316
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,279
- Yeah, and look at his..

317
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,529
- And his dog, Zero.
- Yeah!

318
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:43,070
- [Bryan] That's so cool!

319
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,248
They have a five days til
Christmas countdown even.

320
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,499
- It's gonna be confusing for Finn

321
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,991
when he calls Christmas Halloween.

322
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:49,917
- [Bryan] I know.

323
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,917
(holiday pop music)

324
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:11,320
Whoa, yes, stomp your feet, bro.

325
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,347
And dance!

326
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:14,597
(laughter)

327
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,866
(holiday pop music)

328
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:58,000
- They have the Christmas lights.

329
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,431
- [Bryan] They were so pretty, huh?

330
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:00,264
- Yeah!

331
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,105
- [Bryan] What did you think, Finn?

332
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:03,546
Was that fun?

333
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:04,511
Yeah.

334
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,534
Look how tired they are.

335
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:07,936
I think we tired them out, babe.

336
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,784
We did it, we finally did it.

337
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:12,140
Yes, Bainbridge Falls was amazing.

338
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,706
It's so fun to do every single year.

339
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,433
It's just a really great experience

340
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:16,550
I feel like for Christmas.

341
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,818
- And it's one of our traditions now.

342
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:18,651
- [Bryan] Yeah, it totally is.

343
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:19,719
- [Missy] We've been doing it for a while.

344
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,340
- Yeah I think we're on like
six years now, doing that.

345
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,200
So, definitely a fun night.

346
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,367
Let us know down below in the comments,

347
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:28,242
do you guys go out and
look at Christmas lights?

348
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,060
Do you, like, go visit a certain place?

349
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,225
Do you kinda just, like, drive around?

350
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:34,785
Some people walk around if
they're in a good neighborhood.

351
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:36,693
Throw the kids in a cart, walk around,

352
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:37,636

00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:42,129
If you enjoyed it, be sure
to give it a big thumbs up.

Ollie's giving it a sleepy thumbs up.

00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:46,245
Thumbs up, Finn!

He's tired.

00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,036
Okay, thanks for watching today's video.

00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:51,869
