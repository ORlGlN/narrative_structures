1
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:02,110
- And we are headed to

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,660
visit a horse that I think I'm getting.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,830
But I am really, really
hoping that he's the one.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,997
If everything goes good,
I'm getting a horse today.

Good morning

17
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:31,070
- Morning.

18
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,570
(chuckles) We are up and about today.

19
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,910
And it is school day, huh, Ollie?

20
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,060
- Yeah, it's share day.

21
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,590
- It is actually share
day and the letter is.

22
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,020
- Iron Man!

23
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,000
- (giggles) It's Iron Man, it's I.

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,208
So, we found Iron Man, huh?

25
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,041
- Yeah.

26
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,260
- It's gonna be a really really cool day.

27
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,330
Hopefully, we'll see.

28
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,100
But I'm dropping him off and I'm late.

29
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,580
Six minutes late and I'm
like, I hate being late.

30
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,100
But I was like running
out of this house like,

31
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,880
"Guys, I'm so late!"

32
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,300
And I woke up on time even.

33
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,880
I must've spent too much
time like getting ready,

34
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,713
I don't know.

35
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:02,920
But, we're off to school.

36
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,700
It'll be fine, they don't
usually start til like nine-ish.

37
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,640
School technically starts at 8:30.

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,846
Alright, you ready?

39
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:10,930
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

40
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,860
You guys I feel like a terrible mom.

41
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,220
As you guys know it is
not ever very cold here,

42
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,240
in California, and especially this winter.

43
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,410
I mean, it's basically been
80s almost every single day.

44
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,960
And we've been in Vegas
the past couple days.

45
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,580
And it has been a tad chillier.

46
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,301
And I did not bring Ollie a jacket.

47
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:32,060
Ugh, he was like, "Mom,
it's really cold out."

48
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,630
And I'm like, "Oh, shoot
it's like 50 degrees."

49
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,060
So, I stopped to get me a little food.

50
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm gonna have to run
home and grab him a jacket

51
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,320
'cause it is pretty cold out.

52
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,040
And I would hate for him
to be like playing outside

53
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,870
for like lunch or break and
be like shaking. (laughs)

54
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,590
He's good now 'cause he's in the classroom

55
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,020
and it's warm in there.

56
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,080
And they only go out for
like break (soft clatter)

57
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,930
around noon so I'm gonna
run home, get him a jacket,

58
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,860
and then he won't be so cold

59
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,050
and I won't feel like such
a terrible mom. (chuckles)

60
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,322
Alright, got the jacket and we're off.

61
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,155
- Yes.

62
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,500
- Well, you're gonna stay
here with Daddy, 'kay?

63
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,333
- No.

64
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,750
- Oh, I gotta bring a jacket
to Ollie, Daddy's here.

65
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,469
- Finn, come 'ere, come 'ere.

66
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:09,301
- Dad!

67
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,351
- (laughs) He's like oh yeah.

68
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:14,890
- Come 'ere, come 'ere
(chuckles manically)

69
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,830
Wanna hang out with me?

70
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,663
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

71
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:18,311
- He's like, "Alright,
that sounds fun, alright."

72
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:19,480
- Yay.
- You have fun, 'kay?

73
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,800
- Kay.

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,140
- I have got my mom now

75
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,560
and we are headed to visit a horse

76
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,570
that I think I'm getting.

77
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,060
So, you guys saw him the other day

78
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,930
and I really, really love him.

79
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,210
I think he is a great,
great option for me.

80
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,710
And my mom feels good too.

81
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,450
That always makes me feel good. (laughs)

82
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,420
And so, he has a vet check right now.

83
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,950
So, we're gonna go do that.

84
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,080
I'm really hoping everything's okay

85
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,380
but I am okay if the vet is like,

86
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,280
if he were to say something, like,

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,780
I will be okay if I have to
like keep on with the search.

88
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,800
But I am really, really
hoping that he's the one,

89
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,790
I've got everything set, the
stall's all ready for him.

90
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,140
And I'm ready for him, oh my gosh,

91
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,470
I'm so ready to have my horse.

92
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,230
So, if everything goes good,
I'm getting a horse today.

93
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,620
I guess you guys probably know
at this point if I got him

94
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,380
because it would be like the thumbnail

95
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,130
and title probably. (giggles)

96
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,480
So, let me know if I get him.

97
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,870
But, yeah, I'm really excited
and we're headed there now.

98
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,030
Hopefully, he's healthy
and everything's good.

99
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,690
- Hello, guys, while Missy is out

100
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,190
finding her horse I
wanted to give you guys

101
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,730
an update on our entertainment center.

102
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,660
'Cause we had it finished
and I know a lot of you

103
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,620
are wondering what else
we are going to do to it.

104
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,530
So I am here to reveal to you

105
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:26,449
(Finn babbles)

106
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:29,310
the updated version.

107
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,530
So basically, we mat... (laughs)

108
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,465
Finn is very excited about this, huh?

109
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,400
(cute babbling, Bryan chuckles)

110
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
So basically, we matched
the wood behind the TV

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,540
to match the fireplace

112
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,220
and then I even put a light behind the TV.

113
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,210
And I think it looks so good.

114
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,286
It finally just looks done.

115
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:51,536
(upbeat country music)

116
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:17,709
- I think this is it, I
think I'm gonna get him.

117
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,469
I mean, I keep saying I think because...

118
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,570
- [Mom] You're getting him.

119
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,403
- I'm getting him, okay?

120
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:22,362
- [Mom] Yeah.

121
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,190
- He's like so sweet, he
passed all his vet checks.

122
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,580
He looks great and I'm so excited.

123
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,100
My mom's giving him treats.

124
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,005
At least he has love in him. (laughs)

125
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,240
It's gonna be so fun.

126
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,390
He did get a little beat up
in the pasture the other day.

127
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,910
He's gonna be a really fun horse

128
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,908
for the boys to like grow up with.

129
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:44,158
(giggles) He likes to lick too.

130
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,438
(laughs) It's that funny?

131
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:48,540
Alright, he's mine.

132
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,220
(horse neighs)

133
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,412
He's going home.

134
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:52,250
(Misty chuckles)

135
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,390
Alright, I'll see you when we get there.

136
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,070
I just bought a horse you
guys, I'm freaking out.

137
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,830
I can't believe this,
I just bought a horse.

138
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,230
You guys don't know his name yet

139
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,750
and I'll probably share
a lot more about him.

140
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,240
And I'm just like so excited.

141
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,010
But, we're going home now.

142
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,860
I will probably stop by and
just grab a few things for him.

143
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,700
But I've already bought
quite a few things.

144
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,118
I'm just so excited.

145
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:13,606
I can't believe I got a horse.

146
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,273
(calming music)

147
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,290
- So we are all so excited,
we are now here at the ranch.

148
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,398
And we are going to met Missy's horse.

149
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:38,590
Well, I'm going to meet Missy's
horse for the first time

150
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,480
and I'm so excited.

151
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,965
Hey Billy. (chuckles)

152
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,632
(calming music)

153
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,343
Alright, let's meet Missy's new horse.

154
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:54,140
(Missy imitates reveal)

155
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,330
He is beautiful.

156
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,910
Hi, what's up dude?

157
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,360
Also, I'm holding a bag of
treats and he's like hey.

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,962
This is awesome babe, you found the horse.

159
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,010
- I know.

160
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,138
- On Christmas morning,
I gave Missy a job to do.

161
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:08,971
Okay.

162
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:12,484
What is it?

163
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:15,180
- Oh my goodness, what is
this, what does this mean?

164
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,730
- It's a horse bridle.

165
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,110
(Missy mumbling)

166
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,590
Okay, I didn't give her a
present, I gave her a job.

167
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,800
And she has been working hard.

168
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,110
And she found him so this
is her beautiful horse.

169
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,595
Oh yeah, and this is
where he'll be staying.

170
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:30,428
You wanna show them?

171
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:32,240
- [Bryan] Yeah, so he's
got his own little pen.

172
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,970
He's got Wally to keep him company

173
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,780
and Billy the goat as well.

174
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,830
This is where he'll be staying though.

175
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,070
So, he's got an indoor
area that's covered.

176
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,314
And then we also have outside area too.

177
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:44,500
- Here I can close this.

178
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,333
- [Bryan] Okay.

179
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,370
Let's take him out.

180
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,230
- I love that he has an indoor
stall and an outdoor stall.

181
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,690
And of course they get turned
out everyday to go play.

182
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,588
- [Bryan] Yeah.

183
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:54,603
- You wanna go walk around?

184
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:55,436
Let's go walk around.

185
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:56,285
- Let's go buddy.

186
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,952
(calming music)

187
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,646
Babe, I got you a horse. (laughs)

188
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,270
- I can't believe it.

189
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,130
I can't believe it.

190
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,330
- [Bryan] It's like all her dreams

191
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,638
are coming true right now.

192
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,847
(Bryan laughs)

193
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:14,514
(calming music)

194
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:32,233
- Look so good.

195
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:35,050
- [Bryan] I know, what do you
think of Momma's new horse?

196
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,270
- Good.

197
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,951
- [Bryan] He's cute, huh, Finn?

198
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:38,784
- [Finn] Yeah.

199
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:39,617
- [Bryan] Yeah.

200
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:41,760
- This is Nacho, that's his name,

201
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,220
I think I wanna come
up with a second name,

202
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,342
like Nacho something.

203
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:45,710
- [Bryan] Yeah, 'cause
he's only got one name.

204
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,100
- Yeah, he's just got one name.

205
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,950
He is an appendix, which is

206
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,530
basically, a half quarter
horse and half thoroughbred

207
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,640
which is kind of cool because
I was really looking for

208
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,930
quarter horse there a great
option for your first horse.

209
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,600
They just have a really good mind.

210
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,620
But, he's got the beauty of a thoroughbred

211
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,630
which is just kind of tall and lengthy,

212
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,700
kind of a narrower.

213
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,670
He's really, really just a beautiful horse

214
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,220
but he definitely has the
mind of a quarter horse.

215
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,270
Which is really, really
important when you're a beginner.

216
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,460
He's about 12 years old, he's not old

217
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,380
but he's at a good age where he's not like

218
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,380
dumb and stupid or young and stupid.

219
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,020
He's like a little older,
been there, done that.

220
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,853
- [Bryan] Yeah. (chuckles)

221
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:24,610
- That's good, when you're
looking for a beginner horse.

222
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,533
He's just a really great trail horse

223
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,495
(Nacho neighs)

224
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:30,881
- [Bryan] Oh ho ho. (laughs)

225
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:32,530
- He's been jumping,

226
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,789
so he can do like up to three feet jumps.

227
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,879
I'm not doing that right
now but just good to know.

228
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,934
- [Bryan] He also just
said hi to everyone.

229
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,259
- Yes, look at that.

230
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,740
- [Bryan] Excited to meet you
Nacho, welcome to the family.

231
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,790
He's beautiful babe.

232
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,120
- Yeah, I'm really excited
'cause he's gonna live...

233
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,953
What? Hang on.

234
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,140
He's gonna live here but he's
very close so I can see him.

235
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,490
He's a perfect, you know,

236
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,810
just sense of ways that I
can really get accustomed

237
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,510
and really learn all I
need to know about horses.

238
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,000
Before we end up actually, probably,

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,490
bringing horses onto our property.

240
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,900
- [Bryan] Yeah.
- So, this is a great start.

241
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,150
I've got really great friends here now.

242
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,030
That honestly, I mean,

243
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,390
I plan to ride him as much as possible.

244
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,260
Two, three times a day.

245
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,640
(Nacho neighs)

246
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,340
- [Bryan] Okay, okay. (laughs)

247
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,250
But I got friends that will ride him,

248
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,830
anytime here, that are here.

249
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,360
- Yeah, that is so cool.

250
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,640
Well, he's definitely got a lot to say.

251
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,544
So, what are you gonna do now babe?

252
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:29,020
- I definitely wanna see
if my saddle fits him.

253
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,780
- [Bryan] Okay.
- I wanna put the boys on him.

254
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,802
- [Bryan] Totally, lets get some pictures.

255
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:35,469
(calming music)

256
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,880
(Oliver whines, Bryan chuckles)

257
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,230
He's tryna give you a kiss.

258
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,139
Aw.

259
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:55,806
(calming music)

260
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,060
So, this is the saddle Missy got today.

261
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,480
- Yeah, so it's like an all black.

262
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,120
It's actually not leather which I like

263
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,740
because it's a little more flexible.

264
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,573
- [Bryan] Yeah.

265
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:23,100
- The seat is super
squishy and comfortable.

266
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,933
- [Bryan] Ooh.

267
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:24,769
- So, I'm really excited about that.

268
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,083
(Bryan chuckles)

269
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,333
(inspirational music)

270
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,898
- [Bryan] That is a good
looking horse babe. (chuckles)

271
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:45,065
(inspirational music)

272
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,750
Alright, you are such a good boy, Nacho,

273
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,480
here's a little treat. (chuckles)

274
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,780
Missy's brushing his tail.

275
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,216
He's gonna be so spoiled.

276
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:56,049
Whoa!

277
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,170
He's getting a simulation.

278
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,590
This horse behind him is
like, "Hey, you can ride me."

279
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,660
- Oh, that's it, alright, come on.

280
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,620
- [Bryan] All done. (Finn whines)

281
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,453
- [Woman] Very soft.

282
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,800
- [Bryan] (laughs) He's
cleaning your hands. (laughs)

283
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,060
Nacho is a licker you guys.

284
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,830
Alright, he's in his stall,

285
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,031
he's got a little bit
of food and we are...

286
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:17,940
- [Missy] You like that name?

287
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,410
- [Bryan] Yeah, wrapping him up. (laughs)

288
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,570
- I wanna take him home.

289
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,640
- [Bryan] I know, first night,

290
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,530
he's gotta adjust to a lot
of new stuff, you know.

291
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,940
- Yeah, but he's so like
cool with everything.

292
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,773
As long their sweet.

293
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,610
He was in the pastor
before with another horse

294
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,923
that wasn't let him really
eat, picking on him.

295
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,490
He's got a couple little marks on him.

296
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,630
So, I think he's a lot happier now.

297
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,560
I think he'll be happy.

298
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,470
- [Bryan] Yes.

299
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,060
Because you're going to spoil
him and love him. (laughs)

300
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,150
- I know, I like blew so much
stuff the last few weeks.

301
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,310
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

302
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,410
Maria, this is your horse?

303
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,243
- Yes.
- [Bryan] So, who's this?

304
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,150
- This is Asher.

305
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,297
Very dirty, I'm sorry.

306
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,255
- [Bryan] Aw.

307
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,771
- On camera.

308
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:57,610
This is what we look like after rain.

309
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,760
- [Bryan] Yeah. (Bryan
chuckles, Maria laughs)

310
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,470
So, you got him Christmas
morning too, huh?

311
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,129
- Yep, I sure I did.

312
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,410
- Hi.

313
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,630
- [Maria] It was a big surprise.

314
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,225
He came with a big red bow.

315
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,770
- Aw.

316
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,712
I wasn't allowed to buy
you a horse. (laughs)

317
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:11,077
(Missy mumbles)

318
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:11,910
(Bryan laughs)

319
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,410
I wanted the horse to fill out

320
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,959
but it's okay, she found a good one.

321
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,959
(inspiration music)

322
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,390
Hi Nacho.

323
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,792
So this is his little
outdoor space that he has.

324
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:25,840
(Missy chuckles)

325
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,360
He is spoiled babe. (chuckles)

326
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,310
- He's gonna love it especially

327
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,420
'cause he's just been in a
pasture, kinda picked on.

328
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,240
He gets his own little space and food.

329
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,222
- [Bryan] Food, he gets to
eat all the food he wants.

330
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:41,389
(inspirational music)

331
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,700
- Alright, boys are all ready for bed.

332
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,330
They took their vitamins,
they brushed their teeth.

333
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,140
They got their jammies
on, their hair is brushed.

334
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,450
You guys look so cute.

335
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,680
And their picking out the books they want.

336
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,990
Oh, looks like we left a couple
Christmas books in there.

337
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,350
And Luna's over here being so cute,

338
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,540
just watching over them
while they get ready for bed.

339
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,610
Today was like such an awesome day.

340
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm so happy, I'm excited
for the future too.

341
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,710
Like, today was great but I'm excited to

342
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,430
really get to know him and bond with him.

343
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,360
It's just such an
exciting time in my life,

344
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,273
like it's just seriously dream come true.

345
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:26,720
And I feel like, I feel really great

346
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,890
about the decisions that I'm making.

347
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,220
I feel like I've done a
really good job at like

348
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,810
making a good decision on it

349
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,430
and going about it in a good way.

350
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,630
That I'm not like being
too rash or too hasty.

351
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,230
I feel like, something that my mom's

352
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,510
pointed out a couple times to me.

353
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,020
Is that, sometimes when you have like,

354
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,620
you're just getting like training done.

355
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,050
And this is how it's been
in the past few years

356
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,010
whenever I've been with horses,

357
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,610
I tend to be a little
uncomfortable around them.

358
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,370
Because it's not my horse
and it's like, you know,

359
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,550
it's like if you were to tell

360
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,000
another parents kid what to do.

361
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,100
Like, it's not my kid so I have a

362
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,290
hard time like telling them what to do.

363
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,210
So now I'm excited,

364
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,264
like I already feel so
much more comfortable.

365
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:06,097
(Finn cries)

366
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,010
I can grab my horse and say,

367
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,350
"Come over here, we're going this way."

368
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,940
And I don't have to worry that like

369
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,460
the owner (Finn yells) is not coming back.

370
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,440
So, yeah, I just, I already
feel like so much better.

371
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,550
And I'm just excited.

372
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,080
I'm excited about the boarding
place that we've chosen.

373
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,620
I'm so thrilled and excited about

374
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,980
the people I've met through them.

375
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,346
And just became like friends with.

376
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:24,650
(loud bang, smack)

377
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,483
Oh my goodness.

378
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:27,680
And I'm excited for what they can teach me

379
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,780
and moving forward and one day, you know,

380
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,870
I'll have them on my property.

381
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,200
But I think I'll always have a

382
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,490
very close relationship with this place.

383
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,859
Because I do travel a lot
and so I want them to feel

384
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:38,230
(distorted audio)
comfortable at both places.

385
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,760
So yeah, I'm just so excited,
this is so, so, so fun.

386
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,390
I'm so excited for my boys
to grow up with horses.

387
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,792
(kisses) Huh?

388
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,625
- Yeah.

389
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,746
- You excited to ride the horsey?

390
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:47,579
- Yeah.

391
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:48,810
- Alright, we're gonna go
ahead and end the video.

392
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,320
These kids are definitely done.

393
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,310
So, make sure you give this video

394
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,980
a big thumbs up if you enjoyed it.

395
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,800
Hey Ollie, thumbs up, thumbs up.

396
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,380
And we will see you guys, tomorrow.

397
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,290
- Ooh.

398
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,646
- [Missy] Bye.

399
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:02,510

400
00:15:02,510 --> 00:00:00,000
