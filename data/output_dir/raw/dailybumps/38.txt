1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
- Move your foot.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,540
- [Bryan] Finn.

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,720
- [Missy] No foot, okay that's--

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,610
- [Bryan] Yeah, Finn uses all
limbs when making cookies.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,550
There you go.
- [Missy] Good job.

6
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,070
- [Bryan] Oh! (laughs)

Good morning!
- Good morning!

16
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:35,867
- How's it going, buddy?

17
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:36,700
- Good.

18
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,570
- Good. This morning, Ollie
wanted to show you guys

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,168
something he's so proud of, and honestly,

20
00:00:41,168 --> 00:00:42,420
he did an amazing job.

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,253
You ready?

22
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:44,098
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:45,418
- Snowman!

24
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:48,059
- [Bryan] Your snowman art!
- This is my snowman.

25
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,620
- [Bryan] This is awesome.

26
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,480
- Look at my snowman.

27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,012
- [Bryan] Why is he sad, Ollie?

28
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:53,701
(Ollie laughs)

29
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:55,171
What?

30
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,156
- Because.

31
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,600
- I think I may be missing something.

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,507
Why is the snowman so angry, or sad?

33
00:01:01,507 --> 00:01:03,320
- Because he got hurt.

34
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,063
- [Bryan] He got hurt?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:07,830
- [Bryan] Was it too hot
out and he started melting?

36
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,840
- Yeah.

37
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,673
- [Bryan] (laughs) You got another snowman

38
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:10,960
over here, this one's cool.

39
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,793
- [Ollie] Yeah.

40
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:12,690
- [Bryan] Did you choose those buttons?

41
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,523
- [Ollie] Yeah.

42
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:14,540
- Wait, so did you choose
green 'cause you know

43
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,697
that's my favorite color?

44
00:01:15,697 --> 00:01:16,530
- Yeah.

45
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,363
- Yeah. (laughs)

46
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:18,425
- And look at my little--

47
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,048
- [Bryan] Your little carrot nose?

48
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:21,030
- [Ollie] Yeah.

49
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,710
- [Bryan] That is so good, Ollie.

50
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,071
We have started getting
so much preschool art.

51
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,770
It's been so cool, like him learning

52
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,715
the letter g with his goat.

53
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,690
Or p...

54
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,390
Worm...

55
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,370
It's so cool!

56
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,120
This is also our little grocery list here,

57
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,337
on the side of the fridge.

58
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:42,693
We seem to be missing something.

59
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:45,034
Always La Croix, I
always need more of this.

60
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:46,410
All right, Ollie, did you know

61
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,297
that you are on a very
important mission today?

62
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:49,270
- What?

63
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,557
- We need to make some
Valentine's Day cookies, huh?

64
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:53,390
- Yeah!

65
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,080
- Yeah! So I think you are gonna
go on a mission with Momma,

66
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,550
and you gotta pick out all the
cool Valentine's Day candies

67
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,844
and decorations for cookies, okay?

68
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:00,920
- Yeah.

69
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,143
- Do you know what
Valentine's Day is all about?

70
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:04,240
- Yeah, it's about hearts.

71
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,339
- Hearts, and what else?

72
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:06,348
- Cookies.

73
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:07,916
- Cookies, what else?

74
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,100
- Snowman.

75
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,196
- Snowman? No, it's not.

76
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,110
(Ollie chuckles)

77
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,790
Valentine's Day is about telling

78
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,430
the person you love that you love them.

79
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,560
So be sure you guys are doing that today.

80
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,294
I'm sure we have some cool plans cooked up

81
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:19,983
for Momma for Valentine's Day, huh?

82
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,511
You got a present for her?

83
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,344
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:23,177
- Yeah!

85
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:27,970
- Good morning, guys!

86
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,590
I've got Ollie now, and we are
actually headed to the store.

87
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,663
What are we getting, Ollie?

88
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:35,899
- Valentine's cookies!

89
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,894
- Yeah! Valentine's Day cookies!

90
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:39,105
Let's go get it.

91
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:41,688
(upbeat music)

92
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,850
So we thought it would be a super fun idea

93
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,010
to make Valentine's Day cookies.

94
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,118
And so Ollie wants to do, I
think, sugar cookies, right?

95
00:02:58,118 --> 00:02:59,080
- Yeah.

96
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,500
- And we're gonna, so we need to get stuff

97
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,160
for sugar cookies and we need to get stuff

98
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,230
to decorate the sugar cookies, right?

99
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,659
And we're gonna make
them all Valentine's-y

100
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,457
since it's Valentine's Day.

101
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:10,139
So we are super excited about Valentine's,

102
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,266
so we are gonna go get stuff now.

103
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:16,091
This looks like the right
aisle, Ollie, if you ask me.

104
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:18,383
All of this looks so good, huh?

105
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:19,216
- Yeah.

106
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:20,049
(Missy chuckles)

107
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,925
Look, Valentine's Day sprinkles.

108
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,565
- [Missy] (gasps) We
need some of those, huh?

109
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:25,398
- Yeah.

110
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:27,510
- [Missy] Oh yeah, those look perfect.

111
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,343
What are those ones?

112
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:29,580
- [Ollie] These are heart ones.

113
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,413
- [Missy] Those are heart ones?

114
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:32,983
Those are perfect! Nice find, Ollie!

115
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:36,080
Definitely going to need some red icing,

116
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,604
but I kinda like the idea
of some white icing, too.

117
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:39,640
Does that sound good?

118
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,473
- [Ollie] Yeah.

119
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,030
- All right, I think we've
got all of our decor,

120
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,447
and I went ahead and just
bought some of the, like,

121
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:50,860
kind that's easy to make, little baggies.

122
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,643
Just in case maybe we get too tired

123
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:55,450
and we just wanna do the easy kind, right?

124
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,316
Plus, Mommy's not very good
at making sugar cookies,

125
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:59,850
and if I try and make them,
they might turn out terrible,

126
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,401
and then we'll have to use those ones.

127
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,640
But we definitely need some butter.

128
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,607
And then I think we have just
about everything we need.

129
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:06,970
Right?
- Yeah.

130
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,561
- All right, that was a successful trip

131
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:17,399
to the grocery store.

132
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,854
We gotta get home so we can make these.

133
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,406
Let's get the car loaded up, 'kay?

134
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,239
- 'Kay.

135
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,386
- [Missy] We're home, Finn!

136
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,303
Where are you? Hi, Bud!

137
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,547
Aww.
- [Bryan] Did you miss us?

138
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:32,880
- [Missy] You guys are
so cute! We missed you.

139
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,200
Hi, bud.

140
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,310
- [Bryan] Hey, did you
find some cool stuff

141
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,143
for Valentine's Day?

142
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:36,976
- Did you take a good nap?

143
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:37,809
- [Ollie] Yes.
- [Bryan] Yes!

144
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:38,817
- You took a good nap?

145
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:39,650
- Yeah.

146
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,510
(kisses)

147
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,030
- Oh, wow. It is freezing out here!

148
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,064
Not freezing, but it is very cold.

149
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,675
Check out our pool, it's
actually all heated right now,

150
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:51,627
so you can see the steam coming out of it.

151
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,060
It looks so cool.

152
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,700
So tonight we're gonna be
doing some Valentine's Day

153
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,194
cookies with the boys,
but before we eat cookies

154
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:01,210
we should probably have dinner.

155
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,621
So I'm gonna be grilling
in my grill tonight,

156
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:05,732
which I definitely have to clean.

157
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:07,951
I've got some steaks that I seasoned up,

158
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:11,333
and then I also have a yellow
pepper and orange pepper

159
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,090
that I tossed in olive
oil and salt and pepper.

160
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,760
And I'm just gonna throw
those right on the grill too,

161
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,090
and see how it all turns out.

162
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,330
And then I think Missy's gonna be making

163
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,320
some sweet potato fries.

164
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,280
Sounds so yummy.

165
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,380
I don't know if you can
see on the camera...

166
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,428
A little bit, there's
definitely some steamage

167
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,900
coming from the pool.

168
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,660
Click the thumbs up if you guys wanna see

169
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,118
some pool videos on our channel soon.

170
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:36,200
I think that's gonna have to happen.

171
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,726
(slow beat music)

172
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,450
- We should eat with the hearts ears on.

173
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,533
- [Bryan] We should?

174
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,420
I think that's a good idea,
what do you think, Finn?

175
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,253
- Yeah.

176
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:03,265
- You guys, it's dinnertime,
and we are donning our hearts.

177
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:04,140
(Missy chuckles)

178
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,406
Because we're all so in love
with each other, aren't we?

179
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,354
- [Ollie] Yeah.

180
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:08,660
- Yeah, we are all eating dinner,

181
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,140
and I think we need to cheers, right?

182
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,973
- [Ollie] Yeah.

183
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:12,006
- We always gotta cheers.

184
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:15,346
- [Missy] Ready? To Valentine, or to love.

185
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:19,302
- [Bryan] To love and family.

186
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:21,270
(exhales)

187
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,559
- Momma.
- [Missy] Huh?

188
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,410
- I love you 'cause I love you.

189
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,222
- [Missy] Aw, I love you.

190
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:27,676
(Bryan chuckles)

191
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:28,840
- [Bryan] Our boys.

192
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:32,267
(upbeat music)

193
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,074
All right, what is it time for, boys?

194
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:40,907
- Cookie dough!

195
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:44,288
- [Missy] Woo!
- [Bryan] Making cookie dough!

196
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:47,770
We are making some
Valentine's Day cookies.

197
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,810
- [Missy] Are you gonna help me?

198
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,626
Good job.
- [Bryan] Nice!

199
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,457
As you can see in our kitchen,

200
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,240
we are very, very good chefs,

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,140
we make everything from scratch.

202
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,880
We don't use any pre-made mixes.

203
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,980
- [Ollie] Wait, I want to feel it.

204
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,863
- [Bryan] What's it feel like?

205
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:03,839
- It feels like cotton candy.

206
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,686
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

207
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:06,936
- [Bryan] All right,
Ollie, put in the flour.

208
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:09,005
Nice.

209
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:10,494
- 'Kay, now we need to
mix this up really good.

210
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:11,718
Finn, you wanna try?
- [Ollie] What's this?

211
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,810
- [Bryan] Here, Finn, you
mix it up with the whisk,

212
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,941
and Ollie will do the egg, okay?

213
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:15,774
- [Ollie] Hey, there's a little bit more.

214
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:17,500
- [Bryan] There's a little
bit more in there? (laughs)

215
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,560
- [Missy] Mix it really good.

216
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,393
- It's very specific.

217
00:07:20,393 --> 00:07:24,090
Wants to make sure he
completely gets it clean.

218
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,390
- 'Kay, Ollie do you wanna
mix it a little, too?

219
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,713
- [Finn] Mmm, good job!

220
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:35,421
- [Bryan] (laughs) Now we're
dropping in some melted butter.

221
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,797
- Can you put that in?

222
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:38,945
- [Bryan] There we go.

223
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:41,250
- [Missy] Harder. Good job.

224
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,230
- [Bryan] There you go.
- [Missy] Now take your

225
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,145
other hand, and then we're
just gonna pull it apart.

226
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:44,978
(Ollie cries out)

227
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:46,219
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

228
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,828
That's a good job.

229
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:50,284
- [Bryan] Baking can be
a little messy sometimes.

230
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:51,570
That's okay, though.

231
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,826
Good job, mix it up, Finn!

232
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,430
- What is this?

233
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,987
- [Bryan] These are the
heart cookie cutters,

234
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:57,853
'cause we're gonna cut
these into little hearts.

235
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,175
- Wait, I wanna see.

236
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:00,985
- [Bryan] See, they're hearts.

237
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,630
- Oh.
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

238
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,910
- Sugar or flour?

239
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,010
- [Missy] This is flour,
and we're gonna put it

240
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,547
all over the table, ready?

241
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:16,456
- No!

242
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:20,920
- (laughs) I won't get you, buddy.

243
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:22,619
Move your foot, move your foot.

244
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:23,880
- [Bryan] Finn.

245
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,070
- [Missy] No foot, okay that's--

246
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,783
- [Bryan] Yeah, Finn uses all
limbs when making cookies.

247
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:30,209
- [Missy] So then we take our hand,

248
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,955
and just kind of spread it around.

249
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:34,793
- This is their favorite part.

250
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,289
Kids love making messes.

251
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,369
What's on your hand? (laughs)

252
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,270
- Ready?

253
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,500
- [Bryan] There you go.
- [Missy] Good job.

254
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:51,610
- [Bryan] Oh! (laughs)

255
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,755
Boys, lookit, Momma's
hearts are shakin'. (laughs)

256
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:56,050
When she rolls the dough.

257
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,418
- [Ollie] You look cute, Momma.

258
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:58,528
- [Missy] (chuckles) Thanks.

259
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,815
- [Bryan] Finn, what is your car doin'?

260
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,673
(Finn vocalizes)

261
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:05,066
All right, boys, now we
gotta put our hearts,

262
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,298
and we gotta cut our cookies out, okay?

263
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,230
- Okay.

264
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,917
- So I'm gonna do this one, and Ollie,

265
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,394
I want you to do this one, and
Finn you do this one, okay?

266
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:18,634
So find anywhere on here that
you think it should go, okay?

267
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:20,561
- [Missy] That looks
awesome, so push it down.

268
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,116
- [Bryan] Good job, push
it all the way down.

269
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:23,124
There it goes.

270
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:25,480
- [Ollie] This is gonna be so good, guys.

271
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,437
- [Missy] Good job, Finn!

272
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:27,706
- [Bryan] All right, push
that one down, Ollie.

273
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:29,121
Good job.
- [Missy] Good job.

274
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:31,288
- [Bryan] One right there.

275
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,447
The next step requires
a mother's gentle touch.

276
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:40,284
(Missy laughs)

277
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:43,454
Basically, getting the
cookies out of the dough

278
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:44,790
without destroying them.

279
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,482
- Yeah, we don't have
to put it in the fridge,

280
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:51,133
so it's very (chuckles) gooey.

281
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,716
(upbeat music)

282
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,447
- [Bryan] All right, the
boys are in their pajamas,

283
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:15,257
and it's now time to decorate the cookies.

284
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:18,643
And Missy went a little
crazy and bought everything.

285
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:19,618
(laughs)

286
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,573
We have everything to decorate
Valentine's Day cookies, huh?

287
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:23,406
- Yeah!

288
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,980
- [Bryan] Ooh, so these are
cinnamon flavored hearts.

289
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,200
Show us what else we got, Ollie.

290
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,478
We've got more sprinkles. What else?

291
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:30,824
- White sprinkles.

292
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:31,657
- [Bryan] Cool.

293
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:32,996
- They look like snow.

294
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,247
- [Bryan] Pink.

295
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:36,530
Whoa, look over here, Ollie, we got candy.

296
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,380
We have Sweethearts and
Reese's, we've got some tips

297
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,130
for frostings, we also
have Skittles. (Finn yells)

298
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,780
What? (Finn yells)

299
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,872
Yeah.
- [Missy] Candy!

300
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:47,820
- [Finn] Yeah!

301
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,991
- [Bryan] Whoa, what's that, Ollie?

302
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:50,350
- Cake icing.

303
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,405
- [Bryan] Cool. Do you know how
you're gonna decorate yours?

304
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,150
- No.
- [Bryan] No?

305
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,577
Do you know how you're
gonna decorate yours?

306
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:56,620
- Yeah.

307
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,453
- [Bryan] You do?
- [Missy] (chuckles) Yeah.

308
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:58,286
- [Finn] Yeah.

309
00:10:58,286 --> 00:10:59,119
- Maybe we should have a competition

310
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,867
and we all should design
a Valentine's Day cookie,

311
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,750
and then you guys decide
which one is better.

312
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,355
'Kay, Ollie, they're gonna
decide the winner, sound good?

313
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:06,188
- [Ollie] Yeah.

314
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:07,021
- [Bryan] All right.

315
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,220
We've got cookies and we've got

316
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,040
two boys who want to decorate.

317
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,319
You guys look so cute in your little

318
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,943
Valentine's Day hats. (laughs)

319
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:18,850
All right, Finn's gonna put
his icing, he's chose red.

320
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,440
And there he's off, ladies
and gentlemen! (laughs)

321
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,700
Kind of being a helicopter
parent, it's okay,

322
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,600
he's doing great, he's doing great.

323
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,433
- [Missy] Good job.

324
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,680
- [Bryan] Is that so cool, Finn?

325
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,513
- [Ollie] Okay, now it's my turn.

326
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:30,346
- [Missy] Do you want more?

327
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:32,554
- [Ollie] That looks like buttercup.

328
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:34,848
- [Missy] All right, go ahead and use it.

329
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,284
Do you want me to spread it around?

330
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:37,400
- [Finn] Yeah.
- [Missy] Okay.

331
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,324
- [Bryan] All right, Ollie's
off, too, he chose red.

332
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,460
(chuckles)

333
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,625
I think I'm actually going to
make a rainbow heart cookie

334
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:49,050
with some Skittles and the white icing.

335
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,864
Whoa, good job, I think
that's enough, Finn!

336
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,640
You got some cinnamon hearts on there?

337
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,473
- Yeah.

338
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:58,380
- [Bryan] Well, good job, Finn,

339
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,686
going for the Sweethearts now?

340
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,760
- Yeah.

341
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,712
- [Bryan] Go for it, Finn! Woo!

342
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:06,283
Um, that's a lot of
sprinkles, Ollie. (laughs)

343
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:08,287
That's so pretty, though!

344
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,650
That's awesome, dude.

345
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:14,394
(relaxed pop music)

346
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:32,988
- Whoa!

347
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,536
- [Bryan] That's enough, that's enough.

348
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:44,580
- [Finn] Thank you.

349
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,770
- [Bryan] You're welcome,
here, put some of those on.

350
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,937
- [Finn] 'Kay.

351
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,350
- [Bryan] Dang, babe.

352
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,334
Leave some Valentine's creativity
for the rest of us, okay?

353
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:03,167
(Missy laughs)

354
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,330
Finn's basically got it down, he's like,

355
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,456
"Oh, I totally get it, you just do icing

356
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:08,198
"and sprinkles, that's so easy."

357
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:12,020
We just decorated a ton of
cookies, check these all out.

358
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,681
I think these look so good.

359
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:16,445
All of us have chosen the
favorites that we've done tonight,

360
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:17,840
and we're gonna show them to you now,

361
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,049
so get ready to leave a comment down below

362
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,750
which one is your favorite.

363
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,070
Who is the winner, basically.

364
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,570
Is it me, Missy, Ollie, or Finn?

365
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,660
I'm gonna show you the cookies right now.

366
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,040
Taste The Rainbow, by Bryan.

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,673
This sprinkle-covered one is mine.

368
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:33,750
Ooh, and look at this one of Missy's,

369
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,103
it's so fluffy.

370
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,425
- It's called All You Need Is Love.

371
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:38,700
- [Bryan] All You Need
Is Love is this one.

372
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,360
Look at the sprinkles
in there, I like that.

373
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,532
Ollie, is this one yours?

374
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:42,365
- [Ollie] Yeah.

375
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,840
- [Bryan] And which one
is it, what is it called?

376
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,485
- I call it The Fire One.

377
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:47,120
- [Bryan] The Fire One.

378
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,190
This one is Finn's!

379
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,536
It's got a collection of
Sweethearts, sprinkles, icing,

380
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:54,960
Skittles, kind of the
whole shebang right there.

381
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,151
So there you go, you guys have to choose.

382
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:59,734
Which one? Let us know
down below in the comments

383
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,161
which one is your favorite.

384
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:04,713
Hey Finn, you got a cookie
under all these Skittles?

385
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,739
(laughs)

386
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,250
You got a cookie hiding
in all those Skittles,

387
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,310
did you know that?

388
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,143
- Yeah.

389
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:11,976
- [Bryan] (laughs) You wanna try it?

390
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,000
- [Finn] Yeah.

391
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,120
- [Bryan] Take a bite, ahmm.

392
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,953
How is it?

393
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:16,914
(Finn vocalizes)

394
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:18,971
Yeah, they're not too good once you get

395
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:22,250
all the stuff on them. (laughs)

396
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,280
(relaxed pop music)

397
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:38,302
- All right, this one's
called Heart Of Gold.

398
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:40,703
- [Bryan] Ooh, went a little crazy

399
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,332
on that gold glitter, didn't we?

400
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,749
(both laugh)

401
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,875
How's that cookie, bro?

402
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,566
- Here, I like to eat it!

403
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,536
- Well I think that's
all for today's video.

404
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:53,450
We made enough mess for the day.

405
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,780
By the way, babe, these
sugar cookies are amazing.

406
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,230
- [Missy] Yay, it's so easy.

407
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,040
- She makes the best sugar
cookies from scratch,

408
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,210
you guys, honestly.

409
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,390
She slaves forever.

410
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,405
It took her years to come up
with the recipe, right, Finn?

411
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:04,520
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,665
- I had a grandma, a great great grandma,

413
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:09,803
and her name was Bettay Crooka.

414
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:12,695
- (laughs) Only the
millennials watching this

415
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:14,570
know what just happened.

416
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,950
But anyway, I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video.

417
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,783
If you did, be sure to give it

418
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,112
a thumb's up, thumb's up, boys!

419
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:19,945
- [Missy] Thumb's up!

420
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:21,028
- Thumb's up!

421
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,640
Thanks for watching, we'll see you manana.

422
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,820
Who wants to do the bye boop?

423
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,653
- Me!

424
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:26,486
- [Bryan] All right.

425
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:28,403
- [Finn and Ollie] Bye!

426
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:31,578
- [Ollie] Boop.

427
00:15:32,936 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
