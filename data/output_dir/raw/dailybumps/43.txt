- [Bryan] So, Ollie and
Finn did you guys miss us?

181
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,020
- Yeah.

182
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,646
- [Bryan] Yeah, but you we're actually.

183
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,353
(laughing)

184
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:01,303
- Well you need a head.

185
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:02,800
- He is so into that.

186
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,040
The boys were not actually home alone.

187
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,220
I thought that I should probably clarify.

188
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,140
Mimi and Papa watched them all week.

189
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,600
And did you guys have
fun with Mimi and Papa?

190
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,177
- We went to Aunties house
and go to Disneyland.

191
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,250
- That's right.

192
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,360
Ollie went to Auntie's house
and went to Disneyland.

193
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
If you wanna see her vlog
from that, I'll have it linked

194
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,380
in the icard above, but
that was super cute.

195
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,569
What else did you do Ollie?

196
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:25,821
(laughing)

197
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:28,870
- [Bryan] Oh it's lookin' so silly.

198
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,870
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

199
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,976
- [Bryan] Whoa, that looks
like a good lookin t-rex, huh?

200
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,207
- Yeah.

201
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:34,930
- [Bryan] What else did
you do with Papa, Ollie?

202
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,550
- Um, I just went to
the movie Paddington 2.

203
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,460
- [Bryan] You saw the new Paddington?

204
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,930
- And then we saw Aquaman.

205
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,870
- [Bryan] Yeah, Papa took
him to go see Paddington 2,

206
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,300
which he loved and also took
him to see Justice League?

207
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,711
Who approved that? (giggle)

208
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,620
He didn't watch the whole
thing, but he did like Aquaman.

209
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,907
Oh a seashell, nice.

210
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:59,490
(upbeat music)

211
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,610
Alright, Ollie what
kinda dinosaur is that?

212
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,443
Do you know?

213
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:11,790
- Stegosaurus.
- Yeah.

214
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,920
- [Bryan] I think that's
pretty close, huh?

215
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,960
- I want it.

216
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,970
- [Bryan] What Finn?

217
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,832
- A monster.
- It's a monster?

218
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:20,023
- Yeah.

219
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,510
- (laugh) A gummy fell outta his mouth.

220
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,673
Look (laugh) he's like
yeah don't worry, I'll take

221
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:25,931
care of that.

222
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:26,764
(giggle)

223
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:30,410
So, yes, we just got back
from out Hawaii trip.

224
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,576
We were actually, we were over
here on the Hawaiian islands.

225
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:35,240
The boys were over here.

226
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,420
- They boys did amazing the entire trip.

227
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,193
They were so well behaves
and they had a blast with

228
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,866
Mimi and Papa and Missy and I had one of

229
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:44,910
the best trips ever.

230
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,080
I think it was officially
the best trip ever.

231
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,410
I brought a Go Pro and I
never once picked it up.

232
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,820
I had plans maybe I'd film
some things and we just never

233
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,100
got to it and we just
didn't really want to.

234
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,210
We wanted that time to be
the time that we had together

235
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,400
and alone, not on camera, but
we did Instagram story a lot.

236
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,870
So, if you guys followed us
on Instagram you saw all the

237
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,703
fun that we had.

238
00:08:03,703 --> 00:08:04,600
It was a blast

239
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,210
and very much needed.

240
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,800
But now I feel so much more
refreshed and ready to go.

241
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,850
Ready to tackle some really
big projects we have coming up.

242
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,815
First thing on the to-do
is changing our calendar.

243
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:19,310
(laugh) Look at all of us
eating breakfast in bed.

244
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,240
I love this picture.

245
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,210
It is no longer January folks.

246
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,820
So, if you've got a Daily
Bumps calender at home, be sure

247
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,866
you flip it to February, ya'll.

248
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:30,830
By the way, I have a couple
of these in stock still in

249
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,460
the store and we just put up
Valentine's day merch as well.

250
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,890
And we have Valentine's cards
and like a sticker sheet.

251
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,750
It's super cool.

252
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,340
If you guys wanted to get
that before Valentine's Day

253
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,490
make sure you order by February 8th.

254
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,260
The link for the store will
be in the description so you

255
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,092
can check it out,

256
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:45,260
but yeah, I thought that was so cool.

257
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,090
It is now February and I love
these pictures of the boys

258
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,320
and all of us and Missy, she
looks so beautiful there.

259
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,420
So, let's hang this bad boy.

260
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,450
There.

261
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,558
There we go.

262
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:01,141
(smooth music)

263
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,900
- Alright boys as you know,
every time Mommy and Daddy leave

264
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,904
Papa takes HayHay and
puts him somewhere new.

265
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:22,750
So, one time he was above our bed.

266
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,070
- Yes, and then another
time he was up here in this

267
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,903
nook.

268
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,670
- Yeah, up there.
- For probably weeks.

269
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,370
- He was actually up
there for a long time.

270
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,410
You guys might have even
seen him in the vlog.

271
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,255
- So, boys where's the chicken?

272
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:34,538
- Right there.
- What?

273
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:35,371
- [Missy] What?

274
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:36,843
- [Bryan] There's no chicken up there.

275
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:37,676
- Look!

276
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:38,509
- [Missy] Where would it even?

277
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:40,760
- Oh my god.
- (yell) What in the world?

278
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,010
(laughing)

279
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,400
- How'd he get up there?

280
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,471
How did that happen, Ollie?

281
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,551
- [Missy] How?

282
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:49,850
- Papa just put him up there.

283
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,790
- Papa?

284
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,440
- [Missy] How does Papa do that?

285
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,290
- C'mon, look it, it's zip-tied.

286
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,655
- [Missy] (laugh) Yeah.

287
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:56,655
- [Bryan] He zip-tied it.

288
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:57,488
- I mean that was a lot of work.

289
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,110
He had to have got a ladder.

290
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,600
- Yeah.
- Zip-ties.

291
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,088
- Did he just hold you up there to do it?

292
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,203
- No.

293
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,402
- There, can you reach him?

294
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,628
(Missy giggle)
- No.

295
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:06,629
- [Missy] Get 'em.

296
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:08,290
(Ollie babbling)

297
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,871
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

298
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:10,850
Way too far up there, huh?

299
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,460
- Yeah, HayHay's gonna be up
there until we leave again.

300
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,584
- Yeah.

301
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:16,867
- [Missy] (laughing) Well that's fun, huh?

302
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:17,780
- Me.

303
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,131
- [Missy] You wanna try and get 'em?

304
00:10:19,131 --> 00:10:20,131
- Yeah.

305
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:22,837
- [Missy] (groan) Can you get 'em?

306
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,358
- Alright Finn, reach up.

307
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,691
Reach up, reach.

308
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:27,994
- [Missy] Get 'em.

309
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,174
- Right there.
- I will do that.

310
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:30,850
- [Missy] You already tried.

311
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,310
- Look how attached he is to his monkey.

312
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,749
- [Missy] I know, I just.

313
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:34,786
- Do you love your monkey?

314
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:35,784
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

315
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:36,789
- Do you wanna give him a name?

316
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:37,622
- Yeah.
- What d'ya wanna name him?

317
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:39,301
- Wait, name him Cutie.

318
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:40,134
(Missy laugh)

319
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:41,772
- Wanna name him Cutie?
- Yeah.

320
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:42,781
(Missy giggle)

321
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:43,614
- Cutie the monkey.

322
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:45,960
- (giggle) We just read the
book that goes along with it.

323
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,050
It's so cute.

324
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,600
They literally talk about
how he's best friends.

325
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
- [Bryan] But, that's not
all who's excited to see us.

326
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,433
Puppies!

327
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:57,225
- Hi Karma, hi baby.

328
00:10:58,444 --> 00:10:59,277
Oh my.

329
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:00,440
- [Bryan] Hi Luna.

330
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,800
- Did you guys take good
care of Karma and Luna?

331
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,967
- [Ollie] Yeah.

332
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:04,800
- [Bryan] They are so excited.

333
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,868
Hi Luna, Hi Karma.

334
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:09,025
(laugh)

335
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:12,822
Nothin' like a good ol'
homecomin' from your puppies, huh?

336
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:13,822
(laugh)

337
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:16,330
- Aw, stinky breath, stinky dog breath.

338
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,768
- [Bryan] Hi Luna, aw
look at her she's like

339
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:20,343
- [Missy] Did you miss us?

340
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:21,714
- Soakin' it in (laugh).

341
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,570
(dog panting)

342
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,020
Hi Luna.

343
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,350
Hi Karma boy.

344
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,858
Did you do okay without us?

345
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:27,870
(laugh)

346
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,100
- So I actually did come
home to a little bit of a

347
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,950
problem.

348
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,650
One of our chickens which you
guys probably know if you've

349
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,483
been following us.

350
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:39,760
But, Pam the mom that hatched
like six chickens this

351
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,920
summer has been beat up
really badly by the rooster

352
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,800
Ursula, one of the chicks
turned into a rooster

353
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,790
and it beat up his mom.

354
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,780
So, we're really bummed.

355
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,710
So, Ollie what are we doin'?

356
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,830
- We are gonna clean the chickens.

357
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,530
- Yep, so we're gonna clean her all up.

358
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,140
We've got peroxide, some
cotton balls, we've got some

359
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,980
warm water and the boys are
all gonna help me, okay?

360
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,813
- Okay.
- Okay.

361
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,020
- Let's go get her all clean.

362
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,510
So there's Pam and I don't
know if you can tell but her

363
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,480
head has some pretty big owies on it.

364
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,210
I think she's okay, but we
definitely don't want any

365
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,440
infections setting in so we're
gonna get it all cleaned up.

366
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm just so bummed she is
just like such a sweet chicken

367
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,410
and for this to happen to her,
it's just like the saddest

368
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,243
thing.

369
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:21,076
I think she'll be okay.

370
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:24,550
I think with just like a little
bit of attention and just

371
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,827
you know, she's in a separate
area right now that's clean.

372
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:29,770
She's got her own food an
water away from the rooster.

373
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,720
He's not picking on any
of the others so I dunno

374
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
if he just doesn't like
Pam for some reason.

375
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,720
If we can just get it all
cleaned up and it looking

376
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,890
better before we.

377
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,320
I'll probably end up having
to actually get rid of

378
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,153
the rooster.

379
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:42,610
So, they probably won't see
each other again until she's

380
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,239
all better and then he'll
be gone by then, so.

381
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,669
(sigh) My poor Pam.

382
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,540
She's such a sweetheart.

383
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,650
You guys wanna give her
some love and comfort?

384
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,630
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

385
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,914
- 'Kay come give her a,
tell her it's gonna be okay.

386
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:57,610
- It's gonna be okay Pre-
- Pam. (giggle)

387
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,690
- This.
- Okay so first we're gonna

388
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,040
need some cotton balls and
then can you dip it into

389
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,670
the water for me so we
can get it all clean?

390
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,720
And get it all wet.

391
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,909
Good job.

392
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:09,659
(soothing music)

393
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:16,270
(Finn cough)

394
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,961
- Go ahead and spray this
cotton ball with that yeah.

395
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,711
(soothing music)

396
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:29,310
- It's uh, xray a little bit.

397
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,290
- You wanna xray it?

398
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,359
- Yeah.

399
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,380
- 'Kay
- Looks good.

400
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,950
- 'Kay, let's go and put her back away.

401
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,469
- It's gonna be okay, breath.

402
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,095
- [Missy] He's not hung up.

403
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:41,337
- I mean ham.

404
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:42,170
- [Missy] (laughing) Pam.

405
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,150
Alright boys, how d'ya think she's doin'?

406
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,842
You think she's gonna
make a full recovery?

407
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:46,675
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

408
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:47,690
- Yeah?

409
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,950
I think she's lookin' okay.

410
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,490
It definitely needed a
lot of cleanin' up which

411
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,440
we did.

412
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,990
We got it all cleaned
up with like some water,

413
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,010
some peroxide.

414
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,970
I left some peroxide on that.

415
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,260
I'm gonna put a little bit of
some other stuff that I used

416
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,278
on the horse that my
trainer had told me about.

417
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:05,530
Sounds like it'd be really
good for something like this.

418
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,150
Like a wound like that.

419
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,280
I'll prolly run up to the barn
either tonight or tomorrow

420
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,450
morning to up that on it.

421
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,366
And they already did get
it cleaned up a bit and put

422
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:13,726
some stuff on it too.

423
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:16,090
So, I just kinda wanted to
get it a little bit more on

424
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,870
there, and I'm gonna try
something else in the morning.

425
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,910
Hopefully, she can be
healed up pretty soon.

426
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,679
(soothing music) (kisses)

427
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,329
(kisses) (kids laughing)

428
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:31,111
(kisses) (kids laughing)

429
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:35,377
(kisses) (kids laughing)

430
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,684
- [Bryan] Tickle, tickle tickle

431
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:39,517
(laughing)

432
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:40,990
(laughing)

433
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,316
- Alright boys are all ready for bed.

434
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,149
What does that mean?

435
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,256
- No.
- It means go to bed.

436
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,450
- It means go to bed, like right now.

437
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,940
- [Bryan] Finn, show 'em
how it lights up, buddy.

438
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,900
- How does it light up?

439
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,210
Hit harder.

440
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,630
Oo, that's so neat, huh?

441
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,200
- [Ollie] Mine's green, guys.

442
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,680
- [Missy] Oh yep and

443
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,527
How neato.

444
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,371
- Mine is green and Finn's is orange.

445
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,383
- [Missy] Yep.

446
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:06,609
- Give this video a big
thumbs up if you join it.

447
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,216

448
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:10,216
