00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:35,666
- Good morning on three.

19
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,220
(Bryan laughs)

20
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,170
- [Bryan] Let's try that again.

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,370
- [Family] Good morning.

22
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,522
- Hey guys,

23
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,800
the boys needed a little bit of a do over

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,590
with that good morning, didn't we?

25
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,423
- Yeah.

26
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:50,256
(ding)

27
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:51,460
- Hey, look what they're wearing today.

28
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,773
What are you guys wearing?

29
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:56,420
- I'm wearing the tribe
shirt that says Daily Bump.

30
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,985
- [Bryan] Daily Bump, that's us, huh?

31
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:58,818
- Yeah.

32
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:00,310
- [Bryan] And Finn, who's on your shirt?

33
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,490
- That's me and Finn.

34
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,730
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

35
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,103
Look at that you guy's
in dinosaur costumes.

36
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:06,936
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,371
- The boys were so excited to wear

38
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,190
themselves one their shirts today.

39
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,396
We have a really fun day coming up.

40
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:13,520
Lot of big things
happening inside the house

41
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,920
and Missy actually just
got back her DNA results,

42
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,530
and I think she wants to share
them with you with her mom

43
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,620
because it was pretty interesting.

44
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,980
But yes, welcome to today's blog.

45
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,284
Let's have some fun.

46
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,380
Today is kind of a bittersweet day,

47
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,870
because it is the day we finally

48
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,528
take down all of our
Christmas decorations.

49
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:30,610
(family exclaims)

50
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,070
We have enjoyed our house
being so Christmasy,

51
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,969
haven't we?

52
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:34,802
- Yeah.

53
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:35,828
- [Missy] Are you gonna be sad it gone?

54
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:38,900
- [Bryan] Now we gotta take
down all our Christmas stuff

55
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,180
including this monster of a tree. (laughs)

56
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,610
- You just have to wait
like 11 more months

57
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,443
and we can put it up again.

58
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:44,551
- [Bryan] 11 more months till Christmas.

59
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:45,474
- Yay.

60
00:01:45,474 --> 00:01:46,307
(laughter)

61
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,334
- Yay.

62
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,917
(bright music)

63
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,490
- Alright, there is so much happening

64
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,594
at our house today, you guys.

65
00:02:03,594 --> 00:02:05,810
So much going on today

66
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,200
and we're so excited to show you later.

67
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,247
And we're excited to see ourselves.

68
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:09,460
- It's gonna be cool.

69
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,870
- Totally, but we are
taking a little break

70
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,970
in the middle of the day

71
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,950
and we are taking the
kids to go see a show.

72
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,311
We're gonna go see Annie.

73
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,180
- Yeah.

74
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,793
- Yeah, so we have a couple
of friends in the show.

75
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:21,145
Maddie is in the show,

76
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:22,732
Maddie's dog is in the show,

77
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:24,777
it's gonna be a cool time.

78
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,730
- Yeah.

79
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,940
And it's like a play.

80
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,290
So I'm really excited.

81
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,750
I think it's just like at a high school,

82
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,610
kind of like a chill one,

83
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,480
but I think it's gonna be fun.

84
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,572
I always loved Annie.

85
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:33,405
- I think it has a pool.

86
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:34,238
- [Bryan] You think what?

87
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,656
- I think it has a pool, actually.

88
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,489
- [Bryan] Oh, really?

89
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,580
- Yeah.

90
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,750
- It doesn't.

91
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,530
This one little lion has
passed out on the way there.

92
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,813
That's cute, huh?

93
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:45,284
- Yeah.

94
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:47,867
(bright music)

95
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,636
- [Bryan] Ollie, who you waving to?

96
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:55,780
- Aunt J.

97
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,865
- [Bryan] Auntie, yeah, everyone's here.

98
00:02:57,865 --> 00:02:59,260
- [Missy] Hey.

99
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,950
- [Bryan] June's getting
some papa time. (laughs)

100
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,990
We are all sitting and we're
so excited to see Annie.

101
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,463
It's a hard knock life. (laughs)

102
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:10,910
- He's never even watched Annie.

103
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,743
- I know.

104
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:12,750
You're gonna love the music, dude.

105
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,597
You know there's singing
and music and stuff.

106
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:15,430
Isn't that cool?

107
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,314
- And you're gonna see Maddie.

108
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:17,838
- Yeah.

109
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:19,460
- [Bryan] Finn, are you finding all

110
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,982
your favorites in the cast?

111
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:21,815
- Yeah.

112
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:22,648
- Do you see Maddie?

113
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:23,836
There's Maddie.

114
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,865
- [Bryan] (laughs) He's so
cute looking at it like that.

115
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:28,782
(audience chatter)

116
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,387
- How are you enjoying Annie?

117
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:32,220
Is it fun?

118
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,053
- Good.

119
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:33,886
We're in intermission right now.

120
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:35,180
Bryan actually just took Finn home

121
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,924
because he was like I'm done. (laugh)

122
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,554
well, Finn was.

123
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:41,480
And so we do have a lot
going on at the house

124
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,223
and so we're doing a little intermission,

125
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,040
eating some candy.

126
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,660
I'm even eating some candy too.

127
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,190
We're gonna go back in and watch the rest.

128
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,160
It's actually really good.

129
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,798
I'm so surprised.

130
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,048
(applause)

131
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:56,928
(upbeat music)

132
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,918
(cheers and applause)

133
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,585
(cheers and applause)

134
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,779
We just got back from Annie,

135
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,339
which was really, really good.

136
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,130
I was actually really impressed,

137
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,780
but we have some big changes
that just happened in the house

138
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,621
and I'm so excited to show you guys.

139
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:29,540
- [Bryan] Should we show them?

140
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,045
It's right behind the camera.

141
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:32,815
- I'm looking at it right now.

142
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,815
- We got a new entertainment system.

143
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,180
Check this out, you guys.

144
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,473
You remember what was there before?

145
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:41,380
That little entertainment system.

146
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,104
This thing is massive.

147
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:44,564
- Yeah, the other one was super cool,

148
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:45,440
super cute,

149
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,030
but we needed something
a little bit bigger,

150
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,731
had more storage space and just--

151
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,045
- [Bryan] Look at this.

152
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:51,587
- [Missy] A little more built in.

153
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:52,420
- [Bryan] This is crazy.

154
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,660
And it's not done, that the thing too.

155
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,860
A lot happened today so all of this

156
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,890
is kinda built in to the walls now,

157
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,160
which is nice.

158
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,880
So it kinda just looks like
it belongs with the house

159
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,920
and then we have the nice
farm doors in the front.

160
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,691
- So it's the same color
now as our other cabinets.

161
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,040
It has the same molding
as our other cabinets.

162
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,610
Obviously a lot more storage.

163
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,790
Yeah, so we're pretty excited about it.

164
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,360
- It's so cool and this was

165
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,851
a really big decision for Missy and I.

166
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,289
Missy's really attached to the traditional

167
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:24,240
entertainment center stuff and I dig it.

168
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,300
- Really good at compromises.

169
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,493
- Yeah, it's like a
cool mix of both worlds.

170
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,240
And I got a new TV.

171
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,959
I got a new TV.

172
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,640
So we now have a 4K TV, finally.

173
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,830
- [Missy] Everyone's waiting for this,

174
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,210
'cause we can't watch it.

175
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,560
- This is the best part of
when you get new technology

176
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,915
is peeling the plastic off the surface.

177
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,460
- [Missy] Had to get a chair.

178
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,080
- Had to get a chair.

179
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,220
- [Missy] Here we go.

180
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,847
- So I could reach up here,

181
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,141
'cause it apparently wants
me to do it from here.

182
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,670
(boys shouting)

183
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,503
Ready?

184
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,664
- [Missy] Yep.

185
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:56,630
(peeling)

186
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,510
Look at that.

187
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,844
- Oh wow.

188
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:03,080
- [Missy] Wait, wait, I
get to do the other half.

189
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,913
Oh shoot, no.

190
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:06,840
I didn't want it to move.

191
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,400
- Voila.

192
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,196
- [Missy] Oh wow, look at that.

193
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,033
- This is a lot more plastic than

194
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,963
what they put on your cellphone.

195
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:19,340
- [Missy] Yeah, a little more satisfying.

196
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,270
- I am amazed, this is crazy.

197
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,550
We've never had a TV look this good.

198
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,444
We've always bought the
cheapest TVs we could find

199
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:28,290
and now I'm like I want something cool.

200
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,873
So we can watch some good movies,

201
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,221
it's mostly Youtube actually.

202
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,054
- [Missy] I love it.

203
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:32,890
So we gotta put all the decor in here,

204
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,790
kinda fill it up.

205
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,691
We do have a lot more that's
gonna be happening with this.

206
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,524
- Yeah, we have something
else that's happening,

207
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:37,690
we're gonna keep it a secret though.

208
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,523
Stay tuned.

209
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,540
- [Missy] Stay tuned to see what

210
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,220
changes with the entertainment center.

211
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,940
But yeah, we had a really fun day.

212
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,660
My parents actually were like
we're craving chicken gnocchi.

213
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,420
So they went down to get
us some Olive Garden,

214
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,620
so we can all eat some yummy food tonight.

215
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,710
- [Bryan] Dude, what do you think

216
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,790
of our new TV and entertainment system?

217
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,940
- [Ollie] Good.

218
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,049
- [Bryan] Is it pretty cool?

219
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:56,882
- [Ollie] Yeah.

220
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:57,715
- [Bryan] You wanna watch lots

221
00:06:57,715 --> 00:07:00,982
of cool movies on here and
have family movie nights?

222
00:07:00,982 --> 00:07:01,932
- Yeah.

223
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:02,765
- [Bryan] Yeah.

224
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:05,348
(Finn giggles)

225
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,943
- Oh no.

226
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,460
Finn, you have to put it up

227
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,437
your nose if you want him to stop.

228
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:16,020
(Finn giggles)

229
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:21,072
- Ow.

230
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:22,540
I think you won.

231
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,820
- [Grandma] He found another way.

232
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,410
- [Missy] Auntie just put it up her nose.

233
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,420
- Hey, i just put it up
my nose and he was done.

234
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,822
(laughter)

235
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:31,572
(Ollie giggling)

236
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,638
- [Grandpa] Now what are you gonna do?

237
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,471
What are you gonna do?

238
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:43,485
- [Auntie] Ollie, you
gotta put it up your nose.

239
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:44,818
- Grab it, put it in your nose.

240
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:46,030
Put it in your nose.

241
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,645
Put it in your nose.

242
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:49,419
- [Grandpa] Here it comes.

243
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:50,629
- [Missy] Put it in your nose.

244
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:51,846
- Put it in your nose.

245
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,346
(family sighs and laughs)

246
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,430
- Kids are finally in bed,

247
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,570
they had such a fun day and
were out like that. (snaps)

248
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,480
But before today's blog
ends I wanted to share

249
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,790
with you guys a really cool clip

250
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,512
that I filmed for 23andMe with my mom.

251
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:12,310
I'm pretty excited about
some news that I found out

252
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,850
and so I'm gonna go ahead
and roll that clip now.

253
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,472
Did you know human DNA is organized

254
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:20,500
into 23 pairs of chromosomes?

255
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,030
Which is how 23andMe
came up with their name.

256
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,320
Your DNA is who you are and 23andMe's

257
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,130
personal genetic service was created

258
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,429
to help people understand it better.

259
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,649
You'll be able to see where
your ancestors come from

260
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,076
and learn how your DNA influences

261
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:40,030
your facial features, your hair,

262
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,929
your taste, your sleep and so much more.

263
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,000
It also connects you with your family,

264
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,210
you can learn more about
the genetic connections

265
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,130
that you share and see
what makes you, you.

266
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,460
Our 23andMe results are finally in.

267
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,990
And so me and my mom are gonna share them

268
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,020
with you guys right now.

269
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,410
We have not seen them yet.

270
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,243
I am so excited.

271
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:59,772
(bright music)

272
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,736
Alright, I'm sitting here with my mom.

273
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:04,820
- Hey.

274
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,940
- (squeals) And we're so excited.

275
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,773
- Yeah, for sure.

276
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:07,730
- I was always told that I had

277
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,480
a lot of Native American in me.

278
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,158
- Yeah, Grandpa's mom was Cherokee,

279
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:12,558
that's what we heard,

280
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:14,670
but we also know that there's

281
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,177
an adoption in there somewhere.

282
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:17,220
I dunno.

283
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,150
- Should be interesting.

284
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,186
And what are you expecting to see?

285
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:21,372
- A lot of English, like British,

286
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:25,581
because my grandfather
emigrated over from England.

287
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:26,581
- Wow, okay.

288
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,391
Mine says 100% European.

289
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:34,070
- Oh, I am also 100% European.

290
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,540
- So I'm mostly British and Irish.

291
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,190
- 52% of that is British and Irish.

292
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,467
- That's almost exactly mine.

293
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,760
- But I thought that
you had a lot of German?

294
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,590
Hollister is a German
name and so I thought

295
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,190
that there might be some German in--

296
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,739
- But that might be
the adoptive people so.

297
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:53,930
That might be an adoptive
last name, so crazy.

298
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,620
That is so much fun.

299
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,398
I feel like we're gonna
have such a fun time

300
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,510
comparing our DNA together.

301
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,350
- Yeah, going through all
the little bits and pieces.

302
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,790
- There's so much that
you can learn and see,

303
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,620
which I think is gonna be really cool.

304
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,173
- [Bryan] Be sure to head
on over to 23andme.com

305
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:11,444
or check the link down
below in the description box

306
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,270
to check out their latest promotion.

307
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,680
- We're gonna get back
to comparing our DNA.

308
00:10:21,110 --> 00:00:00,000
(bright music)
