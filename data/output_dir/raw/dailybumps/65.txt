1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:02,618
- Hey, Finn, can you give Dada a hug?

2
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:05,528
Give me a hug, big hug,
big hugs, big hugs.

3
00:00:05,528 --> 00:00:07,186
Oh, I got another big hug.

4
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:08,353
Big hug, ohhh!

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,605
I love you guys. (laughing)

6
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:13,073
(child laughing)

7
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:14,372
- [Missy] I think this
is what Ollie thinks

8
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:15,752
of all this Christmas shopping.

9
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:16,973
Are you exhausted?

10
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:17,846
But he's pretty worn out.

11
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:20,056
He's like, "Mom, tell
me when you're done."

12
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:23,322
Come on, we gotta go get Andy somethin'.

- [All] Morning!

25
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,361
- Hey boys, how's it goin'?

26
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,194
- Good.

27
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:50,027
- Good?

28
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:51,489
It wouldn't be a Saturday
morning at our house

29
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:55,117
without watching funny pet
videos on YouTube, right?

30
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:55,950
- Um-hum.

31
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,346
- These kids love watching anything

32
00:00:57,346 --> 00:00:58,894
that has to do with cats or dogs.

33
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:00,637
And, I actually have a lot
of cute horse ones, too.

34
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:02,045
Oh, look at the kitty.

35
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:02,878
- [Finn] Oh.

36
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:04,894
- He's trying to get
the french fry. (laughs)

37
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:06,862
This is like the new
Saturday morning cartoons.

38
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,534
It's Saturday morning cat videos.

39
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:09,418
- Look, a birdie!

40
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:11,800
- Oh, it is a birdie!

41
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,886
It is a beautiful Saturday mornin'.

42
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:16,877
Missy is frying up some eggs for us.

43
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,302
These are our eggs, right?

44
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:19,135
- [Missy] Yep.

45
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:20,137
- [Bryan] Are we getting enough eggs?

46
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:21,355
How's our egg production?

47
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:23,060
- It's going okay.

48
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,525
- [Bryan] We have like, four, three?

49
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:25,821
- I feel, I wish it was a little better.

50
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:26,654
- [Bryan] Yeah.

51
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:27,991
- We're getting like two or three a day.

52
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:30,940
- Well, also, we just hatched,
like, a ton of chickens

53
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,438
and we only ended up
with one layer, right?

54
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:34,882
- Two.
- Two, okay.

55
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:36,341
So, we need...

56
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,009
It's probably time for more babies soon.

57
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:38,842
- Yeah.

58
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:40,335
- We'll probably have to do
that again in the Spring.

59
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:41,168
- In the Spring--

60
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,263
- Yeah, that'll be cute.

61
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:43,596
Then we can have lots more eggs.

62
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:44,429
- [Missy] Yeah.

63
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:45,910
- Mmm, but I am so hungry.

64
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,859
Hey, kiddo.

65
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,274
Hey, Finn, can you give Dada a hug?

66
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:52,243
Give me a hug, big hug,
big hugs, big hugs.

67
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:53,813
Oh, I got another big hug.

68
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,701
Big hugs, ohh!

69
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:56,534
(child laughing)

70
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,981
I love you guys. (laughing)

71
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:01,806
We woke up this morning and Fred

72
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:04,842
was perched right on our closet door.

73
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:06,778
Check him out looking at everyone.

74
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:07,947
(Finn babbling)

75
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:10,006
(laughing) Are you saying hi to Fred?

76
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,006
(pleasurable music)

77
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,878
Our fish are doing so good, you guys.

78
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,339
They're like all friends and
they're all so friendly now.

79
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,056
They get a little spooked
when you get close,

80
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,041
but like, even Tina's coming out.

81
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,170
You see the fishies?

82
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,006
- Yeah.

83
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:28,228
- They're doing good, huh?

84
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:31,597
What's not doing good are starfish.

85
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:34,756
We have gone through
three different starfish

86
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:38,711
and they never last, and
I'm not quite sure why.

87
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:40,301
But all the other fish that we've added,

88
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:43,303
all the coral that we've added
has been doing really good.

89
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:46,288
So, we're feeding them worms
and shrimp, which is this.

90
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:48,667
And we also feed them seaweed.

91
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:49,500
- Yeah.

92
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,955
- [Bryan] And then also pellets, right?

93
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:52,212
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

94
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:53,794
Alright, Ollie, are you
gonna help me feed the fish?

95
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:54,627
- Yeah.

96
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:56,418
- [Bryan] Alright, climb up on the chair.

97
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:58,709
There we go, put the chair
right next to the tank.

98
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,964
I got all the food that you need

99
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:01,083
to drop in there right there.

100
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,109
Sort of sprinkle it on top

101
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,875
and those fishies can start eatin'.

102
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,541
There we go.

103
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,026
Good job.

104
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:11,424
I don't think they got the
memo, though. (laughing)

105
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,924
Oh, there they go.

106
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:15,245
There they go.

107
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:20,085
- Ooh, one just go on trip!

108
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:21,948
- Yeah! (laughing)

109
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:24,137
Check out this new bubble coral
we have in here, you guys.

110
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,484
It's so cool looking.

111
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:29,256
So we gave them pellets and
now I'm going to squeeze in

112
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:31,006
the worms and shrimp,

113
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,577
just a couple of times in
the tank, just like so.

114
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:36,998
- Wait, do we have shrimp?

115
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:39,684
- [Bryan] Yeah, there's little
pieces of shrimp in there.

116
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:41,802
See, OJ's going for it.

117
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,879
There's Tina. (laughing)

118
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,796
Oh, there's Ty and Lloyd and Pearl.

119
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,918
- Hi!
- Yeah.

120
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:52,085
He really likes the worms.

121
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,766
- [Ollie] Yeah.

122
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,284
- I love seeing him scramble up

123
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:56,280
on the sand like that.

124
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,041
It's so cute. (laughing)

125
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,087
And Pearl is getting really big, too.

126
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:04,087
(pleasurable music)

127
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,643
So, yeah, that's a little
update on our fish.

128
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,337
They're doing really well,
and it's been really fun

129
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:18,553
to have fish that have, like,
a little more personality

130
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,183
and that the kids enjoy and they

131
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:21,927
can be involved in a little bit more too.

132
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,467
Oh, I just saw him jump to,
like, the top of the water.

133
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,114
That was crazy.

134
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,648
- Mmm, yummy.

135
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:31,399
- Yeah, peanut butter
jelly time. (laughing)

136
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,113
Ollie said, "It's lunch time for the fish,

137
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:35,291
"so it's also lunch time for me."

138
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,947
So I said, "Sure," and I
said, "What do you want?"

139
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:38,932
He wanted me to make him a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

140
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:40,297
Doesn't that look delicious?

141
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:41,131
- Yeah!

142
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,384
- [Bryan] Yeah, look
at that yummy sandwich.

143
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:46,620
(upbeat music)

144
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,866
- Alright, where are we going today,

145
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,956
or where are we going right now, Ollie?

146
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,551
- Christmas shopping!

147
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:55,152
- Yeah, and where are we headed first?

148
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:55,985
- Toys"R"Us!

149
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,397
- [Missy] Toys"R"Us!

150
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,230
Can you see it?

151
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,063
- Yeah!

152
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:00,305
- Whoo!
- Look!

153
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:01,864
- Ollie's so excited 'cause me and him

154
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:03,560
are going Christmas
shopping, and he says he's

155
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,203
never been Christmas shopping before.

156
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:07,912
Sure, we've taken him a few
times, but we have a plan today.

157
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:10,106
We're going to Toys"R"Us,
we're going to get a bunch

158
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:12,954
of our family kid presents done,

159
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:14,610
and so he's excited to pick them all out.

160
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,456
Who are you buying presents for today?

161
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:19,793
- CJ and Billy and Peng-yu.

162
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,758
- [Missy] Okay, and Liv,
yeah, and Olivia and Emma.

163
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:23,904
It's gonna be a fun day, huh?

164
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:27,357
Hey, Ollie, it says, "Nice
kids enter here," alright?

165
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:29,075
So, you have to be nice to go through.

166
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:32,275
Alright, we are almost done
with all our Christmas shopping,

167
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,215
but we've definitely had
a harder time figuring out

168
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,272
what we should get for Peyton, huh?

169
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:37,105
- Yeah.

170
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:40,427
- And, it's hard because
she's at that age where, like,

171
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:43,037
anything is cool, but I'm
like, should I get her

172
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,509
something girlie, should
I get her something like,

173
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,600
just fun, or like a game.

174
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,102
So, what do you think she should get?

175
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:51,935
- A mini like, a doll.

176
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,916
- A doll?

177
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,396
A doll is always a good option.

178
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:58,609
So, we're just trying to figure out just

179
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,099
the last few things to get,
but we're having a blast.

180
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,145
And he's having a great time just looking

181
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:06,171
at all the toys that he wants, huh?

182
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,004
- Yeah.

183
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:08,179
- [Missy] Did you figure out
what you want to get for Finn?

184
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:09,031
- This.

185
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:09,938
- You want to get him that.

186
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:12,083
He's like, "This looks
like a great thing."

187
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,638
Honestly, shopping for kids
is like the easiest thing,

188
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:16,636
especially at a store like this.

189
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:18,608
Toys"R"Us is pretty fun, huh?

190
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:19,858
I think this is what Ollie thinks

191
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,343
of all this Christmas shopping.

192
00:06:21,343 --> 00:06:24,421
Are you exhausted? (laughs)

193
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,197
We're now in the mall at Macy's

194
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:27,313
and we've been getting a ton done.

195
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:28,146
I'm actually feeling pretty good.

196
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:32,439
I think we'll be done Christmas
shopping by today, I hope.

197
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,866
But he's pretty worn out.

198
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:35,241
He's like, "Mom, tell
me when you're done."

199
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:39,482
Come on, we gotta go get
Andy somethin'! (laughing)

200
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,987
You've been a really good
shopping partner, 'kay.

201
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,539
Ahh, did you guys miss each other?

202
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,473
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

203
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,748
Oh, you gotta tell him that

204
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,849
we bought all kinds of fun gifts!

205
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:50,682
What?

206
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:52,908
(Finn babbling)

207
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:53,741
Oh, yeah?

208
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:55,399
- Wait--
- He's so cute.

209
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,713
Alright, go play, boys!

210
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:59,339
- So, I wanted to show you
guys something real quick,

211
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:02,836
that might be giving you a
little bit of a sneak peak

212
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:06,666
of how we're designing Ollie
and Finn's new shared room.

213
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,643
This is one of the pieces
that has come in the mail,

214
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:12,153
and I did something really
special with it, so, it's a,

215
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:14,196
it's basically like a
big, hanging lantern.

216
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:16,259
It plugs in and it has a switch,

217
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,134
and it's like really cool and it's metal,

218
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,817
and it's nice.

219
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:22,488
But what I did was I put a certain type

220
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:25,655
of bulb in it so it looks like a fire.

221
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,206
Look at that, it's so cool.

222
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:33,013
It's like an LED fire bulb,
makes it looks like there's like

223
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:35,699
actually fire in this lantern.

224
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,997
And I'm so excited with how
it looks and it turns out.

225
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:40,369
And I had to, like, get a
couple different sizes because

226
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,181
it like didn't fit in there at first.

227
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:43,063
But now it does, but yeah.

228
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,408
Check out this lantern.

229
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:46,694
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

230
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:49,165
And yes, it kind of does
give a little bit away

231
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:51,167
about how we're designing
the room, but I think

232
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,460
you guys are still gonna
be really surprised.

233
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,951
I love technology.

234
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,897
This is so cool.

235
00:07:56,897 --> 00:08:00,223
- [Missy] Boys, why is
your bedroom such a mess?

236
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,231
- 'Cause.

237
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,767
- [Missy] Did you guys
have fun in your room?

238
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:03,974
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

239
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:06,750
They have been playing
so much that now the room

240
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,900
that I just had perfectly cleaned,

241
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,667
because I just cleaned out
tons of stuff the other day

242
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:12,707
is now a mess.

243
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:15,017
Huh? (laughing)

244
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:16,260
We are getting ready for bedtime.

245
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,431
They're in their Christmas jammies.

246
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,908
(Finn babbling)

247
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,271
Yep. (laughing)

248
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:23,461
We're reading our stories.

249
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,468
We've been reading
Captain Underpants again.

250
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:28,200
We started reading that a few months ago,

251
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,088
and we finished like three books.

252
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,176
- Look, you guys!

253
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,176
This is my favorite one!

254
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,595
- That is a really good one.

255
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:38,735
It's about aliens and
it's pretty exciting, huh?

256
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,083
And they actually sometimes
just fall asleep during it,

257
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,508
which I think is super cute.

258
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:43,863
Yep, that's an alien.

259
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:45,576
But, yeah, we're just
having a really fun time.

260
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:49,026
We were supposed to roll
peanut butter balls today

261
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,089
and make cookies,

262
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:53,320
but Mama just got so busy
with all her shoppin'.

263
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,569
I got tons done, though.

264
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:58,809
I'm, I'd say like 95% done,
so that's really nice.

265
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,451
Although Christmas is a week away,

266
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,459
so it's not like I'm
that prepared. (laughing)

267
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,194
I still have stuff to do.

268
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:06,749
Alright, are you guys--

269
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:07,659
- Yes.

270
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,673
- Ready for bed?

271
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,948
- Yeah.

272
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:12,068
- We just opened our Advent calendars

273
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,013
and we had a lot of fun.

274
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,475
There's nine days 'til Christmas.

275
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:18,558
Tomorrow's eight days 'til Christmas.

276
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:22,158
Anyways, I think we're gonna
go ahead and end the video,

277
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:24,573
so make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up.

278
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:26,757
Thumbs up Ollie, thumbs up Finn.

279
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:28,130
No, don't leave Finley.

280
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,183
Oh my goodness.

281
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:30,274
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

282
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:31,107
Do you want to do the bye-boop

283
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:32,797
since your brother's being naughty?

284
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:33,917
You're gonna miss out on bye-boop!

285
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:34,750
(Finn exclaiming)

286
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,583
Ready?

287
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,646
One, two, three!

288
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:37,646
- Bye, boop!

289
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,227
- [Missy] Finley?

290
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:42,328
What do you want?

291
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:43,930
(Finn babbling)

292
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,482
You want to do the boop?

293
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:47,548
You've gotta come back here and sit down.

294
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:48,381
- No.

295
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,213
- [Missy] Okay then, no bye-boop.

296
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:51,046
(laughs)

297
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:51,879
Bye boop.

298
00:09:51,879 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
