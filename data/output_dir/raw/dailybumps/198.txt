1
00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:01,950
- [Missy] Look at these cute boys

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,809
holding their tight hands.

3
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:06,331
You're bringing your teddy
bear home, huh Ollie?

4
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,331
Yeah (laughs), they're so cute.

5
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:17,768
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,112
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset

7
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:26,858
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

8
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:29,860
♫ This is home

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,882
♫ Just running around
you never looked so cute

10
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:37,384
♫ Hugging you tight
cuddling all I could singing

11
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:40,522
♫ I am home

12
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:44,355
♫ Home forever you're with me

13
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:49,225
- And good morning, guys.

14
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:50,574
We are headed out of the house.

15
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:52,824
I'm taking Ollie to school,

16
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,919
I packed his lunch for him

17
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:58,323
and I am actually headed to the gym

18
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,636
and I am excited, I have
my personal trainer today

19
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:01,875
and you know what, as you guys know

20
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:05,187
I ran three miles yesterday
and I'm actually like,

21
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:07,860
not that sore, like, not like last week

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,995
I thought I was gonna die.

23
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,675
This week I just ran
three miles and I'm like,

24
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:12,728
I feel pretty good.

25
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:14,431
So I'm really proud of myself.

26
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,281
Let's do it, okay?
- Yes.

27
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:18,074
- [Missy] Are you gonna have
a fun day at school today?

28
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:20,657
- Yeah, there's my shadow right there.

29
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:22,330
- [Missy] Oh, that is your shadow, huh?

30
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,163
- [Ollie] Yeah.

31
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:25,112
- [Missy] Hey Ollie, today
you're gonna go to school

32
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:28,636
and Peyton's not gonna be there, okay?

33
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:31,481
Yeah, today Peyton is just getting home,

34
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:33,343
I think they might be traveling home today

35
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,760
from Playlist so.

36
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,777
He'll be okay though, huh?

37
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:41,247
- [Bryan] Morning, how's it going Batman?

38
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:45,315
You're reading The Big Fun
Preschool Activity Book.

39
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:46,943
That's so cool.

40
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:47,776
Good morning guys.

41
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,740
Yes, while Ollie is away
at actual preschool,

42
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,655
Finn is aspiring to join himself.

43
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,488
I think he may be headed
to school next year, huh?

44
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:00,069
He wants to go to school early.

45
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,978
No, I don't think we're gonna
be giving him up next year.

46
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:04,938
What?
(garbled baby talk)

47
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,793
Oh really, okay, let's keep looking.

48
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,518
So this is art class,
oh, look at this, flowers

49
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:11,351
and kites.

50
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:16,628
He's genuinely so
interested, it's so funny.

51
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,191
Also, he slept in his Batman pajamas.

52
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:20,253
Tried to change him this morning

53
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:24,798
and he was adamant that he
wanted to stay Batman, right?

54
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:25,824
- No.

55
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:27,866
- [Bryan] You are Batman, huh?

56
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:30,070
(laughs) You hear that little no he does?

57
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,070
It's so forceful too, he's like, no.

58
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:37,014
Look who's Batman, yes, you're Batman,

59
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:39,191
I'm not gonna take it off (laughs).

60
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:42,609
- Alright, I am home and I
had a pretty busy morning.

61
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:45,400
I ended up going to the
gym which was really good,

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,288
my workout was like, whew, tough.

63
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:51,185
I ran a little less,
I ran almost two miles

64
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:54,352
but I ended up having to
cut it short for a reason

65
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:58,349
so anyways, I'm now home and
getting things cleaned up.

66
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,542
I just put Finn down for a nap

67
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,542
because he was ready.

68
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,198
But he was so cute because
he hadn't see me all morning,

69
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:05,124
he was like, Momma, hi, hi,

70
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:07,558
he's like giving me kisses
and hugs, it was so cute.

71
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:09,567
Now I'm actually pretty hungry

72
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,383
so I need to eat some lunch probably.

73
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:13,787
I hate lunch, I literally hate lunch,

74
00:03:13,787 --> 00:03:15,488
I hate trying to find food,

75
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:18,266
I hate trying to like, figure
out what I want for lunch.

76
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,789
Like lunches are just like the worst.

77
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:22,006
Like, I don't like sandwiches, like,

78
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:23,822
what do you eat for lunch,
let me know in the comments,

79
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:24,812
what do you eat for lunch

80
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:26,864
because I'm not a big sandwich person

81
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:30,212
and so, like, lunch is
supposed to be like small

82
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,255
and I'm like, I don't know what to eat,

83
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,532
I can never figure out what to eat so,

84
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:34,647
let me know what you guys eat

85
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,190
and maybe I'll get some good ideas.

86
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,440
Look who's up from his nap.

87
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:41,302
Did you sleep so good?

88
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:42,589
We are right now rushing out of the house

89
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,955
because it is time to pick up Ollie.

90
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:47,455
Oh you see Papa, look at that.

91
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:50,173
I didn't know he was here.

92
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:52,514
Alright we made it, we
gotta go get your brother,

93
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:54,201
are you excited?

94
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,746
He's like so excited to see Ollie.

95
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:57,653
(garbled baby noises)

96
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,443
Yeah, let's go get him, okay?

97
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:00,639
- Okay.

98
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,389
(soothing music)

99
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,718
- [Missy] Are you up?

100
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:14,577
Good morning.
- Good morning.

101
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:17,678
- [Missy] Did you have fun at school?

102
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:19,533
Is that your monkey?

103
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:20,367
Say hi.

104
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,951
Were you doing puzzles over here?

105
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:25,797
- Yeah.

106
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:27,478
- [Missy] How fun.

107
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:28,387
Yeah.

108
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:30,387
Go down the slide, Finn.

109
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:32,829
Come on.

110
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,087
Ready

111
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:35,920
go.

112
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,529
Ah, good job.

113
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:43,679
Finn is going to be so
happy when he's in school.

114
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:47,414
Look at these cute boys
holding their tight hands.

115
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:50,211
You're bringing your teddy
bear home, huh Ollie?

116
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:52,837
Yeah, (laughs) they're so cute.

117
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:55,851
I think that when it's time
for Finn to go to school

118
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:57,751
he's going to be very excited.

119
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,858
Every time we go there
he just gets so excited,

120
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,200
he wants to play with all the toys

121
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,206
he wants to run around with all the kids

122
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:07,214
and he doesn't realize that
he's just a little baby still.

123
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:08,832
But it's actually, it does get me excited

124
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:10,062
for when the time comes

125
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,449
because I think that he's gonna be excited

126
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,646
to do the same thing
that his brother's doing,

127
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,190
but Ollie, how did school go?

128
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,918
- Good.
- Good, were you good?

129
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,924
Did you get in any trouble?

130
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:25,316
Good, you just eating like,
leftovers of your lunch?

131
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:29,915
Yep, now how did you do
with Peyton not being there?

132
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:32,874
- It was good.
- It was okay?

133
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,854
Okay, did you mind it or
would you rather her there?

134
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:40,252
- Just wanted her.
- Oh, you did want her?

135
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,475
- Yeah (mumbles).

136
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,581
- [Missy] Oh yeah, alright,

137
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:46,146
well she'll be back next time, okay?

138
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,350
- What about (mumbles) Bailey?

139
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,321
- [Missy] Yeah, we'll (mumbles)
Bailey soon too, okay?

140
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:55,488
- I have fun at school and
now it's time for Target.

141
00:05:57,394 --> 00:06:00,660
- [Missy] Woohoo, what are
we gonna get at Target?

142
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,160
- Um, some snacks.

143
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:05,222
Maybe some toys too.

144
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:07,095
- [Missy] Um, I don't
think we're gonna get toys

145
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:10,063
because you're still saving up, huh?

146
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,547
Alright, we made it to Target
and the boys are snacking.

147
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:14,550
What do you got, Ollie?

148
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,383
- A cherry, um.
- Icee?

149
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,621
- Icee.
- Yeah.

150
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:22,599
We're basically just kind of
doing some random shopping.

151
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,177
I needed some clothes for the boys,

152
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,252
they were kind of getting low

153
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,035
because they grow out of them so quickly

154
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:29,454
and then I gotta grab a few things maybe

155
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:33,261
apple juice and a couple
things for Ollie's lunches.

156
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,514
Huh?

157
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,255
- (mumbles) for Halloween.

158
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:38,974
- Oh yeah, we totally need
decorations for Halloween.

159
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,169
I actually think we might
have plenty of decorations

160
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,646
up in the attic, we just
have to get them all down.

161
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:48,080
Are you all done with your popcorn?

162
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,189
They do however have some
really fun Halloween books

163
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:52,660
that we probably don't have.

164
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,160
That might be fun to get, huh?

165
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,165
Halloween ABC.

166
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:59,995
You're learning your ABC's, huh?

167
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:01,828
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

168
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:06,023
- [Missy] (laughs) Good job.

169
00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:07,031
Okay, we'll get that one.

170
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:07,890
So we're just about to leave

171
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,640
but I got Finn this
little Batman water bottle

172
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,273
because he's obsessed with Ollie's

173
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:13,678
and he doesn't have one.

174
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:16,655
So look at him, he's so excited.

175
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:20,822
Okay, I just cleaned it out
and put water in it for him.

176
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,632
How is it?

177
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,882
- Good.
- Good, you love it?

178
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,733
- Batman,
(hums Batman theme)

179
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,195
Batman.

180
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:33,028
- [Missy] Even when you go to school

181
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,517
you have matching shirts.

182
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,426
Ollie.
- What did you do today?

183
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:39,137
- [Missy] Tell us all about
your homework you did.

184
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:41,157
Show Daddy.
- Whoa.

185
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:43,336
- It was good.
- What is this?

186
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:45,542
- A.
(cheering)

187
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:46,797
- [Bryan] Apple starts with A?

188
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:48,241
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

189
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,881
- [Missy] And what does an A sound like?

190
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:50,964
- Moo.
- Nope.

191
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,640
(laughing)

192
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,648
- That's not correct.

193
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:55,481
- Ah.
- Ah.

194
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:59,131
- [Missy] Apple, and did you write those?

195
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:01,943
- Yeah.
- That's so good.

196
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:02,817
Did you really write those,

197
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,924
did your teacher help you?

198
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,399
It's very good, yep.

199
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,830
- Smell my feet.

200
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,928
- [Bryan] What do they smell like?

201
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:10,333
- I don't know.

202
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,347
- [Bryan] You want me to smell them?

203
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:13,949
You want me to smell yours too?

204
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,422
Alright, I got some smelling feet.

205
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:19,005
Eww!
(laughing)

206
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:24,138
(coughing)

207
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,109
Ew!

208
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,417
Ew!
(laughing)

209
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:37,777
Why do you buys have such stinky feet?

210
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,062
- Because.

211
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:40,610
Smell them Momma.

212
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,250
- [Bryan] Everyone has to smell the feet.

213
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,671
- Oh, I don't even have
to pretend those stink,

214
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:46,304
those really do stink.

215
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:47,312
- [Bryan] And Finn.

216
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:48,398
- Yours actually smell good.

217
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,648
(laughing)

218
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,534
- [Bryan] You know if you
make a funny face like that

219
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,264
it'll get stuck.

220
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:58,443
And then you'll look like that forever.

221
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,222
(scream)

222
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:01,436
(laughing)

223
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:04,103
(playful music)

224
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:14,504
- You guys I have a little
confession about the chickens.

225
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:16,869
I'm gonna go show you guys them right now,

226
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:19,093
I've been talking about a rooster here

227
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,118
and I'm pretty confident
that guy right there

228
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:23,719
who's running around is a rooster,

229
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:26,762
but either way we definitely
have at least one rooster

230
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:29,927
because I have a confession.

231
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:34,094
The other day we cracked open
an egg and it was fertile

232
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:38,423
and clearly left out a little too long.

233
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,058
We were all a little traumatized

234
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:41,651
to be quite honest.

235
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,775
There's definitely a rooster
fertilizing the eggs.

236
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:46,335
I didn't even think that
they were able to fertilize

237
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,676
at this young of an age.

238
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:50,161
I mean, he's still so like, little.

239
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,897
Yeah, one of my eggs were
fertile the other day.

240
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:55,094
Wasn't a baby, it was just 100% fertile

241
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,902
and it was really, really traumatizing.

242
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:58,979
So anyways, that's definitely a problem.

243
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:00,851
I don't know if I'm comfortable

244
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,054
with any roosters fertilizing
my eggs that I'm eating.

245
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:05,360
Especially if I'm gonna be able

246
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,655
to know that they're fertile,

247
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:07,751
like that's so nasty.

248
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:09,363
Chickens are doing good though.

249
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:12,432
They are on chicken scratch,
like chick starter food

250
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,826
so they're not really making me eggs so,

251
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:16,662
look at that, empty egg box.

252
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:17,653
Kind of a bummer.

253
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:20,385
I did have to go out and buy eggs today

254
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:24,654
which is ridiculous when
you have 11 chickens

255
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:27,190
but hopefully soon here
we can actually get them

256
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,907
back on regular food.

257
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:33,127
Alright guys, I'm gonna
fill up your food, okay?

258
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:35,126
Alright, the chickens
were definitely hungry.

259
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:37,465
Got their stuff filled up and yeah,

260
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:38,512
you can definitely laugh at me

261
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,238
because that definitely happened.

262
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:41,830
Like I said, it wasn't a baby

263
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,791
but if we had left it out
just a little bit longer

264
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,843
definitely could have been.

265
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,903
And I'm honestly pretty freaked out.

266
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:49,170
You guys'll have to let me know

267
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,665
if you guys are chicken experts,

268
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,881
how long can you eat fertile eggs?

269
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,742
I feel like I read up
on it, it said you can

270
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,756
but you have to get them like, right away

271
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,802
and obviously we didn't get it right away.

272
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,808
So let me know in your
guys' experience with this,

273
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:02,903
if you have any, leave that
in the comments down below.

274
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:04,306

304
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:15,589
F for Frankenstein,

305
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:19,108

306
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,338
H for haunted house,

307
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:25,644
we don't need to hit the book guys,

308
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,477
I for--

309
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,915
- [Bryan] They take this
reading thing very seriously.

310
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,858
- [Missy] Stop hitting it.

311
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:31,407
- [Bryan] Huh, Luna?

312
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:33,657
- [Missy] J for jump, jump.

313
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,848
- [Bryan] Is Luna sitting on you?

314
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:37,865
- [Oliver] Yeah.

315
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:40,365
- [Bryan] Luna, you crazy dog.

316
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:44,281
- [Missy] O for owl.

317
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:45,777
- [Bryan] Ollie, what
are you guys reading?

318
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:49,493
- Um, a Halloween book.
- That's so cool.

319
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,842
- ABC's.
- ABC's Halloween.

320
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,798
- P for pumpkin.
- Finn's like,

321
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,990
I am not gonna be a part of this.

322
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm gonna join my own book reading thing.

323
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,850
- [Missy] Here, should
we try this book now?

324
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,606
Okay, let's try this one.

325
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:02,920
- The other day it was so funny

326
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,070
because it was Labor Day and
we told Ollie in the morning

327
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,478
that it was a holiday
and that it was Labor Day

328
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:10,423
and he got so confused and a little scared

329
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,888
and he ran outside of the room

330
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:14,616
and he went into the dining room

331
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:16,437
and then came back to the bedroom

332
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:19,044
and said, yep, it's not Halloween,

333
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:21,004
the pumpkins are still there.

334
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:23,051
Because we had like, pumpkin decor set up.

335
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:26,035
He was so afraid that he
might have missed Halloween

336
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:28,294
but he didn't and he's very
excited about Halloween

337
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:30,390
so Missy got some
Halloween books from Target

338
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,679
and now they're reading them

339
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,199
and you are just, what are you doing?

340
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,176
What are you doing, you
just need attention?

341
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:38,300
Oh my gosh, look at that tongue.

342
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,481
Look at that.

343
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,577
That feels good, you know it feels good

344
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:42,744
when the tongue comes out.

345
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:47,667
How's her breath smell?

346
00:13:47,667 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
