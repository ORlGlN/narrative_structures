1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,649
- [Bryan] Now it's time to read this,

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:03,873
you wrote this a year ago.

3
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,296
- Ugh, I'm gonna get emotional,

4
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,946
I hate it. (laughs)

5
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:09,338
- Very few things that make Missy cry.

6
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,777
- (laughs) Apparently I make me cry.

7
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:14,944
(upbeat bouncy music)

8
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:20,398
- [Together] Good morning!

9
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:21,802
- We are up this morning,

10
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:23,503
and the kids have had a really fun night.

11
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:25,986
You were up at 5 a.m., mister.

12
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:27,146
With older kids in the house,

13
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:28,428
they basically woke up,

14
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,627
ran out into the living room,

15
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:30,949
and already found Fred.

16
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:31,814
Where was he?

17
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:34,241
So, they found him over here.

18
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:36,763
Hanging upside down with their ornaments--

19
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:37,961
- [Bailey] He, he wrote a note.

20
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:38,794
- [Missy] And he wrote a note.

21
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:39,627
And he says,

22
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:40,746
"Hi, CJ and Bailey."

23
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:41,723
Here, do you want to read it?

24
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:42,919
- Hi, CJ and Bailey.

25
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,734
It's so nice to meet you.

26
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:48,151
Zippy has told me so much about you guys.

27
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:53,285
He asked me to bring these back to you,

28
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:58,545
and that Santa says he hopes
you have a Merry Christmas.

29
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,894
- [Missy] He says, Zippy has
told me so much about you guys.

30
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:04,172
How funny.

31
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:05,078
- I hope that's good.

32
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:06,503
- [Missy] I know!

33
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:07,336
And then he says,

34
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:08,169
Ollie and Finn,

35
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,645
You have been such good boys,

36
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:12,497
I wanted to share some candy with you,

37
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:14,728
and your cousins.

38
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:15,561
Yum.

39
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:16,394
Fred.

40
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:17,227
- I didn't eat any of it.

41
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:19,310
- You didn't eat any?
- Bailey took it.

42
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,563
- [Missy] (gasps) So, you guys
already ate all of the candy?

43
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:22,396
- CJ let me have it.

44
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:24,859
- [Missy] Oh, so you guys
ate all the candy already?

45
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,692
- [CJ] Yeah.

46
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,313
- Even left some candy and little notes!

47
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:30,048
That's so cool.

48
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,703
The kids have been pretty
excited about the Holiday.

49
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,262
They've just been playing, having fun,

50
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,798
and now I think I'm gonna go ahead,

51
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:37,735
and make some pancakes,

52
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:39,387
'cause pancakes sound good.

53
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:41,947
Alright, we all got up
so early this morning,

54
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:43,229
and now we're off to church.

55
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,062
- Yay!

56
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,781
- [Missy] Everyone's
dressed and looking cute.

57
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,728
- This is what it would be
like if we had four kids.

58
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:50,032
- It's actually pretty
nice having CJ around,

59
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:51,321
'cause he's so much older.

60
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,764
So, I'm like, you know what,

61
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,825
if you know we end up
having three or four kids,

62
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,066
Ollie's gonna be at an age where,

63
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,506
he can just be extremely
helpful like CJ is.

64
00:01:58,506 --> 00:01:59,389
- Are we having four kids now?

65
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:01,846
- (laughs) We may just have four kids now.

66
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:03,263
- Finn is so out.

67
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:05,778
I don't even know if he can hear me.

68
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:06,738
- It's so windy.

69
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:07,943
Yeah, he's asleep.

70
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:08,841
- Like I said he was up at 5 a.m.,

71
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,111
so he was like, I think
I'm gonna sleep at church.

72
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:12,561
That might just happen.

73
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:14,701
- Alright, kiddos, how was church?

74
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,281
- Good!
- What did you do?

75
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:18,472
That is so cool.

76
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,434
- And we danced!
- You danced?

77
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,915
Look it, you made baby
Jesus in the manger.

78
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:24,523
Was it cool, CJ?

79
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:25,420
Did you like it?

80
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,099
Finn did so good, too.

81
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,148
- Wow, you gotta look right up there.

82
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,637
(laughing)

83
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:32,117
(Ollie mumbling)

84
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:34,605
- It's not a sword, Ollie, it's a cross.

85
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:36,873
- Yes it is, it's a sword.

86
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:39,124
- [Bryan] How do we
explain this one? (laughs)

87
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:41,105
To be honest, it does
kind of look like a sword.

88
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:42,708
Alright, guys, where are we gonna lunch?

89
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,834
- [Together] McDonald's!

90
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:45,782
- They're really excited about it.

91
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:47,139
- They are so confused,

92
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,964
but all the kids are so
excited to eat at McDonalds.

93
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,698
- We just, like, were looking for food,

94
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:52,554
and we like driving past--

95
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,215
- We kinda suckered ourselves into it.

96
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:56,443
We're gonna McDonald's.

97
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,296
But, honestly, this place has
like a pretty epic play place.

98
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:01,890
I wish we had play places
like this when I was a kid.

99
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,756
They'll have a blast.

100
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:05,510
Is our car a little small
for having four kids?

101
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,633
- We're gonna need a bigger car.

102
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:08,949
- [Bryan] Do you think
when we have a third baby,

103
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,125
we'll have to get a bigger car?

104
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,823
- I think so, 'cause like even
Ollie's kind of back there,

105
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:13,656
and that's hard, huh?

106
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:14,489
- [Bryan] Yeah.

107
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,284
McDonald's stepping
their game up you guys.

108
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:17,566
Look at this giant touch screen.

109
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:18,509
You want to order your food?

110
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:19,991
Babe, this is like in London, remember?

111
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,824
- Wow.

112
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:22,860
- [Bryan] You just order
it on the touch screen.

113
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,882
- [Missy] Do you want pickle?

114
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:28,085
- [Bryan] This is like a
McDonald's of the future.

115
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:29,685
You're literally like
selecting every single thing

116
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:30,650
they don't want on it.

117
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,752
- [Missy] Oh, yeah.

118
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:32,585
- [Bryan] Wow!

119
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:33,598
Look at this you guys,

120
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,436
you can even select which toy
you want for the kids meal.

121
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:39,080
We're gonna go with a holiday toy.

122
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,733
That's cool.

123
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:41,764
Alrighty, he's climbing up.

124
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,370
We're taking our shoes off.

125
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,397
You can keep your socks on.

126
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:47,370
Look at this playground, you guys.

127
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,773
This is crazy.

128
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:50,264
- I'm gonna go up there.

129
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,931
- Alright, have fun.

130
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:56,950
Bailey has actually made
it all the way to the top.

131
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,581
She's in the control pod. (laughs)

132
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:03,248
(playful music)

133
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,459
They have a giant touch-screen computer?

134
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,986
That is crazy.

135
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:19,247
The things they're putting
in McDonald's, guys.

136
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,933
Alright, so we are back
at CJ and Bailey's house.

137
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,255
What happened, Bailey?

138
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:25,088
- Our Elf is upstairs!

139
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:26,935
- [Bryan] What the...

140
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:28,418
Your Elf?
- Yes!

141
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,480
- I don't know if you guys
have met Zippy before,

142
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,706
but apparently he and
Fred are friends, right?

143
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,320
- Look!
- (gasps) Oh, there he is.

144
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,623
- [Bailey] That's why it took so long.

145
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,113
- [Bryan] Hi, Zippy!

146
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:41,363
- Zippy, did you tell the Elf about us?

147
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,644
- [Bryan] He must have, huh?

148
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:44,477
- Yeah!

149
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:45,759
- That's so cool, you guys,

150
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,658
Fred and Zippy are friends.

151
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:48,491
- Yeah!

152
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,324
- [Bryan] Awe.

153
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:51,707
I like your hat, Zippy.

154
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,459
- Alright, we are home and
I'm already in my pajamas.

155
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:57,272
Today has just been on of
those days where I was like,

156
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:58,926
get me home, so I can get into my pajamas.

157
00:04:58,926 --> 00:04:59,759
But, we're really excited,

158
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,024
because we are doing what
we do every single year,

159
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,594
which is go to my parent's,

160
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,628
and decorate the tree,

161
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:06,782
and it's a big tradition,
and one of my favorites.

162
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:08,514
I feel like I always say that
every time we do a tradition,

163
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:10,803
'cause I love all my Christmas traditions.

164
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:12,012
The kids are actually sleeping in the car,

165
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,626
while we change and
get our stuff together.

166
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:17,003
And I've got to come into my
very messy closet, right now,

167
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:19,446
and grab my Christmas letter.

168
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,014
If you guys don't know
about my Christmas letter,

169
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:22,624
I do it every year,

170
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,094
but I gotta find it.

171
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:25,927
Not there.

172
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,225
Look in here...

173
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,558
And there it is!

174
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:30,439
Ah ha!

175
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,215
Says Merry Christmas, 2017.

176
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,366
Do not open until Christmas 2017!

177
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,434
And then I guess I couldn't
find anything to wrap it in,

178
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:38,756
so I wrapped it in this necklace,

179
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,943
which means I was unable
to wear this necklace

180
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:43,283
for an entire year, basically.

181
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:44,442
Anyways, we got the letter,

182
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:45,515
I got my pajamas,

183
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:48,815
and I am ready to go celebrate
Christmas at my parent's,

184
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,049
decorate the tree,

185
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,150
do our little traditions.

186
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,816
It's gonna be an exciting night.

187
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:56,066
(mellow holiday music)

188
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:12,187
- We are over at Mimi and Papa's house,

189
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:15,883
and we are decorating the
family Christmas tree over here,

190
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:17,483
and it's always a fun time.

191
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:18,835
Are you guys agreeing on anything,

192
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:20,364
or is Missy just running the whole show?

193
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:23,171
- I am the older sister,
so I run everything!

194
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:25,206
- We're getting yelled at a lot.

195
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:27,143
- Missy has very strong feelings about,

196
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,783
where things go on a Christmas tree.

197
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:31,620
- (laughs) I just want
it to look good, okay?

198
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,370
It's gotta look good.

199
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,561
- Finn, you'll get in trouble.

200
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,078
- [Bryan] Hey Finn, look at these lights.

201
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:39,911
Whoa!

202
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,077
Aren't Christmas lights cool?

203
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:46,327
(mellow holiday music)

204
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:52,325
- [Missy] Ollie, are you putting
all the ornaments on now?

205
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:53,158
- Yeah!

206
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:54,936
- Yeah, you're so happy.

207
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:58,132
(laughs) He's so happy.

208
00:06:58,132 --> 00:06:58,965
Wow!

209
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,418
We're putting up all the ornaments now,

210
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,713
from, like, our childhood.

211
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:04,944
We're like going through them.

212
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:08,057
I feel like we're missing a ton, though.

213
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:11,418
Because even I know that
there's a few on here that we--

214
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:12,832
- I think we definitely
lost some important ones.

215
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,183
- Maybe some of them got lost in the move.

216
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:16,016
- [Sister] Yeah.

217
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,529
- We still got some fun ones on here, so.

218
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,109
We still have my mom's goose egg,

219
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:21,828
because when we lived in Idaho,

220
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,479
she actually had geese,

221
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,999
and yes that is illegal.

222
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,667
- I found abandoned eggs and hatched them,

223
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:29,858
and they imprinted me,

224
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:30,839
I can't help that.

225
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,132
- Yeah, she can help it when she says,

226
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:34,217
(imitating her mom) "Come here, babies!"

227
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:36,425
- Yeah, I would call them
and they would fly from,

228
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,230
I don't know where, and land at my feet.

229
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,063
- [Missy] Yeah.

230
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:40,118
- I think we have a video of that.

231
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,209
- No, she actually has video of it,

232
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:45,084
so I bought her a little
egg that had geese on it,

233
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,596
so that it would remind
her always of her geese,

234
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,488
when we lived in Idaho.

235
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:52,198
Anyway, I got this when I
was, like, a little kid.

236
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:53,741
I have all kinds of memories on this tree,

237
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,729
which always makes Christmas fun.

238
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,824
I hope that through the years
my kids start remembering,

239
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:01,306
"Oh, this one is from
when I was in school!"

240
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,139
- Me!

241
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,625
- [Missy] Oh look at that!

242
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,458
- That's me!

243
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,612
- [Missy] Oh that's yours?

244
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:06,971
Awe.

245
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:10,162
This one's Ollie's, and
you say this one's yours?

246
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:11,594
This one can be yours, for sure.

247
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:12,427
Oh, wait.

248
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:15,000
2015, yep that one's yours.

249
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,212
- Hey, Finn, you know who this is?

250
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:18,445
- Who's that?

251
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:20,145
- Me!
- (laughs) Me.

252
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:21,373
- That's you.
- Is that you?

253
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:22,706
Are you so cute?

254
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,001
He's like, I want it where I can see it.

255
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:28,349
Alright, the tree is all decorated.

256
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,930
You guys, I still remember
the day my dad got this.

257
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,930
It's so old.

258
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:34,753
That must have been on the tree

259
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:36,188
since you've been in the family, right?

260
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:37,074
- Yeah, yeah.

261
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,914
- [Missy] Since I was a little kid.

262
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:41,809
- I would like to point
out that there is nothing,

263
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,138
- [Missy] That's true.

264
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,619
- The decorations end
about the height of you.

265
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:49,010
- Yeah, we just couldn't reach.(laughs)

266
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,843
The tree looks so good but
we're missing the star.

267
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:53,116
Hey, boys.

268
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:53,949
- What?

269
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,428
- [Missy] Do you guys
want to put the star on?

270
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:56,261
- Yeah.

271
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:57,106
- [Missy] Yeah?

272
00:08:57,106 --> 00:09:00,356
- [Bryan] Alright, Finn, grab the star.

273
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:03,891
- [Missy] Put it on.

274
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:04,724
- Push.

275
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,403
(everyone cheers)

276
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,793
- [Bryan] Good job.

277
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,045
Ollie, do you want to
put the star on, too?

278
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,415
No?

279
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:18,618
- I guess it's Finn's year.

280
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:19,451
- [Bryan] I guess.

281
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:21,056
- Next year will be Ollie's.

282
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:24,802
(upbeat holiday music)

283
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:25,870
- Three!

284
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,101
- Two!

285
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,460
- One!

286
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,543
(cheers)

287
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,178
- How do the lights look?

288
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:36,141
Oh my gosh, it's lit, it's lit so good.

289
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,376
- [Bryan] It's lit, man!

290
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,571
It's Merry Litmas!

291
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:39,620
- [Missy] It's so lit.

292
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,032
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

293
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,699
(holiday music)

294
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:51,803
- [Bryan] Alright, Missy's,
grabbing the Christmas note,

295
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,335
The great Christmas note.

296
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:54,371
- I always get so nervous,

297
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:56,390
because I never remember what I wrote,

298
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,485
and, like, what if I was
feeling really emotional,

299
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,134
or if I was feeling like silly,

300
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,445
I made like a weird joke,

301
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:02,387
and no one gets it.

302
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:04,401
Like, I don't know what's in this letter.

303
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:08,549
- [Bryan] Alright, it's time
to read the Christmas letter.

304
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,439
Do you want to just explain
the Christmas letter?

305
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:11,272
- Okay.

306
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,558
So, every year, when Christmas is over,

307
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:15,893
I write a Christmas
letter for the next year.

308
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:17,247
We started it when I was a kid,

309
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:18,768
because it was always a fight of,

310
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,088
who gets to put the star on the tree,

311
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:21,366
and so I'd have to write:

312
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,560
Missy did it this year,

313
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,547
so that means it's Jimmy's turn,

314
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:24,414
Jimmy did it this year,

315
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:25,358
that mean's it's Cassie's turn.

316
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,998
So we would do it for that reason.

317
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:28,352
Then I started to write like,

318
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,515
oh, I wonder, like, what
the next year's gonna bring,

319
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:33,736
and I'm gonna be 10!

320
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:34,669
Or you know, so, whatever.

321
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,520
And we have just been reading
it for a long time, and...

322
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,990
- [Bryan] Now it's time to read this.

323
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,432
You wrote this a year ago.

324
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,400
- Yeah, now it's a huge responsibility,

325
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,389
'cause I've got like kids,

326
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:44,701
and it's just a thing now,

327
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,013
so, here we go.

328
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,207
- [Bryan] This is our tradition.

329
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,358
- Merry Christmas!

330
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,674
Another year over.

331
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:52,279
I'm not exactly sure how many
of these letters I've written,

332
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,344
but it's a lot.

333
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,888
Every year changes so much
and to think back to when

334
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,277
I first started writing these letters.

335
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:59,746
Wow, we were just talking
about that. (laughs)

336
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:02,661
It's crazy, we've grown
three new family members,

337
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,617
gone through more
animals than I can count,

338
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:09,450
and have moved more times
than I can remember,

339
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:13,806
but one thing that stays the same:

340
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,082
our love for each other.

341
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:19,421
In fact, our love has
grown just as we have.

342
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:21,757
I can't wait to see this
family grow even bigger

343
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:22,984
as the years go on.

344
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,449
We have been so insanely
blessed over the years,

345
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,331
in more ways than one,

346
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:31,169
and I hope we never take
any of it for granted.

347
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,290
Aw, I'm gonna be emotional.

348
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,383
I hate it. (laughs)

349
00:11:34,383 --> 00:11:35,992
- Very few things make Missy cry.

350
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:39,938
- (laughs) Apparently I make me cry.

351
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:42,316
To my boys, it is so crazy...

352
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:43,994
Hey, I'm writing to you, Ollie.

353
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,694
It is so crazy watching you
guys grow and change each year.

354
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:49,383
You both are still so little.

355
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:50,694
Finn, isn't even talking,

356
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:54,514
and Ollie is just successfully
going potty on the potty,

357
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,907
everyday.
- [Bryan] Whoo!

358
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:59,208
- I love watching you boys grow so big.

359
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,391
I can't wait to see your bond strengthen.

360
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:05,656
I hope you always know how
much Mommy and Daddy love you.

361
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:07,051
To Bryan, I love you so much,

362
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:08,597
and hope you always know how much

363
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,775
I appreciate what you have done for me,

364
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,790
our boys, and this family.

365
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,503
You are loved by every single one of us,

366
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,639
and we are so proud to call you ours,

367
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,732
just as I am proud to call you mine.

368
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,785
To my brother and sister.

369
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:24,232
This year Jimmy graduates from college,

370
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:25,707
and I'm insanely proud of you.

371
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:27,387
You have worked so hard for this,

372
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:29,877
and you deserve every
ounce of happiness in life.

373
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:33,144
I hope that you take every
opportunity that comes your way,

374
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:35,055
and don't let anything hold you back.

375
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:35,888
We love you so much,

376
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,472
and I am so proud to
call you my boy's uncle!

377
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:39,747
Cassie!

378
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:41,216
This was you're first year of college,

379
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:42,363
and you have moved out.

380
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:43,550
So much has changed for you,

381
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,903
just over the last six months,

382
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:47,901
I can't imagine what else
you are doing by next year.

383
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:48,887
We are so proud of you.

384
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:51,019
You have grown in so many ways.

385
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,841
You may be my younger sister

386
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:56,591
but you are wiser and stronger
than I ever was at your age.

387
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,311
You are the sweetest auntie to my boys

388
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,358
and hope you will always
have the same bond with them.

389
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:02,191
Whoo!

390
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:03,108
Here we go.

391
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,054
Mom and Dad.

392
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,723
You two are the most
amazing people in mine,

393
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:09,321
and all of our lives.

394
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,088
You have no idea how much we love you,

395
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:13,139
not just because of
everything you do for us,

396
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,808
but because of what you have taught us.

397
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,158
Your examples of love,

398
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:21,809
and positive attitudes have
made each of us who we are.

399
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:22,917
Thank you for falling in love,

400
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:25,231
and thank you for showing us real love.

401
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:26,826
You are literally the
greatest mom and papa,

402
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:28,304
and I'm so happy to know that you have

403
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:31,103
such a big part in raising our boys.

404
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:31,936
Merry Christmas!

405
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,969
Don't forget to love on each
other a little more every year,

406
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:37,522
and to never take for
granted our amazing family.

407
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:40,189
Love your, Mommy, Wife,
Sister, and Daughter.

408
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:43,335
P.S.
- (laughs) Oh, no.

409
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:47,085
- Never forget the true
meaning of Christmas.

410
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:52,056
It's a time to give back to
those who are less fortunate,

411
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:55,417
and those that do not have
as much love in their lives.

412
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,153
Let's show others that love exists,

413
00:13:57,153 --> 00:14:00,927
even if it's just with a smile,
or a dollar, or (mumbles).

414
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:01,990
Happy Birthday, Jesus.

415
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,433
(Bryan laughs)
He is the real reason

416
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:04,587
we have our family.

417
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:07,124
- [Bryan] Merry Christmas,
ladies and gentlemen.

418
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:07,957
- [Mom] Good job!

419
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:08,790
(cheers)

420
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,873
That was, that was a lot.

421
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:14,761
- [Bryan] Missy was a
little emotional last year.

422
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:18,650
Boys, do you want to do
your advent calenders?

423
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,435
- [Missy] They're so excited!

424
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:21,316
Get in there.

425
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:22,601
- [Bryan] What's in there?

426
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:23,868
- [Missy] Ooh!

427
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:26,337
- [Bryan] Ooh, presents!

428
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:28,980
- [Missy] What's in there?

429
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,840
- [Bryan] Yeah.

430
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,276
- I got an alien.

431
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:32,134
- [Missy] An alien!

432
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:33,242
- [Bryan] Oh cool!

433
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:34,431
From Toy Story!

434
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,193
The Star Wars one is so cool.

435
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:38,394
- Okay, let's see what we did.

436
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,477
- [Bryan] Oh!

437
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:40,953
- [Missy] What is it?

438
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:42,067
Just another weird spaceship.

439
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,629
(Bryan laughs)

440
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:44,462
- Thank you.

441
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:45,449
Open that one.

442
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:46,684
What's in there?

443
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:48,243
You gotta pull it this way, baby.

444
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:49,076
Oh!

445
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:50,613
- [Bryan] What d'you get?

446
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:51,446
Whoo!

447
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:54,024
- Another spaceship they can put together.

448
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:55,556
Yay!

449
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:58,272
We had such a fun day today.

450
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,105
Huh, boys?

451
00:14:59,105 --> 00:14:59,938
- Yeah!

452
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:00,771
- [Missy] Yeah?

453
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:02,577
Finn, did you put the star
on Mimi and Papa's tree?

454
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:03,410
- Yeah.

455
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,478
- [Missy] Yeah, was that cool?

456
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:05,311
- Yeah.

457
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:06,144
- [Missy] Yeah?

458
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:09,498
And next year you're gonna do it, right?

459
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:11,336
As a kid, we always took turns.

460
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:12,737
It was always just one of us,

461
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,173
but I was like, it's so hard,

462
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:16,362
I just want pictures of doing them both.

463
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:17,965
When Ollie was like, no I don't want to,

464
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:19,563
I was like alright, alright,

465
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:21,531
next year, Ollie will do it.

466
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:22,364
But, anyways,

467
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:25,264
I just love really fun
Christmas days with the family.

468
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:27,071
I just love my little family,

469
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,178
and my big family.

470
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,353
(laughs) You guys are so cute.

471
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:31,916
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this video.

472
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:32,749
We're gonna go ahead and end it,

473
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,459
but we'll see you guys tomorrow.

474
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:37,147
So make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up.

475
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:39,397
And what do you say, Ollie?

476
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,353
Ready, Ollie?

477
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,103
- Bye!

478
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,783
- Guess they both have to do it now.

479
00:15:48,783 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat bouncy music)
