- Ah ah, ah ah ah.

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:04,511
Ah ah ah.

4
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:08,458
- [Missy] So you're singing your ah.

- Good morning guys and
happy Saturday to all of you,

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,300
and it's Friday for us.

18
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,914
I wanted to let you guys know

19
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,650
that I was recently in a video

20
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,270
on Andrew Huang's channel,

21
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,230
I'll have his video linked in the iCard.

22
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,319
But it was really cool because

23
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,240
he tweeted that he need
people to like sing for him,

24
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,580
send him videos of singing so he could

25
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,120
use as vocal samples in
some music he was making.

26
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,170
And he made this beat out of this piano

27
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,250
that fell to the ground

28
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,450
and then used a bunch of vocal samples

29
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,460
and it was super cool and I'm in it

30
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,120
so go check it out, go show him some love.

31
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,298
That guy is super talented

32
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:01,831
and I've collabed with him before.

33
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:02,664
But I thought we'd let
you guys know about that.

34
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:04,550
Good morning, it is a beautiful Friday

35
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,530
here in sunny southern California,

36
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,710
but I'm a little bit sad.

37
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,097
This green light on my
internet router is a lie.

38
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:11,847
There is no internet.

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,870
And as you can imagine,

40
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,220
no internet in a house
where YouTubers live

41
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,310
is quite difficult.

42
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,700
After searching why we
were having such an issue,

43
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,710
I came out her to the outdoor router

44
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,020
and found it very chewed
up and all over the ground.

45
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,470
Because Luna apparently was feeling

46
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,695
very anti-internet today.

47
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:32,320
She basically ripped the
entire router out of the wall,

48
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,950
ripped all the cords out, chewed them up.

49
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,400
Look at this, yeah that's
not really gonna help us

50
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,220
get any internet. (laughing)

51
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,020
Luckily though Missy's brother Jimmy

52
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,626
is a genius when it
comes to stuff like this,

53
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,115
so I literally just sent him some pictures

54
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:46,090
and he's like I'll be
up probably the second

55
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,930
or third time I think
he's fixed this router.

56
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,100
And we honestly probably just need to find

57
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,966
a better spot for it so that she's not

58
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,100
chewing it up, thinking
more like inside the basket.

59
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,214
- [Missy] Good morning, boys.

60
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:57,280
- Good morning.

61
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,954
- [Missy] Good morning Luna.

62
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:00,882
She's always just hanging out,

63
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:01,880
laying around, huh guys?

64
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,040
The boys are so excited this morning.

65
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,900
We have just been hanging out,

66
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,860
I'm getting ready for
a pretty fun day today.

67
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,530
They have been begging to do this for days

68
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,330
and I've just been kind
of holding off on it

69
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,051
because it's kind of a project.

70
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,500
But it's this cool little game called,

71
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,325
I don't even know if it's a game,

72
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:16,030
but it's called Design & Drill.

73
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,670
And they're dying to play it.

74
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,550
And it actually comes in a package that we

75
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,220
get monthly now for Oliver.

76
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,140
It's all about just like educational toys

77
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,550
and stuff for Ollie.

78
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,780
So we get this box

79
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,556
that's all for STEM and
education for Oliver.

80
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,430
And of course Finn can play too.

81
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,923
And so this one is kind of a game,

82
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:35,060
it looks really fun.

83
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,820
It's all about creating pictures

84
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,530
and using a drill to make the same design.

85
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,747
So it's actually a really really

86
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:43,670
awesome educational game so I'm excited

87
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,690
to open it up and play with you guys.

88
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,786
Oh look, Carmen's like I wanna play too.

89
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:51,869
All right, we're getting
started with all of the,

90
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:54,310
of this game.

91
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,143
And so basically they have this drill,

92
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,760
and they've got all the screws in here,

93
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,850
and they've got patterns.

94
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,580
And so right now, what
flag is this, Ollie?

95
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,830
- Um, there's yellow, blue,

96
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,810
and red.

97
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,450
- [Missy] Good job.

98
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,776
And what is this picture of?

99
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:09,868
- Flag.

100
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:10,957
- [Missy] What kind of flag?

101
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,399
You said it earlier?

102
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,792
You said it was the ...

103
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,789
- American flag.

104
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:16,410
- Yeah, he said that all by himself too.

105
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,100
I'm so proud of him of
for even knowing that.

106
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,710
I know they do the Pledge of Allegiance

107
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,600
everyday at school, but I
just thought that was funny.

108
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,040
Then we're gonna do the American flag.

109
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,960
So they just put their first
yellow screw in, didn't you?

110
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
As you can tell they just have to like

111
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,260
kind of make that picture with the screws.

112
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,870
But at the same time, honestly right now,

113
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,250
they're just having fun
playing and putting screws

114
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,320
into the little board.

115
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,060
So that's fun too, huh?

116
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,920
That's not a screw bud.

117
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,290
Good job, all right which one's next.

118
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,360
Another yellow one?

119
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,410
That's awesome.

120
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:59,345
Look at that, he's doing
all the yellow right now.

121
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:03,035
(upbeat music)

122
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,579
all right, he's got all the yellow

123
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,646
and all the blue done,

124
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,248
and now he's just figuring out

125
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,370
where all the reds go, right?

126
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,490
And he actually, one goes there, yeah.

127
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,130
You gotta go one two three
over with red, right?

128
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,027
- And then one over
here and one over here.

129
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:16,860
- You're right.

130
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,160
Dude you're so smart, I'm so proud of you.

131
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,450
And what he's been doing is actually

132
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,390
just making the picture
before he screws them all in.

133
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,223
So you're kinda just gonna put them there

134
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,900
so you can see what it looks like

135
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,620
and then drill them all in.

136
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,690
How smart.

137
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,690
Oops, that one's in the wrong spot, bud.

138
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,006
There you go.

139
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,622
(upbeat music)

140
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:49,948
All right guys,

141
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:51,850
my mom is actually pulling hair right now.

142
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,357
We're heading somewhere to
actually look at a horse.

143
00:04:54,357 --> 00:04:55,920
Actually looked at it yesterday

144
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,150
and really really liked it,

145
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,050
so I'm bringing my trainer now

146
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,530
basically to ride it, and
I might give it a ride too.

147
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,730
I actually have another one
I'm also gonna go look at too.

148
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,645
I did have one that I was
really sure I was gonna get,

149
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,130
but I ended up pulling out of that one

150
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,600
because I just don't think
it was the right fit.

151
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,300
So now I'm back in the search again

152
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,410
and I'm hoping this one is a good one.

153
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,000
It is in town, which I like,

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,180
because I really hate
when they're far away

155
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,998
and it's hard to really
get a good idea about them

156
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:22,500
because I can only se them so many times.

157
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,778
We'll see how this one is, I'm excited.

158
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,361
(upbeat music)

159
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,160
This is the horse we're
looking at right now.

160
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,290
The lady is on him.

161
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:40,186
He's a tiny little guy.

162
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,860
He is like so sweet.

163
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,290
And just a really cool horse.

164
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,620
He's actually really tiny,
which is interesting.

165
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,440
I kinda like, but I'm not sure if

166
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,750
he'll be able to do Western,

167
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,984
or at least we'd have to
find a saddle that fits him.

168
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:59,290
But pretty cute.

169
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,185
All right, I just got done
looking at that horse,

170
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:04,440
and honestly I really really liked him.

171
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,990
I've never rode English before.

172
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,930
So he mainly is English.

173
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,130
I don't think he had any
problem doing Western,

174
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,590
but he's definitely on the smaller side,

175
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,030
and I think he also doesn't
have a ton of muscle.

176
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,251
So what's interesting
though about him is that

177
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,090
I am definitely a
beginner and I don't want

178
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,757
to be doing a lot of things yet.

179
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,150
So as I grow I think he'll grow

180
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,680
and get the muscle and
get a little thicker,

181
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,500
then I'll be ready for more too.

182
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,225
Because he was kind of on the lazy side.

183
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,058
Like he did everything that we asked,

184
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:36,650
but he didn't really
wanna canter that much.

185
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,650
He was super cute, so sweet,

186
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,610
I'm very very very interested in him.

187
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,565
I really really am.

188
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,140
My trainer is super interested too.

189
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,234
So I guess we will see.

190
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:47,750
These things are slow though,

191
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,461
I gotta take my time,

192
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,294
I gotta talk to the owner a little more.

193
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:53,840
And then I have to call
vets, the whole process.

194
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,740
So nothing happens very quickly.

195
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,640
But I really really like him

196
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,770
and I'm super interested.

197
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,120
All right, I just got home

198
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,280
and Ollie is so excited

199
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,949
because he know I brought
him a little surprise, huh?

200
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:05,782
- Yeah.

201
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,050
- He's closing his eyes
cause he doesn't wanna see.

202
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,050
He's got his cowboy boots,

203
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,880
I had to stop somewhere to grab something

204
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
that he's actually been asking for,

205
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,135
so I think he's gonna be really excited.

206
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,556
Okay, hang lemme set it up.

207
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:19,507
Close your eyes.

208
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,470
(country music)

209
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,470
All right open them.

210
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:25,475
What is it?

211
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,308
- Cowboy.

212
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:27,890
- A cowboy hat?

213
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,930
- Yeah.

214
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,073
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, look at you.

215
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,406
That is so cute.

216
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,160
Do you like it?

217
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,993
- Yeah.

218
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,873
- [Missy] I think it's backwards.

219
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,706
See this little tag?

220
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:40,286
The tag goes in the back.

221
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,119
Oh wait, that's how you had it.

222
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,390
Oh okay, you had it right.

223
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,300
Do you like it?

224
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,975
Look at you.

225
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:46,994
- Did you get Finn one?

226
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:49,818
- [Missy] Yes I got Finn a matching hat.

227
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:50,817
Is that exciting?

228
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:51,797
- Yeah.

229
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,653
- Aww, Finn's taking a nap right now.

230
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:54,486
So we'll surprise him with it later.

231
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:55,814
Do you like it?

232
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:56,853
- Yeah.

233
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:57,686
- All right, we're gonna
go look at one more horse.

234
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,645
You wanna go look at a horse with Mommy?

235
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,644
- Yeah.

236
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:01,666
- Okay.

237
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,499
You like it, is it comfortable?

238
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:03,332
- Yeah.

239
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:04,165
- You're awesome now.

240
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:06,951
It'll keep all the sun out of your eyes

241
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,100
and it'll protect you while you're

242
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,225
riding your horse all day.

243
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:11,734
- Yeah.

244
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:12,891
- [Man] Can you take it off and say howdy?

245
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,869
- [Missy] Say howdy.

246
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,867
- Howdy.

247
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,561
- [Missy] You gotta go show Daddy.

248
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,950
- Look at you.

249
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,486
You got a cowboy hat?

250
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:22,319
- Yeah!

251
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,808
- [Missy] He's so excited.

252
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,130
- So cool, I don't think it will fit me.

253
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,481
- [Missy] It's just your size, bud.

254
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:28,314
- You look so cute in that.

255
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:30,150
Don't pull on it, it looks so good dude.

256
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,095
You're like a real Woody, huh?

257
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,198
- Yeah.

258
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:34,030
- [Missy] You set it just like that.

259
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,863
There you go.

260
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:37,697
- Oh my gosh you look so adorable.

261
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:40,294
- All right my parents
are in the front again

262
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:41,547
and it's me--

263
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:42,546
- [Woman] You kids be good back there.

264
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:46,213
- Me and cowboy Ollie
off to go see a horse.

265
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,010
This one is an Arabian.

266
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,509
So I don't know if you
know horses very much,

267
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:52,800
but it is a very beautiful horse.

268
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,350
I think it tends to be
a little more spunky.

269
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,210
I guess we actually had two Arabians

270
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,777
when I was little, right?

271
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,910
- We had two Arabians, and
they were strong horses.

272
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,200
- Yeah they were a little
spooky I think too.

273
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,534
The only reason I'm really going to look,

274
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:06,930
because I was kinda not
looking for an Arabian,

275
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,690
but it's actually a friend of a friend who

276
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,060
like they trust a lot.

277
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,290
I told them I'm looking
for a really chilled

278
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,820
beginner horse, so I thought
may as well take a look,

279
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,960
they're just down the street from me.

280
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,970
So I'm excited to look.

281
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,812
And he I just so excited to go check

282
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,204
and see if he can find a horse.

283
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:24,840
- Yeah well I want to have the horse.

284
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,310
- He really wants a horse.

285
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,780
And you're gonna take your cowboy hat

286
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,910
and go look for one.

287
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,743
- Yeah.

288
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:32,164
- You have to tell me if you
think it's the right one.

289
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:32,997
- Okay.

290
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:34,160
- [Missy] Ollie's over here

291
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,061
trying to get this kitty
cat to come to him.

292
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:38,429
Come here.

293
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:42,775
Aww, look at you, you're
petting a kitty cat huh?

294
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:43,797
- [Woman] She's very friendly.

295
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:47,710
- [Missy] Cowboy Ollie is
gonna go check out this horse.

296
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,532
What do you think of him so far?

297
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:51,782
(laughing)

298
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,810
Is that a good sign?

299
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,429
- Yup.

300
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,543
(laughing)

301
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:58,867
- He's so cute.

302
00:09:58,867 --> 00:09:59,750
I keep saying him, but
this one's actually a girl,

303
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,860
her name's Elena.

304
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,410
I can definitely say that
just from what we've seen

305
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,920
it's a lot like what we thought.

306
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,630
Very high-strung, a little more nervous.

307
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,970
Or not nervous I guess.

308
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,610
I don't now, she does seem nervous, right?

309
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,420
We'll see what she does.

310
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,000
We're gonna let the lady get
on her and ride her first.

311
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:20,931
(upbeat music)

312
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,540
Um what did you just do?

313
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,841
(laughing)

314
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:34,240
You are loving this, aren't you?

315
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,808
So you found the one you want, Ollie?

316
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:38,910
- I want this kitty now.

317
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,593
- [Missy] You want this one?

318
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:41,592
- [Man] That is a small horse.

319
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:44,169
- [Missy] I don't think you
can ride that one, Ollie.

320
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:46,304
Are you hoping to ride
him with your cowboy hat?

321
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:47,698
- Yeah.

322
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:48,697
(laughing)

323
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:50,470
- [Missy] Yeah that's a
pretty sweet kitty cat.

324
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,220
All right, just left that place,

325
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,570
and Mommy was not a big fan of that horse.

326
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,520
What did you think?

327
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,753
- I liked the kitty cat.

328
00:10:57,753 --> 00:11:00,320
- But what did you think of the horse?

329
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,690
- Horse?

330
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,600
- [Missy] Yeah.

331
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,300
Did you see the horse?

332
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,671
- Yeah.

333
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:06,760
- [Missy] Yeah, what did you think of it?

334
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,620
- Um, good.

335
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,618
- You think it was a good one?

336
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:10,849
It was pretty spazzy,

337
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,430
it was kind of like what I
figured an Arabian would be like,

338
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,970
really hard to get a saddle on it,

339
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,580
like it was kinda jumping around.

340
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,360
Which it coulda been tied up for a while

341
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,670
before they had actually
put the saddle on,

342
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,840
but it's just not something
that I'm comfortable with,

343
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,900
plus she did spook a little

344
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,730
when a dog came over.

345
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,002
She jumped back,

346
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,840
and I was like, I'm not
getting on that horse.

347
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,630
Super pretty, and I
think it's a great horse,

348
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,870
but not quite what I'm looking for.

349
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,409
All right, we're all
gonna keep looking, okay.

350
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,520
Although I think Mama's pretty much sold

351
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,682
on that one I saw today,
we'll see what happens though.

352
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:46,290
All right we're home and Finn's up,

353
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,581
so I'm putting on his little cowboy hat.

354
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:50,164
Isn't that so cute.

355
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:54,258
My gosh.

356
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,860
- Look what we did today you guys.

357
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:02,197
Our living room is kind of in shambles.

358
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:04,100
We took down our
entertainment center, our TV.

359
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,770
Missy parents actually stole it.

360
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,950
No, we gave it to them.

361
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,590
We're actually getting
something really cool

362
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,816
installed tomorrow and it's kinda

363
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:12,814
gonna be built in,

364
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:13,970
it's kinda like a permanent
improvement to the house,

365
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,250
which is gonna be really cool.

366
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,820
Really excited for you guys to see that,

367
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,300
so stay tuned to tomorrow's vlog.

368
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,370
I am cooking some dinner
for the boys and for us.

369
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,200
Ollie's playing Design & Drill again.

370
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,770
You really like this game, huh?

371
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,980
We are making ham and cheese paninis

372
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,860
for dinner tonight.

373
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,390
Oh, that look so good.

374
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,430
Look at at that cheese.

375
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,664
- [Missy] What are we doing, Finn?

376
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:35,497
(speaks nonsense syllables)

377
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:37,311
Are we getting ready for bed?

378
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:40,061
Ollie is doing his fluoride, huh?

379
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,120
So he can't talk right now.

380
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,220
Don't make him laugh.

381
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,310
He can't talk right now.

382
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,510
You done?
- Yeah.

383
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,070
- Good job.

384
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,910
All right we gotta brush yours now kid.

385
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,889
I don't know if you guys know this,

386
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,920
but Finn was always a very
difficult teeth brusher

387
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,990
as a baby and as a child.

388
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,500
So just like the last few months,

389
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,720
oh my gosh he's gotten so good.

390
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,050
I'm really excited that he's
finally brushing his teeth,

391
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,840
and he actually has his
first dentist's appointment

392
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,640
here in just a few weeks.

393
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,398
All right, let's brush
your teeth now, okay?

394
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,859
How's your teeth look?

395
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:14,974
Are they all clean?

396
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,205
- Yeah.

397
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,260
- [Missy] Yeah, let me see?

398
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,220
Those look good.

399
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,600
All right, he's excited.

400
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,845
All right show us how good you do.

401
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,471
I'm not gonna be very good,

402
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,469
because I'm one-handed.

403
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,302
I'm one-handed right now.

404
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:27,861
So let's try.

405
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:29,533
Ready, and say ah.

406
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,599
- Ah ah ah, ah ah ah,

407
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,182
ah ah ah, ah ah ah.

408
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:35,399
Ah ah ah, ah!

409
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,121
- [Missy] He's singing Jingle Bells.

410
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:44,038
(singing Jingle Bells to 'ah')

411
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,500
But anyways, we are
getting ready for bed now,

412
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,262
I'm gonna go ahead and end the vlog

413
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:52,706
with these little boys,

414
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,146
because they're going to bed.

415
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:55,120
Mwah, mwah.

416
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,890
All right, hope you guys
enjoyed today's video,

417
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,360
we are getting so close
to getting a horsey, huh?

418
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,013
So close.

419
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:04,846
Give this video a thumbs
up if you enjoyed it.

420
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:09,401
Oh he's like, I'm trying.

421
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:10,234
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

422
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:11,747
What do you say?

423
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:12,747
- [All] Bye.

424
00:14:13,833 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
