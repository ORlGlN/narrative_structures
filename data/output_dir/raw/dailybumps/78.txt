00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:02,630
- [Bryan] What Missy?

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,983
- How did we do that wrong?

3
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,414
(groans)

4
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:06,366
- [Bryan] We're the worst.

5
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:07,384
- I think I can fix this.

6
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:08,988
- [Bryan] This may be a disaster.

7
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:10,139
- I don't know if I can fix this.

8
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,555
- Now Christmas is ruined!

12
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:23,950
- [Missy] Good morning my boys!

13
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,231
You guys look so handsome today.

14
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:27,695
Morning guys, it is Sunday

15
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,749
and it is a beautiful day.

16
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:31,142
We got up this morning

17
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:33,372
and we're off to church

18
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:35,291
and we're excited for a fun, fun day.

19
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,377
Boys where are you?

20
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:37,210
Come on!

21
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,132
We've got to go!

22
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:39,909
Hey Ollie, do you want to
show them where we found

23
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:40,861
Fred today?

24
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:41,757
Where did we find him?

25
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:43,002
We couldn't find him for forever.

26
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:43,835
(shouts)

27
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:48,644
He's pretending to be baby
Jesus in the nativity scene!

28
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:51,862
Fred you should not be
impersonating Jesus!

29
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:53,713
That is not a good thing to do!

30
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,521
No, no, no don't touch him!

31
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:57,383
You almost touched him!

32
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:59,374
Don't touch Fred!

33
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:00,340
You could hurt him.

34
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,351
He could get owies.

35
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,868
By the way, sometimes
we don't vlog everything

36
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:06,881
and sometimes we do a lot of Instastorying

37
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:08,135
or Instagraming

38
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,395
so if you guys aren't following me,

39
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:12,109
make sure you are or Bryan
or even Ollie and Finn

40
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,847
'cause they do a lot of Instagraming too.

41
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:15,848
We'll have that all linked
down below for you to follow.

42
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:18,622
Yesterday I actually
Instastoried finding Fred

43
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:21,212
and it was super duper cute.

44
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:23,557
All right look at the boys are all ready!

45
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:24,846
- We're ready for church!

46
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:27,020
- It's always a little
hit or miss with Finn

47
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,653
when we drop him off at nursery.

48
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,007
You never know if he's
going to start crying.

49
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:30,920
He usually cries.

50
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,779
We're all ready.

51
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:32,612
We're going.

52
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:33,701
I'm actually wearing a
little lettermansweater

53
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,275
and it has a B on it for Bryan.

54
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:37,256
- Aw thanks babe.

55
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,089
- Just for you.

56
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:40,672
(upbeat music)

57
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,418
- [Bryan] Okay I just had to
vlog Finn waiting so patiently

58
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:51,799
to get his crayons out of his box.

59
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,776
He's being such a good boy today.

60
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:54,905
There you go Finny.

61
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,185
Ollie and Finn are doing such a good job

62
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,787
at coloring their coasters.

63
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,506
Good job boys.

64
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,394
They have been such good boys all day.

65
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:05,830
It's so crazy the things that
they're starting to say to us.

66
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,996
- I know and even to each other.

67
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,701
They just love each other so much.

68
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:10,999
- They're starting to become
like really good friends

69
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:13,419
and they're probably
on their best behavior

70
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,639
because it's Christmastime.

71
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,446
But I got in the car and Ollie was like

72
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:19,093
Dada, you're awesome

73
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:20,911
and I was like thanks you're awesome too.

74
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:22,546
You are so awesome.

75
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:23,493
I love you boys.

76
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,135
All right guys let's cheers!

77
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:25,968
Cheers!

78
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:29,765
- We are home and Finn is
just waking up from his nap.

79
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,736
He does not sound very happy huh?

80
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:32,569
- Yeah.

81
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,901
- He took a nap in Ollie's room

82
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:36,310
and he just woke up and he is not happy.

83
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,082
So I'm just like you come
out when you're ready.

84
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:39,258
But we've just been kind of relaxing

85
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:42,625
and getting out all our Christmas decor.

86
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,270
Yay!

87
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,685
For the tree huh?

88
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:47,580
Because we still have to put
together our family tree.

89
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,215
Fred did not get us a tree.

90
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:51,109
He didn't decorate our
tree which is a good thing

91
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:52,554
'cause we like to decorate our tree

92
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,177
and normally we do it like
way earlier than we are

93
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:57,911
but I guess we just kind
of have been falling behind

94
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,856
this year but we're really excited.

95
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:01,317
I was just going through
all my decor though.

96
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:03,524
We've got lots of different things.

97
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:06,511
I think we might get a
few more things at Target.

98
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:08,762
I was plugging in all the
lights and my lights do work.

99
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:10,268
We're going to go get our Christmas tree?

100
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:11,175
- Yeah!

101
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:12,047
- [Missy] All right.

102
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:13,163
Are we going to get a big one

103
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:15,155
or like a small one?

104
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:19,322
- I think we're going to get
just a little bigger one.

105
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:21,766
- [Missy] Okay cool.

106
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:22,805
Let's go pick it out.

107
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:25,388
(upbeat music)

108
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:32,454
All right we've piled into the truck

109
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,772
because we're going to
put the tree back there

110
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,318
which we've never had a
truck to get a tree with.

111
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:38,101
We always have to strap it to the roof

112
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:41,143
and then be scared that it's
going to fly off our car.

113
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,843
Finn is up from his nap.

114
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:43,676
Are you happy now?

115
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:44,509
- Yeah!

116
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:45,342
- He woke up a little grouchy

117
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:46,415
but I think he's happy.

118
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:49,474
First up we're going to
Target to grab a few things

119
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:52,349
so we can decorate it
and it will look good

120
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,078
and then we'll go get our tree.

121
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:56,661
(upbeat music)

122
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:01,586
- So we are now shopping
in a Target wonderland.

123
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:02,589
Yes it is true.

124
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:04,750
All the weird ornaments, even the pickles.

125
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,103
(laughs)

126
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:07,717
We had to pick out a star.

127
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:08,974
We need a tree skirt,

128
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:10,304
we need lights.

129
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:12,760
- Lights and maybe a
couple more ornaments.

130
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,643
- [Bryan] Yeah.

131
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:16,906
You guys they finally
have an elf ornament.

132
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:17,772
Look it!

133
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:18,833
It's Buddy the elf!

134
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,416
(upbeat music)

135
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:26,755
Ooh the boys got some hot chocolate

136
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:29,581
and we have made it to
the Christmas tree farm!

137
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:31,159
We did photos here a couple years ago.

138
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:33,051
It's really, really pretty.

139
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:33,982
- Christmas trees!

140
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,579
- [Bryan] Yeah you want to go pick one?

141
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,429
- Yeah!

142
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:37,293
- [Bryan] And cut it down?

143
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:38,328
Finn, did you bring your saw?

144
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:39,291
- Yeah.

145
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,409
- [Bryan] Okay cool.

146
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,381
I'll let you cut it down this year okay.

147
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,964
(upbeat music)

148
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,415
Merry Christmas throne!

149
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,228
That's so cool!

150
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:53,053
Look at you boys!

151
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:55,615
You're in Santa's chair.

152
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:58,198
(upbeat music)

153
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,150
So there is three different
types of Christmas trees here.

154
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,563
There is a Douglas fir,
there is a Noble fir

155
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:17,061
and there is a Grand fir.

156
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,491
Let me know in the comments down below,

157
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,147
what do you guys normally
get for like your family

158
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,316
Christmas tree?

159
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:23,960
We always get a Noble but
I love like the bushy look

160
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,261
of the Douglas firs

161
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:26,686
and they're like really soft

162
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:28,478
and they look like classic Christmas trees

163
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,165
but it doesn't really matter what kind

164
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:31,468
'cause it smells amazing in here.

165
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,010
I'm like loving (laughs)

166
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,212
this smell and vibe right now.

167
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:36,071
It's pretty dope.

168
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,654
(upbeat music)

169
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:42,359
Alrighty I think we've found it.

170
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,553
- Do you like this one?

171
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:45,269
Is that cool?

172
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:46,903
- [Bryan] We got a Christmas tree!

173
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:48,708
I think this is the one we're getting.

174
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,541
Aw!

175
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,501
(upbeat music)

176
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:59,238
- All right we're home and
Bryan's bringing the tree in

177
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:00,458
in just a minute.

178
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,798
We just moved the couch just a little bit

179
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,744
so it's a lot closer to the TV

180
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:05,573
and we have more room
over here for the tree.

181
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,740
Here it comes!

182
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:08,772
- Imagine that!

183
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:09,856
A Christmas tree that
fits through the door!

184
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:12,323
- [Missy] And one that you
can do all by yourself.

185
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:13,823
Usually I have to have my dad help us.

186
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:14,906
Look at that!

187
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:17,129
Oh it's so good!

188
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,748
- So this year we actually
got what is called

189
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,523
a Nordman fir.

190
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:23,500
I've never heard of it before

191
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,345
but it definitely looks
like a cross between like

192
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,072
a Noble and a Douglas.

193
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:30,419
- Yeah which is perfect
because I really wanted a Noble

194
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,531
and you wanted Douglas.

195
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,188
- [Bryan] Yeah these branches
are so pretty looking.

196
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:34,242
They're strong.

197
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:35,325
Look at that!

198
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:38,502
That is our Christmas tree you guys!

199
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,181
It's so pretty looking!

200
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:42,616
I think that is a good looking tree, babe.

201
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:43,743
- I love it!

202
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,145
It's a small tree but it's
like the perfect size.

203
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:47,846
- [Bryan] I always want to
go with a tree that touches

204
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:48,745
the ceiling.

205
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:50,538
- But it makes it so hard to decorate.

206
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:52,262
Like they honestly kind
of always looks like eh.

207
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,662
(laughs)

208
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:54,627
- [Bryan] And it takes like four hours.

209
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:55,494
(laughs)

210
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:56,404
- Hey Daddy!

211
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:57,327
I'm matching you!

212
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:58,347
- We're matching!

213
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,341
Isn't that so cool?

214
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:01,409
- Yeah!

215
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:02,275
- Yeah.

216
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:03,153
- Hey Finn!

217
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:04,710
Now we are both matching!

218
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,441
- [Bryan] Whoa they're both matching now!

219
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,970
(laughs)

220
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,567
And we're all matching!

221
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:12,691
We're all matching

222
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:15,666
and we are going to now
decorate the Christmas tree

223
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,722
as a family and I thought this year

224
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:20,130
we need to do a time lapse.

225
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,898
So we are going to get that set up.

226
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:23,641
Ollie, are you going to put
those beads on the tree?

227
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:24,617
- Yeah.

228
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:25,476
- [Bryan] That's a lot.

229
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:28,059
(upbeat music)

230
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,887
All right so before we
start decorating the tree,

231
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:38,394
we have to put ornament hooks on our bulbs

232
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:39,844
because we got new bulbs this year

233
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:40,996
and Ollie knows how to do it

234
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:42,634
and I am so proud of him.

235
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:44,359
So you put that hoop in
and then what do you do?

236
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,225
And then you pinch it.

237
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,338
- Good job!

238
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:48,454
- [Bryan] You did it!

239
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:50,327
See how that makes it so much easier Ollie

240
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:51,555
to hang it on the tree?

241
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,934
So we are trying to put all of these

242
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:55,944
on these.

243
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:58,608
Finn's like I don't know what is going on.

244
00:07:58,608 --> 00:07:59,724
Last one Ollie!

245
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:01,488
Put the hook on!

246
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:02,476
Pinch it.

247
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:03,486
- There you go!

248
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:04,586
- [Bryan] Boom!

249
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:05,451
All right!

250
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,370
Should we put all of these
on the tree now boys?

251
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,221
- Yeah!

252
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,325
- All right you guys.

253
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:09,990
We are all in our matching pajamas

254
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,796
and it is time to decorate the tree

255
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,513
so this time we're going to
do a little bit of time lapse.

256
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:15,742
You boys ready to decorate?

257
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:16,683
- Yeah!

258
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:17,639
- Let's go!

259
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,722
(indistinct talking)

260
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,243
(upbeat music)

261
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:31,669
What Missy?

262
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,390
- How did we do that wrong?

263
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,479
(groans)

264
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,347
- [Bryan] We're the worst.

265
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,603
- I think I can fix this.

266
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:38,960
- [Bryan] This may be a disaster.

267
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,422
- I don't know if I can fix this.

268
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:43,058
- Now Christmas is ruined!

269
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:44,760
- All right you guys we may
have figured out a solution

270
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,235
via an extension cord.

271
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,754
- Ribbon time!

272
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:51,337
(upbeat music)

273
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:54,967
- Got beads?

274
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:55,820
We do.

275
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,719
(laughs)

276
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,711
We're going to put them on our tree now.

277
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,294
(upbeat music)

278
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,878
- [Ollie] Dada, you're doing
really great with that tree.

279
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,897
- Thanks guys!

280
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,154
- You're welcome.

281
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:10,737
(upbeat music)

282
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:17,707
- All right now we're going
to throw all these balls

283
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:18,555
on there.

284
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:19,402
(laughs)

285
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:20,298
For Christmas.

286
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:21,727
Boys!

287
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,648
Mommy and Daddy need your help!

288
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,731
So we are now going to put
these on the Christmas tree

289
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,954
and we need your help
to do it strategically

290
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:31,355
and nicely okay?

291
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:32,227
- Okay!

292
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:33,093
- Okay.

293
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:35,552
- Don't let another color
next to another color.

294
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:37,452
- [Bryan] How about right here?

295
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,197
- That means that!

296
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,364
- [Bryan] Whoa you did it!

297
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:43,871
That was so cute!

298
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:45,702
He was so proud of
himself for putting on his

299
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:47,054
first ornament!

300
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,448
(laughs)

301
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:50,174
Ollie you're doing such a good job buddy!

302
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,757
(upbeat music)

303
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,680
Okay now it's time to
put on an assortment of

304
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,807
ornaments that we have
acquired over the years.

305
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,021
Some are like kooky and
weird and some are just

306
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:12,220
downright ugly looking

307
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,215
but they're ours so they go on our tree.

308
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,114
(soft music)

309
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,343
- That's coffee.

310
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:20,683
- Or actually there's hot chocolate.

311
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:23,001
It looks like those are
little marshmallows.

312
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:25,548
- No I think that's coffee
with (indistinct) in it.

313
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:26,559
- Oh really?

314
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,674
- Because coffee is black.

315
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:31,091
(soft music)

316
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,816
- You want to put the birdy on Finn?

317
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:35,806
- Where did this come from?

318
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:39,054
(soft music)

319
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:42,195
(indistinct)

320
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:43,058
- You did it!

321
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:43,900
He's so happy!

322
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,317
(soft music)

323
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:59,000
- [Bryan] Look at you

324
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,087
with your reindeer nose.

325
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:02,579
That's a fun one huh?

326
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,931
All right the tree is all done

327
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,181
and now all we need is
to put the star on top.

328
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:10,545
So boys I'll give you each a turn.

329
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,199
Okay so you put the
star on top of the tree.

330
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:14,060
Sound good?

331
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,904
- I want do it!

332
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:16,190
- And this year we don't
have to use a ladder

333
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,478
and practically make it fall over.

334
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,345
- [Bryan] I know.

335
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,718
It's always been very
crazy every single year

336
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:23,418
but now we have a average sized tree

337
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:24,641
that is pretty grand.

338
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,429
Let's put the star on top okay?

339
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:27,441
- Okay.

340
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:28,374
- All right!

341
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:30,733
So you need to grab this.

342
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,692
- [Missy] See if you can do it.

343
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,709
- Here's the star

344
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:36,063
and put this piece on top of there okay?

345
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,081
- [Missy] Put it up there Finn!

346
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:37,998
Oh my gosh!

347
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:39,994
- Put it on!

348
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:40,827
- I get it on!

349
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:41,660
(laughs)

350
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,493
- [Missy] Did you get it?

351
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,326
(laughs)

352
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,159
His face!

353
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,594
Put it on there, good job!

354
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:47,618
(laughs)

355
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:50,127
Right there, perfect!

356
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,842
You did it!

357
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:53,606
(cheers)

358
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:54,999
- It is Ollie's turn.

359
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:55,832
- [Missy] Okay.

360
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:58,154
- And I brought a chair
because Ollie weighs a lot.

361
00:11:58,154 --> 00:11:59,590
(laughs)

362
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,472
So go ahead.

363
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:02,555
- [Missy] Oh my goodness!

364
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:04,371
You're doing it!

365
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:05,204
Get it on there!

366
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,287
(cheers)

367
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,731
- High five dude!

368
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,642
Love you!

369
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:12,475
Merry Christmas!

370
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:15,034
- Merry Christmas Dada!

371
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,945
- [Bryan] All right it's time
to shut off all the lights.

372
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,845
All right now it is
time to light the tree.

373
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:21,845
Let's do it!

374
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:25,818
Three, two, one, light it up!

375
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:28,984
Woo!

376
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:32,681
It works!

377
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,941
- Peanut butter jelly time!

378
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:37,003
Peanut butter jelly time!

379
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:39,086
(cheers)

380
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,445
- It's Christmas!

381
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:46,188
- [Bryan] Yeah it's
Christmastime now buddy!

382
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:48,605
(soft music)

383
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:21,392
I love our tree.

384
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,873
It is so pretty!

385
00:13:22,873 --> 00:13:23,949
- [Missy] It's so pretty!

386
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:24,810
- [Bryan] We did a good job!

387
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,218
- We did so good with the lights!

388
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:28,840
- [Bryan] Are you so
excited for Christmas boys?

389
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,893
(squeals)

390
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,747
Oh the squealing, that could stop.

391
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:33,709
That'd be cool.

392
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:34,702
(laughs)

393
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:36,351
- [Missy] All right
boys it is time to open

394
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,341
our advent calendars.

395
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:39,825
So we might have missed yesterday huh?

396
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,703
So we get to open two of these

397
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:43,282
and two of these so that will be nice

398
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,552
because then you guys each get one

399
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:46,071
and there's no fighting!

400
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:50,848
Also a lot of people have
questions as to why I start

401
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,528
with 24 and I like to count down

402
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:57,053
so we're going to open up 23 and then 22.

403
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:57,961
I don't know.

404
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:58,850
I just like counting down.

405
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,713
It might be the wrong way

406
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,474
but I think that it's fun
to say there's 22 days

407
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,515
until Christmas instead
of like oh it's the third.

408
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:06,943
Open three. (laughs)

409
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:08,233
All right Ollie.

410
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:09,778
You're opening up 23.

411
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:11,051
What's in there?

412
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:11,968
What is it?

413
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:14,376
I don't know which one that is.

414
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:15,490
We'll have to put it together.

415
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,258
You need to open 22 okay.

416
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,236
Press that one.

417
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:20,069
Right there, get that one.

418
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,152
Okay so Finn got this one

419
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,486
and Ollie got this one.

420
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,752
All right Finn gets to
open up 23 of this one.

421
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:34,543
There you go get it out!

422
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:35,462
Who is it?

423
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,878
Oh my gosh it's Rapunzel!

424
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,791
Ollie gets to open up 22.

425
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,108
What's that one?

426
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:42,745
A Christmas tree?

427
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,289
Oh that's so cool!

428
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,694
I wonder if some fit
in the Christmas tree.

429
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:49,810
You guys I bet they fit in here.

430
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,552
So Rapunzel fits in that one

431
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:54,077
and then I bet we'll find
one that's even smaller

432
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,993
that'll go in that in the top of the tree.

433
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:57,074
Isn't that cool?

434
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:57,907
- Yeah.

435
00:14:57,907 --> 00:14:58,740
- [Missy] How neat!

436
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,573
This one's really fun.

437
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:00,863
No assembly required when you open it.

438
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay guys it's bedtime.

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,818
So so so far past our bedtime

440
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,597
so we're going to go
ahead and end the video.

441
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:08,300
Make sure you visit vlog a big thumbs up.

442
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,200
We enjoyed decorating
our Christmas tree today.

443
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,736
It was such an awesome
day, I really enjoyed it.

444
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:14,157
We'll see you guys tomorrow!

445
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:15,364
What do you say Ollie?

446
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:16,197
- Bye!

447
00:15:17,138 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
