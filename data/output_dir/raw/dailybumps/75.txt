1
00:00:00,623 --> 00:00:03,001
- [Missy] What do you think of that one?

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:06,197
This one really likes licking.

3
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:08,600
Finn keeps teasing him.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,943
Look at that tongue.

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,440
I've never seen a horse lick.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,857
That is so funny.

7
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:18,004

Are you guys cleaning up the kitchen?

20
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:40,764
- Yeah.

21
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:42,866
- Thanks, dude.
- You're helping daddy?

22
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:46,055
- [Bryan] No used crying over
spilled rice, I guess, huh?

23
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:47,309
- [Missy] Good job, bud.

24
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,246
That was good helping.
- I spilled this

25
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:50,614
whole thing of rice on the floor.

26
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:51,718
- Aw.

27
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,937
Good morning, guys.

28
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:56,840
We are having a cleaning fun day.

29
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,757
We are actually taking
down the Christmas tree.

30
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:04,534
I've got all the ornaments here,

31
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:08,080
I've got all the bulbs off,
the garland, the beads,

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,154
all the fun stuff, and
we're taking it down.

33
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,635
I'm actually really proud of us.

34
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:17,876
I feel like we kept the
tree pretty well fed,

35
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:19,602
so it lasted a really long time,

36
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:21,569
all the way until January first.

37
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,345
At this point, it is pretty dead,

38
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:26,707
but honestly, I've had more dead trees.

39
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:29,406
They're really not falling off,

40
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:30,416
so I'm pretty proud of us.

41
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,414
I think we did good.

42
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:32,466
It's definitely time though.

43
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:34,352
We'll leave all the other decorations up

44
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:35,732
for just a few more days,

45
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:38,334
but this tree has just gotta go.

46
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,167
It's just that time, right, Ollie?

47
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,234
Yeah.

48
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,663
All right, I have been
literally taking apart

49
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:45,089
this tree for hours.

50
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:47,982
It's finally gone, thanks to my dad.

51
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,301
He helped me finish it off.

52
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:51,122
I literally was untangling the lights

53
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:52,544
and I could not get it untangled.

54
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,193
The lights literally looked as though

55
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:55,908
I had tied knots around it.

56
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,730
Like, we're never
getting rid of this tree.

57
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,090
So, thanks to my dad,

58
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,225
finally got it out and now
I've got to sweep all this up

59
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:03,597
and get rid of those needles,

60
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:04,882
which is always the funnest part

61
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:07,016
about having a tree, huh, Karma?

62
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:10,946
I'm trying to really
pack it all into here.

63
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:13,303
For some reason, we have a ton of balls.

64
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:15,207
I do not know why we have so many balls,

65
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,735
so I'm going to donate these
because I just don't need them.

66
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:20,257
I don't need that many balls

67
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:23,578
and there's all different sizes and colors

68
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,633
and I kept what I need.

69
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:26,980
I don't need any more than that.

70
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,239
Me and my parents decided
to go on a little adventure

71
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,957
and we are back at the boarding facility

72
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:35,429
that I'll be boarding my
horse once I actually get one

73
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:38,996
and I just want to show them
and kinda look around again.

74
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:41,248
I just feel like this could be the place

75
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,549
I'm going to hang out a lot,

76
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:44,522
so I wanna really get to know it.

77
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,867
I'm taking Finn to come see it, too.

78
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,889
Oh, my gosh.

79
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:49,056
This is Wally.

80
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:50,935
Hi, Wally.

81
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:54,981
Finn, do you see Wally?

82
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:56,814
- [Mom] Look at Wally.

83
00:02:58,188 --> 00:03:00,688
- [Boarding Girl] Can you sit?

84
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,989
- [Missy] Wally is like a dog.

85
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:07,906
He can sit.

86
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:09,973
He's trying.

87
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:13,922
How about you just give me it?

88
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:20,088
What do you think of that, Finn?

89
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,005
Is he cute?

90
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,144
My mom's feeding the pig.

91
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,402
Mom, do I need to get a pig?

92
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,422
- [Mom] I don't know.

93
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:30,760
You wanna feed him?

94
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,947
- [Missy] It's nice we can come here.

95
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,510
Oh, gosh, he's so nervous.

96
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,677
Some pig, hey?

97
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:38,139
- Did you give him a kiss?
- Look, he likes Cheerios.

98
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,014
- Can you pet him?

99
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,514
Can you pet Wally?

100
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:43,482
Aw.

101
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:48,233
Check out this guy.

102
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:49,673
How are you?

103
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:51,542
You're very camera friendly.

104
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,722
(Missy laughing)

105
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:55,625
He's like, where's my Cheerios?

106
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,627
Look at him.

107
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,473
He's like, come here.

108
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:00,026
Give me some love.

109
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:01,238
Finn, say hi to the horsey.

110
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:02,071
- Hi.

111
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,008
- [Missy] Can you pet his nose right here?

112
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:08,758
(Missy laughing)

113
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:12,187
What do you think of that?

114
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:13,549
- Hug?

115
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,786
- You can give him a hug.

116
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:16,619
Aw.

117
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:24,564
(light upbeat music)

118
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:39,332
He likes peppermints?

119
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:40,665
That's so sweet.

120
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,795
- He likes everything.
- He's gonna have good breath.

121
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:45,907
- [Boarding Girl] He used
to drink beer with my dad.

122
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:47,474
- Really?

123
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:50,078
(Missy laughing)

124
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:51,229
- Check out this view.

125
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,117
It's so pretty.

126
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:54,653
I just love this property.

127
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,878
Finn, what do you think of all this?

128
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:57,917
Is that pretty cool?

129
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:58,750
You like the horses?

130
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,266
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

131
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,358
You wanna go say hi to the horses.

132
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:03,341
- Yep.
- Yeah?

133
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:05,353
Aw, are you my little horse guy?

134
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:07,103
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

135
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,575
What do you think of that one?

136
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,075
This one really likes licking.

137
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,894
Finn keeps teasing him.

138
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:15,965
Hi.

139
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:17,048
Look at this.

140
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:19,429
He's so cute.

141
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:22,920
What was his name again?

142
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,253
- Cosmo.
- Cosmo.

143
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,660
Oh, there you are.

144
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:30,039
Oh, he likes peppermints, too?

145
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:30,960
- Oh, yes.

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,793
Yes.
- Hi.

147
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,245
Look at that tongue.

148
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:36,662
I've never seen a horse lick.

149
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:41,914
Is that a good peppermint?

150
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,247
That is so cute.

151
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,151
Oh, my gosh.

152
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,413
- [Mom] All right, go ahead.

153
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:52,062
- [Missy] Give her a lick.

154
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:53,258
- [Mom] Oh, there you go.

155
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:54,732
- [Missy] It's literally a puppy dog.

156
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:56,090
- It's like getting licked by a giant dog.

157
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,154
- Ollie and I just got
back from the movies.

158
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:02,557
We had a little guys' day

159
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:05,240
going to see Star Wars, huh, Ollie?

160
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,073
- Good job.

161
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:08,310
You get to feed the hamburger to him.

162
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,605
- [Bryan] You're playing Pop the Pig?

163
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:13,030
- Yeah, and then you push it
down one time so it clicks.

164
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,117
Good job.

165
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,282
All right, Finny's turn.

166
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:18,086
- Actually, Ollie and I both
went to see the new Star Wars,

167
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,692
the Last Jedi for the
second time for both of us.

168
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:23,699
He sat through the whole
thing again, he loved it,

169
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,313
we ate so much popcorn, it was delicious,

170
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:27,748
so it's kinda like a great
way to start the New Year.

171
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:28,581
- Three.

172
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:32,694
- [Bryan] And now, they're
playing some Pop the Pig.

173
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:34,659
- I'm gonna pick red.

174
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,596
- [Missy] What does it say?

175
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,909
- Two.
- Two.

176
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,872
- [Missy] Good job.

177
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:42,937
Put it in and then you gotta

178
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,604
push down two times.

179
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,609
Good job.
- Good job.

180
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:52,803
- [Missy] All right, Finn's turn.

181
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,464
- [Bryan] That's how he rolls dice.

182
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,760
That's amazing.
- All right, a red one.

183
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,636
You need to do a red one.

184
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:57,638
Can you do that one?

185
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:58,636
- Yep!

186
00:06:58,636 --> 00:06:59,703
- [Bryan] Red.

187
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:00,536
- Do the red.

188
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:01,698
One of these.

189
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:02,531
Good one.

190
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:03,742
Now, what does it say?

191
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:06,829
Ollie, what does it say on the bottom?

192
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:07,829
- Three.

193
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:08,827
- [Missy] Three!

194
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:09,826
Good job.

195
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:10,659
All right, Finn, you have to feed him.

196
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:11,492
- Yep.

197
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,830
- Okay, you get to push it three times.

198
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,163
One, two, three.

199
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:20,693
- Three!
- Good job.

200
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:23,943
(upbeat country music)

201
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,025
- Oh, he did it!

202
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,239
- [Bryan] What happened, Ollie?

203
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,997
- [Missy] No, he exploded.

204
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:43,565
He ate too much!
- He popped.

205
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:45,422
He ate too much and he popped.

206
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,615
- [Missy] All right,
we gotta empty him out.

207
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:48,448
Ready?

208
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:51,988
- Oh, boys!

209
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:55,372
Time for dinner.

210
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:59,375
I have combined two of
your favorite foods,

211
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,542
grilled cheese sandwiches and waffles!

212
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,350
Does that sound good, Finn?

213
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,516
- Yeah.

214
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:08,848
- [Bryan] Ollie, does that sound good?

215
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,047
- Not really.

216
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:12,880
- [Bryan] Ollie's a little unsure.

217
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,792
- I would be too, but you have to try it.

218
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,348
- [Bryan] Okay, wait, I want to show this.

219
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,635
We had waffles this morning
and we had a couple left over

220
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:23,057
and I was like, well, maybe
I'll do something with them,

221
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:24,717
so I saved them.

222
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:25,717
- They smell good.

223
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:26,718
- It smells so good.

224
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:27,717
Actually, just give me that one.

225
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:28,716
I wanna take a bite.

226
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,382
I have to test it before we
give it to the kids, right?

227
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:31,549
- Yeah.
- Okay.

228
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,496
- Is it good?

229
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:35,808
- Mmm.

230
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:36,896
I think they'll love it.

231
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:37,895
- Here.

232
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:40,795
Finn, you wanna try, bud?

233
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:42,342
Let's go sit down for dinner.

234
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:44,925
(upbeat music)

235
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:52,556
All right, kids are in bed

236
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:54,808
and we are just chilling for the night.

237
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:58,465
I had such a fun day hanging
out at the boarding place.

238
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:02,413
It was so cool to just get
to know the other horses

239
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,188
and people around.

240
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:05,640
It was just a really cool time.

241
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,445
Plus, today was the first day of 2018.

242
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,737
- Yes, we made it one day.

243
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:11,944
- One day.

244
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:15,261
- Ollie's already asking
when Christmas is.

245
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,703
- Yeah, he's like, so, now
that Christmas is over,

246
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,581
when's Christmas again?

247
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:23,705
I hope you guys had a
good first day of 2018.

248
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:27,312
We have some fun stuff planned this year.

249
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:30,312
I'm actually excited to travel more.

250
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,629
Not necessarily more than we did,

251
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:35,917
but just continuing to travel.

252
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,934
2018's gonna be really cool,

253
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:39,629
but anyways, I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video.

254
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,876
We're going to be, huh Karma Chameleon?

255
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,396
You gonna go nigh nighs?

256
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:43,901
All right, give this
video a big thumbs up.

257
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,021
- Thumbs up.
- And we'll

258
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:46,029
see you guys tomorrow.

259
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,320
You guys wanna say goodbye?

260
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,405
- Bye.
- Say bye.

261
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:50,407
Boop.

262
00:09:50,407 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
