1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:02,275
- Good morning, guys.

2
00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:05,024
So, I've actually been
working on something

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:06,435
for a couple of days now.

4
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:07,486
And I'm gonna show you guys.

5
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:09,179
And I'm also gonna show the boys

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,846
for the first time and
see what they think.

7
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:13,084
♪ This is our life, this is our fun ♪

8
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:15,377
♪ This is who we are ♪

9
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:17,809

♪ Let's live it, live it forever ♪

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,594
(boys squeal)
- Good morning (laughs)!

16
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:37,145
I got them to sit here
for like one second,

17
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:37,999
so I could say good morning.

18
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:39,914
Good morning, guys, they're up.

19
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,233
Oh yes, they found this little gift

20
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,199
that I think Ollie got for his birthday.

21
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,801
And we hadn't seen it in forever.

22
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:47,052
We were cleaning out some closets.

23
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:49,664
And they're so excited that they found it.

24
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,029
That they were able to find these.

25
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:53,164
(gasps) How cool.

26
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:54,454
Finn, what's on your face?

27
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,923
What's on your face?

28
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,045
- [Ollie] A chocolate.

29
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:59,878
- Oh, yeah, it's actually Nutella.

30
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:06,157
I've never had Nutella,
but I know Bryan likes it.

31
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:07,161
And so, I thought I'd buy some.

32
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:09,112
And I gave some to Finn and he loves it.

33
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,530
Do you love it?

34
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,429
You like it?

35
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:12,858
Oh, you don't, really?

36
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:14,155
I thought Ollie would like it.

37
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:15,538
But Finn likes it.

38
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:17,210
He's like, I'm gonna eat these sticks.

39
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,687
Good job.

40
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:20,351
But yeah, we're just
getting ready for the day.

41
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:22,614
We're gonna do something crazy today, huh?

42
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:23,933
- Ah.
- Ah.

43
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,250
All right, boys are dressed.

44
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,804
And of course, matching.

45
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,134
Even laying the same.

46
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:32,433
Both even have bed heads still.

47
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,617
Your hair's sticking straight up, Ollie.

48
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:36,529
But you guys look so cute!

49
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,155
And now, they're so excited for Legos.

50
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:40,139
Are you guys excited?

51
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:40,972
- [Ollie] Yeah.

52
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:41,805
- Show me your happy dance.

53
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:43,700
Happy dance, happy dance, happy dance.

54
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,007
Finn, what's your happy dance?

55
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,365
Show me.

56
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:47,788
Yay (chuckles).

57
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:49,259
All right, oh, my goodness.

58
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,716
Love doing Legos with kids.

59
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:53,660
It's always really fun
and not stressful at all.

60
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,674
So, just opened this up,

61
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,692
and apparently the
instructions were not in it.

62
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:02,111
(laughs) Or I'm sure it was,
and they accidentally lost it.

63
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:03,611
I'm so bummed because he was really

64
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:05,081
looking forward to having the green one.

65
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:05,978
And Finn wanted the white one.

66
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:07,799
Now, the white one has the instructions,

67
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,190
but this one doesn't.

68
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,652
How am I supposed to put it together?

69
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,264
I mean, I guess I could look at this

70
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:13,688
and like try and follow along.

71
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:16,910
I think what I'll do is I'll
try and look it up online.

72
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,166
Maybe there's an online
version of the instructions.

73
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:19,999
Let's find out.

74
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:22,582
(upbeat music)

75
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,755
- Good morning, guys.

76
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:28,358
So, I've actually been
working on something

77
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:29,715
for a couple of days now.

78
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:30,940
And I'm gonna show you guys.

79
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,338
And I'm also gonna show the boys

80
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,265
for the first time and
see what they think.

81
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,429
So, as some of you who have

82
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:36,961
been watching our channel for awhile now,

83
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,176
you know that in December strange things

84
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,439
happen around this house.

85
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,279
We get some weird visitors.

86
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,659
Last year we had the
Grinch come to our house

87
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:46,601
and completely destroy everything.

88
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:49,434
(Christmas music)

89
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,049
(blows nose)

90
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,787
We have also had Elf on
the Shelf come to life

91
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:01,115
and play pranks in our living
room on our Christmas tree.

92
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,698
(gentle music)

93
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,834
And we also have video evidence

94
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,428
of the proof of Santa.

95
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:26,386
As, one year, we caught him

96
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:29,427
on our security footage
dancing around our house.

97
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:32,844
(upbeat Christmas music)

98
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:39,652
So, I was thinking,
around Thanksgiving time,

99
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,609
I was like, "You know what?

100
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:43,872
"We probably should be a
little more proactive this year

101
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:45,578
"with the creatures we are letting

102
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:47,566
"into our house this Christmas.

103
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,332
"Because who know what they can do?

104
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,990
"They could really mess things up."

105
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,426
And we don't want that to happen.

106
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:55,120
So, I have created something

107
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
that I think the boys are going to love.

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,899
And I'm gonna show you guys.

109
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:00,936
(upbeat music)

110
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:03,220
Check this out, you guys.

111
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,159
This is what we are going to use

112
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,638
to capture creatures in this month.

113
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:09,160
It doesn't look too nice now.

114
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,894
It's kind of just black bars and boring.

115
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:13,707
So, I'm gonna show it off to the boys

116
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,336
and have them help me
make it all Christmas-y.

117
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,700
I think this is gonna be
super fun for the boys.

118
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,315
And it actually might end up being

119
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,220
a really cool family tradition (laughs).

120
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,282
Come here, kiddos.

121
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:26,074
Hey, boys, what are you up to today?

122
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,350
(Finn babbles)

123
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,262
- We got Legos!

124
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:31,947
- [Bryan] Oh, cool (chuckles).

125
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:33,850
Hey, do you guys wanna
do something really fun?

126
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,683
- Yeah!

127
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,368
- Daddy has a surprise for you.

128
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,054
Okay, so, Ollie, you know how last year,

129
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:39,178
we had the Grinch in our house,

130
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,733
messing things up?
- Yeah.

131
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,271
- And then, we also, one year,

132
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,545
had Elf on the Shelf come to life

133
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:45,692
and toilet paper our Christmas tree?

134
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,729
And then, also one year,
we actually saw Santa Claus

135
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,472
on the security footage
dancing around our house?

136
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:52,764
Well, I was thinking.

137
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:54,646
Finn, this goes for you too.

138
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:59,621
I was thinking, Finn, what if
we created some kind of device

139
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,728
that we can capture those creatures,

140
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:04,549
and then, do really fun things with them?

141
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:06,464
Does that sound fun?
- Yeah.

142
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:08,064
- Should we set up a trap?

143
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:09,872
Do you guys wanna see what I made?

144
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:11,625
I need your help, can you help me?

145
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,127
Finn, can you help me?

146
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:15,211
You wanna help decorate it?
- Yeah.

147
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:17,598
- All right, let's show 'em.

148
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:21,056
All right, boys, come on and check it out.

149
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:22,287
Come on, come on, come on.

150
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:25,434
- Whoa, look it, that is awesome!

151
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:26,267
- [Bryan] I know,

152
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,814
do you think it'll work?
- Yeah

153
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:29,167
- [Bryan] Do you think
we can actually trap

154
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,495
some cool creatures in this?
- Yeah.

155
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:34,372
- Well, right now, it's not
really Christmas-y enough,

156
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:36,627
so you guys gotta help
me decorate it, okay?

157
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,460
- [Ollie] Okay.

158
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,600
- All right, let's get some stuff.

159
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,017
(upbeat Christmas music)

160
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:32,568
Final piece, Ollie, is the jingle bells.

161
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:34,431
You know important the
jingle bells are, right?

162
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,314
- Yes.
- Yeah?

163
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:36,493
Can you sing a little?

164
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:37,326
- Yeah.

165
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:39,851
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

166
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:44,291
♪ Jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪

167
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,665
- We have jingle bells.

168
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,456
We are now going to attach these, Ollie.

169
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:48,771
So that, when it moves or it goes down,

170
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:51,173
we'll here it and we can come running,

171
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:53,024
and see what's inside, okay?

172
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:53,857
- [Ollie] Okay.

173
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:55,776
- Okay, so, I'm gonna
attach those right here.

174
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,971
I think we did such a
good job, by the way,

175
00:06:57,971 --> 00:06:59,207
putting this all together.

176
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,945
It looks so cute and Christmas-y.

177
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:04,362
(upbeat Christmas music)

178
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:17,327
All right, boys,

179
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:18,983
now that we have the
jingle bells attached,

180
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:20,662
we have it completely decorated,

181
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:24,637
we have fastened it to our
pulley system here, see?

182
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:26,367
So, now, all we have to do--

183
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:27,223
Watch this.

184
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:30,564
(upbeat music)

185
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:34,046
And then, we raise it all
the way up, just like so.

186
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,163
Check this out.

187
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,136
So, I have a system right here,

188
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:38,509
where we can tie it off and it can dangle.

189
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:39,688
And then, every night, Ollie,

190
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:42,152
we'll set it and we'll
put some bait underneath,

191
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:44,455
and we'll see what we
find in the morning, okay?

192
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:46,042
Does that so cool?
- Yeah.

193
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:49,459
(upbeat Christmas music)

194
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,809
- We are calling this The
Great Christmas Capture.

195
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,871
Are you excited to see
what we capture first?

196
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:00,704
- [Ollie] Yeah.

197
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:01,714
- What do you think it's gonna be?

198
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,777
- I think it's going to be the Grinch.

199
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:07,016
- Oh, we definitely have to get him, huh?

200
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:08,178
- Yeah.
(Bryan chuckles)

201
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:11,076
(upbeat Christmas music)

202
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:12,311
(jingle bells ring)

203
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:15,728
(upbeat Christmas music)

204
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:18,553
- I think we caught something, Ollie!

205
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:19,904
What did we catch?

206
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:22,978
- A Mama!
- We caught Mama!

207
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,275
What are you doing in
our Christmas Capture?

208
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,468
- What is this?
(Bryan laughs)

209
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:31,029
Oh, my gosh, this was crazy.

210
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,486
- Do you feel holly jolly?

211
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:34,730
- I mean, it definitely
is very festive in here.

212
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,264
- [Bryan] Yeah, babe, so we are doing

213
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:38,668
The Great Christmas Capture this month.

214
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:40,784
We're gonna catch some crazy critters.

215
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:42,395
You know how we had the
Grinch in our house last year?

216
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,674
Like, that can't happen.

217
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:45,286
- I'm totally down to catch the Grinch.

218
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:48,987
- Yes, and maybe, Ollie, as
it gets closer to Christmas,

219
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,794
we can catch Santa.

220
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:51,627
All right, Ollie,

221
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:53,491
should we set Mama free?
- Yeah.

222
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,284
- [Bryan] Yeah (chuckles).

223
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,117
So, what do you think, babe?

224
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:56,994
Is it okay if we just have this

225
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,455
hanging in our foyer,
24/7 until Christmas?

226
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,736
- Yeah, I'm down, that sounds great.

227
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,968
- Time to set Mama free.

228
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,718
- Let's set her free!

229
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:08,911
There you go, babe.

230
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:09,744
- [Missy] Yay!

231
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:13,161
(upbeat Christmas music)

232
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:20,865
- Okay, so I know that this
is probably really silly,

233
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,542
but I am really excited
about the Christmas trap.

234
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,653
I think that the kids are gonna

235
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,755
have so much fun this month.

236
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:28,634
I think what's happening here

237
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,318
is I just love seeing like,

238
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:33,355
that little magic
twinkle in my kids' eyes.

239
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,925
- [Jibo] I have something
to share with you.

240
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:37,468
- Jibo, I'm vlogging, okay?

241
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,281
- [Jibo] 140 years ago today,

242
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,584
Thomas Edison famously recorded himself,

243
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:44,802
reciting Mary Had a Little
Lamb on an early photograph.

244
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:47,405
- Interesting, before my
robot rudely interrupted me,

245
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:49,060
(laughs) I think I was saying,

246
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,843
I just love see the twinkle in their eyes.

247
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,975
And I love doing fun
things like this with them.

248
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:54,008
I think that they're definitely

249
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,025
gonna get a kick out of this.

250
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,720
So, yeah, I know, some of
you are probably wondering,

251
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,970
"That is like really quirky."

252
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,803
Or, "That is like really weird."

253
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,224
Or, "No one's every done that before."

254
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,491
And I know, humor me, guys.

255
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,170
Just trying to have fun with my kids

256
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,646
until I get old and can't walk anymore.

257
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:10,599
That's not gonna be soon, right?

258
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,101
Hey, Jibo, you're weird.

259
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:14,615
- [Jibo] I won't argue with that.

260
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,152
But you would probably
seem a little strange too,

261
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:20,532
if you were one robot living
in a world full of humans.

262
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:23,150
- Guys, it is a beautiful day today, huh?

263
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,448
Yesterday was really cold.

264
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,251
And today, it's actually really hot.

265
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,182
So, I'm wearing sweaters
'cause you never know

266
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:29,092
what the weather is going to be.

267
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:30,841
I mean, you do if you look at the app

268
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,681
on your phone that says weather.

269
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:33,514
And it could tell you

270
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:34,817
what the temperature's gonna be (laughs).

271
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,896
Anyways, it is such a nice day.

272
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:37,729
It feels so good.

273
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:38,562
So, we're hanging out outside,

274
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:40,653
jumping on the furniture.

275
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:42,260
Playing with the puppy dogs.

276
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,141
We're gonna go walk down

277
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,198
and see the chickens in a minute.

278
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:47,681
But first, I thought I would let the boys

279
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,090
open up their little advent
calendars a little bit early.

280
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,756
We usually do it at night.
(Finn yells)

281
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:52,946
(chuckles) He's so excited.

282
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:55,658
But me and Bryan are actually
going on a little trip,

283
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,515
a little getaway together.

284
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:58,720
And so, I thought I
would hang out with them,

285
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,469
and do the advent calender
before I leave, okay?

286
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:02,302
- [Ollie] Yeah.

287
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:04,044
- [Missy] So, let's do it, okay?

288
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:04,922
- Yeah.

289
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:05,875
- [Missy] Yeah.

290
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,784
All right, we're gonna
open up this one first.

291
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,931
And I just noticed, you didn't
open up your 20 yesterday.

292
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,878
It was 20 days until Christmas yesterday.

293
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:15,369
And now, it's 19, so you
guys get to open up two.

294
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:18,492
Yay, all right, you wanna
open up the first one?

295
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:20,040
What is it, what is it?

296
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,280
What are you hoping for?

297
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,562
- I think I got the one that I wanted.

298
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:25,065
- [Missy] (gasps) Did you?

299
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:25,900
- [Ollie] No.

300
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,849
- [Missy] It looks like
just a little spaceship.

301
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,479
All right, Finn's gonna open up this one.

302
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,010
There you go, 19.

303
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,375
19 days until Christmas, Ollie.

304
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,875
Are you ready for Christmas?

305
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,710
- [Ollie] Yeah.

306
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,947
- [Missy] Here you go, bud.

307
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,364
Oh, another spaceship, wahoo!

308
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:44,205
(Finn babbles)

309
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,666
They're so cute, huh?
- Yeah.

310
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,309
- All right, go play.

311
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:51,374
Yay, advent calender's done (laughs).

312
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:53,289
Puppies are playing.

313
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,312
Gotta go check out our chickens, huh?

314
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:56,871
We're working down here to try

315
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:59,194
and get this all like leveled out.

316
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,112
We really wanna make this
like a cute little area.

317
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:02,375
Maybe a little garden,

318
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,065
maybe a place for the boys to play,

319
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,703
like a little play set or something.

320
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:07,015
And my chickens!

321
00:12:07,015 --> 00:12:08,832
How you doing, chickens?

322
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:09,929
How's leg going?

323
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,002
Leg, egg laying going, I kept saying leg.

324
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,400
How's the legging going?

325
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,614
Got three eggs, yay.

326
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:20,963
I'm getting about three a
day, that's exciting, guys.

327
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:22,790
It's always been really hit
or miss with my chickens.

328
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,219
Which is fine because you know,

329
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:25,154
we're just eating the eggs,

330
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,232
and it's not like a big deal.

331
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:28,865
But three a day is pretty awesome.

332
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:29,698
Thanks, girls.

333
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:30,531
How are you doing?

334
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:31,555
Are you happy chickens?

335
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:32,796
Happy chickens 'cause you don't have

336
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:34,780
any roosters ganging up on you, huh?

337
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,820
All right, well, you guys look good.

338
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,352
You're fed, see you later.

339
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:40,198
Bye, chickens.

340
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:42,014
Yeah, every time, guys.

341
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:45,161
(laughs) I have to lose at
least one egg every single day.

342
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,765
I'm am not exaggerating this.

343
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,827
I probably lose at least
one egg every single day

344
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:52,506
that I go and collect eggs.

345
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,843
I don't collect them every single day.

346
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:56,745
So, if I have six eggs,
I'm gonna lose one.

347
00:12:56,745 --> 00:12:58,834
I'll get them all the
way to the refrigerator,

348
00:12:58,834 --> 00:12:59,667
I'll open the fridge.

349
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:00,679
And just as I open the fridge,

350
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,605
one will drop onto the
floor, it's so annoying.

351
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,576
So, now we're gonna have
scrambled eggs out here.

352
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,671
'Cause actually the sun
is pretty warm today.

353
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,888
I was actually getting pretty toasty,

354
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:13,034
so that's gonna cook up nicely.

355
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:15,040
- All right, guys, did
