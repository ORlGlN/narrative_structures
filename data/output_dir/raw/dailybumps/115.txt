1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,548
- And we've got a camera here, okay?

2
00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:02,390
- [Bryan] Yeah.

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,456
- It's really cool.

4
00:00:03,456 --> 00:00:04,289
- [Bryan] Yes!

5
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:05,489
- We've got tons of fun footage.

6
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:09,572
(exciting electric guitar music)

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,118
- [Bryan] Aw, he's sad, 'kay?

8
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:15,038
(Ollie cries)

9
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:16,384
- Aww.

10
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,483
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

11
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,579
♫ This is who we are

12
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,996
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

13
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:25,336
♫ Shot among the stars

14
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:27,730
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

15
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,407
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

16
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:34,408
♫ (This is our life) Let's live it

17
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:36,568
♫ Live it forever

18
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:40,138
- [Bryan] Good morning, Daily Bumps fam!

19
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:43,563
This got a little crazy last night.

20
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:46,840
Missy designed the most
epic haunted maze ever

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,979
for our Halloween party
and it's all torn down now.

22
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,896
We've been tearing up the party!

23
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:53,483
Good morning, you guys!

24
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:55,066
We had so much fun.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,767
This is all of the tarp from it.

26
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:58,600
- A lot of tarp.

27
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,588
- [Bryan] So much cool stuff, too.

28
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:01,421
Check this out.

29
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,395
This is that tub of black Orbeez.

30
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:05,552
- We got this tub for
free from Craigslist.

31
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:06,618
- [Bryan] I know, isn't that amazing?

32
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:07,451
- It is cool.

33
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:08,284
My dad was like, oh, should we paint it?

34
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:11,128
I'm like, no, it looks so cool!

35
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:14,833
And people were so scared
to put their hands in this.

36
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:15,666
- [Bryan] I know.

37
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:16,898
- They didn't know what
it was because it's black.

38
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:19,909
Like, Orbeez aren't normally
black, so this was really cool.

39
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,058
- [Bryan] And then we had
a key attached to a string

40
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:24,209
so people had to grab
the key, unlock the box,

41
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,274
pull out the tape.

42
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:27,498
- There's was just like a
really cool girl in here

43
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:29,836
that was totally up to just sit in here.

44
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:31,861
- [Bryan] Yeah, I love your
new tattoo, babe, by the way.

45
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,185
- Oh, thank you!

46
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:34,986
No, if you haven't
watched Kelsey and Corbin,

47
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:37,038
I got a tattoo, we got matching tattoos.

48
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:38,947
- [Bryan] Kelsey and Missy
got matching tattoos.

49
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:40,455
- So, make sure you guys
go check out their vlog,

50
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,979
We'll have it linked up here
so you can go see it too.

51
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,556
- [Bryan] Look at this contraption.

52
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:46,911
- This is like my dad,
my dad's just a genius.

53
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:48,298
Anything that I'm like,
hey, can you do this?

54
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,186
He's like, yeah!

55
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:50,251
And then he does it.

56
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,932
So, he made a two-way mirror for us.

57
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:52,765
- [Bryan] Yup.

58
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:53,932
- And he made it himself.

59
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:55,640
- [Bryan] We bought a
two-way mirror off of Amazon

60
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,696
and he cut a hole in this whole thing.

61
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:58,776
We wall-papered it.

62
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:00,569
- Yeah, we wall-papered it.

63
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:01,402
- [Bryan] We set the scene, so we had

64
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:03,397
The Ring lady brushing her hair.

65
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,826
- The mom, brushing her hair.

66
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,159
- Brushing her hair in the mirror

67
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,705
and then the other person
had to go and do it.

68
00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:08,978
- And then we've got a camera here.

69
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:09,811
- [Bryan] Yeah.

70
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,644
- Which I think is really cool.

71
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:11,477
- [Bryan] Yes.

72
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:12,689
- We've got tons of fun footage.

73
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:13,522
- [Bryan] We had a camera here so,

74
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,462
we got a lot of people scared last night

75
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:18,104
once it switched from
mirror to see-through.

76
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:18,937
- Yeah.

77
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:20,456
- [Bryan] And the person
behind scared them,

78
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:21,318
it was so cool.

79
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:23,343
- It was really cool
and my dad rigged it so

80
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,876
she just flipped the switch
and like, her light went on.

81
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:27,859
- Yeah you push one button
and the lights switch.

82
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:29,111
I was like, that's genius.

83
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:29,944
- Yeah.

84
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:31,509
- So, what we're gonna do,
we have so many good scares

85
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:32,720
from last night at the Halloween party.

86
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,134
I didn't get a chance to
put them in that vlog,

87
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:37,857
so I'm gonna do all the fun
scare montages right here.

88
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,900
Enjoy, you guys.

89
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,067
(spooky guitar music)

90
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:45,140
- [Bryan] She's brushing her hair.

91
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,685
Just stand there and brush your hair,

92
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:48,002
that's all you have to do.

93
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,056
(screams)

94
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:50,639
- [Bryan] Whoa, yes!

95
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:54,589
(screams and laughs)

96
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:58,456
(screams)

97
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:04,052
(screams)

98
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:09,165
(screams)

99
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:12,331
(screams)

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,447
(screams)

101
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,637
(screams)

102
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:24,157
(screams)

103
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:26,013
(screams)

104
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:28,466
(screams)

105
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,633
(screams)

106
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:36,293
(screams)

107
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:37,409
(laughs)

108
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,776
- [Bryan] And then this was
a, like a hallway of bugs.

109
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:45,503
- So yeah, we, I spent a lot
of time putting these bugs up.

110
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:50,145
We stapled hair, bugs, and
then we sprayed it in here

111
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,458
with the most--

112
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,902
- [Bryan] Stinky stuff.

113
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:53,735
- You could smell.

114
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,535
Like, I smelled like it
all day I'm pretty sure.

115
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,443
- [Bryan] Yeah.

116
00:03:56,443 --> 00:03:57,276
(Bryan laughs)

117
00:03:57,276 --> 00:03:58,344
And then for the final scene we have

118
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:01,284
like, a little living room
set up with a guy in a chair.

119
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:04,637
- This, to me, was the, probably
the best part of the maze.

120
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:07,430
- [Bryan] Yeah, we had
Samara come out of the T.V.

121
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,753
And look, it's literally just a T.V.

122
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:12,399
We built this; Missy's dad built this.

123
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,372
- Yep, my dad built this.

124
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:15,515
- [Bryan] And then we picked,
like, the perfect foil.

125
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:16,617
- You can change the channel.

126
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:17,483
Change the channel!

127
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:18,316
- [Bryan] Yeah, I know, right.

128
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:20,853
We had strobe lights
going, it was really cool.

129
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:23,370
- It literally looked like
there was a T.V. and it was on

130
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,748
and then Samara climbed out.

131
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:26,628
- Samara climbed out of it.

132
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:27,533
It was really good.

133
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,911
It was like a production, you guys.

134
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,041
It was really fun to be able to do.

135
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,224
- I mean, I wish, vlogged me
and Kelsey going through this

136
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:37,075
because Kelsey's is
probably, her number one fear

137
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,138
is The Ring, like, for sure.

138
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:41,622
- It's like one of the scariest
movies from our generation.

139
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,316
- Her face, she almost started crying.

140
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,290
- [Bryan] Aww.

141
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,731
- She was so scared out of her mind.

142
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:48,251
I was like, oh, my gosh, calm down!

143
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,319
She's just a record.

144
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,360
(Bryan laughs)

145
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,970
- Yeah, that was definitely a good time.

146
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,820
We had so much fun with
our friends, our family.

147
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,474
Like, Missy, your whole family was here!

148
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:58,307
- Oh, yeah.

149
00:04:58,307 --> 00:04:59,309
- Like, that was so neat.

150
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,363
- Everyone dressed up
and really got into it.

151
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:01,586
- Everyone got into it and we have

152
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:04,246
some amazing photos
from the photobooth too.

153
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:07,413
(spooky guitar music)

154
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,746
- Okay, you guys.

155
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:26,529
So, we just got back from a adult spa trip

156
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,317
with all of our friends
and we had so much fun,

157
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,058
and the boys are back home!

158
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:31,764
- Ha, ha, ha.

159
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,134
- [Bryan] Hi, Finn, what are you singing?

160
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,294
Think he was singing
"This is Halloween," huh?

161
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,127
Yeah.

162
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,192
It's like kind of late in the evening but

163
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,843
I was craving cereal, so I poured myself

164
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:41,757
a big bowl of cereal
and I used all the milk.

165
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:42,590
I'm sorry.

166
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,423
We're all out of milk.

167
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,389
- That's alright, I know.

168
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,050
- [Bryan] And now Ollie's digging
in the Fruit Loops, right?

169
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,840
(Bryan laughs)

170
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,093
- Hey Ollie, did you have fun last night?

171
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:50,926
- Mmhmm.

172
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,251
- [Bryan] Tell them what you did!

173
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,948
- I watched a movie.

174
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:56,448
And I go to bed all on my own!

175
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,117
- [Bryan] At Mimi and Papa's, right?

176
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:02,240
- Yeah with Mimi and Papa.

177
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,461
- [Bryan] Well, that's so cool.

178
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:06,202
Finn and Ollie had a little sleepover

179
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:07,703
last night with Mimi and Papa.

180
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:08,844
How did they do?

181
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:10,108
(Missy laughs)

182
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,527
- We need a bigger bed.

183
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:12,360
(Mimi laughs)

184
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,740
- [Bryan] Oh, they need a bigger bed.

185
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,168
- We're gonna need a bigger bed.

186
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,476
- It was my dad and Ollie in one bed,

187
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:21,712
and they have a king bed
and it was too small.

188
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:24,449
And Finn and my mom in the other bed and

189
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,884
he was up all night, so.

190
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:28,725
- [Bryan] Aww, the kids had fun though.

191
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,396
- It was their very first sleepover, so.

192
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:31,397
- [Missy] Yeah.

193
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:32,421
- [Mimi] They were not ready.

194
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,262
- [Bryan] Finn's got a little bit more

195
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,095
time before he can do sleepovers.

196
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:35,641
Is he hogging all the cereal?

197
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,617
- [Missy] Ollie, let him have some.

198
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:39,450
- Yes!

199
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:42,263
- [Bryan] Dig in there!

200
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:44,417
Get your Fruit Loops!

201
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,530
(Bryan laughs)

202
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,514
Fruit Loops are the best snack ever, huh?

203
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:52,354
(Bryan laughs)

204
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,771
(calm music)

205
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:05,592
- Ollie's sad because
Mimi and Papa are leaving.

206
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,639
- Don't cry.

207
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,027
- He just loves them so much.

208
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,512
- [Bryan] Yeah.

209
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:12,802
- [Mimi] We had a fun time.

210
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:14,504
- Did you have so much fun with Papa?

211
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,998
- And yesterday when I made them dinner,

212
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,003
they ate all their dinner.

213
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,014
- [Bryan] What!

214
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:19,855
- And he finished first.

215
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,146
- You ate all your food?

216
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:21,979
- And then he got dessert.

217
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,292
What did you have for dessert?

218
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:25,200
(Ollie whines)

219
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,700
- Skeleton and a Halloween pumpkin cookie.

220
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,838
- [Bryan] Aww.

221
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,197
- And I was like, woo,
you ate all your dinner!

222
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:34,579
- Good job!

223
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,489
- Yeah, good job buddy.

224
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,078
- Well Mimi's gonna go home and then we're

225
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:40,319
probably gonna see her tomorrow, you know?

226
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,152
- [Bryan] Okay?

227
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:42,673
(Ollie cries)

228
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:43,604
- [Bryan] Aww.

229
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,187
Bye, Mimi and Papa!

230
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:49,442
(chill electronic music)

231
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:22,641
- [Bryan] This is probably one of

232
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:24,459
the cutest things I've every seen.

233
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,864
Luna, chillin' on Ollie's bed.

234
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:28,816
Mama's reading you guys a bed time story?

235
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,689
- My daddy's so special.

236
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,765
Is daddy special?

237
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:34,589
- [Bryan] Aww, thanks, dude.

238
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,860
- I tell him each day.

239
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,710
- [Bryan] I love your pajamas.

240
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,741
- Just how much I love him in every way.

241
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,058
Do you tell daddy you love him every day?

242
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:43,393
- Mmhmm.

243
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:44,553
I love you, da-da.

244
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:45,386
- I love you buddy.

245
00:08:45,386 --> 00:08:47,386
(kiss sounds)

246
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:49,004
I love both of my boys.

247
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:50,494
- Kids are in bed!

248
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:53,157
I think Finn is actually
still crying a little bit,

249
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,566
but hopefully not for long,
he's very, very tired.

250
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:59,038
It has been such a long weekend!

251
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,512
My house is still completely torn apart.

252
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,572
Things are, like, still totally a mess.

253
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:06,088
But, I just have to
say, I had such a blast

254
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,247
at the Halloween party.

255
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,568
I think it turned out so great,

256
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:11,319
but I also am so happy that it's over.

257
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:14,135
I'm so tired, I'm just so, like I've been

258
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:16,381
running like crazy and so stressed

259
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:20,367
and so it's just nice to
like, ahhh, okay, I'm done!

260
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:24,183
I don't have anymore, things
I need to work on or do.

261
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:25,496
We still have Halloween coming up,

262
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,278
so we're excited about
that but it's pretty chill.

263
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:29,377
I did, however, want to show you guys.

264
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:32,049
We didn't really vlog much on my birthday

265
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,686
but I had a super special day.

266
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:36,933
The boys and Bryan just
were so good to me.

267
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,752
I got a couple little gifts.

268
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,942
We went to a really fun family dinner.

269
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:43,068
But I wanted to show you
this really special gift

270
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:44,806
that Bryan got me.

271
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:48,389
So, he got me this
beautiful Tiffany locket

272
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:51,876
with an M on it, which I love.

273
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,002
And let me open it up.

274
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:58,150
So this is the locket
and this is the inside.

275
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,140
It's basically, just, it opens up

276
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,463
and there's just two
little spots for pictures.

277
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,051
And I love it.

278
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,904
I think this is something
that is so special.

279
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:09,538
And something that I can
totally pass down to like,

280
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,664
my daughter, or my daughter-in-law,

281
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:14,431
if I don't have any daughters.

282
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,924
But, I just think this is so cool,

283
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:18,713
such a timeless gift that Bryan got me.

284
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:20,248
And so I'm like, I really love it.

285
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:21,411
It's super special.

286
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,229
Yeah, I'm just really thankful for that!

287
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:27,003
The boys did get me a Switch as well

288
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:30,600
and I have been obsessing over
the new Mario Odyssey game.

289
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,433
So good.

290
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:33,374
Let me know if you guys are playing that.

291
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:34,609
But, I did wanna as you guys,

292
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:38,633
what pictures do you think that
I should put in the locket?

293
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,253
I've been trying to decide.

294
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:41,656
Should I put like, a family photo?

295
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:42,739
But it's really tiny.

296
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:44,671
So I'm like, that might be too many faces.

297
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:47,058
Should I do like, Bryan and the boys?

298
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,504
Or, the animals?

299
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:49,337
I don't know.

300
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:51,090
Give me some ideas down in the comments.

301
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,776
Let me know what I
should put in my locket.

302
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:55,015
But, yeah, I'm just super excited.

303
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:56,309
I can even put, like, my grandparents.

304
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:57,824
Oh, that would be so cute, too.

305
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,666
I don't know what I'm
going to put in there.

306
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,017
But, anyways, it is time to relax.

307
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:04,356
I get to watch shows and just chill.

308
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,647
Bryan's making me a delicious
dinner, so excited for that.

309
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:09,407
But anyways, make sure you
give this video a big thumbs up

310
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,438
if you enjoyed it and we'll
see you guys tomorrow!

311
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,271
Bye-eeee!

312
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:15,017
Boop.

313
00:11:16,543 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
