1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:02,193
- And then the next thing I remember,

2
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:05,347
Missy holding me, and Missy asking me,

3
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:06,361
"Do you know what happened?"

4
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,677
Like, "Do you know what happened?"

5
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:10,078
(ambulance sirens wailing)

6
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:10,911

00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,583
- Good morning!

17
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:34,421
We are at school today!

18
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,588
Do you know what letter
you're learning today?

19
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:38,421
- No.

20
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:39,823
- [Missy] I told you earlier, what was it?

21
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:41,081
- I don't remember!

22
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:42,533
- Oh, it's the letter "Q".

23
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,366
- "Q"

24
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,866
- Like, "Quick!"

25
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,061
And "Quack!"

26
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:46,981
(laughs)

27
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,417
Not very many words that start with a "Q".

28
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:49,250
- Quacker?

29
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,083
- Quacker.

30
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:50,916
(laughs)

31
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:51,749
That's a "C"

32
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:52,582
"Cracker!"

33
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:53,738
It is very confusing.

34
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:55,971
Anyways, we are off to school

35
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:57,578
and I've got some errands to run today,

36
00:00:57,578 --> 00:00:58,503
so I'm gonna drop him off.

37
00:00:58,503 --> 00:00:59,739
I did not do my hair today.

38
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:00,572
(groans)

39
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:01,405
It's a mess.

40
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:03,262
We're going to hurry up and get to school

41
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:04,328
and then Mama's off!

42
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:05,161
Kay?

43
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:06,004
- Okay.

44
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:06,837
- [Missy] Let's go!

45
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:07,754
Alright, have a good day, 'kay?

46
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:08,587
- 'Kay.

47
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:09,420
- [Missy] I love you.

48
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,253
- I love you too.

49
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,304
- [Missy] Go play!

50
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,644
So I am headed in to the big horse store

51
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:15,830
to grab a few things.

52
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,980
He just needs some probiotics
that the vet was talking about

53
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,583
I don't know. It's always
fun to look around.

54
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,201
And then I need some
breakfast. I need to eat!

55
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:25,070
I'm so hungry.

56
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,891
So I have been looking
at all of these pads,

57
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:30,460
because Nacho has such high withers that

58
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,217
I was kinda thinking
about getting a pad with

59
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,077
wither relief. But, I
think I'm gonna wait.

60
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:36,664
Today, he actually has a massage.

61
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:39,181
I'm wondering if maybe it's
not so much that he has

62
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,550
the problem with the withers

63
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,453
but maybe just another Oz Fox.

64
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,657
He's just very uncomfortable
with my Western saddle,

65
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,200
so hopefully we can get
that figured out today.

66
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,586
But I did get my probiotics!

67
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:51,905
And I got Bryan some gloves
because it's been so cold,

68
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:55,023
and I want him to come up
there and do stuff with Nacho,

69
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:58,345
but it's just so cold, and
I'm the only one with gloves.

70
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:00,673
Alright, we're ready to head off.

71
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:04,173
(upbeat electronic music)

72
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:09,908
- (babbling)

73
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:12,554
- [Bryan] Good morning,
Finn! What are you doing?

74
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:13,568
- I'm playing!

75
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:16,563
- [Bryan] Did you build
that giant, tall, tower?

76
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:17,396
- Yeah!

77
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:18,827
- [Bryan] That's amazing, dude!

78
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:20,269
Good morning, guys!

79
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:22,263
Finn is chillin' in my
office this morning.

80
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:25,133
I'm gonna admit, I probably
have kicked the boys

81
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:27,862
out of my office a couple
times, when I'm trying to work.

82
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:28,800
But on chill days,

83
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,644
when I'm just checking
and answering emails,

84
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:32,716
I love when Finn can come into my office

85
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:35,121
and grab toys, and play at my desk.

86
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,258
It's so cool!

87
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:37,875
Look at this cool tower, dude!

88
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:38,708
- (babbles)

89
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,838
- [Bryan] Yeah!

90
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:40,671
- Watch this!

91
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:41,504
- Okay

92
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:43,932
That means "Watch this."

93
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:44,765
Whoa!

94
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,598
(crashes)

95
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,435
(laughing)

96
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:47,360
- Wow!

97
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,590
- [Bryan] It fell down here!

98
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,253
He tried to crack it on the table,

99
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,818
That didn't really work out, did it buddy?

100
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:53,651
- [Finn] Yeah.

101
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:56,914
- So, if you guys follow
me on social media,

102
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:59,260
you probably saw a post a while ago

103
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,954
about an incident we had at the house.

104
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:05,016
It was something that we're
still trying to figure out.

105
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,014
It was something that-

106
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:06,847
(crashes)

107
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:08,394
we don't really have all
the answers, but I think,

108
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:10,580
now, we're at a point
where we could probably

109
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,026
share some of that with you.

110
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,977
It was a really scary
thing that happened to us,

111
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,097
and to me, and Missy.

112
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:16,803
And I will never forget it.

113
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:17,636
(crashes)

114
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,264
And we still have lot to figure out,

115
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:21,571
but today I think it
going to be a good day

116
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:23,653
for Missy and I to share
that with you guys.

117
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,284
So, she's out running errands,

118
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:27,406
and I'm just hanging out doing
some work with the kiddo,

119
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,647
then we'll probably be able
to talk about it a little bit

120
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:30,528
in this vlog.

121
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:33,353
Finn, you need to learn
not to throw your Legos.

122
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:34,634
(laughs)

123
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:36,487
They're all scattered everywhere.

124
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,900
Look at his concentration,
though, when he combines these.

125
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,733
So funny.

126
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:44,096
Good job, dude!

127
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:49,473
- So I am back from my
horse getting a massage.

128
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:52,599
Bryan's actually doing some
song-writing and stuff.

129
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,432
(piano playing)

130
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:56,571
Finn is wearing Ollie's shirt.

131
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,913
And I wanted to give you
a a quick update on Nacho.

132
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:03,294
He definitely had some
areas that were painful,

133
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:05,119
so she worked through some of those,

134
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,318
and it's just good to know,

135
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,093
I don't think it's my saddle,
so that's good to know.

136
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,543
He is just a little
bit sore in some areas,

137
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,480
and hopefully that really helps,

138
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,442
and I know I definitely need
to get his teeth done next.

139
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:17,748
Alright, we're gonna go get Ollie.

140
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:18,884
You ready to go get Ollie?

141
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,716
- Yeah!

142
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,773
- [Missy] You're gonna wear his shirt?

143
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:21,607
- Yeah!

144
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,862
- [Missy] 'Kay, let's go!

145
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:24,812
Hi bud!

146
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,212
(soft guitar music)

147
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:29,462
(babbling)

148
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,976
Finn really wanted Ollie to
take him down the slide, so-

149
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:37,692
Did you show him your play set?

150
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,316
Whee!

151
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,633
Is that so fun?

152
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:42,133
Wow, look at that!

153
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:44,703
Aren't these fun?

154
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,633
Maybe next year you'll
be able to ride these.

155
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,072
- I ride a bike, and it was hard.

156
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,354
- [Missy] Oh, was it hard?

157
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,187
- Yeah.

158
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:54,339
- We are home now, and I
thought that we should finally

159
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:56,509
give the story of something
that happened to Bryan

160
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:57,409
the other day.

161
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,513
He tweeted about it, so a lot
of people have been asking

162
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,153
about what's going on.

163
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:04,838
So I'm gonna let Bryan
explain what happened,

164
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,839
and his experience, and
then I'll explain mine.

165
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,234
But what happened?

166
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,081
- So I woke up early in the morning

167
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:14,362
and I remember having to go
to the bathroom, very badly.

168
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:18,183
So, I woke up, I sprang out of
bed, I went to the bathroom,

169
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:20,163
and as I was going to the bathroom,

170
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:22,606
I started to get very light-headed.

171
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:26,275
And then things started
to blur a little bit.

172
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,103
And then I remember thinking,

173
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,464
"I think I'm gonna fall."

174
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:32,033
And then the next thing
I remember are, like,

175
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:36,913
these scattered memories
with divisions in-between

176
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:39,155
of, like, Missy holding me,

177
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:40,647
and Missy asking me,

178
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:43,176
"Do you know what happened?
Do you know what happened?"

179
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,746
I think, at that point,
I was going in and out

180
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:45,870
of consciousness.

181
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,683
The next thing I remember,
I was laying on the floor

182
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,985
Missy was over me and
she wanted to call 911,

183
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,156
and I was so confused as to
why she wanted to call 911

184
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:58,112
'cause, to me, nothing bad had happened.

185
00:05:58,112 --> 00:05:59,705
I felt like maybe I tripped, or something.

186
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:00,877
- Fell, or something. Yeah.

187
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,959
- Yeah, so she calls 911,
they were there pretty quick.

188
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,792
(laughs)

189
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:08,355
Before I knew it, I had a
ton of people around me,

190
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:09,479
asking me questions,

191
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,117
and there's equipment that
they're attaching to me,

192
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:13,875
and it was all-

193
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,623
it kinda felt like I
was dreaming, in a way.

194
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,160
It was not fun.

195
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,090
(laughs)

196
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,923
For sure.

197
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:23,623
I was very cold, and shaking,
they had to put blankets on me

198
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:25,190
- Probably a lot of anxiety.

199
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,822
- I definitely had a lot of anxiety,

200
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:29,095
'cause more and more people
just kept coming into my bedroom

201
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,075
and I'm like,

202
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:31,736
I'm not even sure what
I'm wearing at this point.

203
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:32,961
(laughs)

204
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:35,097
But yeah, it was nerve-racking.

205
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:37,688
And I think Missy should
give her side of the story.

206
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,586
- Yeah, I can kinda fill in a
lot of the holes, basically,

207
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:41,709
of what he's talking about.

208
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,002
It was very early in the morning

209
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,474
and I was up with Finn, 'cause
he woke up at, like, 6 AM

210
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:49,121
And Karma needed let out so I said,

211
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:50,582
"Bryan, go let Karma out!"

212
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,067
So he gets up, let's Karma
out, he goes to the bathroom,

213
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,147
and, oh my gosh, he was peeing forever!

214
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:55,980
(laughs)

215
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,772
I swear, like, a minute straight.

216
00:06:57,772 --> 00:06:59,303
I was just sitting with
Finn, and all of a sudden,

217
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:02,776
I look up and he starts
falling straight back.

218
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:05,585
And I'm like, "Oh my gosh,
Bryan, are you okay?"

219
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:09,474
And I look at him, and he's
actually, like, seizing.

220
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:12,174
What it looks like is
like shaking, seizing,

221
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:14,223
like, moving, twitching like crazy.

222
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:16,312
And I jump out of bed,
and I run over to him,

223
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,345
and I grab him.

224
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,851
And I'm like, "Bryan! Bryan!"

225
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:21,562
And I'm trying to fumble with
my phone, 'cause I don't know

226
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:23,250
when, exactly, he's gonna wake up.

227
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,071
And he sort of wakes up at that
moment, and he looks at me,

228
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,592
and he's like, "Wait what?"

229
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:29,494
I think he thinks, at that moment,

230
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:31,129
that he sleptwalked, maybe.

231
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,941
And I was like, "Bryan, do
you know what happened?"

232
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:34,815
"Do you know what happened?"

233
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:39,746
And he sits up, and then
he flies backwards again,

234
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:41,438
and he starts seizing again.

235
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:44,706
And, I mean, it was like
eyes open, twitching.

236
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:46,760
It was really scary looking.

237
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,910
To me, I was like,

238
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,383
"Oh my god, he's having
seizures right now."

239
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,408
He basically, at this point,
had hit his head twice

240
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,201
pretty hard, flying backwards.

241
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,158
- My head did hurt.

242
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,114
- Yeah. And so, once he
woke up from that one

243
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:02,453
I was like, "Don't get up! Don't get up!"

244
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:05,191
And I kinda dragged his head
over to where the carpet was

245
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:06,842
just in case it happened again.

246
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:09,297
And he was struggling
to get up and I said,

247
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,081
"Don't get up! Don't get up!"

248
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,958
And, at this point, he
still is very confused

249
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,203
on what's going on.

250
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,768
I don't think he's totally
there at this point.

251
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:17,447
And I'm like, "I'm calling 911."

252
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:19,948
And so I call 911, and I
tell them what happened,

253
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,664
and they say, "Don't let him
get up. He needs to lay there."

254
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:24,930
And so, they're like, "We'll
have someone there right away."

255
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,286
And he starts shaking
like crazy, and he's cold.

256
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:31,505
And so I start throwing
tons of blankets on him.

257
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:34,722
And, at this point, I'm
crying and I'm calling my mom,

258
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,953
and I'm like, "Someone come up here!"

259
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:38,995
Ollie's still in bed so I
didn't want him to see anything,

260
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:43,174
and I sent Finn into the
room to go relax on the bed

261
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,727
until my mom gets there.

262
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:48,145
Paramedics get there,
and after hooking him up,

263
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:50,576
his blood pressure, at
this point, was good.

264
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:53,741
He, at this point, was all there.

265
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,661
'Cause, for a while, he
wasn't talking normal,

266
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,654
he was kinda like, "No,
don't call 911. I just fell."

267
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:03,129
He doesn't know at all what's going on.

268
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:06,288
And so, after they really looked him over,

269
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:10,541
they said that he just
fainted, or passed out.

270
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:14,087
We're pretty sure it
because either he stood up

271
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,952
or, there's even this thing called a,

272
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:16,797
I forget the word.

273
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:19,395
But basically you put a
lot of pressure on your bum

274
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,376
'cause he was peeing for so long,

275
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:23,438
it can drop your blood pressure.

276
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,398
And when you faint from
your blood pressure

277
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,672
dropping so quickly

278
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:30,187
you have what looks like
seizure-type characteristics

279
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,252
of fainting.

280
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,085
- Yeah.

281
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,460
- So, he didn't have a seizure.

282
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,979
- I don't think I had a seizure.

283
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,409
I definitely think I fainted.

284
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,639
I felt really light-headed
the rest of the day,

285
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,259
every time I stood up,
so I kinda could feel it.

286
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:44,585
And, I don't know, we have
a doctor's appointment

287
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,410
so I think they're gonna
check my brain and see

288
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,742
what's going on in there.

289
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:51,199
- Brain, heart.

290
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,611
- Yeah, I feel pretty
confident that I fainted,

291
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:56,338
the paramedics felt very
confident that I fainted,

292
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:59,095
it's not an uncommon thing.

293
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:01,909
We weren't too worried,
they had an ambulance ready

294
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,194
to come pick me up,

295
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:05,275
but I don't think there was any use.

296
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:08,256
They said, "if you really wanted
confirmation, we could go."

297
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,725
But we have a doctor's
appointment set for later.

298
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,161
- I will say that I think
I'm a little more traumatized

299
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:14,810
about what happened than he is.

300
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,629
He doesn't really remember.

301
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,027
But it was very, very, scary.

302
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:19,871
- Yeah, it was scary.

303
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,546
- I think Bryan has a lot of anxiety now

304
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:22,747
about going to the bathroom.

305
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,008
- Yeah, I definitely am
watching myself a little closer

306
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,897
- And I'm walking behind him with pillows.

307
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:29,159
(laughs)

308
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,654
- Hopefully we get some answers soon.

309
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:31,837
- Yeah.

310
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:33,889
- But seriously, you guys do
not have to worry about me.

311
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:36,112
I feel like I am completely fine,

312
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:37,772
we're gonna get everything
figured out eventually.

313
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:39,367
So, just wanted to let you guys know that,

314
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:42,136
to ease your minds a
little bit. Bryan is okay.

315
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:44,362
- And I'm just so glad he's okay!

316
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:47,208
- I'm not going anywhere yet, people!

317
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,729
I gotta lot more to do.

318
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:51,856
But anyway, I think we're
gonna end the vlog with that.

319
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:54,435
Thank you guys for
watching, big thumbs up.

320
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:55,268
(ding)

321
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:59,067
- Big thumbs up for Bryan being okay.

322
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,418
- Thanks again, guys. And we'll
see you in our next video.

323
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:02,347
Bye!

324
00:11:02,347 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
