00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:01,248
- Ahhh.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,767
- [Dad] Oh so there's zombies?

3
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:08,290
(kids screaming)

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,197
Oh no, Finn, she got you.

00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,421
- [All Together] Good morning

17
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:34,838
and happy Easter.

18
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:39,000
- Yay, it's Easter morning, huh?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,760
Yes it is Easter morning
and as you can tell

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,593
I've got mine...

21
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:44,650
I've got barn hair and
I don't care hat on.

22
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,483
Which means you're headed to the barn

23
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:48,370
but first I think the
Easter Bunny came, huh?

24
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,203
- Yeah.

25
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:50,517
- So we are looking for...

26
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,356
- We gotta them Easter baskets?

27
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:52,189
- [Missy] Good morning.

28
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,669
- Good morning, daddy.

29
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:55,502
- Good morning.

30
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:56,557
- Happy Easter.

31
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,491
- Happy Easter.

32
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,574
Happy Easter.

33
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,480
(kid screaming)

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,433
- Wait guys, do you wanna see this?

35
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,273
- Is it like a hat?

36
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:08,263
Oh my gosh, it is like a hat.

37
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:09,570
It's like one of those hats

38
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,970
from the guards in London, Ollie.

39
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,756
- We gotta find our Easter Bunny basket.

40
00:01:13,756 --> 00:01:15,680
So...

41
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,910
We gotta start looking in
all the good hiding places

42
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,800
in the house, where do we like to hide?

43
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,310
Alright, we are on a mission
to go find our Easter basket.

44
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,940
And I thought I saw something this morning

45
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,851
when I was cold.

46
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:29,285
- [Bryan] Whoa!

47
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:30,957
- [Missy] Oh my goodness!

48
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,414
- [Bryan] What's this?

49
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:34,164
- Candy and coloring.

50
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,080
- That's so cool it's a
Crayola Easter basket.

51
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,569
- [Missy] That is so neat.

52
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,870
- There you go, Ollie,
that one's yours, buddy.

53
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,210
Alright Finny, now you gotta
try to find your, okay?

54
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,680
- [Missy] Um yeah, so Finn?

55
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,310
I was changing a diaper this morning

56
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,973
and I thought I saw a
little peek of something?

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,658
- [Bryan] Where do we
change your diaper at, Finn?

58
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,657
- [Missy] Is it in there?

59
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:55,490
- No.

60
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,026
- [Missy] What is it?

61
00:01:58,026 --> 00:01:59,859
Whoa!
- That's awesome!

62
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:02,461
- This is huge.

63
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,383
Look at this is almost
as big as you are, Finn.

64
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:07,280
- [Missy] Is that so neat?

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,264
- That's crazy.

66
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:11,350
- [Missy] Well that's so
nice of the Easter Bunny.

67
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,490
- He's got Peeps.

68
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,100
I'm sure he'll share those with you, okay?

69
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,810
- [Missy] I think both of
you can share together.

70
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,880
- And cotton candy and sand toys.

71
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,724
- Like we can go to the
beach and we can play.

72
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:25,640
- Yeah!
- Yay!

73
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,170
- Happy Easter boys.

74
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,003
I know.

75
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,763
- So fun.

76
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,391
Easter is such a fun little...

77
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,224
- They are so in to this.

78
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:33,300
- I know.

79
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,050
Alright guys, we are actually heading out

80
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,370
so we're gonna come
back and play with these

81
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,216
in a little bit, okay?

82
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:39,352
- No.

83
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:40,185
- [Missy] He's like, I'm
taking this with me, mom.

84
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:41,018
Um...

85
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,370
When did you get so smart
at buckling yourself in?

86
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,120
This is crazy.

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,590
Oh my gosh.

88
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,447
You did it.

89
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,589
You just buckled yourself
in all by yourself.

90
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,910
I'm so proud of you.

91
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,220
Oh my gosh.

92
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,407
It is so crazy to have
a little kid of mine

93
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:02,980
buckling himself in to the car seat.

94
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,507
You're basically like a grown man now.

95
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:08,000
Alright so like I said, it is Easter

96
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,339
and me and Bryan are
going on a trail ride.

97
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:11,172
- Doing a little Easter trail.

98
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:13,427
- [Missy] And we're with
Maria, who's on Asher.

99
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,445
And Travis is on Rusty.

100
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,340
And yeah, this is so nice.

101
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,173
- This is insane.

102
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,464
This is like a grass field
we're going through right now.

103
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:22,470
- Yeah, and this is so fun.

104
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,700
I love going on trail rides

105
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,864
and it's so fun to be
able to do it with Bryan.

106
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:28,800
And it's nice because me
and him went on a trail ride

107
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,839
the other day and it was pretty stressful.

108
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:33,760
And now we've got the
support of our friends

109
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
who are a little more experienced.

110
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,910
Yeah, we're in a really
cool little field area.

111
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,100
I just love this area in town.

112
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,620
We can just ride wherever
and there's so much scenery

113
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,571
and pretty stuff.

114
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:47,550
And we're gonna run now, okay bye.

115
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,481
Alright so Bryan's horse Salty has decided

116
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,530
he doesn't wanna go any further.

117
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,759
- Turned into a pony now.

118
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,543
(laughing)

119
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:56,528
- [Missy] He's just a little stubborn.

120
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,670
(laughing)

121
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,772
- [Travis] Looking good Bryan.

122
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,170
(laughing)

123
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,621
- [Bryan] Made it to a water bowl.

124
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:06,255
Look at him sucking down water.

125
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:09,391
Is that good, Nacho?

126
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:12,058
(playful music)

127
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,920
We're having some Easter cookies and wine

128
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,809
out here on the trail with our horses.

129
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,195
- She's being so good, he just sits here.

130
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,067
- [Maria] I think he
wants to try the wine.

131
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,038
- [Bryan] Yeah.

132
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:39,871
- Would you stop.

133
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:42,661
- [Bryan] Rusty keep
knocking over the bottle.

134
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:45,191
Does Asher like the cookies?

135
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:46,274
- I think so.

136
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,990
- [Bryan] Hey, hey, those are ours.

137
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,290
- If you're gonna be my horse

138
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,390
you have to like my cookies.

139
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,480
- [Bryan] Yeah you gotta try
momma's chocolate chip cookies.

140
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,630
- He doesn't really
like any kind of bread.

141
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:03,383
- He doesn't like it.

142
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:06,639
- [Travis] Rusty does, he's
like oh yeah, those are good.

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,995
- It's so funny.

144
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:11,122
He's a picky eater just like you, babe.

145
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:11,991
- [Travis] Look at this two.

146
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:12,991
(laughing)

147
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:13,824
Are you kidding me.

148
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:14,870
- He's like no, here you go.

149
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,941
- Alright, I'm gonna try to get my horse,

150
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,441
you wanna try Missy's cookies?

151
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,140
Oh yeah.

152
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,531
- [Missy] Oh good.

153
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,667
Okay.

154
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,067
(laughing)

155
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,555
So I think we got two, oh they're hugging.

156
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:28,740
(laughing)

157
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,704
I think did Asher liked the cookies?

158
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:31,537
- No.

159
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:32,654
- [Missy] No, okay.

160
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:33,487
So we got two out of four.

161
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:34,460
You don't like my cookies.

162
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,293
That's okay.

163
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,220
He really liked it.

164
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,600
Alright we are now at a little
get together with the family.

165
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,610
Jessica's house.

166
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,389
And the Easter Bunny
just came to the house.

167
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,222
Whoa!

168
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,083
We're gonna go get the kids

169
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,295
because the Easter Bunny was just here

170
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:49,500
and he dropped off all these eggs,

171
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,840
and now the kids gotta
go collect all the eggs

172
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,220
so that mommy can eat all the candy.

173
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,481
CJ, Bailey, Ollie?

174
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:55,314
You guys.

175
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,300
You're never gonna guess.

176
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,453
- Guess who just got here?

177
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:02,860
I'm excited.

178
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,080
They don't know what's going on.

179
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,679
- [Missy] Come on you guys.

180
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,056
Come on, come on, come on.

181
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,465
Guess who's here?

182
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:09,298

Come alive.

And they got to play with
