1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,430
- [Missy] Ollie is about
to try rock climbing.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,904
Think you can get up to the top Ollie?

3
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:05,737
- Yeah.

4
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:06,570
- [Missy] Yeah?

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,939
♪ Fine, take this hand
and watch us shine ♪

6
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:11,005
♪ This is our life ♪

7
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,012
♪ Let's live it ♪

8
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:18,012
♪ Live it forever ♪

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,510
- Good morning guys!

10
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,300
Today, we are taking the
kids to Uptown Jungle.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,300
It's like this amazing indoor fun park.

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,510
We are on a mission to tire them out.

13
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,270
Let's go inside.

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,650
This place is huge.

15
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,930
So cool.

16
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,674
There you go dude.

17
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:35,537
Whoa, you can keep climbing up.

18
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:38,120
(upbeat music)

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,970
Finn was already exhausted

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,800
because he did not get a nap today.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,080
So after this, I think he is

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,913
definitely gonna be tired, right?

23
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:12,005
- Oh my god, he's so tired now, he's like.

24
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,189
(Bryan laughs)

25
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,174
- [Bryan] What do you think of this place?

26
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,870
- I'm gonna go up this side.

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,703
- Okay.

28
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,783
I just did a ten minute
massage in one of these things.

29
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,462
It was amazing!

30
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:23,045
(upbeat music)

31
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,750
- All right boys, we are exploring

32
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,470
the top half of this urban jungle

33
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,480
and I gotta say this is really cool.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,472
Go Finn, go!

35
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:52,305
Go Finn, go!

36
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:53,776
Go Finn, go!

37
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,090
Woo!

38
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,060
All right, Finn is on a
wrecking ball right now.

39
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,893
You ready?

40
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:58,726
- [Finn] Yeah!

41
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:00,638
- [Missy] Woo!

42
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:02,078
Was that fun?

43
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:02,911
- Yeah.

44
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:04,006
- [Missy] Again?

45
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:04,839
Woo!

46
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,740
Oh gosh.

47
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,370
It's a rolling log.

48
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,830
It's a rolling log.

49
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,940
Don't roll it Ollie.

50
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,660
Don't roll it Ollie.

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,270
Ollie, can you walk on that?

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,590
- [Ollie] Yeah.

53
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,423
- [Missy] Do it.

54
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:25,158
Whoa.

55
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:27,931
You're doing it.

56
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,514
(upbeat music)

57
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,650
Check this out.

58
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:50,520
What?

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,690
It's a giant obstacle course.

60
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,483
Go, go, go!

61
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:57,310
You did it in like one second!

62
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,373
- [Bryan] Awesome.

63
00:02:58,373 --> 00:02:59,230
- [Missy] Woo!

64
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,460
Oh, looks like they're racing now.

65
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,370
Go Finnie, go!

66
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,203
Go Finnie, go!

67
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,260
Oh look it, you're winning.

68
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,759
You're winning.

69
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,176
Finn, where are you?

70
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:10,384
There he is, there he is.

71
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:12,095
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

72
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:12,928
Get in there!

73
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:13,761
- [Finn] Hi there.

74
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,594
- [Missy] Hi!

75
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,677
He's so cute.

76
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,562
Woo!

77
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:18,800
Go, go, go!

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,633
Woo!

79
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:22,488
Yay, you did it!

80
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:23,567
High five.

81
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,150
(upbeat music)

82
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,290
Ollie is about to try rock climbing.

83
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,898
You think you can get up to the top Ollie?

84
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:43,731
- Yeah.

85
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:44,877
- [Missy] Yeah?

86
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:47,460
(upbeat music)

87
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,039
- [Bryan] You can use the
other side too, 'kay buddy?

88
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,622
(upbeat music)

89
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,330
He's going on this one now.

90
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:10,591
Whoa.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,060
He definitely loves climbing.

92
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,966
He's gotten lots of practice
with Finn in the backyard.

93
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,887
- [Missy] Go Ollie, go!

94
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,899
- [Bryan] You got it dude!

95
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,732
Woo!

96
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,622
That's an interesting way.

97
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:25,646
- [Missy] Step up, there you go.

98
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,563
- [Bryan] There you go.

99
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,690
Nice.

100
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,532
He's gotten good at that.

101
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:37,420
- [Missy] That one's a little harder, huh?

102
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,070
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh, it's crazy.

103
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,373
Look at him go.

104
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:41,446
- [Missy] Good job, bud.

105
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,029
(upbeat music)

106
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,010
- [Bryan] Ollie, now Finn's gonna do it.

107
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,910
You inspired him 'cause you did so good.

108
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,800
- I wanna do that.

109
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,710
- [Bryan] Oh, that's cool.

110
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,240
Finn, are you excited?

111
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,930
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

112
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,030
You wanna do that one?

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,450
Missy, is our two year old
seriously about to do this?

114
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,710
- He's gonna do it.

115
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,490
I bet he can get to the top.
- You can do it Finn!

116
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,594
- [Missy] Go Finn, go.

117
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:17,860
- [Bryan] Oh, (laughs) he can't reach.

118
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,693
Oh there you go.

119
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,290
Woo!

120
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,790
Wow!

121
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,530
Look at that muscle (laughs).

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,193
Woo hoo.

123
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,124
There you go.

124
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:29,957
Push.

125
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,291
Oh, nice.

126
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:36,004
That looked like fun, huh?

127
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,180
- Yeah, good job dude.

128
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,938
- [Bryan] All right, he's
going for this one now.

129
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:42,450
- [Missy] He is so little.

130
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,283
- [Bryan] I know.

131
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:45,030
He's like really trying to make it work.

132
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,960
There you go.

133
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,752
Maybe you should start on the
left cause it's the lowest.

134
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,335
(upbeat music)

135
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:03,288
Go Finn!

136
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,661
Ollie, you know you have the
coolest little brother ever?

137
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:13,607
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

138
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,290
He's so cool, he's
always up for adventure.

139
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,280
Finn look at this giant piano.

140
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,927
That's pretty cool.

141
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,510
(upbeat music)

142
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,120
- I turned it on dad.

143
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,953
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

144
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:38,180
You push the button and it goes?

145
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,371
- Dad, you can also spin on the ground.

146
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:42,740
- [Bryan] Oh, really, you wanna spin?

147
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,573
- Yeah.

148
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:45,000
- [Bryan] All right, sit down.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,833
There you go.

150
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,707
Finn, you want to spin with your brother?

151
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,050
- Yeah!
- Come here, hurry!

152
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,883
Come on in.

153
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,427
This is like the Teacups
ride at Disneyland, huh?

154
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:52,260
- Yeah.

155
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,347
- [Bryan] All right, you ready?

156
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,180
And, go!

157
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:01,435
- Excuse me, okay, that's enough.

158
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:04,772
- [Bryan] (laughs) Was that fun boys?

159
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:05,764
- Yeah.

160
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:06,597
- Whoa.

161
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,140
- [Bryan] Oh no, we got a momfalo.

162
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,457
(Bryan laughs)

163
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:21,290
- [Missy] Am I scary?

164
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,123
I'm just kidding.

165
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,790
- [Bryan] He's like yeah,
that's actually a little scary.

166
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,290
(peppy music)

167
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,787
- That's my cookie.

168
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:43,770
- [Bryan] Your what, oh, your cookie?

169
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,603
- Yeah.

170
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:45,436
- [Bryan] Is that your cookie?

171
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:46,269
- Yeah.

172
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,379
- [Bryan] I think that's
my cookie actually.

173
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,712
- No, my cookie.

174
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,034
- [Bryan] No, I think it's my cookie.

175
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,367
- No, my cookie.

176
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,900
- Such a stinker.
- I know.

177
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,570
All right, the boys are all ready for bed

178
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,000
and I thought since you guys got so much

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,570
physical energy today.

180
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,530
You got all your energy out.

181
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,720
Why don't we get some
energy out in your brains

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,251
and do a little matching game?

183
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,950
- Yeah, we love this game.

184
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,320
- So this is Seek a Boo

185
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,781
and Finn has been wanting to
play this for so long, huh?

186
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:19,214
- That's my cookie.

187
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:20,110
- And this is your cookie.

188
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,652
- No, mine.

189
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:23,020
- We're gonna put it right there.

190
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,917
Don't touch it.

191
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:24,750
- Hey, that looks like my bike.

192
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,570
- What's that?
- That looks like my bike.

193
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,748
- What is that Finn?

194
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:30,165
- That's my bike.

195
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:32,450
- [Bryan] Is it your bike?

196
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,490
I think that's Finn's bike, huh Ollie?

197
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,070
- Okay, we're gonna put
the bike right there, okay?

198
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,600
- Your bike's right there, okay?

199
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,409
- See the drums?

200
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,122
Okay, we're gonna put
the drums right there.

201
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:43,003
- Finn's a wee bit tired.

202
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:45,436
- Now Finn, where's the bike?

203
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:46,993
- [Bryan] Do you know where the bike is?

204
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:47,828
- [Missy] Wow.

205
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,954
- [Bryan] Good job.

206
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,390
- Good job Finn.

207
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,490
Okay, it's Ollie's turn.

208
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,959
Ollie, where is the ball?

209
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,216
(cat meows)

210
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:57,158
- Good job.

211
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:58,990
So you guys get to hold on to your ball.

212
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,100
Here, I'll hold on to this one

213
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,270
and you can hold on to the bike, okay?

214
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,310
- [Bryan] Good job guys.

215
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,390
- Finn, where is the teddy bear?

216
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,420
Remember?

217
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,020
Oh, no, that's the drums.

218
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,870
Now let Ollie look, okay?

219
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,780
Sit next to Ollie,

220
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,973
- [Bryan] Ollie, do you know
where the teddy bear is?

221
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:15,999
- Yeah.

222
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,103
- [Bryan] Do you remember?

223
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:18,690
Oh.

224
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,763
No, no, no Ollie.

225
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:20,596
- One at a time.

226
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:22,610
Where is the teddy bear?

227
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,560
Which one is it?

228
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,423
No.

229
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,227
That's Ollie's turn.

230
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:29,060
- [Bryan] Ollie.

231
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,643
- Where is the teddy bear, yay!

232
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,425
Okay you get to hold the teddy bear.

233
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,760
Where is the blocks?

234
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,953
- [Bryan] Oh, do you remember Finn?

235
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:40,786
Yay!

236
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:41,619
- Yay!

237
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,540
All right, you each got three.

238
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,949
It's a tie.

239
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:50,782
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

240
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:52,090
- [Bryan] Good job boys.

241
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,605
Hey Finn, is your brain gettin sore yet?

242
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:55,438
- Yeah.

243
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:56,271
- [Bryan] Yeah?

244
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,590
That's quite a brain workout.

245
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,690
- Okay, Ollie.

246
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,136
The orange triangle.

247
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,070
Where's the orange triangle going?

248
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,930
Right there?

249
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,430
The yellow diamond.

250
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,755
Where's the yellow diamond go?

251
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:10,588
- Yeah.

252
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:11,421
- There you go (laughs).

253
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:14,260
They're so cute in
their Star Wars pajamas.

254
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,720
Oh, I actually showed them something

255
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,100
I just got for my office.

256
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,560
Okay, so it's like this
really really comfy blanket

257
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,830
and looks who's on it.

258
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,510
Darth Vader!

259
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,280
Ollie saw it after I
turned it the right way

260
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,870
and he was so excited.

261
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,520
He was like "That's Darth Vader!"

262
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,990
Oh hey, Karma.

263
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,588
Oh hey, Luna.

264
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:39,480
Aww.

265
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,430
She's like "I missed you.

266
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,803
"You were gone so long."

267
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,252
(Bryan laughs)

268
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:45,270
Karma's like, "Stop it.

269
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,836
"You're embarrassing
me in front of Bryan."

270
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:49,419
(upbeat music)

271
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:57,930
I wonder where it is.

272
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,510
Finn, do you know where it is?

273
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,693
- What is that one?

274
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,980
- [Bryan] Orange triangle!

275
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,740
- Karma, Luna, go!

276
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,640
All right, we are snuggling into bed

277
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,960
and these boys are just so cute.

278
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,542
Did you have such a fun day today?

279
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:13,375
- Yeah.

280
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,208
- [Missy] Yeah?

281
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,600
- Daddy's home.

282
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,691
- [Missy] Daddy's home?

283
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:17,524
- Yeah.

284
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:20,280
- That's good, he loves saying
like everyone who's home.

285
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,890
He's like "Mama, home, me, home."

286
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,870
It's so cute.

287
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,050
We are getting ready for bed

288
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,910
and I just have to give you
guys a quick little update

289
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,120
on their sleeping.

290
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,530
They've been really good from the start,

291
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,740
but there have been days that
it's been a little harder.

292
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,430
And just transitioning from

293
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,600
Finn being able to just leave
the bed anytime he wants.

294
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,580
But just the fact that
they have each other.

295
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,864
As long as you guys have each
other, you guys are good, huh?

296
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:45,900
- Yeah.

297
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,530
- But mornings have been a little harder

298
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,050
and so I told you guys the other day

299
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,720
that I bought this little owl

300
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,811
and when the light in the eyes are.

301
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:55,644
- Green.

302
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:57,891
- [Missy] Green, it means
you can get out of bed, huh?

303
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:58,724
- Yeah.

304
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,235
- [Missy] And you, follow
those rules really well, huh?

305
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,068
- Yeah.

306
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,960
- This one, not so much.

307
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,370
He's like "I don't care
what color those eyes are.

308
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,550
"If I'm awake, I'm
getting out of this bed."

309
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,880
But we're practicing and
continuing to enforce the rule.

310
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,150
Like if he does come to the
bed before the eyes are green,

311
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,940
I make him come back into
the room until it's green.

312
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,250
'Cause sometimes, he likes
to come in my room at five am

313
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,030
and that is just not okay.

314
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,840
This has actually been
really, really cool.

315
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,287
Super helpful for like Ollie
knowing when to get up, huh?

316
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,120
- Yeah.

317
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,030
- We were going off the sun and I was like

318
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,060
the sun comes up pretty early.

319
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,320
Maybe we should go with
a different method.

320
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
And then something else
my dad actually installed,

321
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,210
just for safety 'cause it has
always worried me a little bit

322
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,614
that Finn is up so high and they roll

323
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,130
all over this bed all night long.

324
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,470
My dad installed this
cool little sliding door.

325
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,580
It's not quite what he
wants as a finished product,

326
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,320
but it just slides over
so he can't fall out.

327
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,340
He wants a little bit higher I think.

328
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,050
I think I want it a little bit higher too,

329
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,330
but it's pretty cool.

330
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,163
It just slides.

331
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,300
It's got a little glide for it

332
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,526
and it just closes and opens, huh?

333
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:08,359
- Yeah.

334
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,680
- But anyways, we are gonna
go ahead and go to bed

335
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,585
'cause these boys are done, huh?

336
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:13,418
- Yeah.

337
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,260
- [Missy] Done, done?

338
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,093
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

339
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:17,879
So make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up.

340
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,410
Big thumbs up!

341
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,110
And let us know in the comments
what is your favorite place

342
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,830
to have tons of fun and
get all your energy out.

343
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,040
Let us know down in the comments

344
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,620
and maybe we'll end up visiting one day.

345
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,330
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

346
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,216
What do you say?

347
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:33,915
- [Both] Bye!

348
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:34,792
- [Missy] Boop.

349
00:13:34,792 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
