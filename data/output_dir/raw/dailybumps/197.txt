1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:01,874
- So, today we decided we would do

2
00:00:01,874 --> 00:00:04,344
a really fun project with the boys.

3
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:06,045
Look at that!

4
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:08,400
- [Missy] Ollie, what does that look like?

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,900
- Um, a bath bomb.

6
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:19,958
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,771
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

8
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:28,372
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said,

9
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:31,835
♫ "This is home"

10
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,890
♫ Just running around,
you've never looked so cute

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,614
♫ Hugging you tight,
cuddling all I could, saying

12
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:42,620
♫ "I am home"

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,703
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

14
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:50,827
- Mo mo.

15
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:52,061
- Morning.

16
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,488
- [Bryan] Good morning, Finn.

17
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:55,821
- [Finn] We go to Starbucks.

18
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:04,157
(laughter)

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,600
- [Bryan] Oh, you're so funny.

20
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:12,895
- Here you go, Finn.

21
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:15,900
- [Bryan] Ah, you got
a chocolate milk, too.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,327
- Thank you, Ollie.

23
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,986
- I got one of them, too, Finn.

24
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:20,749
- Good morning, guys,
and welcome today's vlog.

25
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:23,205
This morning none of us wanted to cook

26
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,550
and we didn't want to go out.

27
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,291
We just wanted to go to Starbucks.

28
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,935
So we got drinks and
snacks from Starbucks.

29
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:31,965
Hey, Finn, don't push the button.

30
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:33,833
Don't push it, don't push it!

31
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,561
Oh, you pushed it!

32
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,562
- I push my button.

33
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:38,822
- Don't push your button.

34
00:01:38,822 --> 00:01:41,655
Oh, no, he pushed his button, too.

35
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:46,128
(bright electronic music)

36
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,303
PSL, thank you!

37
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:55,119
You guys, first pumpkin
spice latte of the season.

38
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,287
- Alright, boys, we've dropped off Daddy.

39
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:59,750
I actually took him home
to get some work done.

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,556
He really, really needs to get stuff done.

41
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:02,786
We're just going to go ahead

42
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,695
and do our errands without him today.

43
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,673
Does that sound good,
hanging out with Mama?

44
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:08,103
- Yeah!

45
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,261
- Today, we thought it would be really fun

46
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,094
to make Ollie homemade bath bombs.

47
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:15,541
- Yay!

48
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,099
- Does that sound fun?

49
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,447
Ollie loves bath bombs so I found a recipe

50
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,307
that's exactly what Lush uses

51
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:26,274
and so we thought that would be super fun

52
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:28,217
because the boys both love bath bombs,

53
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:29,600
me and Bryan love bath bombs,

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,801
and we're actually out of
all of our Lush bath bombs,

55
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,057
so let's make some of our own, okay?

56
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,202
- [Ollie] Yeah.

57
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,829
- So let's go shopping.

58
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,278
Some people get overwhelmed
in different stores,

59
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:41,631
whether it's like guys for Home Depot.

60
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,820
Some girls get overwhelmed
with makeup stores.

61
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,396
I get overwhelmed at Joann's
or any kind of craft store

62
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:49,310
because I just want to do everything.

63
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,520
Like, I want to make
crafts, I want to sew,

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,385
I want to knit, I want to do everything.

65
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:55,349
And when I do it, when
I go into these places,

66
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,907
I'm like, "Let's buy it all!"

67
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:58,422
So I have to be really careful.

68
00:02:58,422 --> 00:02:59,781
- It's Halloween stuff!

69
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,170
- Let's buy it all.

70
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,322
Oh my gosh, I'm dying.

71
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:03,742
I just tried to FaceTime Bryan

72
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,716
because everything is so cute

73
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,207
and I want him to see it all.

74
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:08,290
Look at this!

75
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,749
Look at this, that's a
little raccoon wreath.

76
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,945
And an owl, are you kidding me?

77
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,973
Ollie really wants the scorpion skeleton.

78
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:21,693
And Finn's like, "Let me
go look at everything."

79
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:25,054
Why are you guys so stinking cute?

80
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,225
- Scorpion!

81
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:27,223
- Yeah.

82
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,167
Ollie got a little scorpion at Joann's

83
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,256
and they actually didn't have anything

84
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:33,587
for bath bombs there, but I did get a few,

85
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:36,269
just a couple little fall decorations.

86
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,404
We still have to go to Michael's now,

87
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:41,576
or somewhere else to get
stuff for bath bombs.

88
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,737
So, I was able to find a few things

89
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,930
at the local organic store we have.

90
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,290
We still need the mold,

91
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,523
so I'll still go by Michael's
to get the rest of the stuff.

92
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:50,913
We just got out of Michael's,

93
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,675
and I was seriously thinking that

94
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,657
they would have everything
to make bath bombs

95
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:56,639
and they had almost nothing.

96
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,633
I luckily found a few molds

97
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,636
that I'm excited to use with the boys.

98
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:02,085
They really didn't have much.

99
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:03,737
I'm glad I stopped at the organic store

100
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,680
and grabbed those little ingredients.

101
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,021
These boys are ready to
go home, Finn is done.

102
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,330
Alright, let's go.

103
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,628
- So, today we decided we would do

104
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,355
a really fun project with the boys.

105
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,868
- Yep, they're super excited.

106
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,680
- We got all our stuff laid out

107
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,013
and we are going to make DIY bath bombs.

108
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:25,607
- Yay, I got tons of molds.
- How cool is that?

109
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,310
- Which I'm really excited about.

110
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,349
- [Bryan] Yeah, we have molds

111
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:30,494
and we have all the different
ingredients you need,

112
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:32,744
like Epsom salt and citric acid and--

113
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:34,178
- [Missy] Baking soda.

114
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:36,946
- [Bryan] Baking soda and
lots of colors and stuff.

115
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:39,446
(light music)

116
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:54,892
- [Bryan] Alright, Ollie,

117
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:57,338
tell me what you think about this smell.

118
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,823
- Eww!

119
00:04:58,823 --> 00:04:59,694
- You don't like it?

120
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:01,416
- [Missy] It smells like oranges.

121
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,005
Does it smell like oranges?

122
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:03,843
Yeah!

123
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:05,639
Okay, let's try this one next.

124
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,232
- [Bryan] Oh, he'd love this one.

125
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:09,897
Tell me what smell this one is, Ollie.

126
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:10,730
- Lavender.

127
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,563
- Yeah.

128
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:14,038
- Alright, Finn, smell this.

129
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:15,928
Tell me what you think.

130
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:16,841
What do you think?

131
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:17,852
Does it smell good?

132
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:19,102
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

133
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,603
Alright, we are attempting
the color pink for this one.

134
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:31,864
- [Missy] Okay, here we go.

135
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,351
- [Bryan] Let's see if it works.

136
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:37,165
And then we start whisking.

137
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,904
- [Missy] Ah, that's pretty.

138
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,663
- [Bryan] It made a pretty pink.

139
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:42,936
Look at that, it worked, babe.

140
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:43,993
- [Missy] Yay!

141
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,367
It smells very lavender-y.

142
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:46,814
Alright, what's this one?

143
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,042
- We are doing blue next.

144
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,591
- [Missy] Oh wow.

145
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,226
- [Bryan] I don't know.

146
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,080
- [Missy] We'll see, we'll see.

147
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,911
- Wow, it's fizzy.
- It bubbles.

148
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:58,337
- [Missy] I like that blue,
I think it looks good!

149
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,907
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's a good blue.

150
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:01,620
- [Missy] It's definitely
a brilliant blue.

151
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,904
Ooh, now we've got some yellow!

152
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:07,443
That looks awesome, I like that a lot.

153
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:10,235
- Alright, this next color
we're doing is brown,

154
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,569
and I'm not sure if it's gonna turn out

155
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,446
but we'll see, but we
actually wanted to do one

156
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:17,439
that actually looks like a poop emoji.

157
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,070
(laughter)

158
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,322
- [Bryan] So let's try it.

159
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:24,145
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, if that
works that'll be so weird.

160
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:27,125
Ew, it actually is working!

161
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,874
- [Bryan] Look at that!

162
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:31,565
- [Missy] Ollie, what does that look like?

163
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,434
- Um, a bath bomb.

164
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,729
- [Bryan] Alright, now
that we have all of our

165
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,263
beautiful colors, and our brown,

166
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:41,104
we're gonna start filling this mold.

167
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:44,043
Our bath bombs are gonna
be more like bath poops.

168
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:45,474
(laughter)

169
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:46,307
But that's okay!

170
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:47,866
Yeah, this is so cool.

171
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,313
We're using Rosanna
Pansino's poop emoji mold.

172
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,730
- I'm waiting for bath bombs!

173
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:57,951
(playful music)

174
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,020
- Alright, so I am doing a brown one

175
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,719
that's actually gonna
look like a poop emoji.

176
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,044
But then, when the kids
put it in the bath,

177
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,589
it'll have a burst of color.

178
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:18,738
- [Missy] It'll be interesting

179
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,979
what the water ends up looking like, too,

180
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,476
with the brown and all the colors.

181
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,616
- [Bryan] It might look gross.

182
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,024
- [Missy] It's gonna look black!

183
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:28,916
Blue, pink, it's actually really fun.

184
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,348
We should make a business out of this.

185
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:31,883
- I know, right?

186
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:33,488
Designing bath bombs.

187
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:34,849
This is actually gonna be really cool

188
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,434
because it's gonna make, like, green.

189
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,766
The blue and yellow are gonna make green

190
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,246
when they get squished together.

191
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:41,457
And then you have the purple, look at that

192
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:42,864
little burst of color
that they're gonna make.

193
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:45,197
- [Missy] Yeah, that's cool.

194
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,771
- [Bryan] Alright, we are all done

195
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:52,452
making you boys bath bombs,
but before we use them

196
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,716
we gotta let them dry, okay?

197
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:56,173
So what are we gonna do now?

198
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,340
- Pick an animal to sleep.

199
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,907
- [Bryan] An animal to
sleep with at preschool?

200
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:02,834
- Yeah!

201
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:03,925
- [Bryan] Alright.

202
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,596
- Alright, I've gone around the room

203
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:07,441
and he brought home his
monkey the other day

204
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,784
because he wanted to
snuggle with it at home,

205
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:11,544
but I really want one to stay there.

206
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:13,351
So I'm going to give him
a bunch to choose from;

207
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,377
he can choose one for at home
and choose one for school.

208
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:16,547
So here we go.

209
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:17,759
- [Bryan] You ready, Ollie?

210
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,592
- Yes.

211
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:20,024
- So this is for at preschool, okay?

212
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:22,774
We've got the very huggable bear.

213
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:27,289
(clapping)

214
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,456
We've got the always friendly Mr. Fox,

215
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:34,366
he's been around since
the day you were born.

216
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:38,687
Alright, we've got the
adorable Mrs. Bambi,

217
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:42,563
I mean, she is soft,
snuggly, and adorable.

218
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,087
- [Bryan] Ooh, that is a good one!

219
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:48,255
- We've got the very cute
and scary shark, Mr. Shark.

220
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,812
We've got the always reliable Mr. Monkey.

221
00:08:57,408 --> 00:09:00,408
- [Bryan] Give it up for Mr. Monkey!

222
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:04,441
- And the very cute Mrs. Fox,

223
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:10,261
similar to this one, but pretty cute.

224
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:12,746
(family clapping)

225
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:15,380
- [Bryan] That is a hard choice, Ollie.

226
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,732
Drum roll, please.

227
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:20,168
- Which one do you want
to snuggle with at school?

228
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:21,732
- Um, the monkey!

229
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:23,649
- The monkey wins, yay!

230
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:28,830
Alright, so we're gonna keep
Mr. Monkey at school, okay?

231
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,982
- Yeah.

232
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:32,128
- Okay, now you get to choose one...

233
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,630
- [Bryan] Which one do you
want to snuggle with right now?

234
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,720
- [Missy] ...to snuggle
with at home when you sleep.

235
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,816
- The yellow one!

236
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:40,090
- Which one? Show me.

237
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,923
- The yellow one.

238
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:42,951
- He thinks he's yellow,
this is orange remember?

239
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,643
It's kind of like this one.

240
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:47,346
(Finn squealing)

241
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:49,227
- [Bryan] Finn did not
think that one should win.

242
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:50,889
- What do you want to call him?

243
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:51,756
- Bunga.

244
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,734
- Bunga? Okay, Binga Bunga.

245
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:56,081
- [Bryan] Alright Finn, take a break

246
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,626
from eating your macaroni and cheese.

247
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,959
You've gotta choose one too.

248
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:04,013
He's like, "Let me show
you, let me show you".

249
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:06,369
Which one do you choose, buddy?

250
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:07,452
- [Missy] This one?

251
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:10,856
- [Bryan] That one's the
best, look at that smile.

252
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:12,935
- [Missy] He's like, "I like all of them".

253
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:14,345
- [Bryan] Ooh, wait a minute.

254
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:17,175
- [Missy] Can you give him a hug?

255
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:19,537
He's like, "I have to
hug them all to see".

256
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:22,026
- [Bryan] Yeah, gotta
test out each hug score.

257
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:23,873
- [Missy] Aw, he's scary but he--

258
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:28,069
- The hug score was
considered for this decision.

259
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:30,837
- Oh, he didn't test this one out; hug it!

260
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:33,254
- [Bryan] How's it feel? Nah.

261
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,851
- Mr. Bambi wins, that is so cute.

262
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,629
- [Bryan] That is so cute.

263
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:42,091
Alright, boys, now that you've

264
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,761
chosen your stuffed
animals, eat your dinner

265
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:45,893
because bath time is
gonna be super special;

266
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,621
we're gonna use our new bath bombs.

267
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:48,811
You ready?

268
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:49,953
- Yeah!

269
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,036
- Finn, could I hug that?

270
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,748
- Aww!
- Aww!

271
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:56,463
- [Missy] That one's a
pretty cool one, huh?

272
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:59,713
(fun electronic music)

273
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,514
- Bath bomb time!

274
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:07,302
- Bath bomb time, that is right!

275
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:09,997
The boys are taking a bath tonight

276
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:12,814
and our bath bombs are finally dry

277
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:16,053
so we are going to pop them out,

278
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:18,553
see what they look like;
hopefully they turned out

279
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,373
because we worked really hard on them.

280
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:22,160
They smell really, really good.

281
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,327
I'm really excited to see
what they all look like.

282
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:32,244
Alright, we are popping
out our bath bomb molds.

283
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:33,350
- [Missy] I am so scared.

284
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,110
- [Bryan] I know, I hope they turned out.

285
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,693
- Oh, one came out!

286
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:43,488
Oh my gosh, they look amazing!

287
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:46,764
- [Bryan] What!

288
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:50,956
We did it, you guys, oh my goodness!

289
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,579
You guys, these ones
seriously look like poop.

290
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:55,903
Those ones look like poop.

291
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:57,614
- They look nasty, actually.

292
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:59,807
- [Bryan] I know, that is so cool!

293
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:01,684
I cannot believe these turned out.

294
00:12:01,684 --> 00:12:04,187
- This one looks so cool,
too, like the way it swirls.

295
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:06,707
- Yeah, and we used Rosanna Pansino's

296
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:10,040
new baking line for her poop emoji molds

297
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:13,675
to make them, and I
think that's the reason

298
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,592
they turned out so
good, so thank you Rose.

299
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:18,040
And you guys should all
send this video to her

300
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,780
to let her know how our
bath bombs turned out.

301
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,387
- Yeah, you better believe I'm making

302
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:24,246
some delicious poop cupcakes next.

303
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:26,473
- [Bryan] Alright boys, we are gonna

304
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:28,754
put in the very first one.

305
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:31,504
This is a unicorn poop bath bomb.

306
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:37,081
- [Missy] Okay, does it
smell like unicorn poop?

307
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:39,515
- [Bryan] Wow, let it go Finn.

308
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:42,432
Let's let it fizzle, look at it go!

309
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:49,614
We made a bath bomb,
you boys, and it worked!

310
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:51,172
What does it smell like, Ollie?

311
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:52,755
- It smells like...

312
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:55,775
- [Bryan] Oranges?

313
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,726
- Oranges, yeah!

314
00:12:56,726 --> 00:13:00,704
- It smells like all the
smells mixed together!

315
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:02,018
- And it actually didn't make the water

316
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:04,308
as dark as I feel like the Lush ones do.

317
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:06,111
Next one coming in.

318
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:08,903
Wow, the bath bomb is going!

319
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:10,582
- [Missy] That looks awesome.

320
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,397
- [Bryan] That is so cool, too, whoa!

321
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:16,814
Alright, it is now time for the poop one.

322
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:21,892
You guys remember I was a poop
emoji a couple of blogs ago,

323
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:23,937
I'll have it in the iCard above.

324
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,874
So now I've made a poop emoji bath bomb,

325
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,322
and I think these boys are in for

326
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,349
a little surprise of what's inside.

327
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,223
This one's just a brown poop,

328
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:33,386
you wanna see what the
brown poop turns into?

329
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:34,719
Wow, it's brown!

330
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:37,378
Ew!

331
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:41,107
What!?

332
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:45,934
That looks so gross, that
looks so gross, you guys.

333
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,238
- [Missy] Get out of the
tub, there's poop in it!

334
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:50,491
- [Bryan] Where'd all the cool color go

335
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:53,094
that was inside of it?

336
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:55,147
The brown just overtaked everything.

337
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:56,766
Alright, let's grab another one!

338
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,849
Oh my god, why does it look so gross?

339
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,406
That is the grossest bath bomb.

340
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:06,521
- Oh, there's all the color!

341
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:08,081
- [Bryan] There's some color.

342
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,331
Alright, let's do this one.

343
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:16,221
Missy made some other bath
bombs things, oh, there it is.

344
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:19,304
Look at that pumpkin, that's so cute!

345
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,667
Maybe that will turn the
color a little better.

346
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,250
(upbeat music)

347
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,785
They're gonna be very oily.

348
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:45,618
That water, though,
doesn't look the greatest.

349
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:48,437
- [Missy] Alright boys, you're bathed,

350
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:51,111
teeth are brushed, you're jammies are on,

351
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:53,831
you're matching, and you look so cute.

352
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:55,069
