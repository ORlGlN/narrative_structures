1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,542
- [Missy] What is it?

2
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:02,683
- It knows me!

3
00:00:02,683 --> 00:00:03,516
- [Missy] It knows you?

4
00:00:03,516 --> 00:00:04,349
How does it know you?

5
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:05,412
- Say Ollie.

6
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:06,662
(toy noise)

7
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:09,294
- [Missy] It talks to you?

8
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:11,674
(toy noise)

9
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:12,731
Say farted.

10
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:15,064
(toy noise)

11
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:18,538
- [Missy] It said farted?

12
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:19,371
- Yeah.

13
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:26,333
♫ Wherever you are

14
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,677
♫ That's where I wanna be

15
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:30,726
♫ All it took was a life

16
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,607
♫ And that soft sun side

17
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:36,690
♫ Big blue eyes looked up inside

18
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:40,185
♫ This is home

19
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:41,430
♫ Just running' around

20
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,205
♫ You never looked so cute

21
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:44,382
♫ Hugging you tight

22
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:48,078
♫ Cuddling all I could to you

23
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:50,738
♫ I am home

24
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:54,821
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

25
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:59,751
- Good morning, guys.

26
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:01,902
It is bright and early

27
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:03,729
and we are gettin' up for the day

28
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,277
'cause you have school.

29
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:07,164
He's eatin' his breakfast.

30
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:07,997
Are you excited for your day?

31
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:09,282
- Yes.

32
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:11,747
- Every morning I try
and perfect the morning

33
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:13,749
so that he has more time to eat breakfast

34
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,153
less being late.

35
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,195
Which we've never been late,

36
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:17,420
but I'm just kind of like a-

37
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,966
I get a lot of, like, stress

38
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:20,561
when I feel like we're gonna be late

39
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,896
or if we're getting close to being late.

40
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,610
I am still trying, actually.

41
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,818
I set my clock this
morning 15 minutes earlier

42
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:28,772
than I usually do

43
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,399
and I figured out my problem.

44
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,824
It's 'cause I don't like to wake up.

45
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:32,657
(laughs)

46
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:33,490
Once I'm up, I'm great

47
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,629
but I hate that waking up part.

48
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,125
We need to get ready and go.

49
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,694
And you're all ready, huh?

50
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:40,831
Momma got you all dressed
as soon as you woke up.

51
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:41,842
What are you doin'?

52
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:42,783
Go take another bite.

53
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,804
Got his lunch all packed,

54
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,594
and we've got some water,

55
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:48,902
some apples and carrots,

56
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,411
an Uncrustable,

57
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,398
Goldfish,

58
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:53,666
Ane even some little Scooby Snacks

59
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,363
if he makes it all the way to that point.

60
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,019
Alright, Ollie, do you want to show me

61
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,307
what's in your back pack this morning?

62
00:01:58,307 --> 00:01:59,302
- Yeah

63
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:03,474
- [Missy] Alright, go ahead
and unzip it right here.

64
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:05,349
He's like, "Hello, good morning"

65
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:08,096
What is the first thing in there?

66
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:09,461
Mr. Monkey!

67
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,697
So he's coming back to school
to cuddle during nap time,

68
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:12,678
right?

69
00:02:12,678 --> 00:02:13,606
Yay.

70
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:14,702
He's very excited about that.

71
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,262
Alright, what's the next thing in there?

72
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,429
A new blankie.

73
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:21,098
He has a blanket there,
but this one matches now

74
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:23,479
his crib sheet, so that's kinda cool.

75
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,260
And it's a very comfy, soft one.

76
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,863
What else is in there?

77
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,817
An ... What is it?

78
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,405
- A alligator game!

79
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:32,995
- [Missy] The alligator game.

80
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:35,662
(playful music)

81
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:40,241
- Tomorrow, at preschool, is share day.

82
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:42,325
So share day is where
you get to bring one toy,

83
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:44,132
and you get to share
with all your friends.

84
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:45,226
Does that sound fun?

85
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:46,059
- Uh-huh.

86
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:49,288
- Okay, but for this week, the letter is A

87
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,215
which means you have to
bring a toy to school

88
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,488
that starts with the letter A.

89
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:55,337
We've got three options
here to choose from.

90
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:57,262
We've got Spiderman.

91
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:59,564
Spiderman would be really
fun to bring to school, huh?

92
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:00,421
- Cool.

93
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:01,254
- Yeah.

94
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:02,337
We've got car

95
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,428
Ooh

96
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:08,095
And we've got the aligator game.

97
00:03:09,474 --> 00:03:13,560
So which one of these toys
starts with the letter A?

98
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,393
How did you know that?

99
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:18,392
How did you know that?

100
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:19,576
- [Bryan] Ollie, what is this?

101
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:21,103
- Aligator game.

102
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:23,322
- [Bryan] The aligator starts with a ...?

103
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:25,148
- A, A, apple!

104
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:25,981
- A

105
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:28,808
You're so right!

106
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,019
That was so smart of him,

107
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:31,010
I'm so proud of him!

108
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,303
So you're gonna bring the aligator game,

109
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:34,136
does that sound good, Ollie?

110
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:34,969
- Yeah.

111
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:35,802
Yeah?

112
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:36,728
- You're gonna show all
your friends how to play it.

113
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:38,728
Do you know how to play?

114
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:46,004
- [Bryan] Ahh!

115
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:48,694
- So you're gonna share
this with all your friends

116
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,607
and show them how to play, okay?

117
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,024
Yeah, so excited!

118
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:54,685
- I hope Kate can be there.

119
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:56,319
- Yeah, I think she's gonna be there.

120
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,791
- [Missy] That is the aligator
game that you get to do

121
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,339
for Share Day, huh?

122
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,172
- Yeah.

123
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:01,707
- [Missy] Are you excited to share it?

124
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:02,540
- Yeah.

125
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,064
- [Missy] Alright, should be fun.

126
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:06,564
(happy music)

127
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:09,442
- Hey guys

128
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:14,345
So I am headed to pick
up Ollie from preschool

129
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:16,673
and I am so excited because

130
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,648
I really wanna hear how his
very first show-and-tell went.

131
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,774
I remember as a kid

132
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:23,902
I used to love show-and-tell.

133
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,885
And we did it all the way up until-

134
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:28,512
I believe it was second
grade or third grade.

135
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:29,642
Yeah, it was third-

136
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:32,384
I remember doing show-and-tell
in third grade, you guys.

137
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:35,123
And I always loved picking
out an object to bring

138
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:38,131
and show everyone, and it was a big thing

139
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,081
when you were a kid.

140
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:39,914
So.

141
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:42,975
I'm excited to see how Ollie's
first "Share Day" went,

142
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:44,502
that's what they call it, although,

143
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:45,840
it should really be
called, "show-and-tell."

144
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,852
Come on.

145
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,695
We are gonna have a fun afternoon,

146
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:50,245
so Ollie and I are gonna
get to go to lunch.

147
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,211
I'm gonna go to lunch,

148
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:52,662
and he's gonna bring his lunch

149
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,082
that we packed him this morning.

150
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:56,624
And then we're going to
get our hair cuts, also.

151
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:58,598
I'm excited to see how it all went.

152
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,989
And it is a beautiful day.

153
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:01,678
You guys see these blue skies?

154
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:03,300
It's gorgeous today.

155
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,467
Another B-E-A-utiful day here
in sunny Southern California.

156
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:10,062
Look who it is, you guys!

157
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:10,895
- Hi.

158
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:11,728
- [Bryan] How was school?

159
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,561
- Good.

160
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,691
- Good. And how did show-and-tell go?

161
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:15,524
- Good.

162
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,357
- Good?

163
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,448
What did people say about your aligator?

164
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:18,992
- There's four alligators.

165
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:21,187
- Someone brought three other alligators?

166
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,138
- Yes!

167
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,331
- There was four alligators

168
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:24,882
in show-and-tell today, apparently, huh?

169
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:25,715
- Yeah.

170
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:26,582
- That is so funny.

171
00:05:26,582 --> 00:05:28,234
And you had your alligator game.

172
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:29,241
Did you play it with anyone?

173
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,074
- Yeah.

174
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:30,907
- Yeah?

175
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:31,740
Did you and Peyton play?

176
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,573
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:33,931
- And who won?

178
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:35,192
- Me!

179
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:36,114
- You did?

180
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:36,947
- Yes.

181
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:37,992
- Alright, you ready to get some lunch?

182
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,502
He already started eating his lunch.

183
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:40,732
He was doing so good.

184
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:42,817
So he's gonna finish his lunch with me.

185
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:44,658
- Where alligators live?

186
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,049
- [Bryan] Alligators live in the water.

187
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:46,927
- Water?

188
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:47,890
- [Bryan] Yeah.

189
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,723
And on land.

190
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,556
They can go in both.

191
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:50,389
You need to tie your shoe.

192
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,722
- Let's do this.

193
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,100
(happy music)

194
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:03,168
- [Bryan] Alright, Ollie,
what are we doing now?

195
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:05,038
- Getting our haircuts!

196
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:05,871
- [Bryan] Yeah.

197
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,703
- I opened my door by myself!

198
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:08,544
- Good job!

199
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:09,784
Let's go, dude.

200
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:10,741
Just finished up lunch,

201
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:13,192
and now we are going to visit Travis,

202
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:14,874
and he is gonna cut our hairs.

203
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,707
Right?

204
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:16,540
- Yep.

205
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,373
- Yep.

206
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:18,740
I love this little area
where the haircut place is.

207
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,302
This is where that starlight bazar was at.

208
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:24,135
(wild west music)

209
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:32,987
- Hey, Ollie, you wanna try on some hats?

210
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:33,820
- No.

211
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,761
- [Bryan] No? (laughs)
He's not a fan of hats.

212
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:39,011
Dude, look, they have one in your size.

213
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:43,592
What do you think? (laughs)

214
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,272
- [Bryan] Ollie is in such a mood today.

215
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:54,391
He's being so sassy with everyone.

216
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:58,666
Ollie, are you picking fights with Travis?

217
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,916
Alright, time for haircuts.

218
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:05,895
( wild west music)

219
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,932
- Get suckers for a haircut.

220
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:09,765
- [Travis] You're welcome buddy.

221
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,470
- [Bryan] Lookin' good, dude.

222
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,053
Here. You wanna facetime
Mama and show her?

223
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:19,352
Alright, you guys, we got our haircut.

224
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:20,202
What do you think?

225
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:21,236
Do you like Daddy's haircut?

226
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:22,069
Yeah?

227
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,104
It looks good?

228
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,261
What do you wanna do now?

229
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:26,290
- I wanna get ice cream at here!

230
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,427
- We should get ice cream?

231
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:28,393
Okay.

232
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:31,128
There is a little ice
cream place down here.

233
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:34,420
This is becoming a ritual for Ollie now.

234
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,550
- I wanna get vanilla ice cream.

235
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,383
- [Bryan] That's all?

236
00:07:37,383 --> 00:07:38,216
Vanilla?

237
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:39,141
- Yeah.

238
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,628
- It's like a fancy ice cream place,

239
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,626
so sometimes they have weird flavors.

240
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:45,020
- Want one vanilla.

241
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,853
- Okay.

242
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:46,686
One vanilla?

243
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:47,519
- Okay.

244
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,352
Just got my haircut.

245
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:49,185
Feels so good.

246
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,244
I know you love strawberry ice cream, huh?

247
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:52,077
- Yeah.

248
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:52,910
- [Bryan] Yeah.

249
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,487
- The bigger ice cream is the best.

250
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:56,320
- [Bryan] It's pretty good.

251
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,944
This place is so old fashioned,

252
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,294
country western.

253
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:01,763
I love it.

254
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:03,090
You don't really see a lot

255
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,590
of places like this in California,

256
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,470
so it's actually really fun.

257
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,470
(adventurous music)

258
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,654
- [Bryan] All these flavors,
and he chooses vanilla!

259
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:18,487
Right?

260
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:19,320
- Yes.

261
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,890
- [Bryan] Is that your favorite? (laughs)

262
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,807
- I'm hugging you, dad.

263
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,465
- Ollie, look.

264
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:30,816
Isn't that cool?

265
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:31,898
There you go, dude.

266
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:32,731
What do you say?

267
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:34,352
- Thank you.

268
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:37,185
(wild west music)

269
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:40,042
- [Bryan] Alright, we have found

270
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:42,280
a great place to sit outside, huh?

271
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,348
How is that very plain vanilla ice cream?

272
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,177
Is it good? (laughs)

273
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,215
He likes it.

274
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:49,855
I didn't realize how many
cool places there are

275
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:51,022
in this little area.

276
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:54,510
There's, like, artisanal
food products, pizzeria,

277
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,643
Oak Creek Farm and Nursery,

278
00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:57,666
that's cool, they probably have

279
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,840
lots of cool plants in there.

280
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,036
Temecula Clay, Juice Bar ...

281
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,997
There's always lots to do here

282
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:04,088
which is really cool.

283
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:06,005
- [Missy] Run, run run!

284
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:10,455
These boys have been playing
since Ollie got home.

285
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:12,801
Fin missed him so badly.

286
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,717
I wanted to show you
guys what I've been doing

287
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:15,884
in Fin's room.

288
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:19,575
I finally cleaned out his closet.

289
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:23,164
There have been stacks of clothes in here

290
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,773
that have probably been in here for, like,

291
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,782
I'm not even kidding,
like two years. (laughs)

292
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,406
Now ... like, his whole room,

293
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:31,798
I haven't really gone through his clothes

294
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:33,858
in like, two years, obviously.

295
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:35,317
He's almost two years old

296
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,370
which means that in his
drawers, there were, like,

297
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,270
three month clothes, still.

298
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,834
I'm like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so bad."

299
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:44,779
So I was actually able to
donate three huge black bags

300
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,047
of tons of things.

301
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:47,741
But I was able to also
keep some of ... like ...

302
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:49,975
Memorabilia stuff.

303
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:53,190
And then I got a bunch of really
cute stuff to give to June,

304
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,303
which I'm excited about.

305
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,979
And then I got a ton of
new clothes for Ollie.

306
00:09:57,979 --> 00:10:01,138
Or, actually, for Fin, that were Ollie's.

307
00:10:01,138 --> 00:10:03,184
These are all Ollie's old clothes,

308
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:04,899
so I'm excited to see Fin in them.

309
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,482
A you can see, there are
a lot of Christmas stuff,

310
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:08,244
so he might not be wearing
them right away, but ...

311
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:09,729
Yay, do you guys remember this?

312
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:11,540
He used to wear this.

313
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,987
It was so cute.

314
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,808
This was Ollie's, so
it'll be fun to see Fin

315
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:16,708
in all of Ollie's old clothes.

316
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,442
My parents just brought over
this little rodent thing.

317
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:21,168
Come here, Fin, show me.

318
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:22,159
What is it?

319
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,955
- It knows me!

320
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:24,788
- [Missy] It knows you?

321
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:25,621
How does it know you?

322
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:26,454
- Say Ollie!

323
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:27,562
(toy noise)

324
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,729
- [Missy] It talks to you?

325
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,351
(toy noise)

326
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:33,632
- Say farted!

327
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,965
(toy noise)

328
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:39,791
- It said farted?

329
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,385
- Yeah. (laughs)

330
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:43,792
Are you stinky?

331
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,338
(toy noise)

332
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,926
Are you stinky?

333
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:48,828
(toy noise)

334
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:50,365
- [Missy] I love you.

335
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:51,511
(toy noise)

336
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,344
- Meh.

337
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:54,011
- [Missy] Is that your rodent?

338
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:57,470
Aw. It looks like a hamster. (laughs)

339
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,821
It mimics you a lot.

340
00:10:58,821 --> 00:10:59,981
- Say tree house!

341
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,054
(toy repeats)

342
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,039
- [Missy] Alright, we're
hangin' out outside

343
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,181
and my parents are over because ...

344
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,014
Look at me!

345
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,305
I've transformed!

346
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:09,613
I'm going out tonight with Bryan

347
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:11,663
and I think we're actually
gonna bring the camera.

348
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:13,522
We don't normally bring the
camera when we go on a date,

349
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,553
but we thought maybe we
might do that tonight.

350
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:17,671
So the boys are gonna stay
here with Mimi and Papa

351
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:19,857
and hopefully go to sleep.

352
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:20,690
- Hi.

353
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,908
- We're out on out date.

354
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:22,748
It's loud in here.

355
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:27,326
- We are playing Harry Potter
Trivia at a local British pub.

356
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:28,659
And I am stoked!

357
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:33,679
I just ordered a butter
beer, and a Slitherin shot.

358
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,943
- I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.

359
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,109
We've never done anything like this.

360
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:36,942
- It's very loud.

361
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:40,740
Alright, our team name is the
Whomping Weaselby Winners,

362
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,405
and we are seated next to ...

363
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:43,238
Say "Hey!"

364
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:44,995
- Hey.

365
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,251
- [Bryan] What's your guys' team name?

366
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:48,822
- The Real Housegirls of Diagon Alley.

367
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:50,164
- [Brian] Genius!

368
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:51,250
Iconic.

369
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,243
Good luck.

370
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:55,152
Funny story, I went to them
to figure out how to sign up

371
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:57,682
instead of the guy that I was
looking to go to to sign up

372
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:00,417
and I talked to them for
a good ten minutes before

373
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:03,234
they informed me they were not
the place where you sign up

374
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:04,843
to do the trivia.

375
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:05,789
So ...

376
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:07,933
- Luckily, though, we've done it before.

377
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,042
- Yeah.

378
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:12,375
(Victorian royal music)

379
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,227
- [MC] Second year, Vealroy Lockheart

380
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:22,775
Third year, Remus Lupin

381
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,334
Fourth, Madeye Moody (inaudible)

382
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,680
- [Missy] (cheers) You got it!

383
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,513
30 points.

384
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:29,930
- Final question.

385
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:35,501
- [Missy] (laughs) Everyone got it right.

386
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,885
- There's a lot of Harry Potter fans here.

387
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:39,213
- [MC] What vault did Hagrid remove the

388
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:40,528
Sorcerer's Stone from

389
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:43,137
in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?

390
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,541
- [Missy] Oh, man.

391
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,899
- What vault was it?

392
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,287
Okay, hang on, hang on.

393
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:49,047
- Leave it in the comments
down below if you know.

394
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:49,880
38

395
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:54,364
He's been so into this you guys.

396
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:58,531
We're not winning, but he
only got one question wrong.

397
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,900
- I'm in 12th place.

398
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,733
- Yeah.

399
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,704
But everyone here is so smart.

400
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:07,254
Usually, it's like a betting order,

401
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,366
so we're in 12th place,

402
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,238
he only got one question wrong, but ...

403
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,891
- I think it's called 397

404
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,232
- Ooh.

405
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:14,324
- It's not- Yeah.

406
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:15,182
- Yeah.

407
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:16,479
- I think it's vault 397.

408
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,223
- [MC] 713

409
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:19,244
- [Bryan] Aw!

410
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:20,365
- That was wrong.

411
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:21,198
- [Bryan] Aw, 713 ...

412
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:22,333
I got the seven and three right.

413
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,342
- The team names are the best.

414
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:25,970
- [MC] The Who You Horcrux

415
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,411
- (laughs) Who You Horcrux.

416
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:28,566
- [MC] Who You Horcrux,

417
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:31,933
You can come on up and
get your $10 certificate.

418
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:32,766
- [Bryan] Whoo!

419
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,649
- Alright, we are home

420
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,396
and we had such a fun night.

421
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:38,544
It was really awesome,

422
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,566
and even though I didn't really play a lot

423
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:43,176
it was still fun to watch Bryan play,

424
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:44,033
'Cause he had a blast.

425
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:44,866
Kids are asleep.

426
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,927
It's not super late, but
definitely time for bed.

427
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,098
So make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up

428
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,022
if you enjoyed it.

429
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:51,621
Let us know what you thought
of that Harry Potter game

430
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,289
and if you knew some of the answers.

431
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:54,496
I think we only showed
you guys one question.

432
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,406
- Let us know what your
favorite Harry Potter book is

433
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:57,294
in the comments.

434
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,127
- Okay.

435
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:58,960
Leave that in the comments,

436
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,249
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

437
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:01,459
Do you wanna say "Bye boo"?

438
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,680
Boy's like, "I'm playing
with a lego, Mom."

439
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,513
Ready?

440
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:06,263
Bye.

441
00:14:07,271 --> 00:00:00,000
