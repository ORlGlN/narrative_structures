1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:04,883
- Hey, Olly, Fin, I have
someone who wants to say hi!

2
00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:08,419
- I tell you, it is so hard
to grocery shop with two kids.

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:09,803
(laughs)

4
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,586
- I heard about what
happened at the store, Fin.

5
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:14,865
You're a crazy boy, you know that?

6
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:16,657
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)

7
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:20,792
♫ This is our life, this is
our fun, this is who we are

8
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:24,959
♫ This is our dream, this is
our team, shot among the stars,

9
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,520
♫ Take this shield, and we'll be fine,

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,589
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine,

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,756
♫ (This is our life) Let's
live it, live it forever!

12
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:40,041
- Good morning guys, say good morning Fin!

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,211
- Mor-ih

14
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:43,650
- Morning! Olly, say morning!

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,483
- Good morning.

16
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,706
- Good morning! How's your day been?

17
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:47,592
- Good.

18
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:50,254
- Good! It is a beautiful Monday morning,

19
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:54,354
it's October 16th, and it is
100 degrees today! (laughs)

20
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:58,401
It is actually so warm
out, these boys are like,

21
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:01,145
have to be in like, little tiny rompers,

22
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,407
because it is a warm, warm day.

23
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,513
And that's just how it is,
like October and November

24
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:08,207
can be like, confusing,
because you never know

25
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:10,148
what kind of a day it's gonna be like.

26
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:11,881
If it's gonna be a day
to wear like, a sweater,

27
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,385
or a tank top, it could
be literally either.

28
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,867
And today is definitely
a tank top kind of day.

29
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:17,883
I'm not wearing a tank top,

30
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:20,696
but it is definitely very, very warm.

31
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:22,934
But, our day has just
gotten started really late,

32
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:26,122
so Bryan is now getting
work done in the office,

33
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:27,992
so I think I'm just
gonna take the boys out

34
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:30,701
and go have some fun outside of the house.

35
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:33,136
Probably get some errands
done, like grocery shopping.

36
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:36,553
- We going to the, the play area we play!

37
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,051
- Yeah, he's really excited,
I think I'm gonna take them

38
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,587
to go play, I think we're
gonna head out now, you ready?

39
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,595
- Yeah.

40
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,148
- 'Kay, let's do it!

41
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:48,921
Karma good morning, how
are you, how are you?!

42
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:50,264
By the way, if you guys don't know,

43
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:54,040
Luna is in heat right now,
she kinda has to be separated,

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,347
and we take her on walks a
lot because she's not able

45
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:59,930
to like, play a lot out here,
because these two are not

46
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,685
allowed to be together
because Karma is a boy,

47
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:06,917
and he's so naughty with her,
and yes, Karma is neutered.

48
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:10,637
She's been in heat now for
over a month, over a month,

49
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:12,235
I'm saying like, six weeks now.

50
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:15,770
She is away right now,
and hopefully almost done,

51
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,348
so we can let her out
again so she can play.

52
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,767
Huh boy? Let's go.

53
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,043
So we just got loaded up in the car,

54
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:23,733
and Olly just asked me the cutest thing,

55
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:24,937
what did you say?

56
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:28,449
- Can I take a nap Mama? On the way there?

57
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,342
- Yeah, of course you can take a nap!

58
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:31,846
Are you gonna try to go to sleep now?

59
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:32,683
- Yeah.

60
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:34,266
- Okay, good night!

61
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,842
- Ha! Just kidding!

62
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:41,566
- He was just kidding that
time, but he will take a nap.

63
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:44,336
He's like, "Can I take a nap?"
and he literally is like...

64
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,936
He like, was trying to fall asleep,

65
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:48,229
I think he'll totally fall
asleep on the way there, 'kay?

66
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:50,229
See ya in a few minutes!

67
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:53,738
So, turns out Olly didn't take a nap,

68
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:55,359
I thought you were gonna go to sleep!

69
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,281
- I forgot.

70
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:57,754
- You forgot, oh, he's sad now.

71
00:02:57,754 --> 00:03:00,856
And now, Olly, show them
what you learned how to do!

72
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:03,773
- I just unbuckle this by when I...

73
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:08,896
- He really wants to show you guys.

74
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,725
Um, yeah, he learned how
to unbuckle the first

75
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,609
part of his clip, which
he's super good to not

76
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:16,913
do it until we're parked and
stop, so that's always good.

77
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:20,073
But, I'm really proud of him! (laughs)

78
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:21,552
You're excited that you can do that part?

79
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,283
He can't do the second part,
so he's just stuck there.

80
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:26,423
But you know who did
end up falling asleep?

81
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:29,593
That one, he's like, back there snoring,

82
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:32,043
and we're here, and I
thought, maybe we'll just kill

83
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:36,167
some time and let him sleep
a little bit longer before

84
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,920
we go inside and go play, okay?

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,973
And, no, I was not lying,
it is actually 106 degrees!

86
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:45,223
Oh my gosh! Poor little dude, so tired.

87
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,820
Look who's up and ready to play!

88
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:53,749
Check this out, we get
to have a little date!

89
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:56,318
They have food here, and so
they are getting a little

90
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,902
peanut butter and jelly and some fruit,

91
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:00,838
and they are happy, happy kids, huh?!

92
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:03,694
I think it's so awesome that
they have food and a play area.

93
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:06,224
Like, that is so nice, and
they even have food for me,

94
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:07,521
they're gonna make me like,

95
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:10,544
some chicken nuggets and stuff, so, yay!

96
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:12,072
- And they have chocolate milk!

97
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:13,603
- We're killing two birds with one stone,

98
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:16,047
eating lunch and playing, huh?!

99
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,176
Alright guys, we had a
blast at the playground,

100
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,911
and now I am at JoAnn's
and JoAnn's is like,

101
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,141
a fabric, craft store.

102
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:28,121
I am actually attempting to
make Fin's Halloween costume

103
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:30,021
this year, and I'm
really nervous about it.

104
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:33,561
I did make Olly's costume,
I believe, when he was two,

105
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:35,801
for his Halloween, so I'm
basically doing the same thing

106
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,820
for Olly, or for Fin, but
it is a different costume.

107
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,899
So, I'm basically
collecting all these things,

108
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,701
I'm making it completely from scratch,

109
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,141
I do not have anything to go
by, I'm very nervous about it,

110
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,101
I am pretty good when it
comes to things like this,

111
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:51,271
like, making it up as I go,
hopefully it turns out though.

112
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:53,561
Hey, why do you got so much styrofoam?

113
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,019
Do you need styrofoam?

114
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:55,901
- Yeah.

115
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,299
- Yeah? So, one thing's for
sure, when I'm doing projects

116
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,758
like these, I tend to not
know exactly what I'm doing,

117
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,191
but I usually figure it out,
but it takes me a long time.

118
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:07,051
I have been standing in
front of the buttons,

119
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:10,761
I swear, for like fifteen
minutes, and I cannot figure out

120
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:12,778
what button I am supposed to get.

121
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:16,161
I just want like, a snappy
button, for like, right here,

122
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:20,429
and I can't find it, I'm
probably staring right at it,

123
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:23,351
and I just don't know where
to look, which one is it?!

124
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:24,841
There's so many buttons!

125
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,811
I had no idea there were this
many buttons, like, seriously.

126
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:30,451
So, I feel so silly, I finally
ended up asking someone,

127
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,801
because I was staring at
those buttons, I was like,

128
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,690
"I don't get it, none of
them seem to like, work,

129
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,741
it's like it's only one
side, and I don't see

130
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,281
the other side that snaps into it!"

131
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:42,731
Turns out the little button
is snapped on to the paper!

132
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,550
Can you guys see? So that
is the back of the button,

133
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,969
and that's the back of the button,

134
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:51,168
and they're snapped onto
the paper, I feel so silly.

135
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:53,131
So anyways, finally figured that out,

136
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:55,474
and I think we are about
done, so we're headed out now.

137
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,484
Buh bye Fin!
- Bye!

138
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:01,785
- Have fun! He's like,
totally fine with it, uh oh!

139
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:04,070
You're about to go on a ride! Bye!

140
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,700
Mama's gonna go bye bye, 'kay?

141
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,899
- 'kay.

142
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,521
- See you later! I always do this to him,

143
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,710
so now he just doesn't even care.

144
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,291
(gasp) I almost left you in there huh!

145
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,124
- Yeah!

146
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:20,624
- Yeah! 'Kay, I'm going! Buh bye! Buh bye!

147
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:27,699
- Bye!

148
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,449
- (laughs) He still doesn't care!

149
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,761
You just don't believe Mama anymore huh?!

150
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:32,594
- Yeah.

151
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:35,402
- Yeah, you know I'm gonna get you huh?

152
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:38,106
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)

153
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:42,317
You're so cute! Okay, c'mon
bud, I can't leave you here.

154
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:44,411
What, now you just want to stay?

155
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,634
You spent the entire time in the store

156
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:48,442
demanding to get out of the cart,

157
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,397
and now that it's time to get
out, you don't wanna get out?

158
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:52,262
- No.

159
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,762
- Alright, grab 'em. Good job!

160
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,731
We are now grocery shopping,
and I gotta tell you,

161
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:05,080
it is so hard to grocery
shop with two kids.

162
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,462
I was really hoping to get
the cart that has like,

163
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:08,872
the two seats in it, so I have like,

164
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:12,243
the cart that I can fill up,
but it was not available.

165
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,577
And so now I have one
running around the store

166
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:17,482
trying to help me out,
and this one sitting here,

167
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:19,455
trying to climb out.

168
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:20,910
What are you doing?

169
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,369
I'm trying to get this shopping done,

170
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:25,369
is it too cold over in this section?

171
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,390
Alright, I was able to contain them

172
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,080
both in this little cart, one leg out.

173
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,440
That actually helps because
Fin gets very jealous

174
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,146
because Olly's running around,
but he wants to run around.

175
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:40,880
So hopefully we can just finish
up the last of our shopping

176
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,147
and be done, I think I
got all my groceries done,

177
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:46,173
I just have to get the other
items that is always like,

178
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:49,827
a pain! I still have
to grab like, tissues,

179
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,498
cleaning supplies, and all that stuff.

180
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:55,409
These boys! One minute they're fighting,

181
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,965
the next minute, they're
like, hugging each other,

182
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:01,074
and kissing each other, I just can't.

183
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:04,285
In a second this is gonna
turn into a fight. Here we go.

184
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,015
Okay, don't be so rough with him.

185
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:08,767
Hey, are you guys being loving and nice?

186
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,245
- Mmhmm.
- No!

187
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:14,055
- No? Oh my goodness! We're so close!

188
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,921
I'm out of room in the cart,

189
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,785
and I still need a few more things.

190
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:21,770
- No, no, no!
- Oh, I wanna see your mouth.

191
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,270
- Ahhhhhhh.
(Missy laughs)

192
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:29,726
Car is loaded up, and yes it is dark out.

193
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,313
I have been shopping all day!

194
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:35,386
I'm so ready to go home, let's go home.

195
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:39,386
Hey Olly, are you awake?
Hey bud? Are you awake?

196
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,423
Yeah, you're awake? Are you awake?

197
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:47,035
- Yeaaahhhhhhhhhhhh.

198
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:50,094
- Yeah? You kinda look
like you're sleeping bud.

199
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:54,572
Bud? Hey bud, you're not
answering, can you hear me?

200
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:55,489
- Mmmmmmmm.

201
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:00,574
- Well hey, Fin! Did you
go shopping with Mama?

202
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,801
- Yeah.
- Yeah? How did it go?

203
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:05,185
- Good.
- Did it go good?

204
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:06,018
- Yeah.

205
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:09,768
- Yeah? Did you almost
get left at the store?

206
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:13,485
I heard about what
happened at the store, Fin.

207
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,897
You're a crazy boy, you know that?

208
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:18,467
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)

209
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,085
- I'm glad you're safe though.

210
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:23,686
Karma definitely sees something
in our garage under here.

211
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:25,186
He's acting crazy.

212
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:28,424
Our garage is actually
a mess right now because

213
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:31,328
we're sorting through Halloween stuff,

214
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,978
decoration, costumes, party stuff.

215
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:36,476
We have so much Halloween
stuff that we're getting down

216
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,867
for the big Halloween party,

217
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:40,037
for decorating, all that fun stuff.

218
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,539
So yeah, our garage is a mess right now.

219
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,122
(upbeat music)

220
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:52,850
What are you doing over here, Olly?

221
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,209
Are you counting your money?

222
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,235
Do you want me to tell you how
much money you've got there?

223
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,909
- They're my pennies Fin.

224
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:59,792
- [Bryan] Fin trying to take your pennies?

225
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:00,660
- Mmhmmmmmmm.

226
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,828
- Okay, let me tell you what you have,

227
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:04,109
you have two quarters, those are actually,

228
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:07,859
that's not a quarter,
that is something else.

229
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:11,611
So, in American money, you have a quarter,

230
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,338
you have a nickel, you have a dime,

231
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:15,374
and you have three pennies,
but this one over here

232
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:18,709
is not American money,
you know what that is?

233
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:19,595
- What?

234
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:23,800
- [Bryan] I think that
this is from London.

235
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,470
- London? We go to London last time.

236
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,347
- [Bryan] We did go to London huh?

237
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:30,180
- Yeah.

238
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,804
- [Bryan] Yeah, have
you been keeping that?

239
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:32,637
- Yeah.

240
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,402
- [Bryan] It's a part of his
money collection you guys.

241
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:36,599
- So I can play a game.

242
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:39,491
- He's got 43 cents, um, so
I don't know if he's gonna

243
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:40,999
be able to play a game with that,

244
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:43,096
but this is a lot of money to you, huh?

245
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:43,929
- Yeah.

246
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:45,192
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's a
lot of money to some kids,

247
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,210
some kids don't have 43 cents.

248
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,392
- Yeah, so I can play games.

249
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:51,230
- [Bryan] Yeah, you can play
games with the money, 'kay?

250
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,063
- Okay.

251
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:54,134
- [Bryan] What's going
on with Mr. Grumpy Gills?

252
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:56,880
- He wants the two percent milk.

253
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,713
- [Bryan] Really?

254
00:10:57,713 --> 00:10:58,896
- It's whole milk, and I'm like,

255
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:01,103
"Okay, let me go do it"
and then I like, did it,

256
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:02,941
and then, you want it?

257
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:04,052
- Mmm mmm.

258
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:05,660
- [Bryan] So he requested
something special

259
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,608
and you faked him out?

260
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:07,939
- Mmhmmm
- [Bryan] And he's calling it?

261
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,051
- He saw it.

262
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:12,960
- [Bryan] Fin is Mr. Particular.
If he doesn't get the milk

263
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,181
he wants, if he doesn't
get the cup he wants,

264
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,127
it just makes for a very grumpy Fin.

265
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:20,239
- I was doing this! Glug,
glug, glug, glug, glug!

266
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:21,441
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, she's filling it up!

267
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:24,215
- [Missy] I filled it up! That looks good!

268
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:27,237
- He's saying, no you
didn't. No you didn't!

269
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:30,237
You guys, look what showed up today!

270
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:37,836
It's my own personal Porg
from the new Star Wars movie,

271
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:40,022
which Olly and I are so excited about.

272
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:43,567
Olly saw him in the trailer,
so I had to get one.

273
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,154
So I'm gonna show the boys
and see what they think

274
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:47,104
of this little guy, look how cool that is,

275
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,489
it's just a simple little toy.

276
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,572
(laughs)

277
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,500
What are Porgs by the way?

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,536
And are you guys gonna
go see the new Star Wars

279
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:57,123
movie when it comes out?

280
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,419
Let me know down below in the comments,

281
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,973
because Olly and I are both so excited,

282
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:03,687
and if you are a fan of Star Wars too,

283
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:06,300
what is your favorite Star Wars movie?

284
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,922
Leave that in the comments below as well.

285
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:13,089
Hey, Olly, Fin, I have
someone who wants to say hi!

286
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:20,709
Check it out Olly! What
do you think? Awwww!

287
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:29,654
Fin, look! Fin, look! Aww,
is that your best friend?

288
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:33,428
Okay, you just took it, okay.

289
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,840
Someone's still Mr. Grumpy Gills.

290
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,585
Are you Mr. Grumpy Fin still?

291
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:38,756
- Yeah.

292
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,423
- [Bryan] Poor Porg.

293
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:44,905
- I know, huh. Muah, muah, muah, awwww.

294
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,457
- [Bryan] He likes you!
Oh, Fin does not like him.

295
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:52,257
- I'm gonna give it a hug, oh, so cute!

296
00:12:52,257 --> 00:12:54,174
- [Bryan] Check it out, it moves too.

297
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,010
- [Missy] Oh my goodness, it's walking!

298
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,867
- [Bryan] Oh no, oh no! I just saved him!

299
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:01,284
Here he comes, here he comes!

300
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,096
- [Missy] Aww, he's so cute!

301
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,346
- [Bryan] You like him now?

302
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:15,939
- [Missy] Aww, give him a kiss!

303
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,473
- [Bryan] See, he's smiling now.

304
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:19,973
- [Missy] You give him a kiss?

305
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:24,162
- See? Star Wars heals, you guys!

306
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,745
(upbeat music)

307
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,789
I wanted to let you guys
know that if you wanted

308
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:41,118
to become a part of the
Tribe, we have brand new

309
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:43,390
Tribe shirts in the merch store.

310
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,967
This is what they look
like, they are awesome!

311
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:48,019
And it's like an all over design,

312
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,530
and each shirt is just
a little bit unique,

313
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,728
which is really, really cool,
and it says Tribe on it.

314
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:55,508
Its got the Daily Bumps tag on the sleeve,

315
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:57,872
which is really cool, so
go and check those out,

316
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,509
we have samples coming really soon.

317
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,063
So, we're hoping to get them any day now,

318
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,199
but really excited about
the new Tribe shirts

319
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,730

320
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,563
go get yourselves some
backpacks, pop sockets,

321
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:13,926
lunch boxes, hats, all
that fun stuff is up.

322
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,505
Karma is barking, something is going on,

323
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:19,500
what's going on Karma? Karma,
what are you barking at?

324
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
Are you not a fan of
this night time story?

325
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,727
- And the purple gemstone glowed,

326
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:27,894
it shot out a beam covering
both the Hulk and Spiderman.

327
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:31,871
- [Bryan] The story is
stressing out Karma. (laughs)

328
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,865
- [Missy] Do you wanna read
Dragons Love Tacos? Yeah?

329
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:37,589
- [Bryan] Do you like
Dragons Love Tacos, Olly?

330
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,984
- Mmhmmm, thanks for watching!

331
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,709
- That's right, thanks for
watching today's vlog guys,

332
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:42,920
be sure to give it a thumbs up.

333
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,864
- [Missy] Thumbs up Fin!

334
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:45,476
- [Bryan] Thumbs up
Fin, can you thumbs up?

335
00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:48,912
- Thumbs up! He put it up there.

336
