1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:01,768
- I just wanna like, mark off everything

2
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,530
on the United States
and then start working--

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,001
- [Bryan] I know, babe, I
have our passports, let's go.

4
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:05,891
- Let's do it.

5
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:08,724
- Where do you guys wanna go next?

6
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:15,621
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be

7
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:20,275
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset

8
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:24,909
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

9
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:27,997
♫ This is home

10
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:30,993
♫ Just running around
you never looked so cute

11
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:35,589
♫ Hugging you tight
cuddling all I could singing

12
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:38,605
♫ I am home

13
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,688
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

14
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,837
- Good morning.

15
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:49,644
What are you doing, Ollie?

16
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:50,931
- Going to school.

17
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,434
- You're going to school

18
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:55,259
and he is super excited for school today.

19
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,537
School is only twice a week.

20
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:58,103
He like, wakes up every day like,

21
00:00:58,103 --> 00:00:59,524
wait, so there's no school?

22
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:01,783
And I'm like, nope, just two times a week.

23
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:04,096
Are you gonna learn stuff today?

24
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,436
Alright, let's go.

25
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:08,716
I am back home and I
am trying to get things

26
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,584
cleaned up because me and Kelse actually

27
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:12,735
have a really fun day planned.

28
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:13,939
First we're going to the gym

29
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,083
which we went yesterday together

30
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,065
and it was so much fun.

31
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:19,347
I usually, well, I have
been going by myself

32
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:20,644
and it was pretty cool.

33
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:24,488
We got to like, do some
machines and run and it was fun

34
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:25,837
but we're gonna do the same things today

35
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:29,626
but for Kelsey's birthday
we are going to a spa

36
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,364
so I'm trying to get things
cleaned up before I leave

37
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:34,072
because Bryan's going
to be here with Corbin

38
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:36,644
with the kids and me and
Kelsey are peace-ing out.

39
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:37,632
That's what we're doing today.

40
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:39,333
We're really excited because
it's been a long time

41
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,482
since we've been to the
spa, so let's do this.

42
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:45,362
Are you gonna be good for your Papa?

43
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:46,877
Are you gonna be good and let your Momma

44
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,215
have fun today?

45
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:50,157
(laughs) She's like, um, I don't know.

46
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:51,402
Let's see how it goes.

47
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,480
You're so cute, alright,
you have a fun day, okay.

48
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,239
- Well hello guys.

49
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,662
Today has been a very busy day.

50
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:00,264
We've got lots of stuff to do this week

51
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:03,383
to prepare for our brand new family song

52
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:05,555
coming out on iTunes on Friday.

53
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:06,821
If you guys follow me on social media

54
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:08,183
you guys saw the announcement.

55
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:12,562
Our new family song, Tribe,
comes out this Friday

56
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:15,055
and I'm so excited
because we all sing on it.

57
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:16,944
It's so representative of families

58
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:18,844
and it's supposed to be
really empowering for families

59
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:21,391
and it's something that
we love and the boys love

60
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,298
and we're all so excited for
you guys to hear it, so yes,

61
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:25,331
new family song, coming out this Friday,

62
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:26,394
been preparing for that.

63
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:28,979
Ollie's at school and Finn is taking a nap

64
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,146
so I'm using this time
to get some stuff done,

65
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:32,568
and Missy's at the spa and she's having

66
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:34,852
like, an amazing day and she deserves it.

67
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,872
By the way, I just realized
all of my air plants

68
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:41,119
are taking a bath and they
are ready to get dried out.

69
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,207
So I love these air plants, I have a ton,

70
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:44,040
I'll show you right now.

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,086
These are all my air plants (laughs).

72
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:49,208
I actually just got a bunch
because they're so cheap

73
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,756
and they're so easy to take care of

74
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:52,721
and check out this one you guys.

75
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:53,554
So this is all you have to do.

76
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:56,245
All you have to do is soak
them for about 30 minutes

77
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:57,917
and then you let them dry.

78
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,592
Check out this air plant though,

79
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:02,489
it's starting to bloom.

80
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,200
That means it's gonna change colors.

81
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,398
Do you see those pinks
and purples coming in?

82
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:08,474
This whole thing is gonna look amazing

83
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:09,527
in just a couple days.

84
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:10,623
I'm gonna put it somewhere really cool

85
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,982
so that I can watch it.

86
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:14,565
(upbeat music)

87
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:17,555
So I think all you Harry Potter fans

88
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,864
will really appreciate
this, check this out.

89
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,400
I was just showing you all my air plants

90
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,104
and how I have them
scattered all over the house,

91
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,751
like in different, cool places,

92
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,309
well this is one of them.

93
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,422
These are my Harry
Potter trio collectables

94
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:31,239
and I have one of the
air plants right by Ron

95
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,759
because it reminds me of
the venomous tentacula.

96
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,367
That huge plant thing that like,

97
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,447
they had to like fight
in The Sorcerer's Stone.

98
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,283
So I was like, that's such
a cool place to display it,

99
00:03:40,283 --> 00:03:41,146
but check this out, I got the whole,

100
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,631
I got the whole trio.

101
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:44,503
I got Hermione with her time turner,

102
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:48,815
Harry and Ron is kind of
tangled up in the plant.

103
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,342
- [Missy] Oh hey there Finn.

104
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:55,098
Are you hanging out with
Daddy while he's working?

105
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:58,323
I'm home, me and Kelse
just got back from the spa

106
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:02,478
and it was so amazing, so
relaxing, it was so nice.

107
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:06,094
Bryan is now in his office
editing, working like crazy.

108
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:08,175
He has just been working so hard lately.

109
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:09,886
It's actually been kind of sad.

110
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:12,782
Like we actually have been so busy

111
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:15,067
and he's been working that
we haven't really hung out

112
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,478
as much as we're used to.

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,358
Like normally, in a day like me and Bryan

114
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,745
are together a lot and we're doing things

115
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:22,157
and making fun videos and stuff

116
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:24,515
and lately he's just been
like, doing a lot of work.

117
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,431
But it's good, it's all good stuff.

118
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:29,266
Anyways, I am home and just trying to get

119
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,201
the house cleaned up a little bit.

120
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:33,710
Natalia and Jeffry actually
picked up Ollie today

121
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,708
which was awesome because
Bryan was like, super busy

122
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,623
and I was at the spa and luckily

123
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:40,176
they were totally up for it

124
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:41,792
so I guess he's been
having a really fun day

125
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,058
with the Johnsons and I think they even

126
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,029
went out for like, ice cream or something.

127
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,053
So I'm sure he's happy.

128
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:50,059
Finn has been a crazy boy.

129
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:52,394
Huh, you been keeping Daddy busy?

130
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:53,227
- Yeah.

131
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,408
- Yeah, but I have missed Ollie so much.

132
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:57,109
We haven't seen him all day.

133
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,168
He's been at school and then out and about

134
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:01,068
so I think he's gonna be here soon

135
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:05,395
and I'm excited to see
him, but for now, dishes.

136
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,610
Guess what, Finn?

137
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,736
I hear your brother outside.

138
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,705
I think he's here, is he here?

139
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:12,705
- Hi Missy.
- Who's here?

140
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:18,383
- Did you know Oliver
got snow cones with us?

141
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,584
- [Missy] He got a snow cone?

142
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:23,775
It's all over your face (laughs).

143
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:26,503
Did you have fun at school, I missed you.

144
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:27,745
- I miss you.

145
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:28,828
- I miss you.

146
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,970
- [Bryan] Excuse, what's going on?

147
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,499
What are you guys doing in here?

148
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:39,039
Hi Peyton, how was school?
- Good.

149
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,782
- [Bryan] Good, let me see
what color is your mouth?

150
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:43,526
What color is your mouth?

151
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,462
What color is your mouth, Finn?

152
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:47,630
(laughs) Finn's is fine because
he didn't have snow cones.

153
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,898
What color is your mouth?

154
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:50,791
You're good too, did
you not eat snow cones?

155
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,434
- I had birthday cake.

156
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,702
- Oh, there we go.

157
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,284
- The cake is just white.

158
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:56,679
- Oh, okay.

159
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,345
Hi guys, how was school, Ollie?

160
00:05:58,345 --> 00:05:59,802
- Good.

161
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:01,033
- [Bryan] It was good?

162
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,822
Do you like going to preschool with Ollie?

163
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:07,055
Yeah, the Johnsons just
dropped off Ollie from school

164
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:08,982
and he did so good.

165
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:10,567
Okay, Ollie, did you eat
all your lunch at school?

166
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,294
- Yes.
- Did you take a nap?

167
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:13,960
- Yes.
- Did you learn things?

168
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,793
- Yes.

169
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:17,930
- Did you guys learn
about the letter H today?

170
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,493
- Yes, yes, yes.

171
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:21,471
- [Bryan] Ollie, what
starts with the letter H?

172
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:23,804
- Um, help.
- Help, good job.

173
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,483
He's got like, clown lips.

174
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,776
They're all just playing,
the kids are all just playing

175
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:30,658
in the guest room.

176
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,171
You guys are so funny,
alright, I'll leave you alone.

177
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,421
(laughing)

178
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:36,745
It's normal right, a bunch of kids

179
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:37,900
just playing in a closet?

180
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,184
Should we scare them?

181
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:43,601
(growling and screaming)

182
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:53,634
You guys are all trapped in here forever.

183
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:56,872
(growling and screaming)

184
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:59,249
- You guys, I am so excited

185
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:02,400
because today we had
someone come in and help us

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,574
clear out everything down there.

187
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:07,132
It was getting really
like, just full of weeds,

188
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:09,220
so much brush to the point where like,

189
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,844
you couldn't even drive
through it with the Polaris

190
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,792
but even just going down there,

191
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,999
it was just, know there's
like snakes and everything

192
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,532
living in it so I'm gonna go take

193
00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:18,564
a drive down there right
now and go check it out.

194
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:21,545
It looks so good though just from here so,

195
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:22,629
I'm gonna get the pups,

196
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:23,674
they've been sitting in the side yard

197
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:25,373
and I'm gonna go check it all out.

198
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:26,373
Hey puppies.

199
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:30,575
Do you guys want to go explore?

200
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,408
Come on.

201
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:33,254
And go.

202
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,431
Alright, we're taking the drive down

203
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:40,353
we've got the dogs loaded up.

204
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:42,538
We're gonna go check it out, okay boys?

205
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:43,950
- Okay.

206
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,263
- [Missy] Look at that.

207
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:48,164
It's so clean.

208
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:52,331
Wow, I guess the guy said
that there was even poison oak

209
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:56,380
growing all in here because
it's been like, neglected

210
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,939
for so long so hopefully we
can keep up on it from now on.

211
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,612
We really do want to make this whole area

212
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,990
just a really fun area, like a nice area

213
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,693
that you can walk through.

214
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,526
We want like a little decking area

215
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:11,067
to have like, picnics and stuff like that.

216
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,687
So we're super excited about this all

217
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,163
but we definitely had to start with just

218
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:17,132
clearing it all up and getting it ready.

219
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:20,084
Okay, do you guys
remember when I showed you

220
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,063
the amazing flower on this cactus?

221
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:26,702
Well now look at it, it's
completely shriveling up

222
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:28,884
into itself, it's turning
into a little ball

223
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,242
and then it's literally
just gonna crumble away

224
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:33,868
and check this out, overnight
this little guy popped up.

225
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:37,280
This is a brand new bud that's going to

226
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,402
turn into a flower just like that.

227
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:40,815
Isn't that incredible?

228
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:42,148
It's seriously like, out with the old,

229
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:45,819
in with the new overnight,
overnight you guys.

230
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,406
Funny thing is too, we might actually have

231
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:49,815
two big star flowers at
the same time on this thing

232
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:51,770
because there's two buds back here

233
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,191
and then there's three more in front.

234
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:55,810
This thing could possibly be full of them.

235
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,230
So neat, I love plants like that

236
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,152
where you can just like, see
them constantly changing.

237
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:02,384
And you guys are gonna get to see it too,

238
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:03,502
you guys are gonna get to see that one

239
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,626
turn into a new flower literally, probably

240
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,325
in the next couple of days.

241
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:10,773
Whoa, you like your new bean bag?

242
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,356
- Yeah.

243
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:13,419
- [Bryan] Do you like it?

244
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,252
And go.

245
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:17,312
(laughing)

246
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:18,895
He is a wild child.

247
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:21,954
He always has to put his
hands behind his back too.

248
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:23,537
Look, okay, and go.

249
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,101
He's getting really good
at that jump though.

250
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,179
Check out these new bean bags.

251
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,960
These are the boys' new bean
bags for their playroom.

252
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,267
They're a little big.

253
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,982
- They are a little bigger than we hoped

254
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:37,565
but we really needed new ones.

255
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:39,852
Those ones were so dirty and
we can't take the covers off.

256
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,096
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's right.

257
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:43,461
And this one has a big pocket
too which is really cool.

258
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:45,073
Kind of looks like a wolf.

259
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:47,571
The one thing we haven't
shown you guys yet

260
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:51,654
is our new map of the
world, world, world, world.

261
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:55,644
So I found this map on Amazon

262
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:57,903
and it's one of those maps that you

263
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:00,621
scratch the places of where you've been.

264
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:03,269
So right now it's kind of
boring and black and white

265
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,735
but we gotta fill this baby out.

266
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:05,903
We gotta scratch where we've been.

267
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:07,252
We gotta travel the world.

268
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,369
- This one's really cool because

269
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,916
it has like, every name
of all the countries

270
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,525
and even the states which is neat.

271
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,812
And then it also has all
the wonders of the world

272
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:17,124
which we've been to quite a few of

273
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,334
so that'll be fun to scratch off

274
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,853
and then all the flags.

275
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,403
- [Bryan] The flags of
where you visited too.

276
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:22,841
- So that's really, I'm excited.

277
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:25,368
(laughing)

278
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:26,728
- [Bryan] Yeah, and so the more we travel

279
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:28,676
the more colorful this map will get.

280
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:30,306
I think it'll just be
something really cool

281
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:31,139
for our family to have.

282
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,628
- It's actually kind
of inspiring to go more

283
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,204
because you're like I wanna get them all.

284
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:36,550
- [Bryan] Totally, I'm like, Russia,

285
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,092
that'd be a nice big
color, maybe we should

286
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:38,925
just go there real quick.

287
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:39,758
- We can just go there real quick,

288
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:41,762
maybe we'll do like, we'll go to Finland

289
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:42,780
and then just pop over to Russia

290
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,094
and then we can mark that right off.

291
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,471
- [Bryan] Yeah, pretty cool.

292
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,638
So we're gonna scratch this thing off?

293
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:49,471
- Yeah, let's do it.

294
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,187
- [Bryan] It came with a little scratcher.

295
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:54,923
Alright, Finn, this is
our map of the world.

296
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:56,676
Ollie, have you seen our new map?

297
00:10:56,676 --> 00:10:57,509
- Yeah.

298
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:00,380
- [Bryan] Remember all the
cool places that we've been?

299
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,758
Remember when we went to London?

300
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:02,591
- [Oliver] Yep.

301
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:05,762
- [Bryan] Yep, well we get
to do that one right here,

302
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:08,025
we have United Kingdom and France.

303
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:09,569
Finn's like, let me at it let me at it,

304
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,319
I'll scratch the whole thing off.

305
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,507
That is so cool.

306
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:21,139
Look at California
Missy, it's bright blue.

307
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,960
- [Missy] That is so neat.

308
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,293
- [Bryan] Alright, I'm gonna do Florida.

309
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:30,826
See what color it is.

310
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,068
Looks like a purpley-blue.

311
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,337
- [Missy] Like a dark blue maybe?

312
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:37,543
- [Bryan] Oh, this is hard.

313
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,198
- [Missy] I know.

314
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,031
- [Bryan] It's okay if we get into it.

315
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,698
Oh, and Alabama too.

316
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,559
Been there done that.

317
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,226
(playful music)

318
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:09,612
Definitely been to Canada.

319
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,557
Just a little piece of it.

320
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:14,829
CN Tower, this city is so cool.

321
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,789
We definitely have been to Hawaii.

322
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:19,654
That is the most amazing (mumbles)

323
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:22,275
I have ever seen in my life.

324
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,754
Hawaiian pineapple babe.

325
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,851
We found St. Croix,

326
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:28,066
we've been to this
little island right here.

327
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:31,627
So this is the Caribbean Sea
you guys, it's beautiful.

328
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,294
(playful music)

329
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,964
So now that we've done
the top half of the map

330
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:52,270
of where we've been,

331
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,980
we get to come down here
to the wonders of the world

332
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,021
where we get to check off
all the wonders of the world

333
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:59,928
where we've been and all of the flags.

334
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:02,595
(playful music)

335
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:25,373
- Where were you?

336
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:29,675
- We live right down here
in Southern California

337
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,250
where it's nice and hot.

338
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,842
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

339
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:36,335
Look at our travels you
guys, this is so cool.

340
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:38,195
We've got five wonders of the world,

341
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:39,789
we've got a bunch of flags.

342
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:41,032
- Yay, this looks so cool.

343
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:41,865
- [Bryan] It's exciting.

344
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,461
- Now I just wanna mark off everything

345
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:45,234
on the United States
and then start working--

346
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:46,592
- [Bryan] Babe, I have
our passports, let's go.

347
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,759
- Let's do it.

348
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,166
You wanna go?
- Yeah.

349
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,372
- Where do you guys wanna go next?

350
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:55,692
- Disneyland.
(laughing)

351
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:58,253
