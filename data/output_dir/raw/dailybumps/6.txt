1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
- [Woman] Finn, you got
to take your boots off.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,000
(laughs)

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,261

15
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,220
- Good morning, guys, so I want to share

16
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,300
with you guys something
a little bit exciting.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,550
It's a little bit exciting so today,

18
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,860
I am wearing a size large shirt.

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,600
I haven't worn a large shirt since I was

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,410
in high school probably,
this is a Ravenclaw shirt.

21
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,580
Someone actually gave me this as a gift

22
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,710
which I completely understand,

23
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,750
they don't know my size
if I'm a large or an XL.

24
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,500
I've been an XL for probably three years

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,800
and I'm probably a lot more
comfortable in them now

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,460
but today I saw this large shirt

27
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,050
and I was like, I'm gonna put this on

28
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,580
and look it actually fits,
you guys, that's pretty cool.

29
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,800
You know how you always keep
those clothes in your closet

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,620
that are just a little bit too
small and you're like, well,

31
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,200
maybe if I lose some weight,
I'll be able to fit in them.

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,890
I don't really have a whole
lot of clothes like that.

33
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,310
I never did that (laughs)
so this is probably

34
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,310
the only thing, size large
shirt that I will wear

35
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,890
at this point in time but anyway,

36
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,590
it's a beautiful day and Missy

37
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,780
is getting the boys ready for swim class.

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,690
- Is the new Jurassic World out?

39
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,210
- No, it's not, Ollie (laughs)

40
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,740
Every morning Ollie asks me if
the new Jurassic World is out

41
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,880
because he saw the movie
trailer during the Superbowl.

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,900
It's so funny, you're
more excited about that

43
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,540
than Solo, huh?
- Yeah.

44
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,670
- 'Kay but I'm excited for Solo

45
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,911
so you've got to go see
the Han Solo with me

46
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:41,140
and I will go see the Jurassic
World movie with you, okay?

47
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,973
- Yeah.
- Okay.

48
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,032
Hey, are you going to swim class today?

49
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:43,865
- Yes!

50
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:44,698
- [Bryan] Are you so excited?

51
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:45,531
- Yes!

52
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:46,690
- [Bryan] You gonna be a
good boy for the teacher?

53
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,523
- Yeah.

54
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:48,740
- [Bryan] And show him all
your cool new swim moves?

55
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,981
- Yeah.
- Okay.

56
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:51,390
(yells)

57
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,646
- [Bryan] Good morning, Finn,
you getting your socks on?

58
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,479
(babbles)

59
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,519
- [Bryan] I love how all the dogs

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,916
are just all over the place all the time.

61
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,370
- I know, they're always with us.

62
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,980
- [Bryan] Boys, your guys'
room is a mess today.

63
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,989
Are you gonna clean it
or hide in the tent?

64
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,297
- Hide in the tent.

65
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:06,660
(laughs)
Yeah!

66
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,860
- [Bryan] This is how
Finn leaves the house.

67
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,203
He's just hanging onto Missy.

68
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:14,416
- He just grabs onto me if I sit down.

69
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,000
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,490
- [Bryan] Hang on, use your feet! (laughs)

71
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,440
First class service, look at that, whoa!

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,100
You almost ran into me, dude.

73
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,905
Alright, Ollie's taking
his own car to swim class.

74
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,450
(laughs)

75
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,945
Finn's like wait, I want to
drive with the man. (laughs)

76
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:33,572
Have fun at swim class!

77
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:36,340
- Bye, I'm going to swim class.

78
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,333
(rattles)

79
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,230
Yeah! (laughs)

80
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,330
- Who's ready for swim class?

81
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,290
- Me!
(screams)

82
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,450
- They are so excited,
it has been a little bit

83
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,620
of a while since we have done swim class

84
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,970
and we took a bit of a break,
can't remember exactly why.

85
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,970
I felt like Ollie was
just a little stagnant.

86
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,540
He wasn't really going anywhere

87
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,060
and that Finn was in a guppy class

88
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,170
and I think I was just over
getting in and out for him.

89
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,560
So anyways, they are both
going into private classes

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,580
which is the first time for both of them.

91
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,150
Ollie did semi-private with Peyton.

92
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,470
That was really fun and
really really good for him.

93
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,030
Finn has always done guppy classes

94
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,070
which is with other kids
so I'm super excited.

95
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,880
I think Ollie's going to do amazing

96
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,020
'cause now that he's in preschool,

97
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,564
he knows all about teachers
and how you gotta listen, huh?

98
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,600
Yeah, so I think he's
gonna do really good.

99
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,830
I'm really excited just
to get him progressing

100
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,660
with his strokes and I'm
hoping that, you know,

101
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,230
with a little bit of lessons and stuff,

102
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,360
maybe he can eventually
go into a swim team

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,930
or competition type stuff
since you guys know.

104
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,299
He is literally the most amazing swimmer,

105
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,300
a four year-old swimmer I've ever seen.

106
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,280
You amaze me all the time and then Finn,

107
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,160
we definitely want to get
him safe in the water.

108
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,380
He's not quite there so
I think he'll do good.

109
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,930
He might need me 'cause
I don't know if he's ever

110
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,670
been away from me or
done a class without me.

111
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,070
So it will be interesting to see

112
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,950
but he'll have his brother
there to show him the ropes

113
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,780
and so I'm really excited
to see how they do.

114
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,827
Let's head to swim class, 'kay?

115
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,233
- Yeah!

116
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:12,070
- We are almost there, guys,
I'm so excited to go in!

117
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:14,710
- [Missy] To go in the pool?

118
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,634
- Yeah!

119
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:16,875
- [Missy] Are you excited to learn?

120
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,399
- Yeah!

121
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,232
(yells)

122
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,878
- We are here, guys!

123
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,363
- [Missy] Wahoo!

124
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,530
(babbles)

125
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:28,540
- [Missy] Are you excited?

126
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,890
Finn, are you excited?

127
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,144
Okay, we've got Mimi and Papa.

128
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,360
Are you excited? (laughs)

129
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,531
- Finn, you excited?
- Yeah!

130
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,331
- [Missy] Finn, you got
to take your boots off.

131
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:45,086
(laughs)

132
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:46,899
You look so cute, are you ready?

133
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:47,732
- Yeah.

134
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,870
Ollie, your brother got right in.

135
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,240
Are you proud of him, how cool, huh?

136
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:55,756
(upbeat music)

137
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:24,880
So they actually have two separate

138
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,170
private classes right now
and they're at the same time

139
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,340
which is really nice
because we're not trying

140
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,570
to keep one under control,
the other one's running around

141
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,910
or the other one's
swimming and vice versa.

142
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,800
So it's really convenient and
I think that they kind of,

143
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,120
Finn definitely sees
that Ollie's doing stuff

144
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,840
so he wants to do that too
so I'm so proud of them.

145
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,962
They're both doing really good.

146
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,545
(upbeat music)

147
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:40,110
Boys, you did so good

148
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,300
in swim class, I'm so proud of you!

149
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,550
Ollie listened so well and I know that

150
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,890
within no time, you're
gonna be like Aquaman,

151
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,700
swimming so fast, huh, do you want to go

152
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,889
into a swim team one
day and do competitions?

153
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,757
- Yes!
- Yeah? (laughs)

154
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:59,090
- How about we can do a swim race?

155
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,461
- A swim race, totally.

156
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,910
And Finn was even listening so well.

157
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,320
She said, "put your feet in the water."

158
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
He did it and I think that within no time,

159
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,500
he's gonna be floating on
his back and super safe.

160
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,420
Now we are headed into
a little grocery store.

161
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,702
We gonna go grocery shopping?

162
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:14,535
- Yeah.

163
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,695
- [Missy] Okay, with Mimi and Papa?

164
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:16,540
- Yeah.

165
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,450
- So this morning, when Ollie ran

166
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,640
into our bed, he told me
something really funny.

167
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,310
He told me that he had a dream

168
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,840
and I was like no way, what was it about?

169
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,500
And he was so excited, he told me,

170
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
he told Missy, he's told
everyone that he's seen today.

171
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,950
It's the funniest thing but I'm
gonna let him tell you guys.

172
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,667
Okay, so what happened, you had a dream?

173
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,500
- Mmhm.

174
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,707
- [Bryan] And what happened in the dream?

175
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:42,707
- It was about Momma giving
me a fire scorpion tattoo.

176
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,362
- [Bryan] She gave you
a fire scorpion tattoo?

177
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:46,195
- Yeah.

178
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:47,028
- [Bryan] And where was it?

179
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:48,753
- One was right here, one was right here,

180
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:50,690
and one was right here.

181
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,740
- [Bryan] So Momma gave you
three fire scorpion tattoos?

182
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,810
- Yeah.

183
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,590
- [Bryan] Whoa, what color were they?

184
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,567
- They was red.

185
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,080
- Red?
- Yeah.

186
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,464
- [Bryan] That is nuts.

187
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:05,464
- And then Momma gave me
a black one right here.

188
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,320
- [Bryan] Oh really,
so Momma was giving you

189
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,544
tattoos in your dream?

190
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:11,540
- Actually the black one was right here.

191
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,200
- [Bryan] Oh, okay, then you got a tattoo

192
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,850
from swim today huh, that's cool.

193
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,240
Ollie, have you had other dreams?

194
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,210
- Um, no, just one.

195
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,631
- [Bryan] That's the only
dream you've had so far?

196
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,830
- Yeah.

197
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,342
- [Bryan] Yeah, was it fun?

198
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:23,360
- Mmhm.

199
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,130
- It wasn't scary, huh?

200
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,000
I think that, technically,
was Ollie's first dream

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,833
that he's ever had.

202
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,453
- I have one more thing.
- What?

203
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:34,289
- That was a lie!
- Okay (laughs)

204
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,429
- That's never happened
before, that was so funny.

205
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,269
I think that was Ollie's
first dream, you guys.

206
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,929
I think he had a dream that Missy

207
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,295
was giving him a tattoo, that's so funny.

208
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:45,711
(coos)
- It's a heart?

209
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:46,711
- Yeah!
- Aw.

210
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,410
- [Bryan] So the boys
have Valentine's Day cards

211
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,220
and they're going to exchange them, right?

212
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,250
Oh, wait, you already
did exchange them, right?

213
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,660
So this is to Ollie from Finn

214
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,557
and this one is to Finn, love Ollie, huh.

215
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:02,390
- Yeah!

216
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:08,460
- Finn is very excited, okay,
you basically just found a way

217
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,082
to get a lollipop out of this, right?

218
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,030
- Yeah.
- Yeah (laughs)

219
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,240
- [Bryan] By the way, Finn
is wearing his Disney jacket

220
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,410
when we went and did a
bunch of Star Wars stuff

221
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,049
so that's why he says that,
he looks so cute in it though.

222
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,170
Alright, you can open
up the lollipop, boys.

223
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,030
Oh, can Karma get a lick?

224
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,863
- No.

225
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:26,143
- [Bryan] No, come on, give him one lick.

226
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:29,349
- No!
(yells)

227
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,440
- [Bryan] Do you want me to open it?

228
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,716
Got it, there you go, buddy.

229
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,399
- Can you put this somewhere?

230
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,423
- [Bryan] Sure, I will put
this in your memory box, okay?

231
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:40,974
- Okay.
(laughs)

232
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:43,714
This tastes like cherries.
- Yeah.

233
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:44,738
- [Bryan] Is it yummy?

234
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:45,571
- Try it!

235
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,270
- [Bryan] Try it, guys, try it, try it!

236
00:09:48,270 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
