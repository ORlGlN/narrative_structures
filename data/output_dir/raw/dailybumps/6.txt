00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,520
- [Bryan] All the doggies
are hanging out in my office.

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,814
Oh, you giving Karma love?

3
00:00:03,814 --> 00:00:04,910
(Bryan laughs)

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,082

16
00:00:27,572 --> 00:00:29,701
- [Both] Good morning.

17
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,409
- Good morning, boys.

18
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,057
We're all dressed and ready for the day.

19
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:35,000
- Yeah!

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,330
- [Bryan] Yes, we are.

21
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,317
Ollie is headed to school today, right?

22
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,150
- Yeah.

23
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,990
- And we got a couple
things to do before we go,

24
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,016
so let's go, come on.

25
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:43,430
Good morning, guys.

26
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,440
I am still holdin' down
the fort over here,

27
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,051
and I'm getting stuff ready
for Ollie to go to school.

28
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,623
I got this handy-dandy note from Missy,

29
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:52,831
telling me what to pack for Ollie's lunch.

30
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:55,810
And we basically had everything
except for apple slices,

31
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,366
so you're gonna get a
banana instead, okay?

32
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:58,520
- Okay.

33
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,670
- [Bryan] But we've got
his peanut butter and jelly

34
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,010
and graham crackers, banana,

35
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,840
peanut butter to dip his banana in.

36
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,201
I think he's all set.

37
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,893
All right, Ollie, here's
your lunch for school,

38
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:09,726
okay?

39
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:11,040
- Okay.

40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,030
- [Bryan] And then
today is also Share Day,

41
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,380
and it's the letter M.

42
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,493
So, Ollie, what you're gonna
do when you get to school,

43
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,170
you gotta grab the monkey

44
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,916
that you sleep with during nap time,

45
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,759
and that's gonna be your share toy, okay?

46
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,650
- Okay.

47
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,990
- All right.

48
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,603
Climb in, kiddos.

49
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,323
Climb in, Ollie,

50
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:28,763
walk all the way back.

51
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:32,060
(Bryan laughs)

52
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,600
Look at them, they just both climb in.

53
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,793
It is early, you guys,
but we are making it work.

54
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:39,218
I'm gonna try and get
Ollie to school on time.

55
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:41,520
Almost forgot jackets, you guys,

56
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,140
and it's a cold one today.

57
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,380
Oh, and I do not want to forget my tea.

58
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,734
I'm gonna need this this morning.

59
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:50,317
(upbeat music)

60
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,420
Not only did we make it
to Ollie's school on time,

61
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,950
we've got two minutes to spare.

62
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,183
That's pretty` good, huh, dude?

63
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:03,016
- Yeah.

64
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:03,953
- [Bryan] Are you proud of Daddy, boys?

65
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:05,549
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)

66
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,132
(upbeat music)

67
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:11,310
- Can you shut the door?

68
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,344
Come on, try it.

69
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:13,683
You did it.

70
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:16,162
It's a heavy door.

71
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:18,745
(upbeat music)

72
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,410
All right.

73
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,919
Gotta take the picture, right, Ollie?

74
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,752
- Yeah.

75
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:25,920
- [Bryan] All right, big smile.

76
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,730
Good job.

77
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,563
All right.

78
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:30,430
I got Ollie dropped off at school

79
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,870
and now I'm going through Starbucks

80
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,700
because I need food so bad.

81
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,080
I drank all my tea, so
I have lots of energy.

82
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,110
But yeah, my belly is, like, feed me.

83
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,943
(laughs)

84
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:40,776
So I'm gonna get some food.

85
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,453
Hey, Finney, do you want something to eat?

86
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,080
- No.
- No?

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,108
Are you sure you don't
want a pumpkin bread?

88
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:47,810
(baby talk)

89
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,726
You want pumpkin bread?

90
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:49,559
- Yeah.

91
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,392
- [Bryan] Yeah?

92
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:51,225
Do you want it warmed up?
- Yeah.

93
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,290
- Okay.

94
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,417
Oh my gosh, all that looks so good.

95
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,730
Finn has been my little buddy today

96
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,220
ever since I dropped Ollie off.

97
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,130
We actually even went to the city

98
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,510
because I had to file a bunch of permits

99
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,198
and stuff for, like, business-y things.

100
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:05,320
And he was so good in the office,

101
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,680
he didn't make any noise.

102
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,883
And he was super cute and
everyone loved him, like usual.

103
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,304
I love hanging with you, dude.

104
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:13,750
(laughs)

105
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,600
Even though you can be
a little punk sometimes.

106
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,141
Don't try to kick my camera.

107
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:21,583
Oh, we got some hot and
steamy fresh pumpkin bread.

108
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,764
What do you say, Finn?

109
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:24,790
- Thank you.

110
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,893
- [Bryan] You're welcome.

111
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,550
Does that look yummy?

112
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,383
- Yeah.

113
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:30,270
- [Bryan] Yeah?

114
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,970
Here's the rain they've been telling us

115
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,750
we were gonna get forever now, you guys.

116
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,247
It finally just started.

117
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,426
I got a ham and cheese
foldover for breakfast.

118
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,157
This is what Missy always gets
when she goes to Starbucks.

119
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:43,365
Now I'm missing her a little bit more.

120
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,150
(laughs)

121
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,240
So it's been a really good day,

122
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,189
and it's actually been a
really good couple of days

123
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,569
with the boys, but I wanted
to talk about something

124
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,710
that happened yesterday,

125
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,520
something a little bit more serious

126
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,810
that I haven't really ever
talked about on this channel.

127
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,244
I've been somewhat open with this

128
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:02,934
on social media and Instagram.

129
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:05,890
I've gotten a lot of really great feedback

130
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,940
and encouragement and I love that,

131
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,400
but I had an issue yesterday

132
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,523
where I actually had a panic attack.

133
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:17,180
I try not to think about it,
because sometimes it's...

134
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,735
Even when I talk about it
or I remember the moment,

135
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:24,024
my body starts mimicking
those same physicalities.

136
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:25,714
It was tough.

137
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:27,890
Missy texted me something.

138
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,030
It was completely innocent.

139
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,122
I think it was about work
or taxes or something,

140
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:38,122
and it instantly just hit me in the chest.

141
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,660
And my heart started beating

142
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,550
really, really fast, uncontrollably.

143
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,900
I was having trouble breathing.

144
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,370
I was really short of breath.

145
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,830
I started shaking,

146
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,310
and I actually had to pull
over on the side of the road

147
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,437
and just calm myself down.

148
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:58,867
In that moment, I knew that
I was having a panic attack,

149
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:02,114
and it was so frustrating

150
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,400
because it's like,

151
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,530
I had no control, no control whatsoever

152
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,610
over my physical body, and that it was...

153
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,660
It makes it ten times scarier, I think,

154
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,230
when you don't know why
your body is reacting

155
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,370
a certain way to something.

156
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,390
I feel like the last couple
times this has happened,

157
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,490
it's when we had a fire
really close to our house

158
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,190
and we were packing up our house

159
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,784
and getting things if
we needed to evacuate.

160
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,590
That was when I think I last
felt something like this.

161
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,482
But it was tough and I had to

162
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:31,940
sit on the side of the road

163
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,775
and I had to calm myself down.

164
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:37,110
I think a lot of people
look at these videos

165
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,180
and they see us being a happy,
healthy family, and we are.

166
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,720
Trust me, we are.

167
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,480
But we do have issues that
we have to work through.

168
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,860
And I think that's why
it's one of those things

169
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,058
I wanna be open about

170
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,150
because anxiety and panic attacks

171
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,360
is something that a lot
of normal people deal with

172
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,420
on a regular basis,

173
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,377
and it's all about managing it
and knowing what triggers it.

174
00:06:00,377 --> 00:06:03,370
So yeah, I wanted to just sit here

175
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,680
and be real with you guys for a minute

176
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,790
and let you guys really know
what I am going through,

177
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,257
and I just need to work on managing.

178
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:12,787
But if you are someone who
deals with high anxiety

179
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,140
or suffers from panic attacks,

180
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,287
I'm here to tell you
that you are not alone.

181
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,497
I know what you're going through, and

182
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:21,890
we can do this together, you know?

183
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,760
What, Finney? What?

184
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,600
You got some knowledge to drop
on me to make my day better?

185
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,614
You're all done eatin'?

186
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:28,447
- Yeah.

187
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,821
- [Bryan] Okay, here, let me take it.

188
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:31,465
Was that yummy?

189
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:32,817
(baby talk)

190
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:33,770
Yeah.

191
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,140
All the doggies are
hanging out in my office.

192
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,637
Oh, you giving Karma love?

193
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:38,540
(Bryan laughs)

194
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,830
Karma needs love, yeah.

195
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,910
Look at this rain, you guys.

196
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,502
It is pouring outside.

197
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:46,064
Ooh, I just put...

198
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:47,390
which one did I do...

199
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,910
Citrus Bliss in this diffuser,

200
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,160
and it smells so good.

201
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,247
- Gimee!

202
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,252
- [Bryan] Is this yours?

203
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:55,085
- Yeah.

204
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,385
- You can play.

205
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:57,530
Yeah.

206
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,440
I love his little thank-you,

207
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,837
it's like "raht-raht."

208
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,340
(laughs)

209
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,150
Hey, don't drop it, silly.

210
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,801
Ollie, how was school today?

211
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:05,634
- Good.

212
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,467
- [Bryan] Good?

213
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,300
What did you share?

214
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,670
- I shared

215
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,780
my little monkey

216
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,480
that I always sleep with at school.

217
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,686
- You did?

218
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:15,519
- [Oliver] Yeah.

219
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,352
- That's awesome!

220
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,185
And what did they think of it?

221
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:18,018
- Good.

222
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:18,990
- They thought it was good?

223
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,823
Yeah?

224
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:22,680
We just got back from playing
over at a friend's house,

225
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,558
and the boys had so much fun.

226
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:26,490
We kinda just had a chill day.

227
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,813
It rained all day,

228
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:30,664
and Finn took a three-hour nap.

229
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:32,636
So it was pretty awesome.

230
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,590
- A firetruck.

231
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,375
- [Bryan] Whoa, that's
a big firetruck, huh?

232
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,208
Yeah?

233
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,280
I think it's time to put
these kids to bed, though,

234
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,355
what do you think?

235
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:42,355
- [Both] Good.

236
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:43,765
- That was a pretty eventful day, huh?

237
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:44,770
(boys affirmatively respond)

238
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,695
You guys miss Mommy?

239
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:47,140
(boys affirmatively respond)

240
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,880
But you've been having
fun with Daddy, right?

241
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,713
- [Both] Yeah.

242
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:50,546
- Yeah?

243
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:51,516
I love you, guys.

244
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:52,604
- I love you, too.

245
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:55,800
- If you want him to make videos,

246
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,670
give a thumbs-up if you enjoy it.

247
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,000
See you (speaks in foreign language).

248
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,833
- Yep.

249
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,210
We will see ya (speaks
in foreign language).

250
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,043
All right, Finnie,

251
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:03,930
you're gonna do the Bye-boop, okay?

252
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,763
- [Finley] Kay.

253
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:06,194
- See how he does.

254
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,027
All right, you ready?

255
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:07,860
- Yeah.
- And go.

256
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,693
- Bye!

257
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:11,764
Bop!

258
00:08:11,764 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
