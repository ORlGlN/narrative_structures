00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:05,064
- Hey guys, and welcome to
a very, very special video.

2
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:06,714
Today's video is so exciting because

3
00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:08,891
we are not only showing you guys,

4
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,911
but we are showing Ollie and Finn

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:14,180
their very first shared bedroom,

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,600
for the first time ever,
and we are so excited!

♪ Live it forever ♪

11
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,277
So, both of our boys are at the stage

12
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:26,642
where they both need something.

13
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:28,198
Ollie is really having trouble

14
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:29,454
being in his room on his own.

15
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:31,295
He gets scared, he wants to cuddle

16
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:32,128
in the middle of the night still,

17
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,703
he's having trouble
sleeping through the night.

18
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:35,495
Finn is still sleeping in his crib

19
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:37,287
and he is actually ready to transition

20
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,476
out of the crib and go into a bed.

21
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:43,279
So we thought, let's put
them both in the same room.

22
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,955
Let's give them both big beds

23
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:47,912
because Ollie definitely
needs a bigger bed.

24
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:49,694
And let's make this something
really, really special

25
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:51,671
that they can just cherish forever.

26
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:53,279
I think they're going to be
really excited when they see it.

27
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,062
- We've always actually thought about,

28
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:57,671
maybe one day, our kids sharing rooms

29
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,050
and I think it's really exciting

30
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,234
that they actually both
really want to share a room.

31
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,812
- They want to so bad.

32
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,171
- We basically do bedtime
together completely

33
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:08,415
and sometimes they even
both fall asleep together

34
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:09,972
and I have to take Finn out

35
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:12,413
because there's just not
enough room on a twin bed

36
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:14,591
for both of them without
waking themselves up

37
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,018
and kicking each other off.

38
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:18,127
So now they're both going to have room.

39
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:19,223
They can sleep together.

40
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:21,515
They can be in the same bed or same room.

41
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,355
- And I think, too,
let's put them in a room

42
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:24,650
while they like each other still.

43
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,483
- Yeah, totally.

44
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:26,572
- Because they're like best friends.

45
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:27,580
They want to be in the same room.

46
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,410
- I even shared a room with my brother

47
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,676
when I was younger and I think

48
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:33,036
it totally is a great
thing for kids to do.

49
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:35,739
I mean, if you can, I say why not?

50
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,989
You know, until there's a problem not to,

51
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,096
I say go for it.

52
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,230
So we're super excited.

53
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,435
- The room is big and
it turned out so good.

54
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:46,884
I've been buying and
looking and storing things.

55
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:48,967
We actually used a lot of
things from Finn's room

56
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:50,740
and Ollie's room, which is really cool.

57
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,764
And it all just kind of
came together so nice.

58
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:54,597
- Yeah.

59
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:55,489
- Should we show the boys?

60
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:56,530
- Let's, go show them.

61
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,697
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, Finn I
have something to show you guys.

62
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,229
Are you so excited to see your new room?

63
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,188
- Yeah!

64
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:06,972
- Alright Ollie, what are you most excited

65
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:08,663
about in sharing a room?

66
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:09,804
- Um, with Finn!

67
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:11,403
- You're excited about being with Finn?

68
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:12,414
- Yeah!

69
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:14,482
- [Bryan] 'Cause you and your
brother are good friends, huh?

70
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:15,974
- [Ollie] Yeah.

71
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:17,450
- [Bryan] Finn, are you
excited to see your new bed?

72
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,442
- Yeah.

73
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:19,811
- [Bryan] You're going to be
sleeping in Ollie's room now.

74
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,749
It's going to be your guys's room, OK?

75
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:22,582
- [Ollie] OK?

76
00:02:22,582 --> 00:02:23,415
- [Missy] And it's going
to be your room too.

77
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:25,553
- [Bryan] Are you trying to peek?

78
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:26,950
The boys are so excited.

79
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,491
- [Missy] They've been waiting all day.

80
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:29,582
- [Bryan] Hang on, hang on.

81
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,999
Come on in, boys.

82
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,983
(dramatic music)

83
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:57,876
What do you think?

84
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:58,750
- [Ollie] It's good.

85
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,329
- [Bryan] Is that your new bed, Finn?

86
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:02,941
He's just, like, looking at everything

87
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:04,098
like he's so excited.

88
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:05,139
What is that?

89
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,006
- A tent.

90
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:06,882
- [Bryan] That's your tent, bro.

91
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,329
Go inside and check it out.

92
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:10,802
Oh, you want to check out the bed, huh?

93
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:13,003
- [Missy] Oh my goodness,
what is this, Ollie?

94
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,269
- [Bryan] This is your new bed.

95
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,797
Whoa, is that a giant acorn?

96
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:16,725
- Yeah!

97
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,080
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

98
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,936
So, Ollie, check this out, bro.

99
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,393
When you are in your bed,

100
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:24,324
you can look out your window
- I'm (unintelligible)

101
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:26,876
and you can see a squirrel!

102
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,251
Look at that squirrel.

103
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,810
He's looking at you.

104
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,803
You know why?

105
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:31,636
- Why?

106
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:32,720
- Well because you have
the big acorn, right?

107
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,607
- Yeah.

108
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:34,824
- Yeah, he's looking at your acorn.

109
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:36,889
He's like, hey, give me that acorn.

110
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,176
- (unintelligible)

111
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,537
- [Bryan] It's your acorn.

112
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:42,264
Hey Finn, do you want to see your bed?

113
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,837
You're going to sleep
right underneath Ollie.

114
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:44,670
Come here.

115
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,830
Isn't that exciting?

116
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,931
(squeals of delight)

117
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,019
(laughter)

118
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,418
He's so excited.

119
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,022
Look how good they are on that, too.

120
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,786
Whoa, you get a big bed
all to yourself, Finn.

121
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:58,438
Whoa dude, you even have
your own little bookshelf.

122
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,418
You found a lantern?

123
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:00,251
- Yeah.

124
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,686
- You can put your lantern here.

125
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:02,519
- [Bryan] Oh, is there
books in there, Ollie?

126
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,132
Oh, "Chewie and the
Porgs", and you have books

127
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,099
up there in yours, too, huh?

128
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,275
Alright, you got your binoculars?

129
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:08,108
- Yeah.

130
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:08,941
- OK, put 'em up to your eyes,

131
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,121
take a couple steps back,

132
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,111
and look up at the top of your bed.

133
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,488
Look up at that giant owl.

134
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:14,743
He's looking at you.

135
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:16,882
(squeals of laughter)

136
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,791
Isn't that funny?

137
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,767
- Yah! Yah! Yeah, yeah.

138
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,468
- There's a bear! (screams)

139
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:23,794
(laughter)

140
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:25,530
- Put them up close to your eyes and look

141
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,790
all the way up there in the corner.

142
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,140
- [Bryan] What do you see
up in the corner, Ollie?

143
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,580
- [Ollie] Porg!

144
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,938
- [Bryan] What is it?

145
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,097
- A porg!

146
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:33,989
- [Bryan] A porg?

147
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,080
That's right.

148
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,797
We've got a porg hidden in the mural.

149
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:42,162
Ollie, check this out, you
have this huge toy box, OK?

150
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,199
And then you also have
all these awesome cubbies

151
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,468
for storage so you can put
all your favorite books

152
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:47,682
and treasures in there.

153
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:48,926
That's fun, huh?

154
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:49,759
- Yeah.

155
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,549
- That squirrel actually
has an acorn in its hand?

156
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:53,365
- [Bryan] Uh, yes.

157
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:55,470
If you look closely, that little squirrel

158
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,651
up there is holding a real acorn.

159
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:58,771
Don't try to steal his acorn, OK?

160
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,499
- [Missy] He'll come after you.

161
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:03,758
- So, boys, this is not only a bed,

162
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:05,490
it's also a little play fort.

163
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,832
Look at you bed, has windows, yeah?

164
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,141
He's learning.

165
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,268
- [Missy] Say bye-bye.

166
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,218
- [Bryan] Peace out.

167
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:14,130
You can even shut your door.

168
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,178
One more window. Shut the window.

169
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,636
He's like, "OK, peace out parents.

170
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,665
"I'm going to live in my bachelor pad."

171
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:20,893
What do you think of that?

172
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:21,726
- [Ollie] Good.

173
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:22,559
- (unintelligible)

174
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,519
- Ollie, are you so excited
to share a room with Finn?

175
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,352
- Yeah.

176
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,139
- Oh, what's that?

177
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,281
New toys for both the boys.

178
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,268
Come here, Finn, look,
I got one for you too.

179
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,827
I got you a Swiss army knife.

180
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:34,667
It's not real, though.

181
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,663
It's just for pretend. See?

182
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,620
So when you guys go camping in your tent,

183
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,310
you have all the right tools, OK?

184
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,971
If you ever need a little light
in the middle of the night,

185
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,582
you have this really cool lantern here

186
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:47,016
and look, the button is right here.

187
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:50,393
All you have to do is
turn it off or on, OK?

188
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:51,226
- OK.

189
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,729
- Alright, let's turn off the
lights and shut the drapes

190
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:54,992
so you can check it out.

191
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,878
That is so cool.

192
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:58,919
I love these lights up here.

193
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,978
This is your secret hideout?

194
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:01,016
- Yeah.

195
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:02,571
- [Bryan] That's so fun, huh?

196
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,532
- But if bears come, I can check
them out with my 'noculars.

197
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,830
- [Bryan] That's right.

198
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,896
- [Missy] Do you want to see your closet?

199
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,173
- Yeah.

200
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,498
- [Bryan] Your closet
is really cool, Ollie,

201
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:13,673
'cause now you get to share it with Finn.

202
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,557
- This is your side.

203
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,842
- [Bryan] Got all your
clothes and goodies.

204
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,820
And then this is Finn's side.

205
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,919
All his stuff in there too.

206
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,467
It all fit really nicely, too.

207
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,269
Hey, Ollie, when we were
cleaning out your room

208
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:26,376
I found your dollar bill.

209
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:27,841
I kept it safe for you, OK?

210
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:31,112
- OK. But could you put it back for me

211
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:32,722
'cause I don't want Finn to see it.

212
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:33,555
- [Bryan] OK.

213
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:35,146
Hey Ollie, I'm going to
turn this cool little camper

214
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,349
on your shelf into a piggy bank, OK?

215
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:38,182
- [Ollie] OK.

216
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:39,061
- So you can put all your money in there

217
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:40,651
and it will be safe, sound good?

218
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:41,722
- [Ollie] Yeah.

219
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:42,799
- [Bryan] You like your tent, Finn?

220
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,632
- Yeah.

221
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:45,323
- [Bryan] It's so comfy and
look you got a light up there.

222
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,205
Can you turn it on?

223
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,091
Push it!

224
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:49,091
Oh, daddy will help you.

225
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:51,306
- Oh.

226
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:53,645
- [Ollie] Fire, fire.

227
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,474
- [Bryan] We got you
guys critter blankets.

228
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:56,801
- This is a little blanket.

229
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,299
It goes over your head like this

230
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:00,634
and then you put your hands into the paws.

231
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:01,467
- [Bryan] Oh, that's cool.

232
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:02,780
- And you wrap your arms around yourself

233
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,648
and then you get warm.

234
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:04,968
- And you're nice and warm.

235
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:05,801
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

236
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,634
- Do you want to try?

237
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,467
- Yeah.

238
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,300
- [Bryan] This one's a buffalo.

239
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,247
- (unintelligible)

240
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:12,619
- [Ollie] (screams)

241
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:14,701
- [Bryan] Get him, get him, get him.

242
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,701
(upbeat folk music)

243
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:24,639
- Come on Finn, before the bear comes!

244
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,538
- [Bryan] You guys staying safe up there?

245
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:27,371
- Yeah.

246
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:29,036
- [Bryan] Alright, this
is your safe place, OK?

247
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:30,321
(roaring)

248
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,078
- [Bryan] Oh no, mommy bear's coming.

249
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,579
A mommy bear's attacking the campground.

250
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,746
(roaring)

251
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,869
I'm gonna get you.

252
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,008
(laughing and squealing)

253
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,882
It's too high, I can't get you.

254
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:44,454
- [Bryan] OK, Ollie, remember when we were

255
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:46,611
in Idyllwild and you almost saw Bigfoot?

256
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:47,444
- Yeah.

257
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:51,611
- [Bryan] Well, now, you too
can have big feet like a bear.

258
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:56,686
Look at your feet, they're
ginormous and hairy.

259
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:57,519
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

260
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,823
- [Bryan] Whoa, are they
really good for stomping?

261
00:07:58,823 --> 00:07:59,656
- Yeah.

262
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,623
- Well, Ollie, what do you
think about your new room

263
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:03,983
that you're sharing with Finn?

264
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,816
- Good.

265
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:05,649
- You like it?

266
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:06,482
- Yeah.

267
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:07,315
- Did mommy and daddy do a good job?

268
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:08,148
- Um hmm.

269
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,073
- Love you.

270
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,669
- Oh no, the fire got blown out.

271
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,281
- [Bryan] Oh no! It's OK,
you just gotta fix it.

272
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:17,643
Oh, look at Finny's big bear feet.

273
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:19,724
Hi big guy, I love you.

274
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:22,276
Hey, Finn, do you like
your new room buddy?

275
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:24,054
Can your feet come out? Oh!

276
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:26,632
He took his feet off.

277
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,307
So what do you guys
think of Ollie and Finn's

278
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,149
new shared room?

279
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:31,454
Let us know down below in the comments.

280
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:33,910
I am so excited with how it turned out

281
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,055
and I think now that the boys are so happy

282
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,707
they are literally playing in there

283
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,024
so we're going to let them play

284
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:40,441
and Missy and I are going to give you

285
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,450
a little walkthrough of the whole room

286
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,681
from when you walk in.

287
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:45,610
- [Missy] OK, so when
you first enter the room,

288
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,893
you see just this massive
mural on the wall.

289
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,773
I love how it turned out.

290
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:53,374
I just think it has so
much creativity in it.

291
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:54,984
I think it's a place
that the boys can look at

292
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:57,732
and just, like, imagine a world in there.

293
00:08:57,732 --> 00:09:00,045
But we did, also, to kind
of give it a little more

294
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:03,830
of a 3-D view is we put
some branches on it.

295
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,374
- [Bryan] Yeah so it's a
cool little branch hook.

296
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:08,035
We also have a couple
on the back of the door.

297
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:11,315
- [Missy] There's actually
quite a few little, like,

298
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:13,776
hidden things inside of the area.

299
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:16,811
We've got a big squirrel and an acorn

300
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:20,261
and I love that because it
really does make the whole room

301
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,552
just seem like, is this
real or is this fake.

302
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:24,502
- [Bryan] Yeah, I think because she kinda

303
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:25,771
did some on the ceiling, too,

304
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,243
and like there's even a
bush on the other wall.

305
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,537
- Yeah, and over there too.

306
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:31,775
It really makes, you're
like, wait, is this real?

307
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:32,791
So I just love it.

308
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,879
I think this makes the entire room

309
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,313
just feel way bigger and more, like,

310
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:39,973
amazing than it really is, you know?

311
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:41,363
- What's really cool, too, is

312
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,823
this mural was done by someone local

313
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,662
and she was able to come
in on such short notice.

314
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:48,939
So huge thanks to Chante and
Just My Imagination Murals.

315
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,697
I'll have a link down
below in the description

316
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:52,494
so you can check out
some of her other work.

317
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:56,243
Hey, Ollie, did you see your
guys's name is carved in there.

318
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:57,076
That's pretty cool, huh?

319
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:57,909
- Yeah.

320
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:59,719
- So for this section we wanted

321
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,970
to really have a place of play.

322
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,579
Playtime is so important.

323
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:06,000
Pretending is so important, imagination.

324
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,132
So we, literally, like look,
they're playing right now.

325
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:09,965
They're playing around the campfire.

326
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,778
So I wanted to make
this area like something

327
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,956
that they could feel like
they're interacting with

328
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:14,769
that they normally don't.

329
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:17,024
Being outdoorsy, camping is super fun.

330
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,767
So we have a nice A-frame tent

331
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,459
with a really nice wolf rug under there.

332
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,669
It's like a wolf gray
which is like beautiful

333
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:25,824
and so comfortable.

334
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:26,959
(squealing)

335
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,662
We have some really
cool seating like this.

336
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,276
We've got some of these.

337
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:31,440
These are awesome.

338
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,579
We actually picked these
up from Land of Nod.

339
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,385
So they're like little
beanbags that look like wood.

340
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,219
Which is cool, huh?

341
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,058
And then also over here we
have some boulder buddies.

342
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:42,360
So it's like just some
nice big ol' rock pillows.

343
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,766
So, they go with the theme
and they're functional

344
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:47,543
so if they're reading a
book or watching a movie

345
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:49,084
or anything like that they can just relax.

346
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:51,542
We have a big shelf here
for lots of pictures

347
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,359
and storage and fun little things

348
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:56,439
that they can just look at
and use their imagination.

349
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,044
Yes, these are acorns.

350
00:10:58,044 --> 00:10:59,351
I ordered these from Etsy.

351
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,440
I had to have authentic New York acorns.

352
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,854
Here Ollie, you want one?

353
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:03,716
- Yeah.

354
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:04,862
- [Bryan] Keep it safe, OK?

355
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:06,357
- OK.

356
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:08,159
- And then I love this tree bookshelf.

357
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,885
It's just so cool and it kinda just like

358
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:11,572
brings them in the element.

359
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:13,254
It's obviously super functional.

360
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:15,211
They have lots and lots of shelves

361
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,978
and storage places which is cool.

362
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:19,257
And the boys love reading so their bedroom

363
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:21,502
is a place of reading
and sleeping and playing

364
00:11:21,502 --> 00:11:22,922
and we kinda wanted to incorporate all

365
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:24,287
those different elements in here.

366
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,939
Alright, babe, how are we doing?

367
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,089
One room, two kids, one closet.

368
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,434
How is this gonna work?

369
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,108
- Yes, so we are going from both kids

370
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,840
having their own dresser and closet

371
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,257
to just a closet.

372
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:37,390
- [Bryan] One closet.

373
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,494
- No dresser.

374
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:41,654
So we basically split their
closet into two sides.

375
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:42,961
So this is Ollie's side.

376
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,540
He's got all of his shirts.

377
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,015
We are hanging a lot more of
his clothes than we used to,

378
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:49,633
which means a lot of his
pajamas are being hung now.

379
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:52,502
We've got a section for pants and shorts

380
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,034
and then all of his, like, sweatpants.

381
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,997
This is a little spot
for, like, some blankies

382
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,732
and then dirty clothes.

383
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,425
A little spot for socks.

384
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,569
- And now for Finn's closet.

385
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,600
- So Finn, same thing basically.

386
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,251
All his shirts, we even
hung a lot of his pajamas.

387
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:09,276
He's got his sweatpants, pants, shorts

388
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,658
and then a little section with, like,

389
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,191
a picture of him.

390
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,024
- [Bryan] Awwww.

391
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,789
- [Missy] We still have
some random kid here.

392
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,817
We really need to change that out

393
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,499
but I'm kinda used to it now.

394
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:20,241
I feel like maybe he
really did look like this.

395
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,151
So I love it.

396
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:22,450
I really, really feel like this is a nice,

397
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,985
minimal closet and I feel like

398
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:27,220
it's going to be a lot
easier to figure out

399
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,596
what they're going to wear that day.

400
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:31,531
- And last but not least, the bed.

401
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,492
I wanted to get a bed where they both had

402
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:35,967
full mattresses.

403
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,169
I wanted a bunk bed style, but I also knew

404
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:40,387
I wanted something with a lot of character

405
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:42,168
that's going to make them feel comfortable

406
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:44,299
and safe and warm and cozy.

407
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:47,328
So we went with this
awesome cabin loft bed

408
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:49,219
and it has a trundle underneath with a bed

409
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,868
that may be there, it may...

410
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,285
We can take that out if we want.

411
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:53,820
They can both sleep up there.

412
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,251
We're kinda just going to
see what works for them.

413
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:56,915
- I love the fact that
we have plenty of room

414
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:58,742
for, like, their friends to sleep over

415
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:01,983
or for them to sleep and
not fall out of their bed.

416
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:04,015
I love the extra feature that we added

417
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:05,519
with, just like their little books

418
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,897
that they read at night.

419
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:10,353
- [Bryan] Yeah, so the
bed had some exposed wall

420
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:13,238
so we put in those which
worked out really good.

421
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:15,850
- And honestly, a lot of times
when I read books to the boys

422
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,336
they just get shoved to the end of the bed

423
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,439
so it's gonna be so nice to
have a spot to place them.

424
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,272
- [Bryan] Yeah.

425
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,105
- That?

426
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:22,413
- [Bryan] Say hi squirrel.

427
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:23,246
- Squirrel!

428
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,071
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, did you
do your squirrel call yet?

429
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,427
- Squirrel!

430
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:28,459
- Hey Ollie, speaking of that squirrel

431
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,497
we're gonna have to name him, you know.

432
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:31,330
- Yeah.

433
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,442
- [Bryan] What do you
guys want to name him?

434
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:34,171
- Um, Charlie.

435
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:35,004
- [Bryan] Charlie?

436
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:37,733
That's a cute name and
then you can say good night

437
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,020
to Charlie the Squirrel every night?

438
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,853
- Yeah.

439
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,185
- [Bryan] OK, what do you guys think?

440
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:42,359
Do you guys like the name Charlie?

441
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,617
Let us know down below in the comments

442
00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:44,989
or if you guys have other suggestions,

443
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:45,972
let us know too.

444
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:47,198
And then we have a nice big toy box

445
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:48,582
which, of course, is empty.

446
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:51,377
- Yes, and I love that it
- [Bryan] And cubbies.

447
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,244
We have so much stuff for toys.

448
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:54,257
- And you know what?

449
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:55,530
We never had a toy box in their room

450
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,894
and it just ended up that they always

451
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,463
had toys in their room
an nowhere to put it.

452
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,857
Now we have spots for it.

453
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:00,798
- [Bryan] Yeah.

454
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,363
And for those of you who are wondering

455
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,658
we are probably going to be adding some

456
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:04,641
Christmas stuff on top of all this

457
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:06,603
and because their room was
decorated for Christmas.

458
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:09,272
But now that their new room is here,

459
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:11,838
they can sleep in it,
they can read books in it,

460
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:14,369
and they can grow up to
be best friends in it.

461
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,037
And I'm so excited.

462
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:17,198
- Let us know in the comments what is

463
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,052
your favorite thing about their new room.

464
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:21,344
I am absolutely in love
with every little detail.

465
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:23,775
But my favorite thing is the fact that

466
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,506
we can all lay in this bed, comfortably

467
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,779
and read books and just have a fun

468
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:31,511
cuddly night together
and I'm really excited

469
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:32,661
about tonight too, so, yeah!

470
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:35,503
- And my favorite thing
is probably this mural.

471
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:38,125
It's massive, it's
beautiful, it just creates

472
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,278
the whole scene of this room.

473
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:41,634
Alright, Ollie, what's your favorite thing

474
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:42,769
in your new room?

475
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:44,338
- The binoculars.

476
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:45,203
- [Bryan] The binoculars?

477
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:46,036
- Yeah.

478
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:46,997
- [Bryan] Alright Finn,
what's your favorite thing?

479
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,431
Show me your favorite thing in the room.

480
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,817
Show me!

481
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:50,650
- That is.

482
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,614
- [Missy] This is? The ladder?

483
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,024
- Yeah.

484
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,676
- The boys have been playing
in their new room all day.

485
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,207
It's been so cute.

486
00:14:57,207 --> 00:15:00,313
And now we are just finally
getting them ready for bed

487
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,237
to go to bed in their new
bed for the first time

488
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,926
and I am really excited
to see how they do.

489
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:06,751
You all done brushing your teeth?

490
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,741
You ready for bed? OK.

491
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,164
- OK, let's go.

492
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:11,697
- [Bryan] Oh, who's on your shirt, dude?

493
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:13,297
- Um, Yeti.

494
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:15,148
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

495
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,086
How cool would it be, Ollie,
if we were to catch him

496
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:19,210
in our Christmas cave.

497
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,347
Wouldn't that be so cool?

498
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:21,205
(unintelligible)

499
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:23,177
You're wearing Yeti too, huh?

500
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:24,187
- Yeah.

501
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:25,020
- [Bryan] Yeah.

502
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,119
We should totally try to
catch a Yeti sometime, huh?

503
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:27,952
- [Ollie] Yeah.

504
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:31,260
- Come on boys to your guys's room.

505
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,875
(cheering)

506
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,792
The boys are running to their room.

507
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,574
You still like your room?

508
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:38,637
- Yeah.

509
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,205
- Fred!

510
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,424
- [Bryan] What?

511
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:42,474
- [Ollie] Look!

512
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,899
- [Bryan] Awww, hey Fred, I
was wondering where you were.

513
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,826
He was hanging out in your new room.

514
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:49,659
- Yeah.

515
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:51,685
- Is he going to sleep
on your bed tonight?

516
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:52,774
- Yeah.

517
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:55,035
- [Bryan] Alright boys, climb into bed.

518
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:55,868
- Climb in the bed boys.

519
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,404
- [Bryan] We're going to read some books

520
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:58,683
and go night night.

521
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:01,285
We're going to grab our
happy little lantern here.

522
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:02,928
Look at that.

523
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,105
Now you guys have light.

524
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:05,655
That's so cool, huh?

525
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,442
- Look at, these are stars.

526
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:11,220
- [Bryan] Look at you guys
cuddling into your new bed,

527
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,303
it's so cool.

528
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:15,984
- And there's plenty of room
for me to cuddle with you.

529
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:19,497
- [Bryan] Gotta grab Goodnight Moon.

530
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,054
I also got this new book.

531
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:22,158
(owl hooting)

532
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:23,949
So cute, it's called Brave Little Camper

533
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,347
because you guys are kinda
