1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,470
- Hey Daddy.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,000
- [Bryan] Hey dude, guess what?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,370
We got a new fish, do
you want to go meet her?

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,393
- Yeah.
- Let's go see.

5
00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:11,028
Come on, come on.
Let's go see, Fin.

16
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:36,110
- Ahh, good morning Ollie.

17
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,370
(laughs)

18
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,430
You're really playing up that
whole sleeping thing, huh?

19
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,530
Oh good morning guys, we
are so tired this morning.

20
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,970
I went to bed, like, super
late, and then Finn decided

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,430
to wake me and Ollie up super early,

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,070
and would not let us go back to bed, huh?

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,550
Ollie has never, like, been
so tired going to school.

24
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,510
He usually is, like, up and awake,

25
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,510
and the whole time he's
sitting there like,

26
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,170
"Mama, I'm so tired."

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,810
And it is freezing.

28
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,150
I'm wearing a beanie today
because it is literally freezing.

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,210
It has been in the 20s at night.

30
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,970
Like, so cold that if it
were to rain it would snow.

31
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,510
Which is a very, it
won't, because it doesn't

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,980
really rain here, but the
fact that it's cold enough

33
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,780
that if it did rain it would snow

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,950
is absolutely insane for California.

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,740
And so it is actually in
the high 30s right now.

36
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,370
Like, I don't even have the clothing

37
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,838
to support that kind of weather.

38
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:30,910
(laughs)

39
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,830
Ollie's got a couple
layers of clothes too.

40
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,830
Plus you've got a nice,
warm classroom, huh?

41
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,370
Anyways, yeah we have a fun day planned.

42
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,030
I forgot my camera again,
I keep forgetting it.

43
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,670
I am just the worst vlogger right now,

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,470
but I am vlogging on my phone.

45
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,300
And I am going to make
sure that all the footage

46
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,760
that I shoot on my phone gets uploaded,

47
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,540
because the other day when
I was vlogging on my phone

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,110
there was so much footage that I uploaded

49
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,790
using my phone to Dropbox so
Bryan could edit it and all

50
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,310
and I thought it all went
through, and he edited the vlog

51
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,760
and I watched it after
it went up, and I'm like,

52
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,750
"Where's all that footage?"

53
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,259
And none of it made it
through, and I'm so sad.

54
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,410
I went back and saw that all the footage

55
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,010
that I was uploading to
Dropbox for him wasn't there

56
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,320
because it just stopped working
it was just so much footage.

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,240
So you guys actually missed out on a ton

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,640
of really cute footage the other day

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,720
because I vlogged on my phone.

60
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,580
So I'm not gonna let that happen today.

61
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,310
I'm gonna make sure all
of this footage gets sent.

62
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,270
We are off for a fun, fun day.

63
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,231
Look, today's the letter Q, huh?

64
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,064
- Yeah.

65
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,150
- [Missy] You getting
out of your seatbelt?

66
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,370
Q for?

67
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,140
- P.
- Queen!

68
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,615
- Queen.
- Queen.

69
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,420
Okay Ollie, you got your shared toy?

70
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,770
What are you sharing today?

71
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:45,690
- A puzzle of magnets.

72
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,359
- It's magnets that start with a Q, right?

73
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:50,192
- Yeah.

74
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,880
- So, he's sharing, like, a queen,

75
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,590
the letter Q, and a couple
other cute little magnets.

76
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,270
And hey Ollie, what do you think of this

77
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,383
freezing cold weather?

78
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:59,080
- Not good.

79
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,930
- Not good, he's a Cali boy, guys.

80
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,120
I was telling him this morning,

81
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,950
Mommy and Daddy are from Idaho.

82
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,071
Did you know in Idaho we had
to go to school in the snow?

83
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,051
- Yeah.
- Isn't that crazy?

84
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:09,884
- Yeah.

85
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:12,760
- We used to have to drive
to school in the snow.

86
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,970
I got my camera!

87
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,040
I ran home to get my camera
and I'm actually headed

88
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,450
to the barn to go get some
horseback riding lessons.

89
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,540
So I'm going to do English
horseback riding lessons.

90
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,080
And I'm really super excited.

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,470
I feel like, it's because it's my horse

92
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,743
I have like a lot more
confidence about it all.

93
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:28,160
(sighs) I've got a very
busy day ahead of me.

94
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,800
I just got done with my horse riding

95
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,450
lesson which went so good.

96
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,218
I was so cold and, like, my head was just

97
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:37,754
dripping sweat and I have
a beanie and helmet on

98
00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:41,150
and my nose was, like, dripping.

99
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,950
But it was so, so fun.

100
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,950
Honestly, I've learned so much
just from that one lesson.

101
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,510
And I feel like I finally have
the horse, my horse, back.

102
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,900
Cause, like, he's not limping anymore,

103
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,120
he doesn't have any, like, feet problems.

104
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,430
His hives, that were never really

105
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,900
bothering him are finally gone.

106
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,850
His back issues are fine.

107
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,370
He got a massage, so he's feeling great.

108
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,690
Ah, It's just so nice and
he was doing so, so good.

109
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,660
And I was doing good, so it was so fun.

110
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,790
But now I'm actually--

111
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,623
Ah, I forgot my hair.

112
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:05,880
Shoot! (laughs)

113
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,289
I'm actually getting my
hair done really quick.

114
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,380
And she's going to put
my little hair piece in.

115
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,310
Which is something that
I've vlogged about, like,

116
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,350
a few days ago and I think you saw, like,

117
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,890
the second part of it,
of me putting it in.

118
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,810
But you didn't see me
doing it the other day.

119
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,630
So, I gotta go get it, I forgot it, shoot!

120
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,010
Alright, got my hair,
we're good to go. (laughs)

121
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,460
Oh hey Ollie.
- Hi.

122
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,327
- How was school?
- Good.

123
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:31,670
- I'm done with my hair,
look, now it's long!

124
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,530
And I picked this guy up.

125
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,660
Look how cute you're looking.

126
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,580
He's got a little rhinosaur
jacket, from Target.

127
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,380
- Yeah!
- Looks so cool.

128
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,300
And I'm actually meeting
my dad at Home Depot.

129
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,600
He's got Finn and he's
looking for some stuff

130
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,820
to build for me for my horse.

131
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,530
So I'm going to go meet up with him

132
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,250
and see if he's found anything cool.

133
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,990
Alright, keep your eyes out, okay?

134
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,180
We've got to find Papa.

135
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,083
Where is he?

136
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,916
Hmmm, is he down here?

137
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,349
Nope.

138
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:04,766
Is he down here?

139
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,060
Nope.

140
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,810
Ollie I think I see him, do you see him?

141
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,380
Say Papa Marco!

142
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,213
- Papa Marco!

143
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:16,106
(upbeat music)

144
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,956
- Yay, we found you!

145
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:29,009
Have you been having fun with Papa?

146
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

147
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,210
I actually have some really cute footage

148
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,799
of them hanging out, so I'm
gonna put it in right now.

149
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:38,382
(upbeat music)

150
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,749
- [Marco] What are you
thinking about, Mom?

151
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:53,582
- Yeah.

152
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,245
- [Marco] They're pretty cool, huh?

153
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,290
- Yeah.

154
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,689
- [Marco] Okay.

155
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,274
- There's momma.

156
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:01,360
- [Marco] No, that's not mom over there.

157
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,007
That's McDonald's, but close,
they're both pretty cool.

158
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:05,840
- Yeah.

159
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,623
(upbeat music)

160
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:13,350
- That kid is out.

161
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm going to let him sleep
for just a few minutes

162
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,610
with the door open so I can hear him,

163
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,870
but he was so tired, which I'm tired too

164
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,750
because I had to get up at 5 a.m.,

165
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,570
because he woke up at 5 a.m.

166
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,340
Ollie's been up since 5
a.m. because he wouldn't

167
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,790
let either of us fall back to sleep, huh?

168
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,780
So he's going to sleep for a few minutes

169
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,513
and Ollie is going to try and put together

170
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:33,320
(gasps) this Lego set.

171
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,514
Do you think you can do it by yourself?

172
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:36,858
- No, I don't know.

173
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:40,330
- It actually says it's for
kids from four to seven.

174
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,700
And you're four, so you might
be able to do a lot of it,

175
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,170
but momma will help you, okay?

176
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,003
- Okay.

177
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:46,210
- Ollie, you are doing such a good job

178
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,650
of putting this all together.

179
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,730
He just built this all by himself.

180
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,830
I did tell him what to
find, but he found it

181
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,100
and then he followed the instructions

182
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,800
on exactly what to do and
now you're putting on that?

183
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,020
Is that where it says to go?

184
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,127
Oh, yes it is, you're so smart!

185
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,431
(laughs) You've gotten so smart.

186
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm so proud of you.

187
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,330
- Oh hey guy.

188
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,070
Currently Ollie is
slaying this Lego build.

189
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,010
It's for the mountain
police chase helicopter.

190
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,530
This is so cool that he's
able to do these ones now.

191
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,890
- I know, he definitely
needs a little direction,

192
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,560
but not much, he's literally
just looking at the picture

193
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
and he's like, "This is where it goes."

194
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,869
- [Bryan] That's awesome dude.

195
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:26,020
(exclaims happily)

196
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,810
- Alright Ollie, you got
the base all figured out.

197
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,834
What is the next step?

198
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,220
- Um, this.

199
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,310
- [Bryan] Yeah, what are
you going to do with it?

200
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,310
- I'm gonna put it on.
- Snap it on there, good job.

201
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:42,045
That's awesome dude, is it fun?

202
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,628
(upbeat music)

203
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,970
You did it Ollie, show me your helicopter.

204
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,760
That is so cool, I'm
so proud of you buddy.

205
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,420
And it's got a cool chain?

206
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,253
- Yeah.
- Right on.

207
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:02,020
Alright so today is very
exciting because we have

208
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,460
something very cool to show you guys.

209
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,360
Ollie, what are we going
to show them today?

210
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,850
- We got a new pet fishy!

211
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,440
- That's right we did!

212
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,780
And it is probably one
of the coolest things

213
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,500
we have in our aquarium right now.

214
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,710
And here he is, it's a starfish!

215
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,730
He is a pink little starfish.

216
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,720
He's about yea big, and he
has so much personality.

217
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,770
Right babe?
- Yes!

218
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,950
- It's crazy.

219
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,730
- Like, he crawls all over this tank.

220
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,600
A minute ago he was
doing a little backbend.

221
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,313
- Yeah, he's like trying
to escape. (laughs)

222
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,175
- He hasn't, but he's got--

223
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,259
- [Ollie] I want to feel it.

224
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,750
- You can pet him.

225
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,646
- [Bryan] Do you want to pet him Ollie?

226
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:45,479
- Yeah.

227
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,780
- [Bryan] Alright, pet the new starfish.

228
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,110
Alright Ollie, you want to
tell them what we named him?

229
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,230
- We named him Patrick.

230
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,560
- [Bryan] That's right, Patrick Star.

231
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,490
- We actually have had
another starfish in here.

232
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,323
- [Bryan] We've had two.

233
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:01,380
- Two starfish in here
that we never named,

234
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,800
and I feel like because
we didn't name them

235
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,130
they did not last very long.

236
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,164
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

237
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:07,050
- So this time I got this
guy in here and I was like,

238
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,080
"We need to name him right away,"

239
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,178
and we chose the most cliche
starfish name you could.

240
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,423
You gotta be very careful.

241
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,270
- [Bryan] I know and you're petting him.

242
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,390
That's so cool, huh Ollie?

243
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,973
(upbeat music)

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,220
But otherwise all of our fishy

245
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,010
friends have been doing so good.

246
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,106
All of our fish are getting huge.

247
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:31,250
And all of our little plants and corals

248
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,160
and stuff are doing so good.

249
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,630
And I think it's getting time
to add a bunch more stuff.

250
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,660
So I think he's actually going to be here

251
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,920
in a couple of days and he's going to add

252
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,599
some more cool stuff to the aquarium.

253
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,587
What do you got Finnie?

254
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:44,420
- Mom!

255
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,177
- That's so cool, is that like an ATV?

256
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:47,427
- Yeah.
- Zoom.

257
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,940
So far we are in the
stage where Ollie loves

258
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,550
putting Legos together and
Finn loves destroying them.

259
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,579
Right Finn?

260
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:55,412
(Missy laughs)

261
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:56,836
- Yeah.

262
00:09:56,836 --> 00:09:58,660
- So I have been doing a little
cleaning in the boy's room.

263
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,830
And I must say, a lot of overdue cleaning.

264
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,020
Their closet has been crazy for months,

265
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,936
and I just went through it,
and check out the aftermath.

266
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:11,430
Aah, that is so much clothes!

267
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,250
Ollie said, "Mama, why are you getting rid

268
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,100
"of all my clothes, I'm not
gonna have anything to wear."

269
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,810
But I left you plenty of clothes, okay?

270
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,680
So I've got some of
Ollie's clothes that are

271
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,580
too big for him or sorry,
too little for him,

272
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,580
but too big for Finn, so
I'll have to put those away.

273
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,050
And then I'll put all of
Finn's little clothes away

274
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,310
for maybe another baby boy.

275
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,750
Cause Ollie was like, "What are you going

276
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,583
"to do with these?"

277
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,280
I was like, "Well, we might
have another boy," huh?

278
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,433
And then he's gonna wear all
of yours and Finn's clothes.

279
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,380
- Or a baby girl.

280
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,800
- Yeah, or a baby girl, you never know.

281
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,335
So what's interesting is that if we have

282
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,060
another baby boy eventually,

283
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,230
he'll get Finn's clothes as he gets older.

284
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,149
And then when he gets
even older he'll end up

285
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,850
getting Ollie's clothes,
which look exactly the same.

286
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,480
So he'll have probably
double of all the clothes

287
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,890
because they wear the same clothes.

288
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,050
And so he'll be like
wearing this one shirt at 2T

289
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,130
and then when he gets to 3T

290
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,370
he'll be wearing the same shirt.

291
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,590
So, it's kind of funny if
it does work like that.

292
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,423
But who knows?

293
00:11:08,423 --> 00:11:09,730
Maybe we'll have a girl and actually

294
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,330
some of these clothes may
end up going to her too

295
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,500
because not all of them is
just, like, boy clothes.

296
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,360
But their closet looks
so much more organized.

297
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,430
We've got their short-sleeved shirts,

298
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,600
the long-sleeved shirts,
pajamas, sweaters,

299
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,680
and their pants are all organized.

300
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,940
And it feels really good
to have it all cleaned up.

301
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,230
Now I just gotta do my closet,

302
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,240
which is like, a whole other thing.

303
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,370
- So the boys are getting ready for bed,

304
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,062
and I completely spaced,

305
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:35,680
but we were having our fish
tank maintenanced today

306
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,180
and they dropped off the new fish,

307
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,410
and I am so excited to tell the new boys.

308
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,550
- Hey Daddy.

309
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,205
- [Bryan] Hey dude, guess what?

310
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:43,038
- What?

311
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,138
- [Bryan] We got a new fish.

312
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,970
Do you want to go meet her?

313
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,605
- Yeah.
- [Bryan] Let's go see.

314
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,430
Go go go go go go go go go go go!

315
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,760
They are rocking their Mickey
and the Roadster Racers

316
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,990
pajamas and they're
matching and it's so cute.

317
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,900
Come on, come on, let's go see Finn.

318
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,594
Do you know what it is Ollie?

319
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:02,840
- Oh, there's it is.

320
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,040
- [Bryan] There it is!

321
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,290
That's our other new fishy friend.

322
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,830
My lights are on, like, full blast,

323
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,000
so you can't really tell the color,

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,670
but we got a blue tang.

325
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,730
It's our own little version of Dory.

326
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,527
- [Missy] Dory!
- [Bryan] Yay.

327
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:21,220
She's so cute, huh boys?

328
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,069
Alright you guys, what should
we name our new blue tang?

329
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:25,902
- Uh, dah.

330
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:27,878
- Dory, aww.

331
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:31,488
- I want to name it, uh, SpongeBob.

332
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:32,837
- [Bryan] SpongeBob?!

333
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:34,300
- Yeah.
- But Ollie, guess what?

334
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,330
I was actually just
asking our fish tank guy

335
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,470
if we can get an actual sponge,

336
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,423
and he said yes, we can.

337
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,784
- So then we could name
the sponge SpongeBob.

338
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:44,617
- Yeah.

339
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,069
I think we should just have our Dory, huh?

340
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,902
- Yeah.

341
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:47,942
- [Bryan and Missy] Yeah.

342
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,290
- We've been wanting a blue
tang since we had our tank

343
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,590
and they are very hard to come by,

344
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,490
so we have waited a very long time.

345
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,323
- I know.

346
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:54,308
- [Bryan] And we finally
have one of our own.

347
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,480
- Now we just need an actual Nemo.

348
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,730
- [Bryan] I know. (laughs)

349
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,066

what was the star's name in--

But we already have our Pearl.

We got a good little fish family going on.

357
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,304
Alright boys, say goodnight to Dory.

358
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:15,017

363
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:31,448
