1
00:00:00,152 --> 00:00:03,235
(cute, spooky music)

2
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:13,012
(children babbling happily)

3
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:22,412
- [Bryan] Ollie, Finn, time
to go to the pumpkin patch!

4
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:26,245
Let's go!
(cute, spooky music)

5
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:37,482
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

6
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,227
- What's this?
- It seems to be

7
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:42,260
some kind of house.
(Zero barks)

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,982
- This is cool.
- Oh, Jack.

9
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:47,490
I don't know about this;
we shouldn't intrude.

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,657
- Nonsense, let's go!
(sweeping music)

11
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:06,228
(bouncy, spooky music)

12
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,942
Where's the coffin?

13
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,692
This bed's too comfy.

14
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:34,183
- They must really love to entertain.

15
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:38,218
They have so many ingredients for potions.

16
00:01:38,218 --> 00:01:42,332
(Zero barks)

17
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:45,125
Jack, we really should be going.

18
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,355
I don't wanna intrude on these

19
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,840
nice people.
- Yes, I know.

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,454
Let's look at his master closet.

21
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:55,621
I bet it's so big!
(bouncy, spooky music)

22
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,013
(Jack and Sally screaming)
(Zero barking)

23
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:08,180
- Well, well, well, what have we here?

24
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:12,978
Trying to escape
Halloween Town again, huh?

25
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:16,506
- Oh no, it's Oogie Boogie!
- Run!

26
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:19,756
(dramatic chase music)

27
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,448
- I don't understand.

28
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:36,206
Where's Halloween Town?

29
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:39,094
All this running and I'm gonna pop a seam.

30
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:42,463
- Quick, in here, before Oogie gets us!

31
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:46,630
(screaming)
(gentle, pleasant music)

32
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,972
What's this?
- Welcome to Valentine Valley.

33
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:54,019
(gasps) Jack, I've heard of you!

34
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,682
Please don't steal our holiday.

35
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:59,122
- I will never do that again.
- That's a relief.

36
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:01,118
- We're being chased by Oogie Boogie.

37
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:05,285
We came here to hide.
(bouncy, spooky music)

38
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,578
- Hmm, where could they have gone?

39
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:14,400
Come on, bugs, follow me.
(gentle skittering)

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,877
- I think he's gone.
- Thanks for keeping us safe.

41
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:22,472
- No problem; that Oogie
Boogie must be taken care of.

42
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:26,639
Here, have a sucker.
(gentle music)

43
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:35,435
(Zero barks)
- We must find Halloween Town.

44
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:40,129
(screaming)
Oh, no, Sally!

45
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:44,848
We're coming to get you; come on, Zero!

46
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:48,506
(dramatic music)
(barking and screaming)

47
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,423
(bouncy, happy music)

48
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:54,590
- Oh, hmm, hello, sir?
(rabbit giggles)

49
00:03:56,595 --> 00:04:00,469
- Oh no, Sally, are you okay?
- I'm okay, Jack.

50
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:03,199
- Nice to see you again, Easter Bunny.

51
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,199
I promise we won't kidnap you again.

52
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:11,758
Let's go, Sally.
(Zero barks)

53
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:16,356
- I don't understand,
where did our tree go?

54
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:21,152
- We're never gonna get home.
(sleigh bells jingling)

55
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:23,819
Santa Claus, so good to see you!

56
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,538
- What are you doing
out of your tree, Santa?

57
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:30,901
- I stumbled and fell and
landed here, ho ho ho.

58
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,505
I'm lost and Mrs. Claus is
making a pot roast tonight.

59
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:37,882
- We can help you, Sandy.
- Yes, we will.

60
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:40,029
We know this forest better than anyone.

61
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,702
Your tree is right over here.

62
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:44,754
- You a gambling man, Sandy Claws?

63
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:49,486
- Oh no, Oogie Boogie; jump!
(screaming)

64
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,560
(gentle Christmas music)
- I'm home!

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,443
Oh, thank you, Jack.
- You ain't going nowhere.

66
00:04:55,443 --> 00:04:59,465
(laughs wickedly)
- Not so fast.

67
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,061
- Ella, my most loyal elf!
- That's right, Santa.

68
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,390
I'm not letting Oogie
Boogie get to you again.

69
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,517
Not this time!
(dramatic music)

70
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:12,047
- (gasps) Not my bugs!
(powerful whoosh)

71
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:16,214
(magic chime)
(gentle music)

72
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:19,596
- I know who would enjoy this very much.

73
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:21,317
Our pals Ollie and Finn!

74
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:26,029
I bet you they're missing
their other toys right now.

75
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,245
Now that Oogie Boogie's taken care of,

76
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:32,823
let's get you guys home.
(magic chime)

77
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:34,972
- We made it!
- It's good to be home.

78
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:37,242
(Zero barks)
- Happy Halloween to all

79
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:41,409
and to all a good fright!
(gentle music)

80
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:50,081
(doorbell rings)

81
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:01,945
(children talk excitedly)

82
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,470
- Hey, babe, did you get them those toys?

83
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,652
- No, I didn't; I
thought you ordered them.

84
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:18,749
- (laughs) No, it's not even Amazon.

85
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:20,411
Is that a Christmas box?
- Oh, you're right.

86
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:22,220
That's so weird.
- That's so weird!

87
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,803
(children playing happily)

88
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:33,361
(gentle spooky music)

89
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,856
And there you have it, you guys.

90
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,981
- Yay!
- Our Halloween special.

91
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:27,435
The boys are absolutely obsessed

92
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,988
with Nightmare Before Christmas,

93
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:31,049
so I knew we would have
to do this this year,

94
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,787
and they had such a blast filming,

95
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,075
and they loved it.
- Ollie loved being Jack.

96
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:39,569
I think that was the cutest thing ever,

97
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,354
and the fact that I made that Zero costume

98
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:46,287
for Finn is pretty cool.
- Super cool, yes.

99
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:48,745
Missy worked her butt off on that thing.

100
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:50,958
- Yeah, we had a lot of
fun, and I just wanted

101
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,242
to say a big thank you to my family

102
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:55,902
for always being so
willing to get involved,

103
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:57,549
(laughs) and get dressed up.

104
00:07:57,549 --> 00:08:00,142
- Jimmy's like, "Sure,
I'll dress up like a

105
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,929
"Easter Bunny on a green screen."

106
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:03,638
- I know, my poor dad, it's like, actually

107
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:06,991
100 degrees out, he's just
like Santa Claus. (laugh)

108
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:08,730
- And special thanks to Corbin

109
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,933
for helping us film and
get everything organized.

110
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,471
Be sure to check out his channel.

111
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,242
Check out the iCard for last
year's Halloween special

112
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:17,387
and all of the other fun
ones that we've done.

113
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:19,125
It's something we like to do every year,

114
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,544
just to keep things interesting,

115
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:21,837
and the kids enjoy it, and we love

116
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,971
having these videos to
watch for years to come.

117
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,246
- Yeah, so much fun, we
love watching all the

118
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:28,755
first year (laughs) being pranked.

119
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,492
There was one that was so cute.

120
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:32,986
We've progressively gotten
a little bit better.

121
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:34,217
(both laughing)

122
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:35,718
And let us know down in the comments below

123
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,537
what was your favorite
character from the skit.

124
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:40,308
- That's right, and be
sure to give this video

125
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:42,524
a big thumbs up, share
it with all your friends

126
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,332
and family or anyone you
think would enjoy it,

127
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:46,144
because that helps out a ton.

128
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,457
Thanks so much for watching, guys.

129
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:49,790
We will see you manana, bye!

130
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,834
- Bye!
- Happy Halloween!

131
00:08:52,834 --> 00:00:00,000
(energetic spooky music)
