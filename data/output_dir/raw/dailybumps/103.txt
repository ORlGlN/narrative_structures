00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:03,202
- [Bryan] What are all these packages?

2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:04,322
- Well, I don't know.

3
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:05,469
- [Bryan] When did these get here?

4
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:07,418
- I don't know how they get here.

5
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:09,933
- There's a lot of packages
sitting in my foyer, you guys.

6
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:11,682
I think we're going to open
these and see what's inside.

It's early again this morning,

13
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,257
but the boys actually slept in,

14
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:28,178
just a little bit, like maybe 45 minutes,

15
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:29,350

17
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:31,464
Yeah, we had a late night last night

18
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,618
decorating the tree, doing family stuff.

19
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,009

20
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,805

decoration for the tree.

check out our Christmas tree.

I don't know if any of you guys notice,

25
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:47,428
but the top half of our Christmas
tree, it's just not lit.

26
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:48,844
I'm so bummed.

27
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:50,800

Yeah, and just like, from here to here,

32
00:00:58,431 --> 00:00:59,512
they're just not working.

33
00:00:59,512 --> 00:01:00,660
So, I'm going to have
to find the light bulb

34
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,003

00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:49,921
I'm looking everywhere, huh?

67
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:53,891

00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:01,957
Oh my gosh, what is going on here?

72
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:06,201
That is Woody taking a picture of Fred

73
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,652
and he's all dressed
up as a Christmas tree.

How does he know?

78
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,001
- I don't know.

79
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,063
- [Missy] That is so funny.

80
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:22,356
Look, he's got a little background set up.

81
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:24,298
Oh, and look at the picture, they had a

82
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:26,420
little photo shoot last night.

83
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,142
- [Oliver] Yeah.

84
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:29,555

85
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:30,455
- [Oliver] Oh!

86
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:34,622

95
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,368
- Hey!

96
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:13,915
- We're on a pirate ship!

97
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:14,748
- [Bryan] Oh you are?

98
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:15,581
- Yeah!

99
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,958
- [Bryan] A pirate ship made out of hay?

100
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,341
- No, we're on the
pirate ship that can fly.

101
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,435
- [Bryan] Oh, okay.

102
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,634
You look cute, Ollie.

103
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:23,892
- Yeah, we're all dressed up

104
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,835
and back at the Christmas trees,

105
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,183

with some film action going on.

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,478
- Look up at mom, okay, look up at mommy.

109
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:08,369
Where's mommy?

110
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:09,202

- [Bryan] You're doing so good, buddy.

114
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,282
(Bryan chuckles)

115
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:17,286
Finn is riding his first tire swing!

116
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,137
Look at this kiddo!

117
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:20,382
They're having so much fun playing

118
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:21,698
on the ropes and the swings.

119
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:22,532
(Bryan laughs)

120
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:24,644
Do you like that Finn?

121
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:25,586
You want to go to that one?

122
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:26,599
- Yeah!
- Okay!

123
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,136
Finn is a pro at this one.

124
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:31,173
Okay, go show me how you do it, okay?

125
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,524
Climb in there buddy!

126
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,165
Do you want to climb in the hole?

127
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:35,998
Oh, you climbing in that way?

128
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:37,248
Good job, dude!

129
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:40,429

00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,392
(holiday music)

133
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:50,510
- We saw the tepee!

134
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,366
- [Bryan] Yeah, you did,
look at this amazing tepee

135
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,222
it's decorated in Christmas lights.

136

143
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:15,786
I don't remember this.

144
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:16,645
- I don't remember this either.

145
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:17,711
- Oh.
- But it must have been,

146
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:18,774
it's pretty old.
- Yeah.

147
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:20,826
So this tree's called The Great Oak.

148
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:22,941
- And it's over 500 years old.

149
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:24,668
- [Bryan] That's crazy!

150
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:26,066
Look at this tree, you guys!

151
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,016
This is one tree.

152
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,957
- It's so pretty it has lights in it and--

153
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:30,790
- [Bryan] Yeah.

154
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,623
This is so crazy, you
guys, oh wow, I, oh wow.

155
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:37,528
I wish we had something like this

156
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:40,228
on our property, this is so crazy.

157
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:41,390
- It would be amazing.

158
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,271
- [Bryan] And you see,
it's like, created a bush

159
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,282
around it from the limbs falling.

160
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:48,973
- Yeah this would be amazing
to have on our property.

161
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,280
- [Bryan] Yeah, look at this, it would

162
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,506
take an investment for sure.

163
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,339
We'd have to plant it

164
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,606
and then the people who'd
live there in 500 years.

165
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:56,513
- Yeah, totally thanking us.

166
00:05:56,513 --> 00:05:57,662
(bird chirping)

167
00:05:57,662 --> 00:06:00,306
- [Bryan] Crazy! This is so beautiful.

168
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,803
Oh, there you go!

169
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:02,995
Nice babe!

170
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,083
(Bryan laughs)

171
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,416

172
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,585

173
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,244

175
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,286

friend to help move it!

176
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,803
Finn get on this side, buddy!

177
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:25,586
Alright, you gotta push your
legs up so you can play.

178
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,662
See, it then goes down.

179
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:27,883
Yay!

180
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:30,050
And then up and down, yay!

181
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:34,118
That's called a teeter totter, Finn.

182
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,213
(Bryan laughs)

183
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,630
Finn, what did you just find?

184
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,740
Finn's hugging the tree.

185
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,762
He's a tree hugger.

186
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:45,211
C'mon kiddos.

187
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,878
(holiday music)

188
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:49,805
Hey, Ollie what's up?

189
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:50,638
- What?

190
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:51,471
- [Bryan] What are you doing?

191
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:54,388
- Trying to play super slimy ghost.

192
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:56,450
- [Bryan] Oh, really?

193
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,283
- Yeah!

194
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,531
- We have Finn asleep for a nap.

195
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:02,386
We just done with our photo
shoot which went so good.

196
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:03,608
Missy's out running errands,

197
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:07,726
and, Ollie, what are all these packages?

198
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,007
- I don't know.

199
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,275
- [Bryan] When did these get here?

200
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:12,089
- I don't know how they get here.

201
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:14,687
- There' a lot of packages
sitting in my foyer, you guys.

202
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,407
I think we're gonna open
these and see what's inside.

203
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:17,240
Do you know, Ollie?

204
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,073
- Yeah!

205
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:18,933
- You know?

206
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:19,978
- I think it's toys.

207
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:21,061
- [Bryan] You think it's toys?

208
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:22,040
I'm not sure what it is.

209
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Let's open up and see
because I'm not sure I know

210
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,025
what all these giant packages
are and I think Missy is

211
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:29,791
gonna be really mad at
me if I accidentally

212
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,509
ordered something on Ebay or Amazon

213
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:33,956
and maybe I ordered, accidentally, like,

214
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:35,164
too many of it.

215
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,647
Yeah, that's a lot of packages.

216
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:37,493
- Yeah.

217
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:38,326
- We should open it.

218
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,590
It's pretty rare that we
get a package at our house

219
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,046
and I don't know what's in it.

220
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,666
So, the fact that I
don't know what this is

221
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,991
is kind of interesting.

222
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,074
Let's see, so it's a box.

223
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:52,099
Paper! There's paper in it!

224
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:54,102
Don't you want to play with it?

225
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:54,935
- No!

226
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:55,768
(Bryan laughs)

227
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,363
- Just kidding, buddy,
it's not just paper.

228
00:07:57,363 --> 00:08:01,530
Looks like another box in
this box, it's very heavy.

229
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:04,924
Very, very heavy.

230
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,424
Oh, hey, Finn.

231
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:07,396
- [Oliver] Hey.

232
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:09,271
- [Bryan] Did you just
wake up from your nap?

233
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,251
Finn, just woke up from his nap.

234
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:11,344
You're just in time, Finn.

235
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:12,533
- I want Fred!

236
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,016
- [Bryan] I know! You see, Fred?

237
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:14,849
(Bryan laughs)

238
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,684
- Hey, Finn, look at all these boxes!

239
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:20,575
- [Bryan] I know it's Woody, huh?

240
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,672
- Woody's taking a picture of Fred.

241
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:23,754
- That's so cool!

242
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:24,587
(Bryan laughs)

243
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,484
Boys are always getting
sidetracked, you guys.

244
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:29,354
Okay, let's open up this
box and see what's inside.

245
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:30,202
- Paper!

246
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:32,008
- More paper!

247
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,008
(Bryan gasps)

248
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:34,341
Look what it is!

249
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:37,605
It's the calendars!

250
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,397
Yay!

251
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:44,993
Okay, you guys, it's
official, we're signing these.

252
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:48,440
We have so many calendars to sign.

253
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,831
Ollie, are you ready to sign?

254
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:50,664
- Yeah!

255
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:51,972
- [Bryan] Yeah, Finn,
are you ready to sign?

256
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:52,881
- Yeah!

257
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:53,714
- Yeah?

258
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:54,917
So, for those of you who ordered

259
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,203
a signed calendar from our merch store,

260
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,240
we're gonna be signing these
in the next couple of days

261
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,894
and then shipping them off to you guys.

262
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:02,530
We're really, really hoping
to get them to you guys

263
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,690
before Christmas.

264
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,180
So, that's what we're
working on right now.

265
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,979
That's incredible, you guys, that there is

266
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,095
that many calendars.

267
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:11,887
You guys, are so amazing,
seriously, thank you so much.

268
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,503
It was so fun to do that photo shoot

269
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:15,098
and to turn it into something like this

270
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:16,608
that we can look back on forever

271
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:17,940
and like have you guys involved.

272
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,428
I think it's really, really special,

273
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,153
so, seriously, thank you guys.

274
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:22,070
Finn, look!

275
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,045
And we have this one too, huh?!

276
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:26,962
Santa's dancing around.

277
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:29,422
Look it's spinning!

278
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:30,255
- Oh yeah!

279
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:32,303
- I know!

280
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:34,629
Finn loves these, it's so funny!

281
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:37,225
Hang your stocking and say your prayers

282
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:40,389
'cause Santa Claus comes in 21 days.

283
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,237
- Daddy, you can hold him like a baby.

284
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:44,577
- [Bryan] You can, huh?

285
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,221
You love him, Finn?

286
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,841
- No, he's fat.

287
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:48,674
(Bryan laughs)

288
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:51,591
(heavy bass music)

289
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,530
- Bustin' out the bike!

290
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:56,643
Ollie said he wanted to try his

291
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:59,577
other bike today with his pedals.

292
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:02,064
Whoa, look at you go, dude!

293
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:05,130
So, this is how you break,
Ollie, if you want to stop

294
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,522
you pull this.

295
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,355
See?

296
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:08,928
And it breaks, but you
don't need to put it

297
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:09,854
if you're trying to go.

298
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:12,380
So, put your feet up on the pedals

299
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,154
and then use your steerin'.

300
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:17,983
There you go, you're
getting some speed, see?

301
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,193
And then that's how you
stop, good job buddy!

302
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:22,780
Finn, no, don't go down the hill.

303
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,755
(Bryan laughs)

304
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,255
Turn around silly.

305
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,749
(upbeat music)

306
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:35,795
Hey, look mama's home!

307
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:37,539
Hey, babe!

308
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,191
The kids wanted to play outside.

309
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:40,397
It's so cold, though.

310
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:41,230
- It's so cold.

311
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,251
- I think they need jackets.

312
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,911
I'm, like, wearing the
same thing Ollie has

313
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,599
and I'm like starting to get cold now.

314
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,285
You want to try the bike, Finn?

315
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:48,362
- Yes!

316
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:49,862
- [Bryan] Alright!

317
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,775
- [Missy] Not quite big enough, bud.

318
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:57,623
- [Bryan] So you put your feet
on the pedal, right there.

319
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,558
Isn't that cool?

320
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,087
He kind of wants to do it.

321
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:01,167
(Bryan laughs)

322
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:05,472
- Alright it is bath time,
which means I am cleaning

323
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:07,009
out my bathroom.

324
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:08,121
It's kind of a disaster.

325
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:10,162
I just have, like, tons
of things that are like

326
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:11,964
kind of empty or I haven't
used them in forever

327
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,192
and I need to throw them away.

328
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:14,881
I actually found something really cool.

329
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,106
I didn't want to say that
if you don't know this

330
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:21,506
the Johnsons just announced
that they are pregnant.

331
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:22,969
And I'm still literally in shock,

332
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:24,704
I'm actually like I'm so excited about it.

333
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:27,820
They've put out an extremely cute video

334
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,492
telling their kids and their family.

335
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:32,973
They even told me and Bryan,
and I am still in shock.

336
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:35,401
Like my whole body was
like chilled and like,

337
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,283
"oh my god, I can't
believe this is happening."

338
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,156
Like it was just so exciting
and I'm just so excited

339
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,270
that, like, my boys get
to be involved in like

340
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,204
kind of see someone for the
first time they're going

341
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,109
to really see the process
of someone being pregnant

342
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:48,851
and they're belly getting
bigger and bigger and bigger

343
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:50,510
and feeling the baby, like, oh!

344
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,683
I'm so excited about it,
but I was cleaning out stuff

345
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:53,644
and look what I found.

346
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:55,340
Look what I found!

347
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,390
I found the pregnancy test
from when I was pregnant,

348
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,077
when I found out I was
pregnant with Ollie.

349
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:03,022
Like that's so gross, they're
like sitting in these bags

350
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,679
and they're so nasty, but look at that!

351
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,947
(Missy gasps)

352
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:08,947
(slow guitar music)

353
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,858
And I was just like, oh!

354
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:18,749
It's so exciting!

355
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:21,854
It's just really, really cool
that like Natalia's pregnant.

356
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:24,370
A lot of people have
been asking me, though.

357
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,096
They're like alright
Missy Natalia's pregnant,

358
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,664
Ellie's pregnant, you're next.

359
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,126
And I'm like, no I'm not!

360
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:31,959
(Missy laughs)

361
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,006
I'm not next, but you
are going to start to see

362
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:37,078
in the next few months us,
like, kind of preparing

363
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,494
for the next baby or like the
decision to have another baby.

364
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,661
But I will say that I do not
decide on when to get pregnant

365
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:49,317
just because people
around me are pregnant.

366
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,895
I do not have baby fever
right now I'm loving my life

367
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,042
with my two kids.

368
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:56,269
I'm excited for another one
when we decide to do it again.

369
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:57,896
We have, like, a plan and
we have, like, an idea

370
00:12:57,896 --> 00:13:01,319
in mind of what we want, but
just because Natalia's pregnant

371
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,216
doesn't mean I'm getting pregnant.

372
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,121
Anyways, I'm just reminiscing
about the good old days

373
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,240
of finding out your
pregnant and how exciting

374
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,597
and scary and crazy it is.

375
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:11,781
I can't believe I still have these.

376
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:12,614
(Missy laughs)

377
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:14,774
They're just sitting
in, like, weird drawers.

378
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:18,719
But, anyways, I'm just so
excited about Natalia and Jeffrey

379
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,428
and Olivia and Peyton and
how it's just so exciting

380
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:23,454
there's going to be a
new little boy or girl

381
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:24,376
running around here.

382
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:26,071
If you guys haven't seen
the announcement video

383
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,722
it is super special, I'll
have it linked up here

384
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:29,657
you guys can go check it out!

385
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:31,771
Go subscribe to them
'cause now they're starting

386
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:34,462
a whole new journey, a
whole new thing going on.

387
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:36,773
I think she even said she
was gonna do some bump dates.

388
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:38,479
So, if you're a mom you
might get really excited

389
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,478
for something like that.

390
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:42,210
I'm just excited to kind of
follow along, like, we've always

391
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,320
been in each others lives, but, you know,

392
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,796
it's so different when
someone is living their life

393
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:48,107
somewhat on Youtube.

394
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,235
We get to actually follow
it along in that way

395
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:54,140
and I'm so excited and it's
going to be so much fun!

396
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,426
We get to do gender reveals

397
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:59,001
and all the baby showers all over again.

398
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:03,168
Alright boys are all clean
there, wash their hair,

399
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:08,655
wash their faces, brush their
teeth, took their vitamins,

400
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,154
washed their booties!

401
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:12,828
But, anyways, we are ready for bed.

402
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:14,709
You've been kind of crazy today, huh?

403
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,777
Alright, we're going to go
'head and end today's video.

404
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:19,610
Make sure to give a big thumbs up!

405
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:22,988
(Missy laughs)

406
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,623
And we will see you guys tomorrow.

407
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:25,979
Make sure you guys go
subscribe to the Johnson's

408
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:28,299

409
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:29,132
Bye!

410
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,898
(upbeat music)

411
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,262
Ollie wants to do it, ready?

412
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:34,095
- Bye!

413
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:36,866
Poop.

414
