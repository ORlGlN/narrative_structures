13
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,283
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:30,605
- Where we going boys?

15
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,188
- To Disney Land.
- Disney Land.

16
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:35,759
You so excited?

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,521
(bell dings)
These boys are so

18
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,494
excited for Disneyland, huh?

19
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:40,553
Yeah, we decided last night.

20
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:42,591
Well we've been kind of talking
about going for a while.

21
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,336
We have definitely missed it.

22
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:48,475
So we decided that today
was the best day to go.

23
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:51,185
But, (giggles) its the best day to go

24
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,309
because it's the least busy,

25
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,082
but it's still busy enough that
Bryan is not coming with us.

26
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:57,344
Daddy's not coming with us.

27
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,804
But, we're gonna go really soon with him.

28
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,791
We're just gonna enjoy this time

29
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,920
with just these two and mama,

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,534
and I think we're gonna have
a really fun time, okay?

31
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,749
And guess who's coming with us?

32
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:10,080
- Kelsey and Corbin.

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,777
- Kelsey and Corbin and baby June.

34
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:16,404
Are you going to show baby
June all the cool rides?

35
00:01:16,404 --> 00:01:17,950
He's like "Mom, I gotta drink my drink."

36
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,857
Anyways I am all packed up.

37
00:01:19,857 --> 00:01:21,630
I've got all kinds of goodies for the day.

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,570
And I am super excited.

39
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,097
So let's go ahead and
get on the road, okay?

40
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:29,733
- [Missy] Ollie, what are we listening to?

41
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,219
- Nightmare for Christmas.

42
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,880
- Yeah, that's like one of Ollie's

43
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,577
like favorite movies right now.

44
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:36,675
And we just listened to like
(Finn screams)

45
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,699
whole soundtrack on the way here.

46
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,805
Finn is like I'm ready to get
out of this car so let's go.

47
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:44,465
I just told him that there is

48
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,964
a Nightmare Before Christmas ride.

49
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:50,170
And we might even get
to meet Jack Skelington.

50
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,453
- Yes we are.

51
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:52,783
- [Missy] Yes we are.

52
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:53,616
- Ollie's so excited.

53
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,749
I'm actually super sad
that Bryan's not here

54
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,371
cause it's actually kind
of like him and Bryan's

55
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:00,027
like favorite movie to watch together.

56
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,374
So I'm sure Bryan would have
loved to take him on it.

57
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:05,124
But I guess this is
just how it's gonna go.

58
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,509
We'll go on it with Daddy next time huh?

59
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,102
- Yes, yes.

60
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:10,794
- We are super duper excited though.

61
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,860
Our tradition is always
to listen to either

62
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,762
a Disney soundtrack or
Disney Radio on the way here

63
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,446
and it really gets us in the mood.

64
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:21,252
And I'm just excited that
it is fall time at Disney.

65
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,085
It's like my favorite.

66
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:24,548
I actually got the little
ears at a little Bazzar

67
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:26,773
that we went to a few weeks ago.

68
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,273
And I love them their so cute.

69
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,842

70
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:37,759

71
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:42,153

72
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:48,753

73
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,729
We've made it to Disneyland
and look who's with us?

74
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:10,562
- Hi.

75
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:14,691
- Kelsey and Corbin and June.

76
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:16,453
- You can't see her right

77
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:17,639
There she is.

78
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,218

00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:27,174
- Yeah, this is a really fun ride.

84
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,460
And we're taking June on it.

85
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,293
- June's first time on the Rocket.

86
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,056
- We're all a little bit nervous.

87
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:36,743
It is a actually pretty scary ride.

88
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:39,584
- They're pretty high up
there, I'm like nervous.

89
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,580
- Yeah, this is Bryan's
like least favorite ride.

90
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,380
Cause it's actually scary and spins.

91
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,345
- Yeah Kelse's just
scared so she's waiting.

92
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:48,595
- So yeah, we're almost done.

93
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,750
Here we go first ride.

94
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,083

95
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,541
- [Ollie] Good.

96
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,813
- Is this a fun one?

97
00:03:58,813 --> 00:03:59,646
That fun?

98
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:01,960
It's actually pretty scary.

99
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,561
And June is back there.

100
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:05,811
(laughing)

101
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:10,912
(gasps)

102
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:12,450
Ollie, who do you see?

103
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,778
- Captain Hook.

104
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,086
- Are you gonna get a picture with him?

105
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,096
- Yeah.

106
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,144
- Ow wee.

107
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:18,178
- [Missy] You see him?

108
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:19,173
- But is he nice?

109
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:23,059
- I mean its Captain Hook, he's
not like the nicest person.

110
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:25,786
But I don't think he's
gonna like hurt you.

111
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:28,036
(laughing)

112
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,119
(upbeat music)

113
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:32,952
Give him a high fives.

114
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,736
(laughing)

115
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,622
- [Corbin] Finn are you scared?

116
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:42,872
(upbeat calming music)

117
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,160
(upbeat pop music)

118
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:01,530
- I see Jack the Christmas.

119
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,867
- [Missy] Are you so excited?

120
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,051
- [Ollie] Look it.

121
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,391
- [Missy] Oh my goodness,

122
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,056

123
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:09,889
- Yeah.

124
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:10,823
- [Missy] Alright let's go ride it.

125
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:12,502
- The Haunted Mansion gets turned into

126
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:15,668
The Nightmare Before Christmas
ride during the fall season.

127
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:19,331
And the boys are so
excited, especially Ollie.

128
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,190
To ride it.

129
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,819
And normally it's a really long wait,

130
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,478
but we actually got fast passes.

131
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:27,836
- [Ollie] Christmas
powing, Christmas powing.

132
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:31,576
- We're also hoping to
meet Jack and Sallie today.

133
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:32,642
- [Ollie] Look it.

134
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,725

(upbeat calming music)

136
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:45,058
- This this owing, this is owing.

137
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:45,908
(Missy gasps)

138
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:49,333
- [Missy] Are you gonna
go? Are you scared?

139
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,213
- [Ollie] I'm not scared.

140
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:51,463
- [Missy] Okay.

141
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:54,638
(upbeat music)

142
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,590
- [Corbin] It's like one
of my favorite movies.

143
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,757
- [Missy] He's so excited.

144
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,584
(upbeat music)

145
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,258
- [Missy] What do you think so far, Ollie?

146
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,425
Is that scary?

147
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:12,644
No?

148
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:14,727
(laughs)

149
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,954
(upbeat relaxing music)

150
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,169
(upbeat spooky pop music)

151
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,319
(upbeat spooky pop music)

152
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,354
We just went on The
Nightmare Before Christmas

153
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:50,387
and it was so cool.

154
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:52,441
You were not scared at all, huh?

155
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:54,398
And we really really wanted to meet Jack

156
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,914
but it is a little bit of a wait.

157
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:59,573
So I think we might come back
another day to meet Jack.

158
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:02,984
But he looked pretty cool, a
little bit that we saw huh?

159
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:03,817
(Missy chuckles)

160
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:06,093
- Yes, now we are eating some lunch.

161
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,333
Yum, at the French park,

162
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,225
it is like our favorite place to eat.

163
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:12,101
And then we're off to have some more fun.

164
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:15,754
So I was thinking that
Disneyland is amazing

165
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:18,980
but it could be really fun if these guys

166
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,020
actually fit the characters.

167
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,890
Should we do a little
Disneyland magic right now?

168
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,322
Okay, are you ready?

169
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:26,989
Say one, two, three!

170
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:32,433
Oh my goodness look at this magic.

171
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,004
Disney magic has turned
you into Mickie Mouse.

172
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:35,957
(squeaking)

173
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,246
(Missy Gasps)

174
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,226
And you're Donald Duck?

175
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,560
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

176
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,516
And you are Minnie Mouse?

177
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:44,628
- [Kelsey] Yeah.

178
00:07:44,628 --> 00:07:47,616
- [Missy] You guys are so cute.

179
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:48,449
I love it.

180
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:52,261
These kids are so cute.

181
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:55,955
But we're really freaking
(laughs) dying about this one.

182
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:58,859
Look at how cute he
is, totally passed out.

183
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,469
- [Corbin] That is so funny.

184
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:02,620
(Missy laughs)

185
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,060
- [Missy] Are you okay?

186
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,593
It's so cute we're gonna try
and get a picture with them.

187
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:10,343
But he's like "Um, I'm sleeping."

188
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,809
What are you doing?

189
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,617
- [Corbin] Donald Duck,
what happened, buddy?

190
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:21,382
(laughing)

191
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:22,713
It's so funny.

192
00:08:22,713 --> 00:08:25,520
- I feel like I'm holding
an actual duck right now.

193
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,770
(laughing)

194
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:33,935
- [Corbin] Look at his little
tail, it looks so funny.

195
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:36,630
- [Missy] Look at Goofy.

196
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,361
- [Ollie] Skeleton.

197
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:39,294
- [Missy] What is he?

198
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,311
- The Skeleton.

199
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,894
- [Missy] Yeah, that's so cool.

200
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,460
(upbeat pop music)

201
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:51,639
So we were thinking about
going to California Adventures,

202
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,288
but apparently there's a huge line.

203
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:55,642
Corbin's telling us the news.

204
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:56,475
- Costs to get in.

205
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:57,531
- [Missy] What.
- Yeah.

206
00:08:57,531 --> 00:08:58,666
- [Missy] I'm not waiting in that line.

207
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,665
- Both the line for
this lane and California

208
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,306
like going like
- Oh.

209
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:03,345
- So it looks like it's people.

210
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:04,436
- [Missy] I've never seen it like that.

211
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:05,269
- That was crazy.

212
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:08,112
- It must be for like the Mickey
Mouse trick or treat thing.

213
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:11,388
We're definitely not
waiting in that hugs line.

214
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:13,265
So I think we're actually gonna head home.

215
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:14,892
But I am going to give
you some cotton candy.

216
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:15,735
Does that sound good?

217
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:16,568
(kisses)

218
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:18,077
You were so good today,
we had such a fun day.

219
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:21,191
I actually just discovered
that I have some sort of

220
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:23,998
injury on my right like hip.

221
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,180
I think from running,

222
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,539
I'm gonna blame it on
Kelsey, just kidding.

223
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:28,726
(laughs)

224
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,401
I like can barely walk.

225
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,120
So I'm like, "Hmm maybe we should go home,

226
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,646
I'm in a lot of pain right now."

227
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:36,097
So anyways that's where we're headed now.

228
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,558
And Donald Duck is still sleeping in here.

229
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,737
(laughing)

230
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:45,134
- Well hey guys, would
you look who's here.

231
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,658
- [Bryan] What's up dudes.

232
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:47,491
- Good.

233
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,499
- What did you guys do today?

234
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,077
- Go at Disneyland.

235
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:51,986
- [Bryan] You did?

236
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:52,819
- [Ollie] Yeah.

237
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,428
- That is so cool.

238
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,358
Yeah well, Missy was at Disneyland

239
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,719
I stayed at home and
got so much work done.

240
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,140
It was actually very nice.

241
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,159
Ollie wants to tell you something.

242
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,342
What?

243
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:05,659
- There was a Nightmare
For Christmas ride.

244
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:06,727
- There was?

245
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:07,560
- [Ollie] Yes.

246
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,521
- We've been watching that move a lot,

247
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:09,710
did you go on the ride?

248
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,543
- Yes.

249
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,679
- And what did you think?

250
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,225
- I didn't be scared.

251
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,568
- You didn't be scared?

252
00:10:14,568 --> 00:10:15,401
- [Ollie] No.

253
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:16,558
- Yeah, cause it's not very scary right?

254
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:18,225
It's more fun, yeah.

255
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:20,261
What did you think at the end?

256
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,360
- It was pretty cool.

257
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,555
- Did any ghost come home with you?

258
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:25,388
- No

259
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:27,916
- [Bryan] No. Did any ghosts
come home with you Finn?

260
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:28,920
(cartoon music)

261
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,753
(laughing)

262
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:30,763
He's so wiped out.

263
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,417
Both these kids came home
and they are exhausted.

264
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,012
So I made sure to have
pizza here for them,

265
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:36,418
so that they could just chill and eat.

266
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,042
But sounds like they had so much fun.

267
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:39,490
And Ollie just like,

268
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,508
loved The Nightmare Before Christmas ride.

269
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,747
Which I think is amazing.

270
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:44,909
I feel like it means
we're raising him right.

271
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,875
Because we watch
Nightmare Before Christmas

272
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,891
so much in this house.

273
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,675
- [Bryan] Hey babe, how you feelin?

274
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:51,191
- I'm okay.

275
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,580
My like leg really hurts.

276
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,408
Like I can't even like bend it out.

277
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,585
It must have like, just
by walking at Disneyland

278
00:10:57,585 --> 00:11:00,319
it must've like made it really inflamed.

279
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,114
- [Bryan] Yeah, well you
have been working out a ton,

280
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:03,672
so I'm sure that's what it is.

281
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:05,400
- Yeah I'm sure, I just
think I have to rest on it.

282
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,945
I read it, I think it's
called the I.T. Band.

283
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,075
- [Bryan] Oh yeah.

284
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:10,459
And you wore your watch all day?

285
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,556
- Yup.
- Your new Apple Watch?

286
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:13,961
How many steps did it say you took?

287
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:15,713
- I don't know, I don't
understand how to read it.

288
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:16,983
(laughing)

289
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:17,929
- [Bryan] Okay I'll help you.

290
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:21,919
By the way you can see
mine and Charles (chuckles)

291
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,246
Charles Tripeze activity data.

292
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,577
He did 146 today, I saw he
did a light run earlier.

293
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:28,055
- [Missy] He did that like all day.

294
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,446
Like he did that in the
beginning of the day.

295
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:30,279
- [Bryan] Oh that's funny.

296
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,571
So you're on sharing.. let's see.

297
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:32,410
Oh here it is.

298
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,160
So you did, those are
your stats, 4900 steps.

299
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,270
- That's nothing.
- 2.2 miles.

300
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,033
That's a easy Disneyland day.
- Right.

301
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,379
- And my leg is literally burning.

302
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:47,779
Like ow, I'm like, we
barley did anything so.

303
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:48,612
- [Bryan] Bummer.

304
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,176
- Guys there's a rainbow outside.

305
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,278
- There's a rainbow outside?

306
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,111
- Yeah.

307
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,492
- [Bryan] Let's go see
it, let's go see it.

308
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:57,617
Apparently the boys
have spotted a rainbow.

309
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,374
Oh wow what's outside?

310
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:00,207
Holy. Wow.

311
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:07,027
- [Bryan] The sky is like
pink and red. Holy cow.

312
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,691
You guys can't even see it how we can.

313
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:11,294
This is all like so pink, you guys.

314
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:13,217
I thinks its from all those fires.

315
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:15,369
Did you guys see the
fires driving back home?

316
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:16,264
- Oh yes.

317
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:19,353
- [Bryan] Yeah, I think that
probably partially from that.

318
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:20,813
That is amazing.

319
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:22,213
I actually wanna go to
the top of the slide

320
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,518
and see if I can get a better shot.

321
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,713
You guys stay here and look
at the sky from there okay?

322
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,521
(wind blowing)

323
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,041
- [Bryan] Alright the top.

324
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,752
Can see a little better. WoW.

325
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,364
That's crazy. That's
so funny that the boys

326
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:37,043
are like, "There's a rainbow.",

327
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:39,892
well it's just red, it's
not actually a rainbow.

328
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,725
(chuckles)

329
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,607
That's nuts you guys.

330
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:46,286
We get some great sunsets
out here, amazing.

331
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:48,193
Alright boys, you had a fun day?

332
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:49,054
- [Both] Mm-hmm.

333
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:50,530
- Yes, I'm so happy for you guys.

334
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,368
Someone smells like poop.

335
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:53,930
(chuckles)

336
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,386
Anyway I think that's
all for today's video.

337
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:58,863
Be sure to click that thumbs up button.

338
00:12:58,863 --> 00:12:59,696
- Yeah!

339
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,340
- [Bryan] Thumbs up, thumbs up.

340
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,535
Check out the iCard in the corner

341
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:05,534
to watch more fun Disneyland videos.

342
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,429
Thank you guys for watching.

343
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:07,482
We'll see you in Maniana.

344
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:08,664
Ollie what do you say?

345
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:09,497
- Byeeeee.

346
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:16,264
(upbeat pop music)

347
00:13:23,531 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat pop music)
