1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:01,014
- [Bryan] All right, kiddos.

2
00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:02,132
What are we doing here?

3
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:04,035
- Finn, what are you gonna make?

4
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:04,958
- Duh-uh?

5
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:06,282
- Pizza?
- Duh uh?

6
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,115
Look at him go!

7
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:08,298
Ooh, he is taking over.

8
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:09,131
- Good job!

9
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:09,978
- He's like let me do this, Mom.

10
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:10,811
- Ready?

11
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,750
- [Bryan] Awe.

12
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,216
♫ This is our life

13
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:14,536
♫ This is our fun

14
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,618
♫ This is who we are

15
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:17,911
♫ This is our dream

16
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:19,193
♫ this is our team

17
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,708
♫ Shot among the stars

18
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,587
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

19
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:26,693
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

20
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,330
♫ This is our life

21
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,111
♫ Let's live it

22
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,865
♫ Live it forever

23
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:37,762
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)

24
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:39,019
- You ready for school Ollie?

25
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:40,018
- Yeah!

26
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:41,260
- [Bryan] All right.

27
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,889
Taking Ollie to school this morning.

28
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:44,403
And Ollie, say Good morning!

29
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:45,536
- Good morning!

30
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:46,417
- [Bryan] You ready for school buddy?

31
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:47,250
- Yeah!

32
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,497
- He's got his lunchbox,
he's got his share.

33
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:52,092
Today he's sharing fake snake for s.

34
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:53,050
Right? You excited?

35
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,947
- Yeah, I really tricked
you with that snake.

36
00:00:56,947 --> 00:00:58,256
- [Bryan] I remember, yeah. (laughs)

37
00:00:58,256 --> 00:00:59,444
- All right buddy, you're gonna be big

38
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:01,134
and brave and not cry, right?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:02,612
- And you're gonna have
a good day at Preschool?

40
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:03,445
- Yeah.

41
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:04,278
- Kay. I love you.
- Love you too.

42
00:01:04,278 --> 00:01:05,571
- See you soon?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:06,436
- Kay.

44
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:09,581
All righty. Got Ollie to school.

45
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,262
The parking lot was packed, but yay!

46
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:13,553
I got Ollie to school this morning.

47
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:15,244
I don't normally take Ollie to school,

48
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:17,424
which probably explains why
he's like 20 minutes late.

49
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:18,319
But, it's Preschool.

50
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,744
It doesn't really matter.

51
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:21,131
And there was a ton of traffic.

52
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:22,965
Like, where are all these people going?

53
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:23,803
But yes.

54
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:25,422
I got Ollie to school successfully.

55
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:28,214
He did cry and hang onto me and did not

56
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:30,067
want me to leave which was very hard

57
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,735
because he's been doing so good
for the entire school year.

58
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,079
Like halfway through the year now,

59
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,231
all of a sudden he's afraid
and scared and stuff.

60
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,425
His teacher was like,
"It's completely normal

61
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,278
"about this time they start doing this."

62
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:42,664
So, hopefully he has a good day.

63
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:45,136
She says he calms down
pretty fast usually.

64
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,280
I just dropped him off and now
I'm headed back to the house.

65
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,613
(fun music)

66
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:53,847
- Good morning Finny!

67
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,487
Are you playing with all your toys?

68
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:57,320
- Yeah.

69
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,542
- Are you ready to get
ready for the day, bud?

70
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:00,543
- Yeah.

71
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:02,792
- (laughs) Finn has so
much fun on the days that

72
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,798
Ollie ends up going to
school 'cause he just

73
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,134
plays by himself, happy as can be.

74
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,280
He has fun with his brother, but I know

75
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,020
he also loves the alone time.

76
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,717
I'm all ready for the day.

77
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:13,852
Finn's got to get ready.

78
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,651
And then I gotta get some chores done.

79
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,334
I gotta go clean out my
chicken coop, and I'm gonna

80
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:19,940
do a little bit of cooking today.

81
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,652
We've got friends coming
over tonight so I'm gonna

82
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:22,807
make some yummy dessert.

83
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:24,035
(child fussing)

84
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:25,748
- [Missy] Uh-oh! Did you ...

85
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:27,081
Oh, it all fell?

86
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,947
That's okay, you can pick it back up.

87
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:32,173
I gotta get some stuff done, and then

88
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:33,596
we're gonna have a fun day!

89
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,323
You gonna have a fun day today, Finn?

90
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,156
- No.

91
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,434
- [Missy] He's like no, the thing fell!

92
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:38,531
I'll help you pick it up, kay?

93
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:39,451
- Kay.

94
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,972
- It is time to get to
work on my chicken coop.

95
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:45,147
It is definitely a mess
in there and a little

96
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:47,315
I wouldn't say it's overdue
for a little mucking out,

97
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:49,190
'cause we do a method of where

98
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,402
I don't have to clean it every week.

99
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,359
I think I'm supposed to clean
it like every six months

100
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,222
to a year, but it's getting
pretty gross in there.

101
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,900
So I was like, I think
I'm gonna clean it out!

102
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,473
My Dad is coming to help
me out, and the chickens

103
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:03,313
are gonna get some play time outside.

104
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:06,085
And hopefully Luna
doesn't eat you. (laughs)

105
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,552
I'll keep an eye on you guys, okay?

106
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:09,668
Look at Luna.

107
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:12,939
She's just like "Oh my God." (laughs)

108
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,908
Those look so much fun. (laughs)

109
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:18,469
Karma doesn't care about them at all.

110
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:19,698
It's Luna who's like Mmm!

111
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,444
You can just see it in her eyes.

112
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:23,363
She's just like "They look like something

113
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:24,592
I wanna play with."

114
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,811
No Luna! Luna!

115
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,072
Luna do not!

116
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,405
That's a no! No!

117
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:32,926
Again, I would never let her
out without me watching them.

118
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:35,538
And she might- No Luna!

119
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:36,709
Luna!

120
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,316
She's just like "I'm so
happy right now." (laughs)

121
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:42,231
We have filled up about what is it?

122
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,258
Four or five of those?

123
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:47,053
And the coop is looking pretty dang good.

124
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:48,978
There's definitely like some spots,

125
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,867
but looks pretty clean to me.

126
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,351
And now, we are filling up
a much bigger trash can.

127
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,629
I've got a lot more chickens now,

128
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,798
and so they go through a lot
more food than they used to.

129
00:03:56,798 --> 00:03:58,382
So I need a lot more.

130
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,530
But I am so happy!

131
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,003
It looks so clean in here!

132
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,571
Finn, have you been helping?

133
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:06,218
Helping or hindering, you tell me.

134
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,099
- Hey?

135
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,075
- [Missy] You watching
out for the chickens?

136
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:13,242
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)

137
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:19,498
Look how clean it's getting!

138
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:21,402
The outside is all rinsed off.

139
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:23,439
These were like literally caked in dirt.

140
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,795
Now we've gotta pour-

141
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:25,829
- Dirt?

142
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,299
- [Missy] (laughs) Dirt?

143
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,265
- I think yeah, it was chicken poop.

144
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:29,364
- [Missy] Oh yeah.

145
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:30,339
A lot of it was chicken poop.

146
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,620
Now we gotta pour this all in there.

147
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,787
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)

148
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:00,427
Ta-dah!

149
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,930
Look at this comfy bedding for them.

150
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,088
And it's so clean.

151
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:07,391
And it smells like pine.

152
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,478
And the chickens are
like "can we come in?"

153
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,011
"Are you done cleaning?"

154
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,467
That's our rooster.

155
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,915
That actually was Anna,

156
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,248
now I would say we'll name him Kristoff.

157
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,961
- [Missy's Dad] Oh, okay.

158
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:23,046
- [Missy] We'll name
him Kristoff. (laughs)

159
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:24,593
- Oh hey, boys! (laughs)

160
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:25,426
- Hey!

161
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,100
- I just picked up Ollie from school

162
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,260
and we had such a busy time, didn't we?

163
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,272
- Yeah!

164
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,610
- We're just now getting home!

165
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,352
We picked up these Rocket
League Mystery Balls

166
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:36,973
that have little cars in them,

167
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:38,610
but the kids don't know
which kinds they have.

168
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,796
- How do you open it?

169
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:40,629
- [Bryan] Squeeze it.

170
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:41,873
Oh! Just like that!

171
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,065
Boop! What's in it?

172
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:43,898
Ooh!

173
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:45,003
Open it up! Open it up!

174
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,272
All right, I tore it open.

175
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:47,626
You guys pull out your cars!

176
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:50,001
- (gasps) I did!

177
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,251
- [Bryan] Whoa!

178
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,855
It's green, and it's like a big truck!

179
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,035
That's so cool!
- Yeah!

180
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:57,351
- [Bryan] Finn, what did you get?

181
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:58,184
- This!

182
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,952
- [Bryan] Whoa! That's your car?

183
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,159
That is so cool.

184
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:03,159
And check this out boys.

185
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,414
Vroom! Can you make it go?

186
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:08,247
Whoa! Isn't that cool?

187
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:11,761
There you go! Whoa!

188
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,615
Now it's going fast.

189
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:16,698
(lighthearted music)

190
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,110
Go get it Finn! Go get it!

191
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,129
(screams playfully)

192
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,333
Can you do it?

193
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,886
Oh, there it goes! Yay!

194
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,044
- So, for today's story time
we are using the moonlite

195
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:32,043
which turns story time
into a magical experience.

196
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:34,521
It basically makes the
story book come to life.

197
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,573
I love the fact that
moonlite was created by a mom

198
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:40,442
for parents everywhere who
love reading to their children.

199
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:44,415
The moonlite has full HD
projection, sound effects

200
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,831
and more all powered by your phone.

201
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:50,749
This helps make story time
engaging, playful, and memorable.

202
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:53,029
There's always time for story time,

203
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,812
no matter how busy our lives get,

204
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:57,114
we always make time to
read to our children.

205
00:06:57,114 --> 00:07:00,177
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)

206
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,731
All right Ollie, are you ready
to make a book come to life?

207
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:03,734
- Yeah!

208
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:04,567
All right.

209
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:05,981
We've just gotta turn out the light, okay?

210
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:10,148
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)

211
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,698

219
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,441
- We're having a pizza night
with some of our friends.

220
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:35,394
Brooke brought over these
amazing little crusts

221
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:39,142
for the kids, most likely us because

222
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,044
we're like putting this
all together and the kids

223
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,559
are just running around crazy. (laughs)

224
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,502
We have all these amazing ingredients.

225
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:48,205
We've got bacon, canadian
bacon, cilantro, peppers,

226
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:50,796
chicken, tons of cheese, and sauces.

227
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:54,432
And we are going to make
personalized pizzas tonight.

228
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,142
Hey! What's up kiddos!

229
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,763
- Are you vlogging us,
are you vlogging us?

230
00:07:57,763 --> 00:07:59,201
- [Bryan] I'm vlogging you! (laughs)

231
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:00,532
- Yay!

232
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:01,649
- [Bryan] What are you guys doing?

233
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,771
Are you playing Hot Wheels?

234
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:03,684
- [Jude] Yeah!

235
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,716
- [Bryan] You playing with cars Ollie?

236
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:06,198
(Ollie screams playfully)

237
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:08,684
- [Bryan] Ollie is so excited to have

238
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:10,227
some friends over to play.

239
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:12,658
This is Joelle and Jude.

240
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,852
You guys okay to play with
Ollie and Finn tonight?

241
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:15,771
- [Jude] Yep.

242
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:16,786
- [Ollie] I have a pile of them!

243
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:17,780
- [Bryan] Can you keep them company?

244
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,661
- [Jude] Yep.

245
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:19,494
- [Bryan] You know what
you guys should do?

246
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:20,327
- Huh?

247
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,956
- [Bryan] You should teach
them a choreographed dance.

248
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:24,484
You up for the challenge? (laughs)

249
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,230
- I do not know what you're talking about.

250
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,063
- [Bryan] Oh, okay. (laughs)

251
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,160
Are you guys gonna design pizzas?

252
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,993
- [Joelle] Yes.

253
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:30,925
- [Bryan] You excited
to design a pizza, dude?

254
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:31,802
- Yeah!

255
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,378
- Are we allowed to say how old we are?

256
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:34,826
- [Bryan] Sure, how old are you?

257
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:35,659
- Six.

258
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,049
- [Bryan] And how old are you, dude?

259
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,046
- Seven.

260
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:39,126
- [Bryan] Six and seven!

261
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:40,611
Have fun guys!

262
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:44,048
Okay, so we are doing
a pizza art challenge.

263
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,210
Kay, I am going to attempt to make

264
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,035
a Christmas tree on the pizza.

265
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:51,031
A lot of people do the
pancake art challenge,

266
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,423
but I'm gonna try it pizza style, okay?

267
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:54,420
- [Missy] Yeah!

268
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,727
- So first you need some red sauce.

269
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:57,907
That's a lot.

270
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:00,118
- [Missy] (laughs) That was
a lot of sauce. (laughs)

271
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:01,930
- That was a lot of red sauce.

272
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,763
Apologies.

273
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:07,145
(lighthearted music)

274
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:09,229
Next, I'm going for
cheese, and you know what?

275
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,303
The cheese I'm not going to
incorporate into the design,

276
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:12,795
I'm just gonna have it all over.

277
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:14,251
- [Missy] That sounds like a good idea.

278
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,251
- A nice base of cheese.

279
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,834
- [Missy] Yep. Yum!

280
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,758
- I'm going to use orange bell pepper

281
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:25,122
for the stump of my Christmas tree.

282
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:26,673
- [Missy] Mmm! There you go!

283
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:29,159
- Kay? And then I have cilantro
which is quite possibly

284
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,143
the best pizza ingredient in the world!

285
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,211
Let me know down below
in the comments also

286
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,515
what is your favorite pizza ingredient?

287
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:37,825
- [Missy] This is looking pretty good!

288
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:40,550
- I'm gonna shape that kind
of in a Christmas tree.

289
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,847
But I have lots of other greens.

290
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,925
- [Missy] Oh yeah.

291
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:43,758
- So we've got arugula, which is also

292
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,380
really good on pizza.

293
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,681
Shout out to Brooke for
bringing the arugula.

294
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:50,158
(Missy laughs)

295
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:53,998
You can't have a pizza
without some decor, so

296
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:56,712
we've got little red pieces of bell pepper

297
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:59,057
just kind of scattered throughout.

298
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,356
And now you've got like, ornaments!

299
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,409
What do you think, you guys?

300
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,770
Christmas tree pizza.
- That is so cute!

301
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,644
I love it!

302
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:09,063
- And I'm gonna have a nice
yellow glowing star on top.

303
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:13,424
What do you think Ollie,
is that cool? (laughs)

304
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,684
- [Missy] He's like "It looks
cool, but I wouldn't eat it."

305
00:10:15,684 --> 00:10:18,327
Huh, would you ever eat that Ollie?

306
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,844
What do you think Jude?

307
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:21,466
- [Bryan] Okay Jude, what do you think?

308
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,319
- It's yummy, but my
least favorite ingredient.

309
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:26,164
- [Missy] Yeah. Like it looks cool,

310
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:27,569
but you don't want to eat it.

311
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:28,809
- Yeah, but it looks really cool.

312
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:30,258
- It's the coolest thing I've
ever seen in my whole life.

313
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:32,311
- It's the coolest thing she's ever seen!

314
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,253
You guys, I am a pizza artist master.

315
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:37,066
- I was gonna say that too!

316
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,213
It's really cool.

317
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:40,119
The coolest pizza I've ever seen.

318
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,231
- [Missy] (laughs) Are
you eating an apple now?

319
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:43,555
- It even has leaves for the tree.

320
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,743
- [Bryan] I know!

321
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:45,769
I honestly didn't plan that.

322
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,191
- Edible leaves.

323
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,397
- [Bryan] All right.

324
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,296
Kids table is hoppin'
with some pizza making.

325
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:52,429
What are you making?

326
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:56,770
- I'm gonna make a pesto
happy face bacon pizza.

327
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,582
Like the eyes would be pepperoni,

328
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:02,070
the nose would be pepperoni,

329
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,940
and the happy face would be bacon.

330
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,469
- [Bryan] Okay, I'm down.

331
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:06,409
How about you?

332
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:07,242
What are you making?

333
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:09,251
- I'm just gonna make a pizza for my dad.

334
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,404
- [Bryan] Oh!

335
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,821
That's so sweet! For her dad!

336
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:17,318
- I don't actually know
what he wants on it.

337
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:18,542
- [Bryan] All right kiddos,
what are we doing here?

338
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,895
- Finn, what are you gonna make?

339
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:21,728
- Duh uh?

340
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:23,288
- Pizza?
- Duh uh?

341
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:24,282
- Do you wanna mix is around?

342
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,200
- [Bryan] He probably wants all the meat.

343
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,197
Look at him go!

344
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:28,406
Oh, he is taking over.
- Good job!

345
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:31,009
- [Bryan] He's like let me do this mom.

346
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:32,529
- Is that glue?

347
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,288
- It's the glue that
holds it all together.

348
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,338
- [Jude] Mine looks like a booger pizza.

349
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:38,471
- [Bryan] Oh it does kind of look

350
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:39,918
like a booger pizza! (laughs)

351
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:43,001
(lighthearted music)

352
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,635
Finn! You made a happy face?

353
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:48,784
- Is that yours?

354
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,780
- [Bryan] Good job, dude!

355
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,863
(lighthearted music)

356
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,242
All right, so this was
make your own pizza night

357
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:08,932
and everyone basically
made the same pizza.

358
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:11,235
You guys realize we could
have just ordered this?

359
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:12,715
(group laughs)

360
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,424
That looks really, really good.

361
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:16,184
Fresh garlic even? Mmm!

362
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:18,598
We have some really good looking pizzas.

363
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:21,406
And the Christmas tree
pizza is out of the oven.

364
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,860
And look at that, that is
actually really good, you guys.

365
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,494
What do you guys think?

366
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,716
Let me know in the comments

367
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:28,459
what you think of my Christmas pizza.

368
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,542
(lighthearted music)

369
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,483
Hey dude, did you have fun today?

370
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:41,493
- Yeah.

371
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,087
- [Bryan] Yeah, that was
so cool making pizzas

372
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:44,546
and having your friends over, huh?

373
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,620
- Yeah.

374
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,365
- [Bryan] Yeah. You had a good day?

375
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,363
- Yeah.

376
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:49,742
- Good, It's bed time?

377
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:51,289
It's bed time.

378
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:54,926
He got to stay up so late
and you watched movies

379
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:58,287
and cuddled with all your friends, yeah?

380
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:02,643
We actually had a very rigorous
game of Scrabble tonight.

381
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:05,305
But anyway I think that
is all for today's video.
