00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,497

cleaning your play room.

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,703
- Okay Momma.

3
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,844
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:32,624
- That looks good.

5
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:41,875
A wand!

6
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:48,610
(wand booming)

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,446
I cleaned my play room!

8
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:52,343
♫ This is our life this is our fun

9
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,699

14
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:10,634
♫ Living for your fam

15
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,889
- [Both] Good morning!

16
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:17,298
- Hey guys, so what did you
think, the new intro babe?

17
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:18,795
- It's pretty cool.

18
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,212
- I'm so excited.

19
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:25,563
- It's super different but
yet still our same style.

20
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,590
- It's short and sweet and
to the point too, which a lot

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,050
of you wanted.

22
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,286
And a new song and a new
animation, I think it's cool.

23
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:34,015
- I really like intros, I
know people have different

24
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:36,768
opinions on them and
personally I think it's cool

25
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,211
that people can watch our
show or watch our videos

26
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,783
and know who we are
and what our names are.

27
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:43,075
- Before it technically starts.

28
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,893
- So I'm not offended if
you guys skip it but I love

29
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:47,604
the intro and I think it's
important for us to have.

30
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:49,308
- No we worked hard on
that intro and you need to

31
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:50,141
watch it every single time!

32
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:50,974
- Yes watch it every time!

33
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:51,807
- Every single time!

34
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:52,710
Anyway what's up guys?

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,142
Today we got the whole damn
fam over, oops I did it again.

36
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:58,737
I Brittany'd it'.

37
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,607
- But Auntie is not here and Ollie was

38
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:02,018
pretty upset about it.

39
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,470
- Alright Mimi what are we doing today?

40
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,876
- Alright we're gonna do some
carne asada, kind of fajita,

41
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,077
kind of asada, I don't
know, what's the difference?

42
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:10,377
I don't know, tell us in the comments.

43
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:12,726
- [Dad] We have some veggies to stir fry,

44
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:14,197
we've got meats.

45
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:15,430
- Avocado!

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,847
- [Mimi] We've got some rice.

47
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:20,673
(meoowing)

48
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,564
- Oh no I changed my head!

49
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:25,314
Let's change it back!

50
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,270
I got it back!

51
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,937
I think little Finn!

52
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:35,568
(laughing)

53
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,755
(upbeat music)

54
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,043
It's Uncle!

55
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:52,109
He's such a good swimmer!

56
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,614
(laughing)

57
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,504
- These dental bills are gonna be so high

58
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:09,621
I'm gonna have to get a loan shark.

59
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:10,454
- Got you!

60
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:16,151
That's Mimi!

61
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,707
- Ollie what are you doing over there?

62
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,290
Oh, am I a rabbit!?

63
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,360
- Got you Mimi!

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,974
- How did I become a rabbit!

65
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,786
(laughing)

66
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,884
Oliver, did you do this?

67
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,967
- Hey man, no it's all

69
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,210
- Dad is supposed to be a cute teddy bear.

70
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,819
- Yeah I know.

71
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:45,565
Yeah so what are you guys doing today?

- You turned me into a teddy bear?!

78
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:00,778
- Can I cuddle you tonight?

79
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:02,611
- Hang on, I gotta go.

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,533
(vacuuming)

81
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,280
- Mama's cleaning!

82
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:19,483
Can I see a panda clean? (laughing)

83
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:27,130
- Am I a panda!?

84
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,695

86
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,550
- Papa's fixing something!

87
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:51,026
- Oliver!

88
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:52,905
- I changed your head!

89
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:54,384
- You changed my head didn't you!?

90
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:55,744
(laughing)

91
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:57,867
I'm trying to fix the sink Oliver!

92
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,867
- Fix the sink now Papa!

93
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,460
- Okay you guys, this is the
last straw, Ollie has been

94
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,443
pranking us all day with
his magic wand turning

95
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:11,253
our heads into animal
heads, and that's not right

96
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:13,264
and we're angry, huh

97
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:14,908
(growling)

98
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:17,323
So let's go get him!

99
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:19,406
- I'm in so much trouble!

100
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,354
(shouting)

101
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:27,275
- [Dad] You change my head back Ollie!

102
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:31,023
- Oliver, Oliver James you

103
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:32,856

00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:44,060
Ollie wake up, you're dreaming,

00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:46,595
- What happened?

108
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:49,928
- What were you doing, are you dreaming?

109
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:55,113
He must have had a crazy drea.

110
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:56,609
We heard him yelling!

111
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:58,751

112
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:00,642
- Say "good morning Ollie!"

113
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:02,694
Ollie what did you dream about?

114
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:06,071
- I turned all your heads into animals.

115
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,118

116
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:08,285
