1
00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:02,358
- [Missy] Finn, guess what?

2
00:00:02,358 --> 00:00:03,870
(laughter)
It's nap time.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,845
- No.

4
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:06,182
- [Missy] It's nap time.

5
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:07,501
It's nap time.

6
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,858
Nap time.

7
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:11,090
♪ It's our lives ♪

8
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,033
♪ Let's live it ♪

9
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,854
♪ Live it forever ♪

10
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,520
- Good morning.

11
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,373
Are you ready for school, bud?

12
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:19,320
- Yeah.

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,329
- Are you excited?

14
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,162
- Yeah.

15
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:21,995
- Today is share day.

16
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:23,140
What are you going to be sharing today?

17
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,710
- My Captain Jake and the
Never Land Pirates sword.

18
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,543
- Yes.

19
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:30,010
That's a lot of words and we are looking

20
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,439
for something that
starts with the letter J.

21
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,830
We could not think of
anything, other than Jessie,

22
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,144
which we have a Jessie from Toy Story,

23
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,340
but it's kind of like a collectable item

24
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,580
and it's kind of put up on the high shelf

25
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,790
that we don't really play with,

26
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,210
so I didn't really want to do that one

27
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,420
and then I found a Jake and
the Never Land Pirates sword.

28
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,370
That starts with the letter J.

29
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,090
I mean, technically it's
like a sword I guess

30
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,160
but Jake and the Never Land Pirates,

31
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,940
so I mean I guess that'll work.

32
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,995
Right?

33
00:00:57,995 --> 00:00:59,360
Cause Jake starts with a...

34
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:01,079
- Q.

35
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,107
(laughter)

36
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:04,700
- J.
- J.

37
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,290
Jake, juh, juh.

38
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,120
Jake starts with the letter...

39
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,953
- Q.

40
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:09,786
- J.

41
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,150
Preschoolers, they're so cute.

42
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,260
We need to work on the letter J.

43
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,210
Alright, Ollie is off to school.

44
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,340
I actually just got my
hair done with Michelle.

45
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,630
Oh my goodness, I just dropped it.

46
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,930
Yeah, just got my hair
done really, really quick.

47
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,850
I love Michelle, she's so nice.

48
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,003
She's like, "Sure, come in.

49
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,000
"I'll do your hair."

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,620
And I'm actually headed to
a horseback riding lesson.

51
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,310
And I actually haven't really filmed

52
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,740
any of my horseback riding lessons yet,

53
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,900
so maybe I will film a little bit of this.

54
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,210
The only thing is that
when I'm doing a lesson

55
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,620
I do have to be super
focused and so if I'm filming

56
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,500
it makes it a little
difficult, but we'll see.

57
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,818
Maybe I'll get some fun little footage.

58
00:01:47,818 --> 00:01:50,229
It's lesson time, Nacho.

59
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,290
Are you ready?

60
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:53,168
Are you going to be good?

61
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:54,199
You gonna be nice to me?

62
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,782
(upbeat music)

63
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,380
Good lesson, Nacho.

64
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,400
We did so good today, huh?

65
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,759
We practiced a lot of just transitioning

66
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,000
from trotting to cantering.

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,170
I would say I did pretty good,

68
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,100
but he did really, really good.

69
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,300
He has a bit of a habit
to throw his head up

70
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,370
and keep his head too
high, and he's definitely

71
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,720
starting to relax his head
as you can see right now.

72
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,610
He's just do, do, do, let's
just relax and have a fun time

73
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,290
and this is how he was
even trotting, too, so.

74
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,240
And it's just been fun
to kind of grow with him,

75
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,040
cause we're both learning a
lot together and he's just

76
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,220
such a fast learner
and a good, good horse.

77
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,440
- Alright you guys, I am
back at the studio space,

78
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,170
which is still just a
giant, empty building,

79
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,530
but check this out.

80
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,150
These closets were all torn out.

81
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,420
The little reception area
that was here is all torn out.

82
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,630
So it's like way bigger.

83
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,530
Still trying to get this carpet up,

84
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,040
and today we're doing
something really cool.

85
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,740
So we got Justin Critz here.

86
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,660
Do you guys remember him?

87
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,170
He helped me out on my album.

88
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,130
He's gonna be doing some
recording for me as we do

89
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,290
a cover video on this cool new
DJI Osmo, which is awesome.

90
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,160
Are you loving it?

91
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,460
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's so cool.

92
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,690
I love that you can control
the direction of the joystick.

93
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,560
The entire place is filling up with smoke,

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
as you can see, so this
is gonna be really cool.

95
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,620
Also, this may be one of
the only videos we film

96
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,120
in this building before
we get it all built out,

97
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,070
so we're gonna try and
highlight some of the

98
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,470
industrial features of
it before it looks all

99
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,230
nice and pretty and like
a nice new building.

100
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,740
Look at that, that smoke is
just lingering under that light.

101
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,573
I love it.

102
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:35,376
(techno music)

103
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,990
Alright, so we just finished filming.

104
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,930
Justin, thank you so much.

105
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,763
You're awesome.
- Of course.

106
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:47,596
No, thank you.

107
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:50,190
- [Bryan] So now we're taking
some photos and what is this?

108
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,023
Is this--

109
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:51,859
- It's a prism.

110
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:52,692
It's called a prism.

111
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,700
- [Bryan] It's like something
from The Fifth Element.

112
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,832
- It is.
- Oh, cool.

113
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:55,665
- I don't think I use it correctly,

114
00:03:55,665 --> 00:04:00,630
but I just use it to add some
light flares around here.

115
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,463
- [Bryan] It's cool.

116
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:03,050
- Yeah, a lot of people use it
for reflections, but I don't.

117
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,430
- [Byran] No, dude, that's awesome.

118
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,043
He's taking some cool photos.

119
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:08,626
(techno music)

120
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,420
- Alright, I am home.

121
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,680
Or I'm not home, I'm
at Mimi and Papa's now.

122
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,450
And look, it's Finnie.

123
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,820
Have you been having fun with Mimi?

124
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,653
- Yeah.

125
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:23,300
- Yeah?
(laughter)

126
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,660
He's just been hanging
out here for a little bit.

127
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,990
Wow, you have so much energy.

128
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,800
It's actually nap time so

129
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,590
just get the rest of that out now.

130
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,423
I don't know if you guys know,

131
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:35,950
but Bryan is just working
on some stuff today

132
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,367
and a little busy, so he got
to hang out with Mimi and Papa.

133
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:40,370
- Yeah.
- [Missy] Yeah.

134
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,203
Was that fun?

135
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:43,050
Guess what, guess what?

136
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,883
It's nap time.

137
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,160
(laughter)
Finn.

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,993
Guess what?

139
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:48,882
It's nap time.

140
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:49,715
- No.

141
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,038
- It's nap time.

142
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:52,124
It's nap time.

143
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:55,380
(laughter)
It's nap time.

144
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,586
Alright, after a little convincing,

145
00:04:57,586 --> 00:05:00,280
I think he knows he's going
down for a nap, right?

146
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,170
- Yeah.

147
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,003
- Can you say night night?

148
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:02,836
And then when you wake up,

149
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,840
we're gonna go play, play, play, okay?

150
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,040
He gets to sleep in his
bedroom at Mimi and Papa's.

151
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,030
I don't know if you guys remember.

152
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,770
We totally did this room.

153
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,530
They actually ended up
switching it back to a twin bed

154
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,740
and then this has a pull-out bed in there.

155
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,900
They can both still sleep here,

156
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,530
but it's a lot roomier
in here when they're not.

157
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,143
We're gonna try and take a nap now.

158
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:24,440
We'll see how--

159
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,590
Good job.

160
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,468
Turning your sound machine on.

161
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:31,218
(peaceful music)

162
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:35,420
(record scratch)
And this is about

163
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,620
as far as we got with nap time.

164
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,970
Not gonna happen, huh?

165
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,803
- Yeah.

166
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:40,636
- Yeah.

167
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:42,240
You're gonna have to sleep in the car.

168
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,616
And of course he fell asleep
the second we hit the car,

169
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,370
actually probably like one minute

170
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,690
into our drive he was fast asleep.

171
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,230
But look who's here now.

172
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,063
- Hi.

173
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,896
- [Missy] How was school?

174
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:56,729
- Good.

175
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:57,562
- [Missy] Did you share your Jake

176
00:05:57,562 --> 00:05:58,820
and the Never Land Pirate stuff?

177
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,800
- Yeah.

178
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,950
- [Missy] So cool.

179
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,783
How did it go?

180
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:02,616
Did everyone like it?

181
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:03,449
- Yeah.

182
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,110
- [Missy] Was there any other
cool share toys that you saw?

183
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,943
- Mm hm.

184
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:06,776
- [Missy] Which ones?

185
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:07,810
- Peyton's jellyfish.

186
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,830
- A jellyfish from Peyton?

187
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,040
That's so cool.

188
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,670
Yeah, it was so nice, I actually ran into

189
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,620
Jeffrey when I was
running in and I was like,

190
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,130
"can you watch Finn so
that I don't have to

191
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,290
"bring him out of the car seat?"

192
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,300
So Jeffrey watched him while I got Ollie,

193
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,480
so I'm like a little out of breath.

194
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,590
Finn stayed asleep, so yay.

195
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,520
Thank you, Jeffrey.

196
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,578
Alright, we're off to go home.

197
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:29,000
(laughter)

198
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,461
- [Bryan] What are you laughing at, boys?

199
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,292
- [Missy] No, don't hit it.

200
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,194
- [Bryan] She's got it, she's got it.

201
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,027
- Ready?

202
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,226
Ah.

203
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,410
Hang on, hang on.

204
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,380
- I knew it.

205
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,200
- [Bryan] Look at that balance,
that poise, and that grace.

206
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,170
That's amazing.

207
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,010
Get it, babe?

208
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,199
That's a-maze-ing.
- A maze?

209
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,670
- Cause this is Maze-O, and it's a maze

210
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,424
game that the boys are going to play.

211
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:56,446
- Do you guys want to play this?

212
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:57,470
Can I open it?

213
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,303
- [Bryan] Alright, so the boys

214
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,810
are going to be playing
this cool little STEM toy.

215
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,300
It's the mighty maze
maker and what they do

216
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,150
is they draw a card,
which has a shape on it,

217
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,150
and then they have to
build it with their maze.

218
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,129
- So they have lots of cool pictures

219
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,140
that you can make with it.

220
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,460
- [Bryan] Ooh, look at the pirate ship.

221
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,293
- A pirate ship.

222
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:13,650
That's just a heart.

223
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,208
Here's a big old whale.

224
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,910
- [Bryan] So you know
what this means, boys.

225
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,670
We're gonna have to do a little friendly

226
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,290
competition brother against brother.

227
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,401
Who's gonna win?

228
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,630
- I think it's me.

229
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,463
- [Bryan] You?

230
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:25,296
What about you, Finn?

231
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:26,247
Who's gonna win?

232
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,994
- Mama.
- [Bryan] Mama's gonna win.

233
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:28,827
- That's probably right.

234
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,057
- [Ollie] I'm the champion.

235
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:31,743
(laughter)
- [Missy] Are you

236
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,836
going to win, Finn?

237
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:33,669
- Yeah.
- [Missy] Yeah.

238
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:34,502
- Daddy.

239
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:35,520
- [Missy] Daddy's gonna win.

240
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,400
- So what we'll do is
we'll give them a card,

241
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,100
we'll let both of them create it,

242
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,030
and then we'll see who wins.

243
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,220
This is how you make kids grow,

244
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,170
you have to pit them against each other.

245
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,310
Alright, boys, round one.

246
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,800
You guys are going to
be making a puzzle box.

247
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,260
Here is all of the things
you are going to need.

248
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,720
These are puzzle pieces
that you're gonna have to

249
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,490
put together to create this, okay?

250
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,760
Finn is thinking very, very hard

251
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,059
on this one, using
those fine motor skills.

252
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:06,809
(cheerful music)

253
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:15,760
- Blue piece, yellow piece,
green piece, and red piece.

254
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,730
- [Bryan] Yep, so grab all
your pieces first, Ollie,

255
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,448
and then you can put them together.

256
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:22,198
(cheerful music)

257
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,539
Alright, Ollie is all
finished with his maze.

258
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,929
Let's see it.

259
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,679
That is so cool.

260
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,749
So how does it go, Ollie?

261
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,039
Can you figure out how to do it?

262
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,492
So you start right here or right here.

263
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:47,816
(cheerful music)

264
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:48,649
- Good job.

265
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:49,490
- [Bryan] Good job.

266
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,670
- I think that's like, really good

267
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,190
for him to put that together.
- [Bryan] I know.

268
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,080
- I don't know if he really
knows the concept of a maze.

269
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,980
- Yeah.
- So it's

270
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,813
a good thing to learn.

271
00:08:58,813 --> 00:08:59,780
- And this is so fun because this is

272
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,260
like a super easy one,
but it goes up in levels.

273
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,840
- [Bryan] So Ollie, look,
what makes this a maze

274
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,040
is you have to figure out the way out,

275
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,940
because what if you went this
way and then went over here?

276
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,773
Oh.

277
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:10,380
You'd be stuck, huh?

278
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,390
- Can't go that way, huh?

279
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,600
- [Bryan] So you gotta go
all the way back around.

280
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,160
And Finn is building
a pretty amazing maze.

281
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
He kind of broke the mold.

282
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,273
He was like, "You know what?

283
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,660
"I don't really need instructions
on how to play this game.

284
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,940
"I'm gonna play it on my own."

285
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,570
And he did very well.

286
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,403
- Yes.

287
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:27,441
- [Bryan] Look at what he's making, babe.

288
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,973
- That was awesome, Finnie.

289
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:30,058
- [Bryan] That is so awesome.
- Look, if you

290
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:31,750
go in this way and go that
way, you'll get stuck.

291
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,770
You can't go that way.

292
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,996
Good job.

293
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:35,440
- [Ollie] That's cool, Finn.

294
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,010
- [Bryan] He's so good at it.

295
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,320
Good job, Finn.

296
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,730
Last one?

297
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,563
- Yeah.
- Alright.

298
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:44,436
Put the last one right there.

299
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:48,580
There you go, you did it.
(clapping)

300
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,222
He's so proud of himself.

301
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,160
It's adorable.

302
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,810
Alright, can you do the maze now?

303
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,060
Go this way, and this
way, and this way, and oh.

304
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,893
Not over here.

305
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,032
Oh, out there.

306
00:09:59,032 --> 00:09:59,865
- Woo.

307
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:03,800
- I want to get a car
to go drive the maze.

308
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,520
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's a good idea, dude.

309
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,353
Go get one.

310
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:07,350
You go, too, Finnie.

311
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,110
You each can grab a little
car for your maze, okay?

312
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,780
Alright, Missy is now
doing the Maze-O boy,

313
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,000
which is a boy one, and we're gonna see

314
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,210
how the boys do going through the maze.

315
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,532
So you gotta go up the leg
and out the arm, okay boys?

316
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:27,365
- Okay.

317
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,810
- [Bryan] Alright, so Mama
finished the boy maze,

318
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,240
and now we're going to
time them and see how long

319
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,530
it takes each of them
to do the maze properly.

320
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,210
- Yeah, so Ollie you're
going to use this car

321
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,980
and you're gonna start here and you have

322
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,960
to get to here without
going over any walls.

323
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,980
You just have to drive through, okay?

324
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,680
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

325
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,513
Okay.

326
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:48,340
On your marks, get set, go.

327
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,370
- [Bryan] Go, Ollie, go.

328
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,153
Good job.

329
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:53,040
Oh, he did it.

330
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:55,408
- Guess that was really easy.

331
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:56,930
(laughter)
- [Bryan] Ollie,

332
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,130
that was like seven seconds.

333
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,580
Good job, bro.
- [Missy] Yay.

334
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,007
- [Bryan] Alright, Finnie, your turn.

335
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,485
How fast can Finnie do it, you ready?

336
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:03,318
- Ready.

337
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:04,400
On your marks, get set, go.

338
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,510
- [Bryan] Go, go, go.

339
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,750
Good job.

340
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,420
- Four seconds, he won.

341
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,610
- [Bryan] Babe, did you do this one right?

342
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,950
- I think so.

343
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,969
- [Bryan] You most definitely did, yes.

344
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,692
I don't know why that was so easy.

345
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,240
- Okay, I'm gonna switch around a couple.

346
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,073
Hang on.

347
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:22,530
- [Bryan] And look, there's
a Maze-O boy on this side

348
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,888
and Maze-O girl on this side.

349
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:25,721
- Wait, I wanna see.

350
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:26,749
- [Bryan] Yeah.

351
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:29,186
- Girl on this side, boy on this side.

352
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:30,019
- [Bryan] Cool.

353
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:33,553
- [Missy] Okay, so Mama
has now built a girl, see?

354
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:36,490
She's got red hair, she's
got two little arms,

355
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,710
she's got a cute little
dress on, and some legs.

356
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,130
We're gonna go ahead
and race doing this one.

357
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm hoping it's a little bit harder

358
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,560
since the boy was so easy.

359
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,790
So here we go, okay?

360
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,790
You have to get from this leg
all the way to this arm, okay?

361
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,623
- Okay. My turn.

362
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:55,050
- [Missy] On your marks, get set, go.

363
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,740
(upbeat music)

364
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,923
Nope, nope.

365
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:03,756
Don't go over.

366
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:07,647
- [Ollie] There?

367
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,805
- [Missy] Uh, oh.

368
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:11,850
- [Ollie] Stuck.

369
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,683
- [Missy] No, no.

370
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:14,080
Okay, there you go.

371
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:20,648
You've gotta back up and then turn.

372
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:23,231
(upbeat music)

373
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,700
Uh, oh.

374
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,108
Are you stuck?

375
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:29,941
- I don't know.

376
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:31,790
- [Missy] So, Ollie, get back to here.

377
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,320
(laughter)

378
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,653
Go back to here.

379
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:39,520
Now turn.

380
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,353
See?

381
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,529
(mumbling)

382
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,640
And...

383
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,802
Oh, I forgot to set the timer.

384
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,580
Um, you did one minute.

385
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,413
Good job.

386
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:52,340
High five.

387
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,240
That was a hard one, huh?

388
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,500
Okay, it's Finn's turn.

389
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,540
On your marks, get set, and start.

390
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,932
Go.

391
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:01,760
(mumbling)

392
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,780
Go.

393
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
Can you get through?

394
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,340
- All the way to that one.

395
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,173
- [Missy] Good job.

396
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:09,380
Oh, wrong arm.

397
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,230
You gotta go through this way.

398
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,920
Whew, apparently the girl is a lot harder.

399
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,270
Where do you go from there?

400
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:20,770
- [Finn] Ah.
- [Missy] Ah.

401
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,230
- [Ollie] Go through this way, Finn.

402
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,130
- [Missy] Oh, he's starting over.

403
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:27,820
(laughter)
Well, I think

404
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,570
it's safe to say that Finn
doesn't really understand

405
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,684
and this one is definitely a harder one.

406
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:35,111
Yay.

407
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:35,956
You did it.

408
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,515
Woohoo, good job, boys.

409
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:38,820
This is awesome.

410
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,900
Not only is it awesome for
them to be able to build,

411
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,530
which I just built some really hard ones

412
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,640
that they wouldn't be able to do,

413
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,370
but it's just really good for them to put

414
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,800
puzzles together like this, but also good

415
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,445
to actually try and do the maze.

416
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,476
And this is such a cute little car.

417
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:53,030
Rr, er, ah.

418
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,570
(Finn yelling)

419
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,403
Alright.

420
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,269
It is time for bedtime, huh?

421
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,102
- [Ollie] Yeah.

422
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:02,950
- Yep, and we are reading our book.

423
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,140
I'm actually reading "Dragons Love Tacos."

424
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,370
Every night, we read books, right?

425
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,203
- Yeah.

426
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:09,351
- How many books do we
get to read every night?

427
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:10,360
- [Finn] Three.

428
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,039
- [Missy] Three, you're right.

429
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,470
- Three and five.

430
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,460
- Three and five?

431
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,840
Sometimes between three and five.

432
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,610
I try and keep it between three

433
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,170
on a normal night, two
if I'm like, go to bed.

434
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,410
And like five if I'm like,
"Well, it's a little early."

435
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,450
"I guess we can stay up."

436
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,010
So which book is your favorite?

437
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,500
- This book.

438
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
- [Missy] That's your favorite?

439
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,600
- [Ollie] And this book.

440
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,490
- [Missy] Uh huh, so these
ones are all about Oliver,

441
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,170
but he can actually say every single word

442
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,050
of that book from start to finish.

443
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,400
You have that one memorized.

444
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,020
Finn is definitely a little tired tonight.

445
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,442
As you guys know, he
didn't get much of a nap.

446
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,010
He's not super happy.

447
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,980
I was trying to think of
what his favorite book is.

448
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,590
I would say that his favorite
book is this one right now.

449
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,130
He got this when we went to Hawaii

450
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,290
and whenever we read it he get so excited

451
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,840
cause he has that little monkey.

452
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,220
We've got a lot of books here,

453
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,860
but we've read all these
about 100 times, huh?

454
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,760
So yeah, let us know down below what your

455
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,400
favorite bedtime story is
and we'll read over them

456
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,100
and get some of the ones
that you guys enjoy.

457
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,540
But anyways, for now we're gonna go ahead

458
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,630
and end the video, so make
sure you give this video

459
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,460
a big thumbs up if you enjoyed it, yay,

460
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,180
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

461
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,154
What do you say?

462
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:18,987
- Bye.

463
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:21,163
Boop.

464
00:15:21,163 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
