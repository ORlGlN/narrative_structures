1
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:02,774
- We would do something
we have never done before.

2
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:04,946
- Yes you guys we're gonna do it.

3
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:07,507
We're gonna read some mean comments.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,168
- Why would you say something like that?

5
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:11,722
- That's so rude, that's just hurtful.

6
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:13,317
- Like I feel so bad.

7
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:15,911
♫ Shine, this is our life

8
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:17,926
♫ Let's live it

9
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:20,188
♫ Live it forever

10
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,771
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:31,012
- Happy Sunday everybody and welcome

12
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:33,679
to the Daily Bumps vlog.

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,362
Sunday is always such a fun day

14
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:38,853
for us because it's the day
we always kind of chill.

15
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,073
We all went to church this morning.

16
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,112
Which went very good,
the boys both did great

17
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:45,628
and then we got home and the boys

18
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,394
are now doing quiet time for Finn

19
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:50,009
that means a nap, for Ollie that

20
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,522
means he gets to lay in his bed

21
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:52,747
and watch a show, read a book,

22
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,524
play with his toys, anything as long

23
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:55,897
as he's doing it in very little

24
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:57,761
light with very little noise.

25
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:58,987
But I have to show you guys this because

26
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:02,391
I was not going to put
Finn in his crib anymore.

27
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:04,108
I can not get him in and every time

28
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:06,739
I do he just wakes up so I literally

29
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:10,627
just sat him on the
floor next to his crib.

30
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:11,892
Because I figured he's probably

31
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:12,818
gonna sleep a whole lot better

32
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:15,098
next to his crib than inside his crib.

33
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:17,703
Plus he's two now, he's gonna wake up

34
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:18,900
and he's gonna walk out of the room

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,651
and just look for me or Missy

36
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:22,183
or someone and we're watching him.

37
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:23,730
So I know that he's okay.

38
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,595
But I think it's just getting close

39
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:27,938
to the time we put him into a big boy bed.

40
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,688
When we do that I really want Ollie

41
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,087
and Finn to share a room because

42
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,600
I feel like it would be really, really

43
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,335
good for them as brothers to share a room.

44
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:35,882
But that's what we're
working with right now

45
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:37,696
with his sleep transition it's been crazy

46
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:40,100
getting him to fall
asleep in his crib lately.

47
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,826
So he's chilling pretty good
on his floor next to his crib.

48
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:46,243
(soft music)

49
00:01:58,492 --> 00:01:59,943
- Good morning bud.

50
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:01,897
(Finn mumbles)

51
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:04,147
Did you sleep on the floor?

52
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:06,836
- No.

53
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,773
- Yeah you did, did
you sleep on the floor?

54
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:09,606
- No.

55
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,967
- Yes you did, yeah I just got home.

56
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,416
I was actually hanging
out with my mom and dad.

57
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,270
And apparently he slept on the floor.

58
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,001
That is crazy, we have definitely

59
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,604
been still struggling with like

60
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:21,753
what exactly we wanna do with his

61
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:24,059
crib or big bed and stuff like that.

62
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,757
And it's hard because most nights,

63
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:29,054
most of the time, this is
the best option for him.

64
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:31,926
But putting him in here
can be such a pain.

65
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:33,128
'Cause you have to kinda like shove

66
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:36,018
him in and then zip it up and
then hope he stays asleep.

67
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,047
And sometimes he's not asleep

68
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:38,675
and he's like get me out of here.

69
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:39,693
He's like in that in between stage.

70
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,691
He's not quite ready for big boy bed.

71
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:44,615
But he's like super done
with the crib, huh bud.

72
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:45,777
And we just went back to watch

73
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:47,508
when we switched Ollie over although

74
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:48,619
every kid is different and I really

75
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,353
am not trying to like
compare where they're at.

76
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:54,028
'Cause Ollie and him are very different.

77
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:55,694
And Ollie was never the kind to

78
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:57,270
like just climb out of the crib.

79
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,413
He would rather just sit there

80
00:02:58,413 --> 00:02:59,609
and wait for me to come get him.

81
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,344
But either way we switched him right

82
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:04,830
about at this exact age,
two years and one month.

83
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,349
He'll be two years and one
month in a few weeks so crazy.

84
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,844
Alright, what do you want baby?

85
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:11,183
(Finn mumbles)

86
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:13,057
Oh yeah, he's like obsessed with

87
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,492
clothes right now he's like always

88
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:16,039
wants to try on a different outfit.

89
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,225
What are you thinking, you
need something else to wear?

90
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,058
- No.

91
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:21,241
- [Missy] No you're comfy?

92
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:22,859
- Ollie's still sleeping, he fell

93
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,978
asleep watching a show so, I'm gonna

94
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:25,870
go in and get him because we

95
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,453
want him to sleep good tonight.

96
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:35,590
Ollie, hey buddy, iPad,
what's he watching?

97
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:41,234
Disney Junior Halloween (laughing).

98
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:44,184
Hey buddy, did you get a good little nap?

99
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:45,564
Mama wants to cuddle with you.

100
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:47,192
You wanna go cuddle with mama?

101
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,025
- Yeah.

102
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,301
- [Bryan] Okay, come on kiddo,

103
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,384
you're so cute, you fell
asleep watching your show.

104
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:55,192
I love kids when they
wake up they're so cute.

105
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:59,746
Hey climb onto daddy
there we go, good morning.

106
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:01,012
- Good morning.

107
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:03,864
- It's not morning time (laughing).

108
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:07,325
- Did it feel good to
nap, ooh you are sweaty.

109
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,158
- [Bryan] Yeah he is.

110
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:10,226
(laughing)

111
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:11,635
- Hi.

112
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:14,052
(soft music)

113
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:20,039
- It is five o'clock you guys

114
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,588
not even five o'clock, five
minutes to five o'clock.

115
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:25,347
And this is what the time change gave us.

116
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:29,300
It's seriously almost dark here you guys.

117
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,583
And it's not even five o'clock.

118
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,760
I think sometimes the time change

119
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,013
is like a love and hate thing.

120
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:36,897
So let me know down in the comments below,

121
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:39,960
do you love or do you hate
the time change, and why?

122
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,819
I definitely don't like
that it gets darker earlier.

123
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:45,068
But I might be biased
because I'm a vlogger

124
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:47,974
and we use cameras and
they need light and stuff.

125
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:51,861
Finn just walked out the back
door with a bag of cereal.

126
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,778
What do you have kid, Lucky Charms.

127
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,316
(Finn laughs and mumbles)

128
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:00,976
- [Bryan] I know it's yummy huh?

129
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:02,261
- Yeah, ooh.

130
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,874
- I really love his new haircut you guys.

131
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:05,775
It's seriously so cute, if you haven't

132
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:07,597
seen his haircut vlog I'll
have it in the I-card.

133
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:08,871
Do you like your haircut Finn?

134
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:11,324
- Yeah (mumbles)

135
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:12,792
- [Bryan] Yeah, okay.

136
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,636
- Egg, he's like my eggs, oh no.

137
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:15,469
- [Finn] No.

138
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:16,978
- [Bryan] Too slow.

139
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:18,706
- [Missy] Too slow.

140
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:20,175
(Bryan laughing)

141
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:21,076
- [Bryan] How many eggs you get?

142
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:21,909
- [Missy] Two.

143
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,728
- [Bryan] Not bad, it's cold.

144
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:25,868
- Not bad when they're
mostly all roosters.

145
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,882
- [Bryan] Yeah and it's cold.

146
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:29,064
- It is getting chilly.

147
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:32,262
Alright kids are eating
dinner and it has been

148
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:35,334
a pretty chill Sunday today so we thought.

149
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,167
- It really has.

150
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,656
- We would do something
we have never done before.

151
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:40,796
- Yes you guys, we're gonna do it.

152
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:43,533
We're gonna read some mean comments.

153
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,718
Everyone gets, every
YouTuber gets mean comments.

154
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:49,034
We got them probably day one of uploading.

155
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:49,894
- Yes.

156
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:52,971
- There are some interesting
people in the world

157
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:55,138
and you find them in
the comments of YouTube.

158
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:56,377
- In YouTube comments.

159
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:57,787
- So we have.

160
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,340
- I never knew these types of people

161
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,610
existed until I went onto YouTube.

162
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,616
- Yes, yes and it's kind of like

163
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:05,565
a prerequisite of being a creator.

164
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,194
You have to be able to
handle stuff like this.

165
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:11,258
And make a fun video like this.

166
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:12,485
- Yeah here we go, we're gonna read,

167
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:14,406
hopefully not your guys' mean comments.

168
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:15,306
But someone's mean comments.

169
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:16,412
- Yeah you guys aren't posting these

170
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:17,429
mean comments that's not you.

171
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:20,041
- No, no one's watching
these leaving mean comments.

172
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:24,750
- Okay, first one comes
from Arianna, annoying brat.

173
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,228
- No I'm not.

174
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,513
- I've been meaning to tell them

175
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,431
that they are annoying brats.

176
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,515
Karma and Luna they
just get they're crazy.

177
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:34,532
- They are so bad.

178
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:36,203
- They jump up and down
you're right, you know.

179
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:37,036
- Yeah, you're right.

180
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:38,322
- They are pretty bratty I'm sure

181
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,457
that's who they were talking about right.

182
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:40,792
- Oh well of course, no one else

183
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,395
in my family's an annoying brat.

184
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:44,842
Alright next one's from modern sword,

185
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:47,195
and they said, what the bleep type

186
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:50,468
of bleep did I just bleeping click.

187
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:53,218
(Missy laughing)

188
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,287
(Bryan laughing)

189
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:57,248
I don't know.

190
00:06:57,248 --> 00:07:00,481
- You probably clicked on a
very good looking thumbnail.

191
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:03,448
- Yeah a really cute
thumbnail, I don't know.

192
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:04,777
- So, you're the one who clicked on it.

193
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:06,290
- Sorry, sorry we're
so good at thumbnails.

194
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,702
- [Bryan] Finley will you stop

195
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:09,892
stealing your brother's pizza.

196
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:10,725
- No.

197
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:12,079
- [Bryan] Alright Ollie I got

198
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,790
a mean comment for yah, I
wanna see what you think okay?

199
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,921
- 'Kay.

200
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:16,572
- [Bryan] Tiana Johnson said,

201
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,925
this to be honest is not really good,

202
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:22,980
I know y'all can do better,
what do you think about that?

203
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,948
- Not good.

204
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:28,761
- [Bryan] Not good, who's
not good, us or Tiana?

205
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:29,702
- Finn.

206
00:07:29,702 --> 00:07:33,541
- Finn, you don't know
what you're talking about.

207
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,603
Finn has acquired pizza so he is happy

208
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,672
and hopefully he will
stop eating Ollie's pizza.

209
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:38,505
- Finn, Ollie's.

210
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:42,672
- Roblox gaming said, this
is corny as bleep, corny?

211
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:44,907
- Yeah.

212
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,616
- We don't eat a lotta corn,
do you eat a lotta corn?

213
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:49,124
- I actually do like corn so maybe.

214
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:51,109
- She's gonna make corn now you guys.

215
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:53,443
Alright here's a really
mean one from Vincent.

216
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:56,193
To me it seems that all the Brian

217
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,358
cares about is the views and the video

218
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,941
and not his family, crappy dad.

219
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:05,675
- Who's Brian.

220
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:07,674
- The Bri, no it's not
Brian, it's the Brian.

221
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,451
- The, the Brian.

222
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:11,408
- To me it seems that all the Brian.

223
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,290
I am, okay, from now on I am the Brian.

224
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,123
- Okay.

225
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:16,668
- Crappy dad, you wanna see a crappy dad.

226
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:17,935
I'll show you a crappy dad.

227
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,454
- [Missy] Do the poo-poo dance.

228
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:22,037
(fart noises)

229
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:26,490
Pappy Taz says, no one cares
about your bleeping life.

230
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,709
- Ouch.

231
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,619
- I mean, I'd say about
2.8 million people might.

232
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:31,644
- Almost three million people.

233
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,599
I mean it's hard to fight with numbers

234
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,238
but they're pretty, pretty solid.

235
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,479
- It's a lot, I mean even
if you cut that in half.

236
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,328
- No one, I mean would
you, that could, maybe,

237
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:46,280
maybe no one means three
million peoples to this person.

238
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,139
So maybe what he's saying, what

239
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:50,453
he's talking about is three million people

240
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,971
care about your bleeping life.

241
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:53,093
- Yeah that makes sense.

242
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:55,391
- Alright Rahma said, Bryan you

243
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:57,829
and Missy won because you're both fat.

244
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,419
- I mean I'm sorry that our body

245
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,664
is not how you want it to look.

246
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:04,221
- Is it okay to call people fat?

247
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,141
- No it is absolutely not okay.

248
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:07,641
- It's 2017 Rahma.

249
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,537
- No, yeah.

250
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,362
- A lot of people care
about what we look you guys.

251
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,485
Alejandro said, Bryan thinks he

252
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:18,327
is cute but he is ugly as F.

253
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:20,717
- No you're not you are handsome
and so cute and I love you.

254
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:23,884
- Thanks babe, aw thanks, thanks babe.

255
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:28,988
- Cameron says, no offense
but I hate potatoes.

256
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:32,715
- What, I'm not even sure
this is a real person.

257
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:35,864
Jalijah said, you suck you suck

258
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:39,848
name the starfish hotdog
listen ninja starfish hot dogs.

259
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:42,032
Oh, they're telling us
what to name our starfish.

260
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,330
- So it's hotdog.

261
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,870
- Name the starfish hotdog.

262
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,855
Listen, ninja starfish hotdog.

263
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:49,802
Hey Ollie, should we name our

264
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:51,961
starfish, ninja starfish hotdog?

265
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:54,442
- That actually is a pretty cool name.

266
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:58,349
Actually we haven't picked
a name for the starfish.

267
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,116
So we will take that
one into consideration.

268
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:00,949
- Yeah.

269
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:02,342
- Why would you say something like that?

270
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:06,019
- That's so rude, that's just hurtful.

271
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,891
- Like I feel so bad for potatoes.

272
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:10,839
- I feel bad for people
who hate potatoes like.

273
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,672
- Yeah.

274
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:14,783
- Tif said, Missy you are bad mom.

275
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:18,125
- I am bad mom, am I a bad mom?

276
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,708
- You are the goodest mom ever.

277
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:23,441
- [Missy] What?

278
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:24,995
- Goodest mom ever.

279
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:26,541
- You're the goodest mom ever.

280
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,893
- Okay we can just stick with

281
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,348
bad mom, goodest mom,
you know, that all works.

282
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:33,124
- Hey Sara I saw your comment

283
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:36,041
it said, LOLOLOLOLO cringe, cringe.

284
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:41,536
(both laughing)

285
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:43,277
- That is so cringy.

286
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,411
- I mean she got, she laughed.

287
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,581
So obviously we're entertaining.

288
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:48,644
- Yeah, and like hate, I mean hate

289
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:51,373
is a really strong word you
don't like french fries.

290
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:53,771
- Potatoes didn't do anything
wrong to you, they didn't.

291
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:55,059
- Yeah and like french fries.

292
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:55,892
- They're great.

293
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:56,725
- Yeah.

294
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:57,558
- Mashed potatoes.

295
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,744
- You are a terrible person.

296
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,020
- Tater-tots.

297
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,337
- Come on, hash browns.

298
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:05,509
- Twice, hash browns,
twice baked potatoes, like.

299
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,602
- Baked potato soup, I think it's a thing.

300
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,120
- Potato chips.

301
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,435
- Oh yeah.

302
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:16,104
- Fatmah said, stop cutting
your hair it looks ugly.

303
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:16,937
- I look ugly?

304
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,523
- I think they're talking about my hair.

305
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:22,632
Do I just need to grow my
hair, do this, I think Fatmah.

306
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,641
- Prefers you with long hair.

307
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,318
- Prefers me with long hair
it's cute that he cares so much.

308
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:28,929
(Missy laughing)

309
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:29,762
Honestly.

310
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:32,663
- Alright Maria says, love love love DB

311
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:34,766
but why does Missy constantly laugh

312
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:38,435
and scream in every video
even when nothing is funny

313
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:41,404
I've been a day one watcher and she

314
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:46,106
has changed a lot will still
always be a die hard fan.

315
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,775
Well I appreciate you being a fan.

316
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,422
I'm not quite sure what you mean

317
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:54,054
by laughing and screaming, screaming?

318
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,108
- You've changed apparently things

319
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:59,642
are funnier and also
scarier in this new Missy.

320
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:02,568
- Yeah my, the new Missy
laughs a lot more I guess.

321
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:03,961
- In every video.

322
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,361
- Every single one?

323
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:06,545
- Have you screamed yet in the vlog?

324
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:07,771
(Missy screaming)

325
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:10,794
Ellie said, hate the fact it's really

326
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:13,184
obvious that you're miming in the video

327
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:14,807
cute video but for me I found

328
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:16,764
the miming cringeworthy even though

329
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:19,725
I play this one constantly
brought it without

330
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:22,824
even listening to the
sample it's an amazing song.

331
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:24,906
Okay, so I'm assuming they're talking

332
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,452
about the Tribe music video which

333
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:27,575
you should definitely go watch

334
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:29,205
in the I-card, you're not gonna

335
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:30,808
find any miming in the video.

336
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:31,641
- Miming.

337
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:34,332
- There's no invisible boxes or ropes

338
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:36,832
or anything like that, Ellie's

339
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:40,900
probably confusing the word
miming with lip syncing.

340
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,781
- Lip syncing makes sense, I will say.

341
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:44,279
- Which is what you do in music videos?

342
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,537
- Thank you for buying the song.

343
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:46,648
- Yeah thanks for listening to the song.

344
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:47,610
- And thanks for watching.

345
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,588
- I think Ellie's trying to request

346
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:52,026
that we do a video where we are mimes.

347
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:54,273
So I'll add that to the list.

348
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,106
- Okay.

349
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,055
- Thanks Ellie, alright
Missy last mean comment.

350
00:12:57,055 --> 00:13:00,388
Samina said, Daily Bumps you are stupid.

351
00:13:03,171 --> 00:13:04,522
- Stupid?

352
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:06,035
- [Bryan] Look how they spelled stupid.

353
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,940
- Stupid, I don't know what that means.

354
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,859
