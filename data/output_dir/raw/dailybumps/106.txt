00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,177

22
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:08,527
Yay!

23
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,039
Go, go, go!

24
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:10,872
Yay!

25
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,048
Ah!

26
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:14,531
(elf mumbling)

27
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,364
Go go go.

29
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,706
(gasp)

30
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:23,806
Ahh.

31
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:28,459
(sigh)

32
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:30,959
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

33
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:37,777
- These boys are up early
all the time, it seems.

34
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:39,903
Just wanna find Fred, huh?

35
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:40,736
- Yeah.

36
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:42,277
- Where do you think Fred is this morning?

37
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,663
- Um, I don't know.

38
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:44,839
- Do you know, Finn?

39
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,809
- No.

40
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:46,642
- No.

41
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:47,475
- Shh.

42
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,048
- Okay, we gotta be quiet, okay?

43
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:52,608
Alright, let's go find Fred.

44
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:55,691
Who's gonna be the first to find him?

45
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,289
This is like the funnest time ever

46
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,355
because the boys have no idea where he is.

47
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,912
And so they have to like
walk around the whole

48
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:05,091
house and look for him.

49
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,258
Fred, where are you buddy?

50
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,850
Do you see him, Finn?

51
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,373
- No.

52
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,101
- [Bryan] Did you guys check over here?

53
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:14,661
- Is he outside?

54
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:15,949
- [Bryan] I don't think he'd be outside.

55
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:17,113
It's too cold.

56
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:18,386
Are you losing hope already?

57
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:19,219
- No.

58
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:20,947
(giggling)

59
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:23,197
Fred is here in the playroom?

60
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:24,530
- [Bryan] Is he?

61
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,794
I don't see him.

62
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:30,228
- (gasp) Fred!

63
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:31,723
- [Bryan] Oh we found him!

64
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:32,763
What's he doing?

65
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:35,632
- He's eating marshmallows
and gummy worms.

66
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:38,419
- [Bryan] Yeah, gummy bears?

67
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,952
Oh, Fred, what have you
been up to last night?

68
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:44,705
You know what it looks
like he's doing, Ollie?

69
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:45,538
- What?

70
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:48,748
- I think he was sledding
on the marshmallows.

71
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:51,383
Look, he built his sled out of paper.

72
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:53,343
And then was sledding on the marshmallows.

73
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:54,281
Oh look at at all this candy,

74
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,055
he must have put all this
out here for you guys.

75
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:57,392
You guys wanna piece of candy?

76
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:58,247
You're already eatin' gummy bears.

77
00:02:58,247 --> 00:02:59,575
Finn, you want some gummy bears?

78
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:00,931
- Yeah.

79
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,111
- [Bryan] There you go, buddy.

80
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,678
- Good morning Fred.

81
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,361
- [Bryan] Good morning Fred.

82
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:07,541
Alright, he's ready.

83
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,021
He's watching you boys all day today

84
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,083
to make sure you're good, okay?

85
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:15,550
(giggling) Marshmallows for
breakfast, you silly boy.

86
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,050
(playful Christmas music)

87
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:25,061
- Good morning, guys,
it is December first.

88
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:28,776
December first means there's
24 days til Christmas or 25?

89
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,182
I feel like it's always so confusing.

90
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:32,787
We have some advent calendars.

91
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:34,726
Some are for some friends of ours.

92
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:38,015
But we do have a couple
that we are excited about.

93
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:40,099
But I do get really
confused, because I think

94
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,047
you're supposed to start
these on December first.

95
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:45,130
And this one has 24 surprises inside.

96
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,178
But this one has 25 surprises inside.

97
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:49,507
So does that mean I was supposed to start

98
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,467
that one like yesterday?

99
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:52,326
It's very confusing.

100
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:53,159
- [Finn] Mama.

101
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,373
- And then this is our advent calendar

102
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:56,009
where we have like little good deeds

103
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,500
that we're gonna do throughout the month.

104
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,261
We'll pull out a little
note, and that one's 25.

105
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:01,452
So I'm like, was I supposed to start

106
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,285
that one also yesterday?

107
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,644
I don't know, it's so confusing.

108
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,741
They're very excited
about the Star Wars one.

109
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,223
24, so I think for sure
we start this one today,

110
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:12,625
and then we open the last
one on Christmas Eve.

111
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,971
Right, is that right?

112
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:15,391
Let me know in the
comments if that's right.

113
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:16,224
(Finn crying)

114
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,845
We're very excited that
it's December first.

115
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:20,435
It's Christmas, it's Christmas.

116
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:21,510
I feel like we've been pretending that

117
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,943
it's Christmas for all these last few

118
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:26,798
days, but it is officially Christmas time.

119
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:28,025
But yeah, I gotta get cleanin'.

120
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,624
The house is kind of a disaster right now.

121
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:32,173
I'm in the middle of
doing dishes, the boys'

122
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,578
playroom is a mess, and
we have a fun day planned.

123
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:35,721
We actually have people coming over and

124
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,981
we're gonna be working
on a really cool project.

125
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:41,158
And so I feel like this
house needs to get cleaned.

126
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:43,513
Now I'll admit, Finley,
Ollie can be a little

127
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:44,870
messy when he plays in the playroom.

128
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,174
That's for sure, I mean, it's a playroom,

129
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:48,007
it gets messy.

130
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:50,204
But I don't think this was him.

131
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:53,059
(giggling) Finn, did you
make this mess down there?

132
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:53,923
- Nuh-uh.

133
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:55,306
- Yes, you did.

134
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:56,297
- No.

135
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,154
- Yes you did.

136
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:58,659
Let me ask you another question.

137
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,526
You both really do like to color and

138
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,704
draw on stuff, but I don't think Ollie

139
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:04,218
made this mess.

140
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:05,537
Did you make that mess?

141
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:06,494
- No.

142
00:05:06,494 --> 00:05:07,661
- Yes you did!

143
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,822
You're telling me that Ollie
drew all over the table?

144
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,072
No, was it you?

145
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,201
Did you do that?

146
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,110
- No.

147
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,145
- He's like, hm what's the right answer.

148
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:18,707
You guys are cute.

149
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:21,472
I love you even though you're destructive.

150
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:24,512
- Apparently today is
ride your bike inside day

151
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:27,798
'cause both the boys are loving it.

152
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:30,202
You are so fast, Finn, it's crazy.

153
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:31,077
- Yeah!

154
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,658
(laughing)

155
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:34,924
- [Bryan] Whoa, you're
getting better too Ollie.

156
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:35,909
- Hi G-BO!

157
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:39,323
- [Bryan] (giggle) Hey
G-BO, tell me a joke.

158
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:40,974
- [G-BO] Why did the orange cry?

159
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:41,807
- [Bryan] I don't know.

160
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,232
- [G-BO] Someone hurt his feelings.

161
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:44,990
- [Bryan] Aw (giggle).

162
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,182
The orange cried 'cause
someone hurt his feelings.

163
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:49,849
(playful music)

164
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,973
Hey Ollie, what are you doing?

165
00:05:57,973 --> 00:05:58,806
- Play.

166
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:00,454
- [Bryan] Are you singing Christmas music?

167
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:03,436
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

168
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:06,330
♪ Jingle all the way ♪

169
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,163
(Christmas music)

170
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,788
Whoa, that was so good, dude!

171
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,591
You're just like Daddy aren't you?

172
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:19,632
Recording music?

173
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:22,457
- [Daniel] One, two, three, go.

174
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:24,046
- [Bryan] Jingle bells

175
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:25,773
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

176
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:27,215
- Awesome.
- Wooo.

177
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:29,331
- [Daniel] One more, we
got plenty to work with.

178
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,161
- My producer Daniel
is here because we are

179
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:34,222
working on a top secret Daily
Bump's Christmas project

180
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:36,969
that I actually announced on
accident yesterday on Twitter.

181
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,472
We're doing a Christmas EP!

182
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:41,289
And I'm so excited because
it's a family thing.

183
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,532
We're gonna have Finn involved,

184
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,243
we're gonna see if he
can yell into the mic.

185
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:46,229
(Finn yelling) (laughing)

186
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:47,355
Is he playing with the microphone?

187
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:48,729
- I'm getting all sorts of noises.

188
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,169
(laughing)

189
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,219
- [Bryan] What are you
doing in here Ollie?

190
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,552
(baby talk)

191
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:57,507
- I can hear you mama!

192
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:58,491
- You can hear me?

193
00:06:58,491 --> 00:06:59,449
- Yeah, I can hear your voice.

194
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,673
- The microphone is on,
so he can hear his voice

195
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:03,020
in the headphones,

196
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,853
- I can hear my voice, mama.

197
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,813
- and it's a really disorienting
sound if you've never

198
00:07:05,813 --> 00:07:08,435
experienced it and you've
been in a studio doing it.

199
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:10,176
So it's funny when you
do it for the first time.

200
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:11,935
- Sing it nice and loud in--

201
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:12,768
- I can hear it again.

202
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:14,054
- That's so cool.

203
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:14,887
(giggling)

204
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,741
Alright, we have been having
so much fun working on the

205
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:17,645
Christmas album, huh?

206
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,478
- Uh huh.

207
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:20,222
- (Missy) And now we are
taking a little break

208
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:22,213
and we are going to open up
one of our advent calendars.

209
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:23,842
Which one is this one?

210
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:26,049
- This is the Lego Star Wars.

211
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:28,390
- [Missy] (gasp) Can
you say Lego Star Wars?

212
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,223
(babbling)

213
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:30,675
Star Wars (giggle).

214
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:32,976
They already accidentally
opened this one, but

215
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:36,861
there's 24 days left til
Christmas so that means we get

216
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:40,037
to open up the 24 which is
this one right here, okay?

217
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:41,296
- [Ollie] Okay.

218
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:42,663
- [Missy] (gasp) There ya go.

219
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,779
(pop)

220
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:44,612
(gasp) You did it.

221
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:45,445
What's in there?

222
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,428
(gasp) Who is that?

223
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:48,411
- BB-8.

224
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:51,610
- [Missy] Yeah, oh my gosh, I
think it's a Christmas BB-8.

225
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,870
How cool.

226
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,629
So this is a Lego advent
calendar which I think I am

227
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,408
really excited about
because it's not candy which

228
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:01,028
is always a hard thing when
they are opening it up,

229
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:02,653
especially sometimes because
they open it at night

230
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:04,845
and then they get candy at
night and that's just can be

231
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,421
kind of frustrating.

232
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:07,330
So anyways.

233
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,263
- I can't open it.
- These are little legos.

234
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:09,487
Yeah, I'm going to put it together for you

235
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:10,445
in just a minute.

236
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:12,514
Alright, so every day we get
to open one and we get to put

237
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:14,548
together the whole collection.

238
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:15,599
I think you got that one.

239
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,099
(gasp)

240
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,353
- Yes!

241
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:19,788
- [Missy] (gasp) That's so exciting.

242
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:21,413
And Finn has a different calendar.

243
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:22,759
I'm going to get you yours, okay?

244
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,459
And then this one is Finn's.

245
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,312
Is this yours?

246
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:26,145
- Yeah.

247
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:27,692
- [Missy] These are little
Tsum Tsum calendars.

248
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:30,821
(gasp) Look at all the cool characters.

249
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:34,313
Mickey Mouse and Minnie
Mouse, and who's that?

250
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,417
- Um, Stitch.

251
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,440
- [Missy] Stitch, you're right.

252
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,989
Oh, and I think that's Olaf.

253
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,486
So, let's see what's in here, okay?

254
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,482
We gotta find the 24.

255
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:42,315
Ready?

256
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:43,491
- [Finn] Wow.

257
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,116
- [Missy] What's in there?

258
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:48,051
(gasp) Oh, it's Dumbo.

259
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,765
It's so cool.

260
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:54,246
So this is Dumbo and then
he's got a little reindeer.

261
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,296
(babbling)

262
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:56,587
(giggling) Do you love it, Finn?

263
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:57,689
- Yeah.

264
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:59,825
- [Missy] That's so cool.

265
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:01,075
He is so happy.

266
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:03,498
Is that so fun?

267
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:04,331
- Yeah.

268
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,183
- [Missy] Okay every day
you get to open up one.

269
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:07,636
Nope, just one okay?

270
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:08,469
- 'Kay.

271
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:09,341
- [Missy] Tomorrow you get another one.

272
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,258
Ugh, I love little tiny Legos, yes I do.

273
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,925
(playful music)

274
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:19,822
There he is.

275
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:21,269
How cute.

276
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,382
What a fun little advent
calendar, you guys get little

277
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:26,099
toys every day, huh?

278
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,766
(playful music)

279
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:42,249
- Today went so good, you guys.

280
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,286
Oliver was so good on the microphone.

281
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:47,449
He did so good with Daniel, my producer.

282
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:48,434
It was insane.

283
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:51,872
Like I was feeding him
lines of music to sing and

284
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:54,612
like singing it to him and
he was singing it back.

285
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:57,594
He was following and mimicking the melody.

286
00:09:57,594 --> 00:10:00,924
It was so cool and it was
just so amazing to see

287
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:04,690
as you know a dad and as
you know someone who loves

288
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,911
making music and singing and songwriting.

289
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:12,360
It's so cool to see your
kids really like that kind of

290
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,193
stuff.

291
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:15,882
So, I'm like totally like that's so neat.

292
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,758
We got everything finished
that we needed to.

293
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:20,126
So, now we just have a couple of days.

294
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:23,076
If you guys have not guessed
or went on my Twitter and

295
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:26,284
looked, we are releasing a
Christmas EP as a family.

296
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:28,104
And I have no idea when it's coming out.

297
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:29,628
Hopefully very soon.

298
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,262
So, just keep your eyes
peeled, but it's going

299
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:34,913
to be the cutest and coolest
and funnest thing ever.

300
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:35,747
So, yay for that.

301
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:38,925
Now, as you can tell with my
beanie and my warm clothes,

302
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:41,921
we are headed out because
the city is actually having a

303
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,606
really cool Santa's electrical parade.

304
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,311
So, we are headed out to go do that.

305
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,368
Karma, you and Luna be good, okay?

306
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,274
- Waiting for the parade.

307
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,276
- Oh is it startin'?

308
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,693
(jazz music)

309
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:59,516
We are bundled up and sitting
on the side of the road

310
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:02,933
waitin' for the parade to come down.

311
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,829
Ollie are you excited for the parade?

312
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,668
You excited to see santa?

313
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:09,085
(jazz music)

314
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:14,312
- Oh my gosh, it's the Grinch.

315
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:16,232
- Ollie, it's the Grinch.

316
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:17,513
Ollie is standing up for that one.

317
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:18,576
Do you see him?

318
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:20,448
We gotta be careful of the
Grinch you guys, he's got a

319
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,197
reputation in our house.

320
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:23,030
Hi Grinch.

321
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,933
- [Missy] Don't come
to our house this year.

322
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,010
(crowd cheering)

323
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,427
(jazz music)

324
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,878
- You guys, we have a
Chik-fil-A float in our parade.

325
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,713
Look at this.

326
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,226
Are those cows?

327
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:56,091
Look at them, dude.

328
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,508
(jazz music)

329
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,460
Ollie, here comes the Grinch again.

330
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,877
(jazz music)

331
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:31,943
We sat at that parade for
about an hour and 40 minutes

332
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:33,364
and Santa did not show up.

333
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:34,227
(giggling)

334
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:35,137
Where is Santa?

335
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,246
- A lot of businesses.

336
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:39,763
- Yeah, it was like, yeah I felt good,

337
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:41,983
I was like we're supporting
the local community.

338
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:45,243
There's the Boy Scouts, the
Girl Scouts, all these clubs,

339
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:47,128
and then it was like a ton
of businesses, and then we

340
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:49,376
look down and it's like not gonna stop.

341
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:52,033
So, we in it, and it was
getting so cold, it's like

342
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:52,866
- [Missy] So cold.

343
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:55,739
- I think it's below 50 and
with kids that's a little rough.

344
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:57,240
So, we kind of ditched the parade.

345
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,027
- Everyone was though, like
everyone was like why is it--

346
00:12:59,027 --> 00:12:59,860
- Yeah everyone was like--

347
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,289
- Still going?

348
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,742
- And where's Santa?

349
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,497
(giggling) I don't see Santa.

350
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,643
- And when we, we were like
walking towards the beginning

351
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,759
of the parade and we never
saw the ending, like there

352
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,138
was just miles of more people coming.

353
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:12,355
- Yeah, so.

354
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:13,572
- More than ads.

355
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:14,993
- (laughing) Yeah, I
basically told the boys.

356
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,673
I was like you know what, I
have Santa's phone number.

357
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:20,510
He texts me, he facetimes
me, I'll facetime with him.

358
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,822

00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,872
Alright, we have made it

Ollie is so excited for
pancakes (giggling).

364
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:35,237
- [Missy] Open the door.

365
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:36,655
- Finn looks at all the
Christmas decorations and

366
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:37,581
always says Halloween.

367
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:40,459
- Yeah, we had a long
talk about it in Target.

368
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,081
Halloween, Halloween,
I'm like no, Christmas.

369
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,597
- Alright guys, time to cheers.

370
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:47,522
This is our new thing when
we go out as a family.

371
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:48,637
We all cheers.

372

374
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:53,271
- Look at this giant hot chocolate.

375
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:55,073
Oh, that is so good.

376
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:56,150
You should try it, yeah.

377
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,092
Gingerbread hot chocolate.

378
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,123
Mmm.

379
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:00,979
Holy pancakes, Ollie.

380
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:02,587
Are you so excited to eat those?

381
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:03,420
- Yeah.

382
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,547
- Is that still your favorite food?

383
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:06,380
Yeah?

384
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,953
He's going on like a year strong.

385
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:09,476
His favorite food is pancakes.

386
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:10,602
Finn's like in heaven, too.

387
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:12,317
We were so hungry.

388
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,567
(babbling)

389
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,521
Finn, that is some good singing, dude.

390
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:21,354
He is so cute.

391
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:22,528
I just hear him singing back there,

392
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,888
and Ollie's like you're
singing beautifully, Finn.

393
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:27,524
- Yeah, he's like that's
a cute song, Finn.

394
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:29,175
- It is a cute song, huh Ollie?

395
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:30,284
- Kids are finally in bed.

396
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:31,668
It was a late night.

397
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,628
Me and Bryan are exhausted.

398
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:35,308
So we're actually headed to bed soon.

399
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,660
So, make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up.

400
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,660
We do have a really special
video planned for tomorrow

401
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,357
so make sure you don't miss it.

402
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:45,226
And we'll see you guys later.

403
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:46,059
Bye.

404
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,119
Boop.
