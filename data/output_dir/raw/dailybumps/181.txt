1
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:05,306
(Finn whimpering)

2
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:09,190
- This is probably the
cutest time out ever.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,115
♫ This is our life

4
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:11,234
♫ This is our fun

5
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:13,968
♫ This is who we are

6
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:15,234
♫ This is our dream t

7
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:16,738
♫ This is our team

8
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:18,761
♫ Shot among the stars

9
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:20,867
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

10
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:23,771
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

11
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:25,462
♫ This is our life

12
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:27,700
♫ Let's live it

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,378
♫ Live it forever

14
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:32,461
- Good morning guys and happy Friday!

15
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:36,019
- Morning happy Friday!

16
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:37,047
- Morning

17
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:38,098
- Good Morning Finn.

18
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:42,114
Hello guys, I am making
waffles this morning.

19
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:44,380
Look how beautiful they look.

20
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,525
(Finn whining)

21
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:48,102
Yup I have your breakfast
all ready, you wanna eat?

22
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:49,245
- Yeah!

23
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:52,156
- Alright, we got waffles and syrup with

24
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:54,573
some apples and strawberries.

25
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,813
- Dad do you remember you's
was a beautiful unicorn?

26
00:00:57,813 --> 00:00:59,088
That was silly.

27
00:00:59,088 --> 00:01:00,204
(laughs)

28
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:01,979
- I was a beautiful unicorn?

29
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,552
When?

30
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:05,525
- It was Halloween.

31
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,774
- Ollie may be giving away secrets

32
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:10,040
right now and I apologize for that.

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,324
Spoiler alert.

34
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:12,256
Silly boy.

35
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:14,237
Hi, good morning, I love you.

36
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:15,640
I got you breakfast, okay?

37
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,738
I also have bacon in the oven,
Finn you want some bacon?

38
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:20,717
Finn likes bacon, huh,
Finn likes everything.

39
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:22,201
- Dada.

40
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:26,250
- [Bryan] You're welcome.
You're welcome. You're welcome.

41
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,161
- Wait, where's the syrup?

42
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:30,937
- [Bryan] The syrup is hiding
but it's in there, see?

43
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:31,794
- Oh.

44
00:01:31,794 --> 00:01:34,188
- [Bryan] All your little
waffle pieces are pre-dipped,

45
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:35,464
that's pretty nice of me.

46
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:36,297
- Yeah.

47
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:38,832
- [Bryan] You like it Finn?

48
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,328
- Yeah.

49
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:41,768
- I like it.

50
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,291
- [Bryan] Good.

51
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,874
(upbeat music)

52
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,245
- Good morning guys.

53
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,299
Say good morning.

54
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,989
- Good morning!

55
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,764
- Bryan was so nice to make
us breakfast this morning and

56
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:03,044
I was able to get ready and
now me and Finn are going

57
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:03,877
somewhere really special.

58
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:05,244
What are we doing?

59
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:06,456
(baby mumbles)

60
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:09,383
- Say we're going to music class.

61
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:11,728
Kelsi and Corbin have been
doing music class with June

62
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:14,832
for a long time, almost since
she was like very very little.

63
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:17,202
And so they found one
here and they invited us

64
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:18,910
to come too and see how Finn likes it.

65
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,742
So me and Finn get to do a little

66
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:23,128
mommy and me class together.

67
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:26,203
So we're gonna go see how he
enjoys it and go have some fun.

68
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:27,036
That sound good?

69
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:27,869
- Yeah!

70
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:28,702
- Yeah!

71
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:31,431
Finn what do you think
of music class so far?

72
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:32,264
Is it fun?

73
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:34,278
- [Female] Make sure your
Mommy and Daddy get one too.

74
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:37,386
Are you teaching Finn
how to do music class?

75
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:39,268
- She's like, "Oh yeah, I'm a pro".

76
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:40,101
(laughs)

77
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:42,391
- [Missy] Are you gonna go get one?

78
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,515
Aww.

79
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:45,291
There you go, good job.

80
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,708
(soft music)

81
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:10,360
Finn did you like the class?

82
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,193
- Yeah.

83
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,026
- Yeah.

84
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,473
- What did you think of that Finn?

85
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,694
Did you like that?

86
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:17,249
Do you wanna do that again?

87
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:18,082
- Yeah.

88
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:18,915
- Yeah.

89
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,437
- That was actually very cool.

90
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:22,755
I really wasn't sure how
Finn was going to respond or

91
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:25,105
if it was something that we
would want to continue doing,

92
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,184
but I really really loved
just like the atmosphere,

93
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:29,898
I loved that...

94
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:32,988
It took him like a few songs to understand

95
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:34,103
what was going on, but he was really

96
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:35,564
starting to get it and he loved...

97
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:38,374
I just loved watching him
interact with the other kids

98
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:40,661
and learning how to participate

99
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,276
and I think this is a
really cool thing to do

100
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:44,682
before he's going into school.

101
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,757
So I'm really really excited about it.

102
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:48,856
I think we're gonna actually go for it

103
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:51,014
and do this with Kelsey and Corbin,

104
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,528
which is kinda fun
because he gets to do it

105
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:53,952
with June cause he adores June.

106
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:55,978
I will say, I was thinking
about taking Ollie,

107
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,990
but I definitely don't
think Ollie would enjoy it.

108
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,242
He seems a little bit
too old for this class.

109
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:02,141
Although he's still in the
age range, I just think that

110
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,351
he would think this is like a baby class.

111
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:05,803
Cause there was a lot of little kids and

112
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:09,726
it's just a lot of more baby type songs

113
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:12,643
so I don't think he
would've enjoyed it as much.

114
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,731
So I'm glad that I didn't
take him, but I think Finn's

115
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:16,482
gonna love it and he did love it today,

116
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:20,125
but I think as he gets more
comfortable and understands

117
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,675
what's going on I think he's

118
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:22,932
going to start to really love it.

119
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,260
So that was really fun,
I'm really excited that

120
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,257
Kelsey and Corbin invited us to it.

121
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:28,387
So yeah now I'm gonna go
see what Bryan's up to.

122
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:30,220
- It's new iPhone day.

123
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,482
I've been waiting by my
office window all day

124
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,076
where I can see the gate and
I can see the UPS man come in

125
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,097
and he came and he was like,

126
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:39,685
"Are you excited for the new iPhone?"

127
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,195
And I was like, "Yes, please."

128
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:43,206
So we got our new iPhones,

129
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:46,269
Missy got an Apple watch,
which I'm very excited about

130
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:49,073
because she's been working
out a lot and she can use it

131
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:51,888
to find her phone, which she loses a lot.

132
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:53,701
So this is the old iPhone,
this is the new one.

133
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,656
You're not really gonna see a
difference, but look at this,

134
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:59,591
it has wireless charging
which is super cool.

135
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,023
I'm gonna be putting a bunch
of these things all around the

136
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:03,661
house so people that have
the new iPhone they can

137
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,538
just set it there and
charge their phones up.

138
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,567
I think that's pretty cool.

139
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,348
And as always, make sure that
you guys are following me

140
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:12,401
on Instagram because I
did a story of unboxing

141
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:17,373
the whole iPhone, so you can
go check it out right now.

142
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:20,400
Well hey there mister
Finnigan, how was music class?

143
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,484
(baby mumbles)

144
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:24,901
- You went with Mama?

145
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:25,752
Nice.

146
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:28,131
Now he's having a little snack, cereal,

147
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,381
and I am whipping up a BLT.

148
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,082
We had some bacon left over
from this morning's breakfast

149
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,232
and Missy just went and
got me lettuce and tomatoes

150
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:38,311
so that I can have a BLT, so thanks babe.

151
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,148
- You're welcome.

152
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:40,966
- You boys are so cute, you know that?

153
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,432
- Yeah, Mama is.

154
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,075
- [Bryan] Really?

155
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:44,908
- You is beautiful.

156
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:45,741
- Thank you guys.

157
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:47,782
- Aww, Mama is beautiful, huh?

158
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:48,837
- Yeah.

159
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:50,416
Look at our boys,
they're cuddling watching

160
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,535
"Beauty and the Beast".

161
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,104
- I was just cuddling with them.

162
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,816
- They're so cute. (chuckles)

163
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:57,886
The thing is, is Ollie just
wants to cuddle with Finn and

164
00:05:57,886 --> 00:06:00,412
Finn just wants to like
hit him and like....

165
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:01,245
(laughs)

166
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,078
- I know Finns in a...

167
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:02,981
- Take everything from him.

168
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:03,814
- Finn's in a fun stage right now.

169
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:04,647
- Yeah.

170
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,759
Finn is coming up on
terrible twos you guys.

171
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,046
And I remember when this
happened with Ollie,

172
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:10,257
because it was like on his
birthday something switched

173
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:12,567
in his head and he changed and I was like,

174
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:13,811
"What happened?"

175
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:17,079
It's terrible twos, they're a real thing.

176
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,912
- [Finn] Mama, mama.

177
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:19,246
- We got through it pretty
easily with Ollie, but I think

178
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,700
Finn's gonna be different because
he's got an older brother.

179
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,200
- [Bryan] Totally.

180
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:27,423
(Finn whimpering)

181
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:28,663
- [Bryan] It's okay Finn.

182
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,327
This is probably the cutest time out ever.

183
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,220
Put your nose in the
corner, you're in trouble.

184
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,864
(Finn whimpering)

185
00:06:35,864 --> 00:06:39,265
Finn, put your nose in the corner.

186
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,611
Finn has been doing really
good to take time outs

187
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,890
when he's being a little
much or not listening,

188
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,122
you tell him to put his nose in a corner

189
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,838
and he just relaxes, huh?

190
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:48,864
Are you okay?

191
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:49,937
- Yeah.

192
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:52,034
- Can I have a hug?

193
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:53,358
It's okay.

194
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:56,866
You need to share with Ollie, okay?

195
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,701
It's so funny because at this point,

196
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,746
Ollie is not the trouble
maker, he's just trying to

197
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:04,324
play and have fun and
Finn is just at that stage

198
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,527
where he wants everything Ollie has.

199
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,278
(Ollie screaming at Finn)

200
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:11,883
Just run from him, make him chase you.

201
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,550
Get it Finn, get it.

202
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,492
It's okay Finn, come here.

203
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,514
Life is so hard, isn't it?

204
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,740
Yes, life is so hard.

205
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,120
(Finn whimpering)

206
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,703
I know, it's okay.

207
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:29,299
You antagonize him, don't
antagonize him Ollie.

208
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,293
You have to love your brother,

209
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:31,378
can you give him a hug?

210
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:32,500
Hey Ollie how about you give him hug

211
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,191
and a toy to play with, okay?

212
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,700
- Okay.

213
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,330
- [Bryan] Go find a toy for him
to play with, okay? (laughs)

214
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,479
Finn's like, "I don't want
a toy, I want your toy."

215
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,431
You guys might be wondering
why we have a bucket

216
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,779
on a plate with some chips in it.

217
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,556
Well, I have everything
ready to make something

218
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:53,936
super awesome and cheesy
tonight cause I'm having

219
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:56,004
a guy's poker night with
a couple of buddies.

220
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:57,696
I'm gonna show you guys later,
I'm really excited about this

221
00:07:57,696 --> 00:08:00,808
but right now Missy is making
one of my all time favorite

222
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:04,494
treats and that is Pumpkin
pasties from Harry Potter.

223
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,806
They're basically little pumpkin hand pies

224
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:07,642
- Yeah.

225
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:08,609
- [Bryan] And it's so cool.

226
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,733
We make these every year, we
always use Rosanna Pansino's

227
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,622
recipe because it's the best, basically.

228
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:14,455
- Yeah it's so fun...

229
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:15,703
- Guys, I love you.

230
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,823
- [Bryan] Aw, you love them?

231
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:17,986
- Mm-hm.

232
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:19,503
- [Bryan] Well that's so nice of you.

233
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:22,086
(upbeat music)

234
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:30,431
- [Bryan] Finn's helping
out, that seemed to...

235
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,395
It's helped his mood a little.

236
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:33,227
Mix it up dude.

237
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:34,060
There you go.

238
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:35,534
Finn wants to use that, he's like,

239
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,196
"This works way better."

240
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:38,394
Oh geez, oh he turned it on, okay.

241
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,991
(laughs)

242
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:43,311
- Let's let Finn try it for a sec.

243
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:44,633
- [Bryan] Go ahead, mix it up dude.

244
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,561
- Use the mixer.

245
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,665
- [Bryan] Look at you
dude, you're doing it.

246
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,981
You really think this is gonna end well?

247
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:51,814
- Probably not.

248
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:52,647
Good job.

249
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,782
- [Bryan] He prefers the
old fashion way of mixing.

250
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,503
- He got it, I'll get, I'll get it, no.

251
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,828
- [Bryan] Ahh.

252
00:08:58,828 --> 00:08:59,995
- I'll get it.

253
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:02,971
- Making messes.

254
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:07,171
Smells so good, I am so excited
for pumpkin pasties babe.

255
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,428
It looks just like Rose too.

256
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:10,811
You trying to eat it?

257
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:14,344
- You wanna try it and see if it's good?

258
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:15,778
Is it good?

259
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:18,152
Alright, my pumpkin pie mixture's all done

260
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:20,060
and now I've gotta
transfer em over to these

261
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,058
pie dough disks, which
will fold over and make

262
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:26,365
them into little pies.

263
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,923
I'm excited, I think
they're gonna turn out good.

264
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:31,506
(upbeat music)

265
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:48,562
- [Bryan] Pumpkin pasties are in the oven.

266
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:51,334
So excited, thank you babe.

267
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:52,402
- You're welcome.

268
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:54,816
- And we are definitely
having some iPhone 8

269
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:57,072
activation drama at this point.

270
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:59,370
I have my phone all set up, it's right now

271
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,821
running an update for my Apple watch.

272
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:05,878
Missy's I just can't seem to get working.

273
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:07,924
It keeps saying that I
have to approve the phone

274
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:12,118
but I already approved the
phone from her old phone.

275
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:14,060
I think what's happening
is a lot of people are

276
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,064
accessing all the servers
at the same time because

277
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:17,882
everyone just got their
new iPhones in the mail

278
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,801
so it's kind of like
congesting everything.

279
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,588
It did take awhile for Missy's phone

280
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,893
to activate with AT&T.

281
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:27,868
I must have done mine early
enough that I beat the rush.

282
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:30,803
Bro do you even know
what's about to happen.

283
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:32,506
- These ingredients look
amazing and I'm really

284
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,904
excited for what's about to happen.

285
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:35,640
- [Bryan] We're just gonna
put it all in a bucket,

286
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,435
and then we're gonna put it in the oven,

287
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:39,975
and then we're gonna
flip it upside down and

288
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:42,090
make a nacho cheese cake.

289
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,328
- What?

290
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:44,161
- [Bryan] Are you ready dude?

291
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:45,290
- I don't believe you.

292
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,253
- [Bryan] It's gonna happen.

293
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,265
- [Corbin] Alright, here we go.

294
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:52,058
- We're gonna do a layer of
chips, I got carne asada.

295
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:53,233
- [Corbin] Okay.

296
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,881
- Then we're gonna take some beans,

297
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,864
black beans that I just whipped up.

298
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,645
I feel like I'm preparing a
meal for like a farm animal.

299
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:00,478
- [Corbin] Yeah.

300
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:02,939
- So then you do a layer of
black beans, then your cheeses.

301
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:05,656
- [Corbin] I feel like
you're Guy Fieri right now,

302
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:07,419
you need like the blonde hair.

303
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,390
- Cheese.

304
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,985
- [Corbin] Cheese, queso.

305
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,272
- Queso what?

306
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,345
- Queso, I'm in the
middle of filming a video.

307
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:16,424
(laughs)

308
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:19,007
(upbeat music)

309
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,338
- Boom.

310
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:31,336
Okay so I just did like
five layers of this and I'm

311
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,717
freaking out because I don't
know if it's gonna work.

312
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:35,394
- [Corbin] That is a
full bucket of nachos.

313
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,785
- It's full of nachos,
beans, cheese, meat.

314
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:38,876
- [Corbin] Oh my gosh.

315
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:42,126
- We put it in the over for 15 minutes.

316
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:47,941
- [Corbin] Boom, that just happened.

317
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,291
- Bro.

318
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,909
- [Corbin] Hopefully it comes out.

319
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:53,548
- Alright I just pulled
out the bucket of nachos

320
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,053
and all the guys are
here because we're doing

321
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,590
guys poker night on Sunday.

322
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,081
- [All] Yay!

323
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,301
- And we're gonna flip this now and see...

324
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:01,134
- [Male] Flip it.

325
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:02,169
- See if it works dude.

326
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:03,313
Someone gonna spot me?

327
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:04,405
- Where are you flipping
it at, right here?

328
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:06,016
- I feel like on the balance beam...

329
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,599
- Three, two, one.

330
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,232
- [Corbin] You're good.

331
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,167
- [Male] He did it.

332
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,000
- You ready?

333
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,964
- [Male] Okay.

334
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:16,500
Oh no.

335
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,771
Oh wait, is it center, should I center it?

336
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,671
Is it all coming out?

337
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,553
Is it all coming out?

338
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:21,515
- [Male] It's spilling out the edges.

339
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,098
- Hang on, hang on.

340
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,272
- [Male] Good job man.

341
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:33,770
- It's a Pinterest, Instagram fail.

342
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,697
- [Male] I feel like it's not even melted.

343
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:35,701
- It didn't melt all the way.

344
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:36,812
- [Male] It's medium rare,
it's just medium rare.

345
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:37,645
- Let's put it back in.

346
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:38,857
- Put it back in the bucket.

347
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:43,341
- [Male] Put it back in
the bucket, redo, cut.

348
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:46,174
- I present the nacho cake bucket.

349
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,285
- [Male] Wow.

350
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,744
- Ladies and gentlemen.

351
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:52,577
- [Male] I'm impressed.

352
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:53,410
- Gentleman actually.

353
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,993
- [Corbin] The presentation
man, that's crazy.

354
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,765
- [Male] That's some excellent garnishing.

355
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:57,598
- Look at that.

356
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:59,384
- [Corbin] Who's gonna
take the first bite?

357
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:00,590
- This is gonna be good.

358
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,574
- [Corbin] I think you should.

359
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,710
How is it?

360
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,543
- It's really good.

361
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:05,376
- [Corbin] Yeah?

362
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:06,209
- It's baked too.

363
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:07,042
- [Corbin] Nice.

364
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:07,875
- I'll get some plates.

365
00:13:07,875 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Corbin] Dig in.
