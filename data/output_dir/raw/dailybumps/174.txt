1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:02,757
- I thought let's just add
some cookies in there to

2
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:04,567
so everyone can snack on cookies.

3
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,140
Ali's helping me?

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,225
You being such a good helper?

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,563
Alright let's do this.

00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:13,063
(happy music)

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,481
♫ Wherever you are

8
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:20,827
♫ That's where I wanna be

9
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:23,801
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

10
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:28,406
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

11
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:31,465
♫ This is home

12
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:34,486
♫ Just running around
you've never looked so cute

13
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:35,505
♫ Hugging you tight

14
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:39,002
♫ Cuddlin' all I could saying

15
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:41,335
♫ I am home

16
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:46,097
♫ Home forever you're with me

17
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:51,811
- Good morning and Happy Labor Day!

18
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:54,929

00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,430

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,976

- [Bryan] Yes I bought her these new,

00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:05,388

25
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:07,996
and they're made for working
out and they're wireless.

26
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:09,678

00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:13,211
I'm like a real gymmer.

29
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:14,427
- Anyway Finn is having

30
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:16,583
so much fun jumping around in my office,

31
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,445
the boys are going crazy,

32
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,642
and mamma's leaving forever.

33
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:23,975
- [Missy] The kids club is closed today.

34
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,683
- [Bryan] He's seriously
like a mini daredevil.

35
00:01:27,683 --> 00:01:29,186
Are you a mini Ali?

36
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,847
Are you a mini Ali?

37
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:32,132
Can you say good morning?

38
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:33,131
What's he doing?

39
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:34,801
What are you doing?

40
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:37,158
What are you doing?

41
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,408
(laughter)

42
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:43,253
He is so cute this morning alright,

43
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,753
Missy's going to the gym.

44
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:46,079
She's leaving me here with the boys.

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,052
It's Labor Day.

46
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:51,016
We're gonna have family over
and have a really fun day.

47
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:53,159
Good morning Ali what do you get to do?

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,094
- Get to put two balls in.

49
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:58,539
- [Bryan] You get to put one and

50
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,340
two balls in your jar!

51
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,260
What happens when you fill this up?

52
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,712
- I get a toy!

53
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:04,808
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

54
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,785
Ali's been following all his rules.

55
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:08,223
- And we've been keeping up on this again;

56
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:10,857
kind of stop doing it.

57
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:12,591
And he was so good
yesterday he didn't have to

58
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,855
flip any cards.

59
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:15,760
So you get two right?

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,206
But on a special special occasion

61
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm gonna let you put one more in because

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,024
you went to bed wait listen,

63
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:25,227
you went to bed all by yourself.

64
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,611
- [Bryan] That was so good Ali.

65
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,444
Finn really wants to

66
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:29,692
put a ball in to.
- [Missy] I am so proud of you

67
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,934
so you get one extra

68
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,598
for going to bed all by yourself.

69
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:35,956
I was so so proud of you.

70
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,135
- Yeah but already put one in.

71
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:40,337
- [Missy] You did good.

72
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:43,431
- Yes so all we told Ali
yesterday was it's time for bed

73
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:45,124
and you gotta go to bed huh?

74
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,596
And you went right to your bed,

75
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:47,479
and you were a little sad,

76
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,659
but you fell asleep huh?

77
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:53,158
And that's what we're
gonna keep doing okay?

78
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:54,242
You gotta book?

79
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,174
You wanna read Boss Baby to Finn?

80
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:57,208
- I already read it.

81
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,387
- Oh you already did read the whole book?

82
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,202
Wow this kid is so smart you guys.

83
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:03,064
He's in preschool and he
just read a full book!

84
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:04,228
Good job kiddo!

85
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:06,728
(happy music)

86
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:25,814
So I actually had some succulent plants

87
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,612
that I haven't done anything with.

88
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:31,585
So today I threw them together
in this little planter.

89
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:35,248
Check that out its got some
moss and its got some rocks and

90
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,447
couple different succulents.

91
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:40,969
And then this one I
forgot to put in that one.

92
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,167
So I put it in its own

93
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,000
and actually it's good.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,846
You don't want to put too
much in here 'cause these

95
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:46,445
we want to get nice and big.

96
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:48,543
But I'm so proud 'cause all of our new

97
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:51,058
little plants and stuff
are doing so good you guys.

98
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:53,452
Normally we kill everything.

99
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:54,827
We kill all the plants

100
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:57,326
but they've been all really good

101
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:01,151
especially this one is nice and strong.

102
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,163
I like it.

103
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,638
- Alright so I just got
back from the gym and

104
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:06,151
I have to be honest with you guys I'm

105
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:09,483
really proud of myself because I ran

106
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,138
three and a quarter miles today.

107
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:13,137
I don't think that's ever happened

108
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:14,794
in the history of my entire life,

109
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:17,031
like ever ever ever ever.

110
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,296
Like a half a mile maybe.

111
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:19,255
(laughter)

112
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,053
- [Woman] How far did they
make you run in high school?

113
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,084
That's how far you've ran.

114
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:24,055
- And then me I've done like a 5K

115
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,352
and I've like walked it a
lot you know what I mean?

116
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:27,435
But like ran?

117
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,198
Like almost the entire way?

118
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:31,283
Yeah I'm pretty proud of myself.

119
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:34,745
So anyways I'm proud of myself
so I'm making myself cookies!

120
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:36,081
(laughter)

121
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,680
We are making regular cookies

122
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,378
but we're just kinda
making them for the family

123
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:42,068
'cause today we have a
big barbecue going on,

124
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:43,456
we got tons of food,

125
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:44,683
tons of snacks;

126
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:47,137
I thought let's just add
some cookies in there to

127
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:48,467
so everyone can snack on cookies.

128
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,682
So Ali's helping me.

129
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:53,440
You being such a good helper?

130
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,882
Alright let's do this.

131
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,382
(happy music)

132
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,624
- The perks of having a grill.

133
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:22,300
Someone always brings
food over and grills.

134
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,258
It's kind of always nice.

135
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:25,200
Look at these big ol' steaks we're doing

136
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,045
Labor Day weekend and we even have corn.

137
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:30,982
We're getting ready for
a yummy feast tonight.

138
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,649
What are you doing?

139
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,820
You shooting aliens?

140
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,487
With Buzz Lightyear?

141
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,973
That's so cool.

142
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:39,973
Oh it broke?

143
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:45,029
- Maybe I can get a new one from

144
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:47,196
(mumbles)

145
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:52,722
- [Missy] Alright food is
served and it looks delicious.

146
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:53,775
Everything looks so delicious.

147
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:56,025
We got steak and potatoes

148
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:59,833
and corn and green beans looks good.

149
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,447
Some of us just got out of the pool.

150
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:02,556
We've been swimming and having fun.

151
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:04,119
It's just been a really fun relaxing day

152
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,399
with the whole family;

153
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,232
a bunch of family.

154
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,769
Not everyone I guess but

155
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:11,608
a bunch of family and
now it's time to eat!

156
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:13,934
- So I may have just
taught our son something

157
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:16,215
every kid should know how to do.

158
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:17,882
How to climb a pole!

159
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,302
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

160
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,541
- [Bryan] Can you do it?

161
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,425
- I feel like as a kid I
used to climb this pole even.

162
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:26,933
- [Bryan] I know it's
just coming full circle.

163
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:27,850
So jump up!

164
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,854
Oh you can do it

165
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:32,017
Look at that
- [Missy] Look at that!

166
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,729
- Here hold it with your feet remember?

167
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:35,785
Feet and then push off

168
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:38,368
- [Missy] Wow you are a monkey!

169
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:42,405
- There you go.
- [Missy] Oh my gosh!

170
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,070
(laughter)

171
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,034
Oh my gosh okay?

172
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:48,451
This is so scary.

173
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:53,823
(laughter)

174
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,868
- He's stuck on the flag pole.

175
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:01,782
He's stuck on the flag pole!

176
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:03,949
You got it Ali you got it.

177
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:07,171
- [Missy] Good job bud!

178
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,754
Daddy will get you.

179
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:13,970
- [Woman] You're tired and
you're willing to fall.

180
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,803
- Did you do it?

181
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:15,636
- [Missy] That was kinda scary.

182

187
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,516

188
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:26,099
They're both on it.

189
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:29,511

00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:31,135

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,219
You did so good Finn!

200
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:57,627
Alright Ali you want to try again?

201
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,023

00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,065

203
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:01,911

00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,894
- I can't can you help me?

205
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:04,727

206
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,560
Alright Ali you ready?

207
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,268
- Move your feet there you go.

208
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:11,601
- [Bryan] And then push off.

209
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,466
Whoa dude you're doing it!

210
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,799
How's that feel?

211
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:20,930
- You are so strong!

212
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,515
You got it?

213
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,784
- I need the string.

214
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:30,192
- [Bryan] He wants to
go all the way up there.

215
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:32,611
- There you are you got it!

216
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:34,006
- [Ali] Now I just have to hold on.

217
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,177
- I feel like that is

218
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,111
a skill that all kids should know.

219
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:38,710
He's gotta climb things.

220
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,958
What if he had to climb

221
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,231
to like escape something.
- I used to have a pole

222
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,999
like this right next to our house

223
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:45,973
so I climbed it and then
got on top of our house.

224
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:49,023
- [Bryan] That's pretty
good climbing dude good job!

225
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:52,152
- We have had such a fun day huh?

226
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:55,872
My poor little thing has not
been feeling his greatest.

227
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:58,220
He got a runny nose longer
than like all of us.

228
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,428
He always takes the longest to kinda

229
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,357
get through it and
sometimes he even gets worse

230
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:03,561
before he gets better.

231
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:04,945
I wouldn't say he's worse or anything

232
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,245
but he definitely is;

233
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,522
he might be teething
actually also 'cause he's

234
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:12,994
drooly and sad and just
all around irritable.

235
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:15,409
So anyways it is bed time for this guy.

236
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:19,242
We gotta clean you up
and get you to bed okay?

237
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:22,335
Alright first thing's first.

238
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:23,925
What do we do first?

239
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:26,865
We gotta turn on our sound machine!

240
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,295
Well this is like our music machine.

241
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,385
Now what do we do?

242
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:33,968
He knows everything what to do.

243
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,568
What do we do now?

244
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:50,133
Did you get it?

245
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:55,038
And then the light.

246
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:58,550
Finn we gotta get your jammies on first.

247
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,069
But yes he does have a sound
machine and a music machine

248
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,305
to help keep him asleep and it works.

249
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,972
What is that face you're making?

250
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,429
Can you say goodnight to the baby?

251
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,596
He's like acting shocked it's so cute!

252
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,286
What do you see?

253
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,431
You excited for bedtime?

254
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:22,681
You got Batman?

255
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,222
Yeah you're Batman!

256
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:28,841
Say goodnight everyone!

257
00:10:30,260 --> 00:00:00,000
(happy music)
