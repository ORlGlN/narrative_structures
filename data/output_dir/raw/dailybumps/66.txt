1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
- [Grandma] Are you gonna
put Auntie on your zip line?

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,347
- [Ollie] Yeah, I don't want her to fall.

3
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:05,820
- [Grandma] You don't want her to fall?

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,240
Whoa.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,428
Okay.

6
00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:09,928

- Hi guys, welcome to
Missy and Bryan's video.

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,567
I'm with my buddy, Ollie, here, right?

18
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,400
- Yeah.

19
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,620
- And I thought that we would
vlog for Missy and Bryan

20
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,000
because they're headed back
from Las Vegas right now.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,133
What are you?

22
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,462
- (baby talk)

23
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,860
- [Auntie] Is he a abominable snowman?

24
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,693
- Yeah.

25
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:50,405
- [Auntie] You look so terrifying,
give me your best roar.

26
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:51,380
- No.

27
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,365
(roaring)

28
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:53,417
- Watch my roar.

29
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:54,250
- [Auntie] Okay. (laughs)

30
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,076
- [Ollie] Watch my roar.

31
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:57,395
- [Auntie] What's your roar?

32
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,672
(roars)

33
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:00,505
- [Auntie] Finn?

34
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:01,338
- [Papa] Let's hear your roar.

35
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:03,500
(roars)

36
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,532
- [Auntie] (laughs) Good
Job, Boys, Good job.

37
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,670
We're outside right now, it is absolutely

38
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,264
actually freezing, Mom.

39
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:10,110
It is freezing.

40
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,170
It's freezing.

41
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,220
- [Grandma] There are
people out in the East Coast

42
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,980
dealing with a snowpocalypse or something.

43
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,535
- All right, fine, it's above average.

44
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,750
- [Grandma] Snowmageddon, or--

45
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,993
- No, it's like 50 or 60 out.

46
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,394
- [Grandma] A bomb cyclone,
that's what they called it.

47
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:23,340
- Bomb cyclone.

48
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,530
We're outside playing with Koda right now

49
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,450
and the other dogs, and
we're just hanging out.

50
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,531
- [Grandma] Okay, are you gonna
put Auntie on your zip line?

51
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,900
- [Ollie] Yeah, I don't want her to fall.

52
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,610
- [Grandma] You don't want her to fall?

53
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,770
Yeah, I don't think she wants to fall.

54
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,120
Whoa.

55
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,290
- Don't touch that wire.

56
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,123
- I won't.

57
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:39,956
- [Grandma] All right, all right,

58
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:41,820
we gotta help her down at the bottom.

59
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,796
We got uncle down there.

60
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:44,972
- I will not touch the wire.

61
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:45,831
- [Grandma] Okay.

62
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,004
- One, two, three.

63
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,337
(screaming)

64
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:51,222
- [Papa] Oh!

65
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:52,472
- [Grandma] Oh!

66
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,669
Okay, she kinda hit the bottom.

67
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:57,608
Kinda hit the bottom.

68
00:01:57,608 --> 00:01:59,040
- [Ollie] My turn, my turn!

69
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,850
- [Grandma] Okay, is it your turn?

70
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,752
Here we go! (laughs)

71
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:05,669
- [Finn] (screams)

72
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:10,500
- [Grandma] So we put a lower
handle for Finn this time

73
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,410
so he's not reaching so high up.

74
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,100
All right, your turn?

75
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,590
Okay, go for it!

76
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,423
Here he comes!

77
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:22,669
- [Finn] (screams)

78
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:27,310
- [Grandma] Yay!

79
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,470
All right, it's Ollie's turn.

80
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:31,335
Here we go.

81
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:39,890
Woo hoo!

82
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,460
- All right, ready? Go back!

83
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,531
- [Grandma] All right

84
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:52,690
we added the other two dogs to the mix.

85
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,610
We had to wear out Koda a little bit

86
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,070
before we brought the other dogs out.

87
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,130
Otherwise, he just gets all mad at them.

88
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,628
I think we wore him out
pretty good. (laughs)

89
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:02,128
(dog barking)

90
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,390
- [Grandma] Poor Karma, though,
he hasn't got the ball once.

91
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,300
He's getting old.

92
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,010
- [Papa] Oh, look at that.

93
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,699
- [Grandma] Oh, a sneak attack.

94
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:14,990
- [Papa] Yay!

95
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,870
- [Grandma] Hey guys.

96
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,703
- [Auntie] Karma's like, oh my God.

97
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:18,670
- [Grandma] Where'd it go?

98
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,194
- [Auntie] Please start throwing it.

99
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:21,620
- [Grandma] (laughs)

100
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,453
- [Auntie] Good job.

101
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,470
Karma is like, I'm
never gonna drop it now.

102
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,680
All right, well I had such
a fun day with you guys

103
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,513
you know that?

104
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:28,346
- Yeah.

105
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,179
- What did we do today?

106
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:30,110
Can you tell them what we did?

107
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,943
- Yeah.

108
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,750
- We filmed a super,
super fun video together.

109
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,520
It was very interesting.

110
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,830
We tried our best.

111
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,160
If you guys wanna click
the I-card right there

112
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,040
you guys can check out the video

113
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,280
that me, Ollie, and Finn, and
my dad, and everybody filmed

114
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,380
while Missy and Bryan were gone.

115
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,730
You guys can see the mess we made.

116
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,843
But I'm actually gonna
leave, so, I love you.

117
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:47,780
- Love you too.

118
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,730
- You look like Mimi. (laughs)

119
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,899
All right, bye, buddy.

120
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:51,630
- [Finn] Bye Mimi.

121
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,580
- Bye sweetie, I love you.

122
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,586
- [Finn] Bye sweetie.

123
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:56,419
- [Auntie] (laughs)

124
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,640
- [Missy and Bryan] (shout) We're home!

125
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,630
- [Bryan] What's up, boys?

126
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:03,611
- Give Mommy a hug.

127
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,710
- [Missy and Bryan] Aww, we missed you.

128
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,170
- [Missy] How was Mimi
and Papa, was it fun?

129
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,003
- Yeah.

130
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:10,240
- [Missy] Did you hang
out with Auntie today?

131
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,080
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,961
- [Missy] (gasps) I was kinda--

133
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:12,794
- [Bryan] What'd you do?

134
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,081
- We did a big slide video,

135
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:19,668
and there was a big green rope above it.

136
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:20,519
- [Bryan] Oh, cool.

137
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,160
- There was just a muddy pipe in there.

138
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,850
- Oh my goodness, I think
he's telling secrets

139
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,840
from Auntie's video.

140
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,260
Look, even Karma missed us.

141
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,079
Did you miss Mama, too?

142
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,400
We got the best welcome home, though.

143
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:37,860
- I'm not old enough
to climb this anymore.

144
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,300
- [Missy] Yeah, you gotta
just go up the door, huh?

145
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,133
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,190
- So while we were in Vegas

147
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,870
we got the boys some little presents.

148
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,360
- We have goodies for you!

149
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,193
You wanna see?

150
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:48,048
- Mm-hmm.

151
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:49,266
- [Bryan] Oh, my Karma!

152
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,204
- [Missy] Sit down and pet him.

153
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:51,240
- [Bryan] Look at those dogs, they're like

154
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,497
wait, presents for us?

155
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:53,330
- [Missy] (laughs)

156
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,633
Oh, maybe you got some.

157
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,466
Come here Lena, come.

158
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,870
- I don't know which one
you guys are gonna get

159
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,020
so I'm gonna give you
each one of these, okay?

160
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,030
- I feel it.

161
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,281
- [Bryan] Okay, open it up.

162
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:02,587
What is is?

163
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:06,239
Open it, open it, open it!

164
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,520
- Dragon.

165
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,872
- [Missy] What is it?

166
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:09,705
Awe!

167
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:11,734
- [Bryan] Whoa, it's a dragon?

168
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:13,215
- No, it's a little puppy.

169
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:14,545
- [Bryan] Oh, it's a puppy?

170
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:15,480
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,650
- [Bryan] Hmm, I think it's a dragon.

172
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,720
- No, it's a puppy.

173
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,270
- [Bryan] Okay, but
which one is that, Ollie?

174
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,103
- [Missy] Let's see, Finn.

175
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:20,936
What is it Finn?

176
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:22,192
- [Bryan] See which one Finn got.

177
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,524
Which one did Finn get?

178
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,445
- [Missy] What is it?

179
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:25,392
- [Bryan] Whoa.

180
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,890
- [Missy] Is that a kitty cat?

181
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,220
- [Bryan] They're little sculptures.

182
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,470
They're made out of wood, Ollie.

183
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,560
Someone carved it.

184
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,080
- Cool, we can put that
up on your shelf, huh?

185
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,220
- [Ollie] Let's put it on.

186
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,532
- Okay.

187
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:40,830
- [Bryan] (laughs) Good job.

188
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,700
All right, I got one more
present for you boys, okay?

189
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,946
What'd you think is in here?

190
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,220
What'd you think is in this box, Ollie?

191
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,053
- I don't know.

192
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:49,830
- [Bryan] You'll never guess.

193
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,720
What about you, Finn?

194
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,640
What'd you think is in it?

195
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,473
- Yah.

196
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:54,490
- [Bryan] What's you think is it?

197
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,363
All right, open it up, boys!

198
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:58,077
Open it up!

199
00:05:58,077 --> 00:05:59,400
- It's a hard one to open, here--

200
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
- [Bryan] They're going to love this.

201
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,180
- There we go, it opens from the top.

202
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,880
- [Bryan] Yeah, it's kinda upside down.

203
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:08,956
- Yay!

204
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:09,858
- [Missy] What is that?

205
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:12,300
- [Bryan] What is it, guys?

206
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,133
- Whoa.

207
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,737
A scorpion?

208
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,010
- [Bryan] It's your
very own scorpion, boys.

209
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,345
- Is it real?

210
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:22,178
- [Bryan] Yeah.

211
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:23,390
- It's real inside.

212
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,910
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's a
real scorpion inside there.

213
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,394
We got it from Vegas.

214
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:27,227
- Really?

215
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:28,540
- [Bryan] Because they
have lots of scorpions.

216
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,103
- But is it real?

217
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:30,936
- [Bryan] Yeah.

218
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:31,800
- [Missy] It's real.

219
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,830
- Do they have a spider one?

220
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,100
- [Bryan] I don't know,
they had a scorpion

221
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,400
and a butterfly, so I
thought, you know what,

222
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,020
my boys, they would
like the scorpion, huh?

223
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,860
- I really like this one.

224
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,957
- [Bryan] You like it?

225
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:46,021
- I like black ones and red ones.

226
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,135
- [Missy] Awe.

227
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:48,044
- [Bryan] Yeah.

228
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:48,877
So it was a good present?

229
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:49,710
- Yeah.

230
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,543
- [Bryan] Yay!

231
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,591
- Wait, do you have one more present?

232
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,576
- [Bryan] No.

233
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:53,790
- I have a little present for you guys.

234
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,623
- [Bryan] Mommy has some presents.

235
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,740
- [Missy] One more, okay?

236
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,100
- [Bryan] Hey, what'd you say to daddy?

237
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,599
- [Ollie] Thank you, daddy.

238
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,605
- [Bryan] You're welcome.

239
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:02,405
- It's really cool because it has pinchers

240
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:05,198
and that yellow stinging tail.

241
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:06,126
- [Bryan] Yeah.

242
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,690
Ollie is obsessed with scorpions

243
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,690
so when I saw it, I was like

244
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,140
"Oh, they're going to love that."

245
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,880
We see them everywhere around here.

246
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,780
- Okay, ready?

247
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,174
Your other prize is...

248
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:19,410
Chocolate pajamas!

249
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,690
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, we got you pajamas

250
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,920
from the Hershey store!

251
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,300
Look, they have like little
chocolate guys on them. (laughs)

252
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,396
Pajamas, mom, that's not a present.

253
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,044
- [Missy] Say, thank you mama.

254
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:32,024
- Thank you, mama.

255
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:33,691
- Aww well, Finn likes them.

256
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:36,524
(feel-good music)

257
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,130
- I am getting the kids ready for bed

258
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,960
and I have missed putting them to bed

259
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,460
the last couple of nights.

260
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,470
But, they were so good for Mimi and Papa

261
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,260
and so, I'm so proud of them.

262
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,800
Slept in your bed all night.

263
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,550
There was one night where
he got a little nervous

264
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,539
and needed Mimi, huh?

265
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:00,378
- Yeah.

266
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,010
- But the other night, he did great.

267
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,110
I did get something in the mail

268
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,550
that I ordered a little while ago.

269
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,940
It's this little Okay to Wake owl

270
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,220
and I'm really excited about it

271
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,787
because his little eyes, when you press

272
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:16,150
turn yellow, and it kinda
plays a little lullaby.

273
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,350
What it also does is

274
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,270
in the morning, when
it's time to wake up--

275
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,180
I set the timer for
them to wake up at 7AM.

276
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,210
They can press it, and if it turns green

277
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,100
it'll say, "Good morning,
it's time to wake up."

278
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,500
And so, they know not to get out of bed

279
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,799
until the eyes are green.

280
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,028
Isn't that pretty cool?

281
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,861
- Yeah.

282
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:36,694
- So they're excited about it too

283
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:37,528
because they always are like--

284
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:40,480
They don't necessarily know
if it's too early to get up.

285
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,440
Other than, I tell them to not
get up until the sun is up.

286
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,650
But, (laughs) you know

287
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,360
I think it can be difficult sometimes

288
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,680
so I was like, "All right, in
the morning you press this."

289
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,690
If it says it's time to wake
up, or if the lights are green

290
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,214
that means go, go, go, huh?

291
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:55,047
- Go, go, go.

292
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:56,120
- [Missy] Go, go, go see mama.

293
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,270
- Yeah, yeah.

294
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,880
- If they press it just a little too early

295
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,530
it'll say, "Go back to bed."

296
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,310
or, "It's almost time to get up."

297
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,550
but the eyes will still be yellow.

298
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,520
So, I'm excited!

299
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,460
I'm hoping it works.

300
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,585
We'll see how it works, huh?

301
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:07,470
- Yeah.

302
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,280
- [Missy] You're gonna stay
in bed until the lights are--?

303
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,113
- Open.

304
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,367
- Green! (laughs)

305
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,457
All right, kids are in bed.

306
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:18,090
We have had a long day driving.

307
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,640
It's so nice, though, to be home

308
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,760
and it's so nice just to be with the kids.

309
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,490
Putting them to bed is just
always really cute and fun.

310
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,820
I think we're gonna go
ahead and end the vlog

311
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,660
so we can go to bed (laughs).

312
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,580
We drove for like five hours.

313
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,370
It was a long drive.

314
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,760
I hope you enjoyed today's video.

315
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,091
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up, if you did.

316
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:39,782
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

317
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:40,615
Bye.

318
00:09:42,381 --> 00:00:00,000
(lively music)
