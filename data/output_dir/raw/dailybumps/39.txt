- Good morning, guys.

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,130
I am headed up to Nacho right now.

19
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,290
I'm actually in the truck,
and I'm headed up there

20
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,150
because I'm dealing with
a little bit of an issue

21
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,210
with him right now,
(bell dings)

22
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,170
and I'm hoping it doesn't
turn into a bigger issue.

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,310
I'll give you guys more
information once I get up there,

24
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,530
but yeah, I'm just a little worried,

25
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,970
a little bummed, and I'm hoping

26
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,500
it's nothing too big of a deal.

27
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,610
Let's go check on him,
and see how he's doing.

28
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,330
All right, here's my boy.

29
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,170
He's out in the pasture.

30
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,390
Hi, you giving me some kisses?

31
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,930
Oh my gosh, he looks so handsome.

32
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,040
Actually, I don't know
if I showed you guys,

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,060
but I shaved his nose, and I love it.

34
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,760
He looks like a little man.

35
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,020
Freshly shaved, huh?

36
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,240
Not even a little man, he kind
of looks like an older man.

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,650
Hi, Funs, how are you?

38
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,160
This is his friend Funs,

39
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,420
and they actually get along really well.

40
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,320
They love to play.

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,910
Basically, like I said, I'm dealing with

42
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,670
a little issue with him,
but the other night,

43
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,440
I actually was riding him,

44
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,410
and he just felt a little bit off.

45
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,140
It wasn't anything too visible,

46
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,480
but I could tell something was

47
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,390
a little off in his front leg.

48
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,490
I trotted him around while
my trainer watched him,

49
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,240
and she said that his front left foot

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,910
was definitely a little, like,

51
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,320
something was going on with it.

52
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,730
Oh my goodness.

53
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,250
Are you biting each other?

54
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,430
Knock it off.

55
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,030
So not nice.

56
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,550
Oh my gosh, he's licking him.

57
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,240
Oh my gosh.

58
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,073
That's cute.

59
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:53,770
This leg, something
seems to be a little off.

60
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,650
There's no gashes, he's not
necessarily hurt at this point.

61
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,600
I did take him on a
pretty long trail ride,

62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,070
so he could've been just a little sore.

63
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,020
Could be that he chipped something.

64
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,750
Could be that he has a little abscess.

65
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,160
Could be nothing that big of a deal.

66
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,500
Could be something that's
a bigger deal than that,

67
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,310
so we gave him a little butane.

68
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,420
and some Epsom salt, and
been letting him rest,

69
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,420
but I'm gonna go ahead
and lunge him right now

70
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,253
for the first time.

71
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:17,470
I've never lunged a horse at all,

72
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,390
and I've never lunged him.

73
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,210
I hear it's a really,
really great thing to do

74
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,890
for bonding and stuff, so we're gonna see

75
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,110
how he does, and if he's good to go,

76
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,970
then I'll give him a ride.

77
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,040
If not, we'll see,
maybe I'll call the vet,

78
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,070
and make sure nothing too bad.

79
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,400
You want to go?

80
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,350
You're so pretty.

81
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,634
All right, let's go, bud.

82
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:34,720
I gotta say, guys, I'm
pretty proud of myself

83
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,100
for being able to notice
that he had an injury

84
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,280
'cause it was definitely not something

85
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,650
that you would've known unless

86
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,650
you rode him frequently and
know how smooth he is and stuff.

87
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,280
You wouldn't have even really seen it

88
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,540
unless you knew what you were looking for

89
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,810
when I was trotting him and stuff,

90
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,180
so I'm really proud of myself.

91
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,540
I definitely feel like I'm
learning a lot from him,

92
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,460
and it's been a really
cool experience so far.

93
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,530
Now I gotta figure out how
to get out of the pasture.

94
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,620
It's looking good.

95
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,940
Doesn't look like it's
gotten worse or anything,

96
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,470
so that's nice.

97
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,303
Go this way.

98
00:03:04,303 --> 00:03:07,260
I know, vlogging and walking
a horse is a little difficult.

99
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,790
All right, I've got him all saddled up,

100
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,540
and we're gonna lunge you.

101
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,570
Should be fun.

102
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,780
Hopefully, everything's all better, right?

103
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,630
Maria gave me a quick
little lesson on lunging,

104
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,020
and I gotta say, he's
pretty dang good at it.

105
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,110
I would say he's more
responsive to lunging

106
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,160
than me riding him.

107
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,540
Yeah, I think this'll be great to do

108
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,270
just 'cause he'll learn my voice,

109
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,830
and what I want, and how he does.

110
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,060
He actually does really good.

111
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,970
I had the little whip to move him,

112
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,380
but he didn't even need it.

113
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,213
He says, "Great."
(upbeat guitar music)

114
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,170
But I will say that,

115
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,460
after trotting him for a little bit,

116
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,500
he definitely still has a sore leg,

117
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,700
so I'm gonna soak it with some Epsom salt,

118
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,600
and do a whole little thing.

119
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,400
I'll show you guys in a
minute what I'm gonna do.

120
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,380
Hopefully, it gets better.

121
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,500
Basically, I can't really ride him.

122
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,160
I can maybe walk him a little bit,

123
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,550
but I probably won't even do that.

124
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,070
I'll do this for a minute just 'cause

125
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,550
I've got him hooked up and saddled up,

126
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,080
but really, I can't ride him

127
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,700
until whatever's wrong is fixed.

128
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,150
She's thinking probably
an abscess in his hoof.

129
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,470
Until that emerges and is done,

130
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,460
I really can't ride him,

131
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,380
and that could take
anywhere from, you know,

132
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,160
a few days, a few weeks, to a few months.

133
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,090
She had a horse that took two months,

134
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,019
just depending on how deep it is in there.

135
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,019
I really hope it doesn't
take months to help.

136
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,469
Hopefully, it's not.

137
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,470
Hopefully, we can get it out of there.

138
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,730
We're gonna use everything we can

139
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,980
to get it out of there, 'kay?

140
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,450
Poor guy, he's definitely uncomfortable,

141
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,650
so let's see if I can show
you some lunging really quick.

142
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:54,690
All right, we just went one way,

143
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,080
and I gave you a little trot just to see

144
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,760
if maybe any horse people want
to tell me what they think.

145
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,170
He wasn't doing too bad.

146
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,670
I'm gonna switch him to the other side,

147
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,700
and I'll trot him for just a minute,

148
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,460
and I'll let you guys check it out

149
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,570
'cause I know there's some
horse people out there

150
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,500
who might be interested
to see what he has,

151
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,170
and honestly, I'm
interested in your opinions

152
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,620
if you think it's anything too bad.

153
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,030
I don't think it's anything too major.

154
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,270
I really think it's just an abscess,

155
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,870
but I'm gonna try the
other way really quick,

156
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,200
and you guys can take a look.

157
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,980
All right, that is all I'm gonna do today.

158
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,520
I was actually gonna
walk him a little bit.

159
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,530
I gave you guys more trot and more canter,

160
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,600
and as you could see, he was definitely

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,010
throwing his head up, and that is him,

162
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,420
because he's a little uncomfortable.

163
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,700
His foot definitely is hurting,

164
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,970
so I don't want to walk him anymore,

165
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,080
and I don't want to trot
him or canter him anymore.

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,540
I just wanted to give you guys an idea.

167
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,140
I will say, first time lunging,

168
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,470
I know I'm not a pro,
but I actually feel like

169
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,940
it was pretty dang good and pretty easy

170
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,270
for my first time, so I'm excited.

171
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,380
He's obviously really awesome at doing it,

172
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,810
so that helps a lot.

173
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,580
If I had a horse that
didn't want to do it,

174
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,250
that'd be a little more difficult,

175
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,340
but he's awesome.

176
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,910
I honestly have learned so much from him.

177
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,350
It's been so great.

178
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,961
I'm gonna go ahead and
de-saddle him, or unsaddle him,

179
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:31,862
give him a little break,

180
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:35,110
and kind of fix up his
leg, put some stuff on it.

181
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,990
Hey, say hi.

182
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,950
He's like, "Guys, my foot hurts.

183
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,283
"My foot hurts."

184
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:51,210
All right, I am heading out.

185
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,900
Kind of gave you a little bit of b-roll

186
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,720
of us wrapping up.

187
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,650
She's actually showing me how to do it,

188
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,800
and all the stuff I need to buy.

189
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
It looks really awesome,
the way she does it.

190
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,700
I'm hoping it works.

191
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,980
I'm hoping that it can show itself sooner

192
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,560
rather than later 'cause
basically, it's like,

193
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,170
an abscess inside there,
it needs to come out.

194
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,610
We're putting stuff on it to hope that

195
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,330
it pulls it out, and I'm just so sad

196
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,429
that he's got an owie.

197
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:15,270
Yeah, I gotta go buy everything.

198
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,570
I just gotta say, I love
this place that I'm at.

199
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,350
I totally am a beginner,

200
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,440
but I've learned so
much from these people,

201
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,910
and they're just the sweetest, nicest,

202
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,200
most loving, it's just like,

203
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,440
they're willing to give me
so much time and attention,

204
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,810
and teach me so much, and it's just been

205
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,950
such an amazing
experience, and I feel like

206
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,300
I'm totally a part of this barn.

207
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,430
It's just been a really,
really cool experience.

208
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,948
For all you horse people, I don't know,

209
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm loving it, I'm loving it,

210
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,580
and I know I've got a
lot of people watching me

211
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,410
who do a lot of horse stuff,

212
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,890
and I hope you guys know that
I am totally enjoying myself.

213
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,350
I know a lot of people
were a little worried

214
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,670
about me getting a horse as a beginner,

215
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,020
but I know it was the
best decision for me.

216
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,853
I'm really excited about it.

217
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,080
Anyways, as I was touching
my hair the whole time

218
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,060
'cause that's what I do, I'm
gonna go ahead and head home,

219
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,590
go see Bryan, and then I gotta head off

220
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,070
to get Ollie soon.

221
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,980
I am headed in to grab Ollie.

222
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,091
I am so hungry right now.

223
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,490
I have not eaten anything, so I'm gonna

224
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,480
grab him, get some lunch.

225
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,950
How was school, bud?

226
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,783
- Good.

227
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:20,616
- [Missy] Good?

228
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,640
Are you ready to go into
the horse store with me?

229
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,473
He was asking, he was like,

230
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,430
"Why are there horse tracks here?"

231
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,456
It looks cool, right?

232
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,289
- Yeah.

233
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,890
- [Missy] Ollie found the horse
at the front of the store.

234
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,270
Are you excited?

235
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,610
Hang on, hang on, watch,

236
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,020
you gotta put your foot here.

237
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,059
No, no, your other foot.

238
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,619
Now, put this foot here.

239
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,289
Yeah, there you go.

240
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,009
Then use that so you can push yourself up.

241
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,230
Oh my god, you just got
on a horse by yourself.

242
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm so proud of you.

243
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,610
Look at that.

244
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,050
He's all saddled and ready.

245
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,813
You want me to give you some money?

246
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:56,646
- Yeah.

247
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:57,860
- I actually had a feeling
he'd want to go on it,

248
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,510
and I really wanted him to go on it too

249
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,810
'cause it's so cute.

250
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,060
I always see it when I come in here,

251
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,464
and he's never been on it, huh?

252
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:04,731
- Yeah.

253
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:05,820
- [Man] Attention, parents,

254
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,401
please do not leave your child unattended

255
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,160
while riding the ride.

256
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,780
- [Missy] Okay, hold on.

257
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,830
Hold on to the reins.

258
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,830
(laughs)

259
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,693
What do you think?

260
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,070
(Ollie laughs)

261
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,960
What are you getting Nacho, Ollie?

262
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,372
Getting him some treats?

263
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:27,101
- These are gingerbread treats.

264
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,940
- Oh, those look delicious, actually.

265
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,360
They're like little muffins.

266
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,740
They got all kinds of yummy stuff in them,

267
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,450
so we are gonna get him that.

268
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,810
We got him a new curry comb.

269
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,240
I do not like the one I got.

270
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,120
Then a different one, some
shampoo and conditioner,

271
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,416
one of those, some more of these treats.

272
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,340
These are a little bit more basic.

273
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,730
We just got a few more things to go.

274
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,010
- [Bryan] Missy just got done making

275
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,280
the most delicious looking dinner.

276
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,798
Thanks, babe.

277
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:54,710
- You're welcome.

278
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,891
- You're the best.

279
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:57,520
Sorry about your horse, by the way.

280
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,684
She's really bummed.

281
00:09:58,684 --> 00:09:59,570
(laughs)

282
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,210
If she hasn't showed it,
she is really bummed.

283
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,960
- Actually, when I was at the store,

284
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,350
I spent most of the time
talking to this lady

285
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,479
who had had a lot of horses
(Finley shouts)

286
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,003
that are prone to abscess.

287
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,740
- [Bryan] Oh, yeah?

288
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,500
- I'm so stressed.

289
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,380
Please, if you have any advice,

290
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,300
leave it down in the comments,

291
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,740
and you know how to draw this thing out

292
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,740
without splitting its hoof, apparently.

293
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,593
- [Bryan] What?

294
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:22,444
- Yes.

295
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:23,960
- This poor horse.

296
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,330
- All right, dinner is done,

297
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,970
and we all ate so good, huh?

298
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,602
Now we're playing.
- He's in love with this porg.

299
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:32,302
- [Missy] I know.

300
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:34,406
- I'm in love with Zurg.

301
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:35,239
- With Zurg?

302
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,800
That's so cool, huh?

303
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,080
- He loves his Zurg.

304
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,180
Fin loves his porg.

305
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,940
I didn't know we were such Star
Wars people, but apparently,

306
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,773
we really are.
- We, apparently,

307
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,180
are very big Star Wars people.

308
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,670
- I mean, that's not Star Wars, but.

309
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,550
Anyways, I'm really hoping my
horse gets better really soon.

310
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm so nervous about it.

311
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,900
Hopefully, it all is all good.

312
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,810
I got a bunch of really cool stuff,

313
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,085
so hopefully, it gets better.

314
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:58,680
- That's such a bummer
you can't even ride him.

315
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,513
- I know.

316
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:02,198
Can't ride him, really
can't even be lunging him.

317
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:03,031
- Aw.

318
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:03,864
- Can't really walk him.

319
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:04,950
He can play in the pasture.

320
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,103
- And you can give him treats.

321
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:08,840
Be a good time for him to fatten up.

322
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,710
- Yeah, if anything, I can
bond with him in other ways,

323
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,270
like just hanging out with him,

324
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,550
and brushing him, and stuff,

325
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,340
but I think it'll be okay, hopefully.

326
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,190
Crossing my fingers.

327
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,060
I'll probably gonna ferry
out there really soon.

328
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,730
Anyways, we're gonna go
ahead and end today's video.

329
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,240
It is almost time for bed.
(electronic music)

330
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,789
- All right, boys,
let's end today's video.

331
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:26,622
- [Missy] Can you say,

332
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:27,580
"Give this video a thumbs up"?

333
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,050
- Thumbs up, thumbs up.

334
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,270
- [Missy] Luna, Karma,
you guys can do thumbs up.

335
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,170
Thumbs up, yeah?

336
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,003
Okay, cool.

337
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,500
- Hey, you there, paw up.

338
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,365
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

339
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:37,288
- Paw up.

340
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:38,730
- Paw up, give us a paw up.

341
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,530
Whoop, there you go.

342
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,404
All right, we'll see you guys tomorrow.

343
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:44,330
What do you say, Ollie?

344
00:11:44,330 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
