(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,726
- [Missy] There's a little
surprise in here, okay?

3
00:00:06,726 --> 00:00:07,559
- Okay.

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,636
- Don't touch, you guys.

5
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:11,911
Don't touch it, I mean it.

6
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,411
I'll be right back

00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:37,316
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

16
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,901
- We're getting ready to take--

17
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:40,370
(dog barking)

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,620
I think someone's here.

19
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,690
I think Tara Lynn's actually here.

20
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,970
But we're actually headed off today.

21
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,740
Right now we're gonna go
to the barn real quick.

22
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,750
But we have a fun day planned.

23
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,583
What are we doing today?

24
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,757
- We're going to go to June's birthday.

25
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:51,710
- Yeah, it's her birthday party.

26
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,330
But before her birthday party,
we are headed up to the barn.

27
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,540
And Finn is just waking up,

28
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,680
so I have to quickly get him dressed,

29
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,580
head to the barn, and then
we got a party today, yay!

30
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,307
And Finn's up now and all dressed.

31
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:04,739
- Yeah, good afternoon.

32
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,877
- [Missy] Are you gonna go see Nacho?

33
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:07,710
- Yeah.

34
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,720
- Yeah, we are headed up to the barn.

35
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,300
We're just gonna go ride for a little bit

36
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,649
before we gotta head out.

37
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:15,232
(upbeat music)

38
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:18,620
- Happy do.

39
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:21,231
Bye do.

40
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:25,560
Do.
(laughing)

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,180
- What he's trying to say,

42
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,230
over and over again
through all those takes,

43
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,890
is happy birthday, June.

44
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,962
It is June's first birthday
and we are so excited, huh?

45
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:35,795
- Yeah.

46
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,888
- [Bryan] Yeah, so we got
her a big present, didn't we?

47
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:39,721
- Ball.

48
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,735
- [Bryan] What do you think's in it?

49
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:41,568
- Ball.

50
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,550
- [Bryan] A ball?

51
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,383
- Yeah.

52
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:44,920
- Yeah, he's gonna give away her present.

53
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,510
Okay Finn, I have to teach you.

54
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,530
When you go to a birthday party,

55
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,101
you don't tell them what you got.

56
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:49,934
- Okay.

57
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:51,640
- [Bryan] Okay? They have to unwrap it

58
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,571
and then they be surprised, right?

59
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,404
- Okay.

60
00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:55,237
- [Bryan] So don't tell her

61
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:56,952
that there's a ball game in there.

62
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:57,820
- Okay.

63
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,120
- [Bryan] Okay, high five.

64
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:01,100
I love you, dude.

65
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,077
- Hey, where's my bow tie?

66
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:05,664
- I know, I'm sorry.

67
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:08,155
All he told us today, he
really wants to wear a bow tie

68
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:11,130
to Juniper's first birthday party.

69
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,460
But we couldn't find one, sorry.

70
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,670
You look really good, though.

71
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,410
- Yeah.
- So the theme is spring.

72
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,980
So we've got some spring colors here.

73
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,350
We've got green, I'm rocking a blue shirt.

74
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,070
I picked up some new clothes yesterday

75
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,010
because all of my clothes

76
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,640
have been fitting really big on me.

77
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,292
My shirts just feel huge.

78
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:32,130
All my skinny jeans are
basically like regular jeans.

79
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,210
So I had to get some
new clothes yesterday,

80
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,380
and it feels so good to be
wearing smaller clothes again.

81
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,960
Going down a full shirt size,

82
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,956
I was not really expecting, and it's nice.

83
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:43,539
(upbeat music)

84
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:56,100
All right, we are now
at Kelsey and Corbyn's.

85
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,300
And it is like one of the
cutest birthday parties ever.

86
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,420
It's spring themed and the
boys are now about to do

87
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,700
a sack race with bunny ears on their head.

88
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
This is hilarious.

89
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,410
June, you can be the judge, okay?

90
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,493
Happy birthday, June.

91
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:11,713
- [Woman] Kelsey did such a beautiful job.

92
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:13,210
- [Woman] Go, go, go, go, go!

93
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,550
- [Woman] Hop, little bunnies!

94
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,740
- [Bryan] She ditched the ears.

95
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,890
Go Ollie, go, go, go!

96
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,550
I don't think my son understood the rules.

97
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,050
- Go, Ollie, go, go, Ollie!

98
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,330
- [Bryan] I'm not sure Ollie
knows what a sack race is.

99
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,580
- He's like, "You're on my team."

100
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,200
- Ollie, you don't run
circles around people.

101
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,100
You're supposed to run to the end, silly.

102
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,100
And also if you wear your rabbit
ears, you'll go way faster.

103
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,002
There you go, now hop, hop, hop.

104
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,729
There you go, oh.

105
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,350
Good try, buddy.

106
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,000
- I really want one of these.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,570
- [Bryan] I know, they look so yummy.

108
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,729
Look at these cute carrot cake cupcakes.

109
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:50,010
- No, no, you gotta sing
her Happy Birthday first.

110
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,843
- Ollie, come on.

111
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:53,397
You are going to be five this summer.

112
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:54,710
Oh my gosh, I can't believe

113
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,040
those words actually came out of my mouth.

114
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,060
You should know how
birthdays work by now, right?

115
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,893
- Yeah.

116
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:00,390
- You gotta sing Happy
Birthday and then we eat cake.

117
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,119
How is our son gonna be five this summer?

118
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:04,786
- I don't want to talk about it.

119
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,246
Is this the birthday girl?

120
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,180
She's like, "I'm so nervous.

121
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,769
"There's so many people here for me."

122
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,079
You want to play in the sand with Finn?

123
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,459
There you go, she's so happy right now.

124
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,690
- Can I take Bunny?

125
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,900
- [Missy] All right, we're
having a flower-planting contest.

126
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,069
- Yeah, they get to pick their pot.

127
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,018
- [Missy] How cool!

128
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:31,240
- And now they're putting soil in it,

129
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,078
which is the plant's food.

130
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:35,590
And then we're gonna
put the flower in there.

131
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,680
- [Missy] How neat, Ollie.

132
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,860
You're gonna plant your own flower, fun!

133
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:43,087
(upbeat music)

134
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,647
Are you all done?

135
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:07,480
- Yeah.
- Me too.

136
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,524
- [Missy] That looks
awesome, good job, Nathan.

137
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:10,357
- [Bryan] Good job, boys.

138
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:12,230
- [Missy] That looks so good.

139
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,370
Ollie, did you just win?

140
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,203
- Yeah.

141
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:16,590
- You won the best plant, good job.

142
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,340
You're taking after your daddy.

143
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,470
You know Daddy loves to plant flowers.

144
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,760
- You did so good, man.

145
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,400
I am very proud of that.

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,849
- [Missy] I know, look at that.

147
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:28,180
- He even left a little room
on this side for the butterfly.

148
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,978
- Yeah, you set yourself
apart with that butterfly.

149
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:32,450
- Good job, dude. Cheers!

150
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,110
So close, try again.

151
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:37,903
His little face.

152
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:39,212
I love when he puffs out his cheeks

153
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:41,473
and is trying to blow it.

154
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:44,056
(upbeat music)

155
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,701
- One, two, three!

156
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:57,794
Hurry and jump in.

157
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:02,783
- [Woman] You're getting
faster, Hunter, and higher.

158
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:05,366
(upbeat music)

159
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,710
- They are literally ridiculous.

160
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,130
She kind of mothers
him, which is hilarious.

161
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,420
She totally bugs him.

162
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,200
She loves him to death.

163
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
And he kind of loves her too.

164
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,160
And I just had to show
you Finn cleaning up.

165
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,300
Did you put your shoes away?

166
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,630
What a good little helper.

167
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,840
They both actually put their
shoes away, huh, Ollie?

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,790
And now these two are being insane.

169
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,680
But we are home now.

170
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,200
June had such a cute little birthday.

171
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,498
It was so much fun hanging
out for June's birthday, huh?

172
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:46,770
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

173
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,010
Did you have fun at June's first birthday?

174
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,843
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

175
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,280
You guys were so good.

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
And they even cleaned up their stuff.

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,273
And so guess what?

178
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:57,010
I have a little surprise for you guys.

179
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,479
- I want to see.

180
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,370
- [Missy] Yeah, okay, come here.

181
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,940
Okay, the boys are sitting
at the coffee table

182
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,450
and they are all ready for their surprise.

183
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,560
Ready?
- Yeah.

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,110
- Okay, hang on.

185
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,090
All right, guys.

186
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,590
There's a little box up here.

187
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,194
And there's a little
surprise in here, okay?

188
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,027
- Okay.

189
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:17,218
- [Missy] Don't touch, you guys.

190
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:18,960
Don't touch it, I mean it.

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,620
Okay, now listen to me very carefully.

192
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,861
Finn, you listening?

193
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:23,694
- Yeah.

194
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:28,490
- [Missy] This box says
"Don't touch," okay?

195
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,480
- Okay.

196
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,338
- [Missy] So don't touch it.

197
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:33,947
- What's inside it?

198
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,126
- [Missy] I don't know.

199
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:39,160
- I really want to open it.

200
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,210
- I'll be right back.

201
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,047
- No, no, no, no, don't touch it.

202
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:50,785
- Can we touch it?

203
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:53,796
- No, it says don't touch it.

204
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:56,870
- So I'm watching them
on my phone right now

205
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,550
to see how long they
can go without doing it.

206
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,130
They're actually on the floor now.

207
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,540
Are you gonna touch it?

208
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,200
- I want to touch it.

209
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,490
- I think Ollie won't touch
it, but I think Finn will.

210
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,407
- I want to go and see.

211
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:14,780
Oh my!

212
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,314
- What does it have on it?

213
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,479
Can we open it up?

214
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,503
- Can we see?

215
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,562
See in--

216
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:27,045
- Don't touch it!

217
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:29,004
- That means I can.

218
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:29,837
- No.

219
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,304
Don't touch it.

220
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,900
(vocalizing)

221
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,150
Don't touch it.

222
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:40,337
- Yeah.

223
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:42,420
- It says don't touch it.

224
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,524
- [Missy] All right,
how's the surprise going?

225
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:49,700
- Good.
- Me too.

226
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,079
- [Missy] Yeah, has anything happened yet?

227
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:52,912
- [Finn] Yeah.

228
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:55,420
- [Missy] Yeah, are you guys
tempted to press that button?

229
00:08:57,665 --> 00:08:58,660
I don't know.

230
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,120
I don't know what's gonna
happen if you press the button.

231
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,580
I don't know.

232
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:07,660
What was that?

233
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,840
Finn, I feel like you want
to push that little lever.

234
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:14,507
You want to go for it?

235
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:15,340
- Yeah.

236
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,550
- [Missy] See what happens.

237
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,870
Okay, go ahead.

238
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,817
What happens?

239
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:22,650
- Oh.

240
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,541
- [Missy] Oh, what are you going to do?

241
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,744
- Push the button.

242
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:28,494
- [Missy] What if you push it up?

243
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:32,659
- Oh dear!

244
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,367
- [Missy] Wait, wait.

245
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,284
- Hi there.

246
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:40,883
Hi.
- That's funny.

247
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,998
(laughing)

248
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,780
- [Missy] He keeps pushing it down.

249
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,630
- Let's see what's gonna happen.

250
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:16,395
- [Missy] He's like, "Stop it."

251
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,095
- Ow!

252
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:30,856
- [Missy] Is that so funny?

253
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:32,855
- I want to touch it.

254
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:33,938
I touched it.

255
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:37,896
- [Missy] Don't touch.

256
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:47,531
(laughing)

257
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:48,976
- Don't touch it!

258
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:51,059
- [Finn] That orange guy.

259
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,130
- I thought it was a real baby kitty-cat.

260
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,400
- [Missy] That was a
really big letdown, huh?

261
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,690
Wasn't a baby kitty-cat, sorry.

262
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,550
Did you guys think that was funny?

263
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,383
- Yeah.

264
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:08,216
- [Missy] You actually did pretty good.

265
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:11,220
I told you guys not to touch
it and you didn't touch it.

266
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,580
- Yeah.
- What's that?

267
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,537
- [Missy] Except Finn got a little daring.

268
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,436
(laughing)

269
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:18,353
- [Oliver] Don't touch!

270
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:22,209
- [Missy] That is so cute.

271
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,337
- He's touching my box, don't touch it!

272
00:11:24,337 --> 00:11:26,920
(upbeat music)

273
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,970
- Wasn't that so cool, dude?

274
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,803
- Yeah.

275
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,603
- Did you expect a little
kitty to pop out of that box?

276
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,460
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,574
- You did?

278
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:45,080
You just think any type of
box gets put in front of you,

279
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,413
there's a kitty in it?

280
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,730
(laughing)

281
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,970
I think this is an important
lesson for the kids to learn,

282
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,100
that you should not push buttons

283
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,903
that you don't know what they do, huh?

284
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:57,736
- Yeah.

285
00:11:57,736 --> 00:11:59,030
- 'Cause you never know
what a button could do.

286
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,642
You have to be careful.

287
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:02,810
- Yeah, thanks for watching today's video.

288
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,380
