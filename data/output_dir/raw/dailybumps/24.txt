1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,333
- Good morning!

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,898
(Finley babbling)

3
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:08,898
♪This is our life. Let's
live it. Live it forever. ♪

4
00:00:09,864 --> 00:00:13,341
- Good morning guys! Finn
is watching Daily Bumps

5
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:17,127
on an iPad. Aren't you Finn?
Are you watching Ollie?

6
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:17,960
- Yeah

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,813
- Yeah and Finn and Mama and Dada?

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:21,646
- Yeah

9
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,676
- Yeah. It's just been one of those days.

10
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:25,596
I'm getting work done and
trying to clean and Ollie's

11
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:28,879
actually at school so
Finn's super bored and

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,378
so I was like, "Finn, just watch a show

13
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:34,842
while I clean up and
that is what he's doing

14
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:35,675
and he's actually being really good.

15
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:38,011
I think he's tired. I think
it's time for his nap.

16
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:41,420
But yeah, I think he's about
to go crazy any minute here.

17
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,257
Luna Loo, that is not your toy!

18
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:46,394
Drop that right now! Drop that right now!

19
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:49,811
Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Luna, drop it!

20
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:54,958
Okay, thank you. She's like, "It's just so

21
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,721
fun to play with." I
think this is the boys'.

22
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:00,254
- So this video is sponsored by Alice

23
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:02,227
so special thanks to Alice for sponsoring

24
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:04,904
today's video. I'm trying to
find Missy right now though.

25
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:07,822
- Shh! I'm trying to hide from the boys

26
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:10,856
so I can play this cool game
I just found called Alice.

27
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:13,499
(pops and chimes)

28
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:14,891
Yes!

29
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,438
The game is beautiful and
just so much fun to play.

30
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:19,947
I found it in the app store.
You can also get it on

31
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,894
Google Play and it reminds me
of my favorite tale, Alice.

32
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,961
The goal is to get the last
figure, which is obviously Alice

33
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,310
while placing figures on the field.

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,542
While matching these figures together

35
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:31,773
I got a cute little sheep.

36
00:01:31,773 --> 00:01:34,814
(pops and chimes)

37
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:36,968
I just matched the dog to make this cute

38
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:38,917
little rabbit, the March Hare.

39
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,689
Look at his glasses!

40
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,169
What's cool about this game is

41
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,818
there's lots of different opportunities.

42
00:01:43,818 --> 00:01:46,045
The app is brand new,
so if you download it

43
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:48,707
within the first month,
you get ten balloons

44
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:51,209
which will boost your game a ton.

45
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,513
All you need to do is
download the app Alice

46
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,597
by clicking the link down below

47
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:57,388
and then connecting it to your Facebook.

48
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:59,011
Ooh, I just got a cute little mouse.

49
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,511
I wonder what the next figure is gonna be.

50
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,559
- [Missy] Bryan, what are you doing?

51
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,744
- I'm leaving.

52
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,500
- [Missy] No, don't leave us!

53
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,283
- Yup, I've had enough with you.

54
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:14,301
I've had enough with the
kids. I'm outta here.

55
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,638
- And just so you know, that is not

56
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:17,721
enough room for my stuff.

57
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:21,352
- Yeah, I'm going on a trip on my own.

58
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,185
- [Missy] Yup

59
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,375
- No kids, no wife

60
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,652
- It's not our vacation yet. If you guys

61
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:28,149
don't know, yesterday we announced that we

62
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,507
are going on a little trip and it's

63
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:32,032
going to be our first real vacation

64
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:33,593
but this is not that trip.

65
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:36,043
- No, this is a work trip.

66
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:38,485
- I'm actually going to San
Francisco just overnight.

67
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,940
I have a couple meetings at YouTube

68
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,117
the fancy website you're
watching this video on

69
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,853
- And I am making some lunch. It's going

70
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:47,036
to be so sad that Bryan is leaving

71
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,705
but I am also really excited about them

72
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:50,531
It's such an honor that they're

73
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:52,278
inviting him out for these meetings.

74
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:54,611
I'm just really excited that
he gets to be a part of them.

75
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:56,655
I am gonna make food because I'm so hungry

76
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:59,827
and I know Finn's hungry and
I know Bryan's hungry too.

77
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:02,227
So I am running into school to grab Ollie.

78
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:04,567
All the boys have haircuts today

79
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:09,567
and so I'm grabbing Ollie and
meeting Bryan at the salon

80
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:12,549
and of course this one is fast asleep.

81
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,218
So I'm going to quickly put him into this.

82
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:17,024
Hopefully he stays asleep because

83
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:18,974
he definitely needs the nap and then

84
00:03:18,974 --> 00:03:22,841
we are going to head
to get a haircut. Shh!

85
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:26,258
Alright, got him in and he's fast asleep.

86
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,531
Success! Let's go get Ollie.

87
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:33,198
(lullaby music)

88
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,663
- [Missy] Hey dude, how was school?

89
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:39,587
- Good.

90
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,932
- [Missy] Good and did
you have a good share day?

91
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:45,330
You shared your triceratops.
So, what was the letter?

92
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,356
- T

93
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:48,625
- [Missy] T, yeah, and were
you able to draw the T?

94
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,689
- Yeah

95
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,510
- [Missy] Good I'm so proud of you.

96
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,375
Did they all like your triceratops?

97
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,658
- Yeah

98
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,301
- [Missy] Good. Alright, let's
go head to get a haircut.

99
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,134
- Haircut

100
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:02,609
- [Missy] Yay! Alright, the real test

101
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,824
is getting him back in his
seat without waking up.

102
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:07,666
Think mama can do it?

103
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,499
- [Oliver] Mmhmm

104
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,808
- [Missy] Okay

105
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:12,475
(lullaby music)

106
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:18,176
Shh. Close your eyes.
Close your eyes. Shh.

107
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:27,415
Alright, Finn, close your eyes, baby. Shh.

108
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:28,788
- Mama

109
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:31,571
- Well, that didn't go terribly
but could have been better.

110
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,728
- Alright, boys, where are we headed?

111
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,452
- We're heading to our haircut.

112
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:40,068
- Yay! It's haircut day.
These boys love haircut day.

113
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:42,665
We're walking in now, and
they're actually in pretty

114
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:46,020
good moods for just
waking up from naps, huh?

115
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,802
Did you sleep good at school?

116
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:48,720
- Yeah

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,651
- Good, alright, they are so
excited to see Travis, huh?

118
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:54,484
- [Oliver] Yeah

119
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:55,997
- [Missy] Yeah

120
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:58,580
(upbeat music)

121
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,308
- [Missy] I don't know
what happened there.

122
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,176
He just decided to start
crawling up the stairs.

123
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,653
Did you get too tired?

124
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:14,486
- Yeah

125
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:16,071
- [Missy] Sometimes Mama
feels like she needs

126
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:18,741
to crawl up the stairs too. Daddy's here!

127
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:20,006
- I'm here!

128
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:21,242
- [Missy] Ollie, did you miss Daddy?

129
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:22,075
- Yeah

130
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,372
- He still barely fits in my arms.

131
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,991
- [Missy] Aww so cute.
Ollie was asking about you

132
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:31,342
and he was like, "I can't get a

133
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:32,843
haircut unless Daddy's with me."

134
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:34,209
- Aww, yeah

135
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,404
- You need Daddy here, huh?
You excited to see Dada?

136
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,237
- Yeah

137
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,010
- There he is, huh.

138
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,843
- Yeah

139
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,426
(upbeat music)

140
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,327
- You like my haircut?

141
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,160
- Yeah

142
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,727
- Yeah? Dada's gotta go, so I'm

143
00:05:58,727 --> 00:05:59,953
gonna see you tomorrow, okay?

144
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:00,829
- Okay

145
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:01,880
- Are you gonna be okay?

146
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,713
- Yeah

147
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:05,395
- Okay. I love you,
Finn. I love you, Ollie.

148
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:06,295
- Love you too

149
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:07,383
- Listen to Mama, okay?

150
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:08,216
- Okay

151
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:10,579
- Will you FaceTime me
tonight? Yeah? Okay.

152
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,013
- Gotta say goodbye

153
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:12,981
- I gotta go. I literally
have to finish packing

154
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,617
and then the car's gonna pick
me up in a half hour or so.

155
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:17,940
- [Missy] Yup. Alright.

156
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,048
- Alright, bye boys. Have
a good haircut, okay?

157
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:20,881
- Okay

158
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,782
- Love you

159
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:24,825
- Love you

160
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,408
(upbeat music)

161
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:45,268
- That length's cool?

162
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:46,435
- [Missy] Woo!

163
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,244
(Missy laughs)

164
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,401
- Are you ready?

165
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:54,234
- Yeah

166
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:55,067
- Yeah

167
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:57,788
- Do you love haircut day?

168
00:06:57,788 --> 00:06:59,268
- Yeah!

169
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:01,851
(upbeat music)

170
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,917
- [Missy] Look at how
handsome these boys are!

171
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:21,538
Look at your haircuts. Yours
looks very cool, Ollie.

172
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:24,288
Look at you! Very handsome, Finn.

173
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,202
Look at that little pose.
You guys ready to go home?

174
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:29,035
- Yeah

175
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:30,528
- [Missy] Alright, you guys did so good.

176
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:34,362
You got your suckers and I
even grabbed a couple candles

177
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:37,332
that smell amazing, which
Bryan will be excited about

178
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,002
but we gotta get home. I think there's

179
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:40,835
quite a bit of traffic
so that should be fun.

180
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,835
So we are all done with haircuts and

181
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,811
it's actually getting pretty late

182
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:50,134
but I just had to come up and see Nacho.

183
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:51,903
Trying to decide if I have time to

184
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,838
saddle him and ride him for a minute but

185
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,212
I was wanting to come up here earlier

186
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:57,339
but we were just super
busy so now I'm gonna go

187
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:58,954
see him and they're going
to hang out and play.

188
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,011
You guys gonna play?

189
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:01,677
- Yeah

190
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:03,294
- 'Kay. Oh, hey boys.

191
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:04,127
- Hey

192
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:06,311
- Are you hiding from Billy?

193
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:09,050
They are both so scared
of Billy 'cause Billy

194
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,878
does tend to headbutt them
because they're the same size.

195
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:15,190
He doesn't really like kids, I guess

196
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,471
So I locked him in here while I get Nacho.

197
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,859
You guys being good?

198
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:20,788
- Yeah

199
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:22,608
- Alright, I gave Nacho a little ride

200
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:25,057
but we didn't vlog anything.
Are you guys freezing cold?

201
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:25,890
- Yeah

202
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,505
- It's so cold and Nacho's
got his blanket and he's good

203
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:31,805
for the night. Night Nacho!

204
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:34,056
- [Oliver] How does horses sleep?

205
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,009
- [Missy] How do they sleep?

206
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:35,845
- [Oliver] Yeah

207
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,364
- [Missy] That's actually a
good question. Do they lay down?

208
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:40,097
- They do. Some do.

209
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:41,858
- [Missy] Some do and some just
stand and close their eyes.

210
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:44,482
- Most of them stand.
Really, I've walked in

211
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,362
on Asher a few times laying down.

212
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:51,547
- [Missy] Have you ever stood
and slept while standing?

213
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:52,380
- Yeah

214
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,992
- [Missy] No that would be so silly, huh?

215
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:57,833
- Maybe they are sleepwalking

216
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,422
- [Missy] Yeah, they
basically just sleepwalk, huh?

217
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:03,944
- Alright we are home
and you ate your dinner

218
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:04,777
- Yay

219
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,639
- And we are all ready for bed.

220
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,583
Mimi and Papa are over and I think I'm

221
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,404
actually going to make them some dinner

222
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:14,437
But we're going to go
ahead and end the vlog

223
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,847
because actually I do not have a computer

224
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,081
Bryan took the computer with
him and I actually don't

225
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:22,867
own a computer so I have
to use my mom's computer

226
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:26,001
to send Bryan footage so I'm
going to go ahead and end

227
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:29,269
this video so that I can
send footage on her computer.

228
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,371
Alright, well, we're going
to go ahead and end the video

229
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,602
so make sure you give it a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it.

230
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:36,335
Say, "thumbs up!" Oh,
there it is down there.

231
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:39,488
And we will see you guys
tom- oh, you know what

232
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:42,604
I was going to say I think
I've owned this shirt for

233
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:45,311
as long as we've been
vlogging or longer than

234
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:47,874
we've been vlogging so
bonus points if you can find

235
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:50,407
the first vlog that I
ever wore this shirt in.

236
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:54,801
I would not be surprised if
it's our very first vlog.

237
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,396
I really think I've had this
shirt for a long, long time

238
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,280
and I just thought about it
because I was like, "We've been

239
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,085
vlogging for five years.
Have I had this shirt

240
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:01,749
for five years?" Let me
know down in the comments.

241
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:04,085
We'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye!

242
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:05,168
- Bye!

243
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:06,868
- [Missy] Boop

244
00:10:06,868 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
