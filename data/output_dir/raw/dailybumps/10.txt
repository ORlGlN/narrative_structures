- Morning!

00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:04,380
- Good morning!

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,053
- [Bryan] Whoa, good morning to Ollie.

00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,704
- Good morning.

9
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:17,107
I love this hat.

10
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:19,052
I got it on Amazon.

11
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,470
I was like, "That's so cute!"

12
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,551
- Good morning, guys.

13
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:23,980
Today we are all out of the house

14
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,753
because Ollie does not have school today.

15
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:28,440
So we are gonna be running some errands

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,817
as a family.

17
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:30,650
- Yay!

18
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,483
- And we have a couple things to do.

19
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:32,463
We have to go grocery shopping.

20
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:34,220
We're looking for a couch

21
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,180
for Missy's secret project.

22
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,482
And then we are also doing
something really fun tonight

23
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:40,980
with the boys.

24
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,449
Finn, do you know what we're doing?

25
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:43,326
- Yeah.

26
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:44,620
- [Bryan] Ollie, do you know?

27
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,460
- No.
- [Bryan] Yes you do.

28
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,473
Why is he pretending like he doesn't know?

29
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:51,374
Is he like, "Am I not supposed to know?

30
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:54,546
"What if I know and then it
means I'm not allowed to go?"

31
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:56,086
- Do you know what we're doing later?

32
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,664
- [Bryan] What we're gonna go see tonight?

33
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:58,728
- What?

34
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:00,067
- Here's a hint, Ollie.

35
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,508
♪ This is the greatest show ♪

36
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:04,549
Now where are we going tonight?

37
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:05,397
- The circus.

38
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:08,421
- The circus, that's right,
the circus is in town.

39
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,026
And it's a really good circus,

40
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,134
so we wanna take the boys

41
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:13,833
because they've been
loving The Greatest Showman

42
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,629
soundtrack; we've been
listening to it like crazy.

43
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,617
I think it's out on--

44
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:18,310
Is it out?

45
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,230
Oh, we need to watch it with them.

46
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,111
- Yeah, he saw the big circus tent

47
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:23,172
the other day and I
personally was never allowed

48
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:24,646
to go to a circus when I was kid

49
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:27,211
because my parents felt
that they were probably

50
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,197
abusive to animals and stuff,

51
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:30,854
so I was like, I have to check to see

52
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:32,717
if we can go, Ollie,
'cause I don't wanna go

53
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,069
if it's not a very good one.

54
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,662
But apparently this one is a good one.

55
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,460
It's totally good, they
don't use any animals.

56
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,383
And I think it's just gonna be fun.

57
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:42,460
- My parents apparently weren't as nice.

58
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,707
They didn't care about the
animals, 'cause I went.

59
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:45,781
Yeah, I mean, I went to
circus with elephants,

60
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:48,376
giraffes, and lions and stuff.

61
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:51,169
I know, nowadays in our time I feel like

62
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:54,530
that definitely is not allowed,

63
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,918
for good reasons, but it's interesting,

64
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:59,280
the experience that Ollie's gonna have

65
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,048
at the circus versus
what we had growing up.

66
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:04,300
- Do you think it'll be so
different without animals?

67
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,352
- Oh yeah, I think so, for sure.

68
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:06,964
But I think it'll still be a good show.

69
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:08,363
It's still gonna be the greatest show

70
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:11,292
and regardless, this is the
greatest show right here.

71
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,190
- [Missy] Yeah.

72
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,023
- [Bryan] All you guys.

73
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:16,142
- The future's so bright
I have to wear shades.

74
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:17,552
- He may have learned that from me.

75
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:18,840
(laughs)

76
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,361
What, Ollie, why is there
cracks on the ground?

77
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:22,346
- Sometimes the world breaks it.

78
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:23,359
- [Bryan] The world breaks it?

79
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:25,090
- Yeah.
- [Bryan] Oh, with

80
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,923
an earthquake?
- Yeah, I think so.

81
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:28,250
- Yeah, I think it's an earthquake.

82
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,363
All right, we are headed
in to the furniture store.

83
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:33,480
- Mimi and Papa have this couch upstairs.

84
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,675
- They do, huh?

85
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:37,193
So Missy actually found a couch

86
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:39,060
and she's buying it and all that,

87
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,893
so I'm taking the boys

88
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,744
and literally just
walking around the store

89
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,391
trying to get my step counter going.

90
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:44,550
(laughs)

91
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,500
I've been stuck at the house

92
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,590
for a couple days straight

93
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,850
and I haven't moved a whole lot

94
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,700
and my Apple watch reminds
me of it quite a bit,

95
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,556
so I'm like, well, let's just walk

96
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:51,480
around the store.

97
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,330
But then this happens.

98
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,340
We find a bunk bed and the
boys just wanna climb it.

99
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,173
How's that one?

100
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:56,457
- Good.
- [Bryan] Good.

101
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,962
Ollie, you were literally just saying

102
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:59,801
how much you love your
bed the other day, huh?

103
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,880
- Yeah.
- He was so sweet.

104
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,362
He was like, "I really love my bunk bed.

105
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:04,563
"Thank you guys so much."

106
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,933
And it was one of those moments

107
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,319
where I was like, "That's so sweet."

108
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,660
(laughs)

109
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,493
This is a cool one, huh?

110
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,650
- Yeah.
- They're so cute,

111
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,718
I just say, "Ten-hut!"

112
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:16,646
And they come by and
they start following me.

113
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,629
I've gotta teach 'em
left-right-left, though.

114
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,208
(laughs)

115
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,895
- Left, left, left-right-left.

116
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:24,219
- [Missy] Where are we going next, boys?

117
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,256
- To the store!

118
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,270
- We're going to Target!

119
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,618
I don't know if we've
done a family Target run

120
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:31,020
in forever.

121
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,601
- 'Cause we're smart in full.

122
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,447
- I know, this is going to be a mistake,

123
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,690
a very big mistake.

124
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,066
But first, Starbucks.

125
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:39,020
(laughs)

126
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,440
So me and Bryan have decided to split up

127
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,930
and he's going to take
on starting the groceries

128
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,990
and I'm going to do all
the non-grocery items.

129
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,187
So I've got Finn, Starbucks,

130
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,862
and we're gonna get that shopping done

131
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,100
and then meet up with Bryan

132
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,979
and finish up the groceries.

133
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,778
And just like that, we're done, huh Finn?

134
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,218
- Yeah.
- [Missy] Woo-hoo!

135
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,051
(laughs)

136
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,100
- All right, guys, we are back home

137
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,574
and I just finished
cleaning the entire fridge

138
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:03,993
and stocking everything

139
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,690
and, yes, we got a lot of Bubly.

140
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,040
For those of you wondering,

141
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,916
I know I've talked about La Croix a lot,

142
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,840
but I just tried Bubly

143
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,760
and it's really good,

144
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,588
and so I am stocking the house up

145
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,867
with some of this sparkling water.

146
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,769
I've been drinking sparkling water

147
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,188
for like four months now

148
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:25,330
in place of soda and it has changed

149
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,730
a lot of different things, so

150
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,950
I swear by it.

151
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,190
I drink that stuff all the time.

152
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,430
I've been drinking a
lot of sparkling water

153
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,460
and a lot of tea lately.

154
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,720
But my sister actually just sent me

155
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,091
a package and I wanted to show you

156
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,140
what she got me,

157
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,540
'cause she's just the coolest.

158
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,726
Finally got your birthday card, sister,

159
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:39,016
in case you were wondering,

160
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:43,060
and yes, she put 1,000
dollars in it, sweet!

161
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,715
My sister actually sells dōTERRA,

162
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:46,427
and I use those every now and then,

163
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:48,032
so I had her send me a couple ones,

164
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:49,520
and she's so cute,

165
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,423
she writes everything down,

166
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,060
like "This one's for Slim and Sassy,"

167
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,893
this is what it does,

168
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,307
this is how you can use it.

169
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,335
Past Tense is like a tension blend,

170
00:04:57,335 --> 00:04:58,924
helps ease stressful feelings.

171
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,910
And then she always throws in a little

172
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,191
(laughs) sample.

173
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:04,170
Yeah, she always throws
in a little sample,

174
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,277
and I'm like, "You know I'm your brother,

175
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:06,110
"I'm probably gonna bye from you anyway."

176
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,070
She's like, "I don't care."

177
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,009
This one is the, ooh,
vanilla roller, cool.

178
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,780
She always pops something in for the boys,

179
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,880
which I think is really cute.

180
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,713
She threw in some Pop Rocks.

181
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:15,939
The boys are going to love these.

182
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,464
She's always so nice.

183
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,150
I love my sister, I miss her.

184
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,505
I wish she lived closer.

185
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:24,083
Three, two, wah!
Pop rocks!

186
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,567
- Why is there a red one, a green one,

187
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,640
and a blue one?

188
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,180
- [Bryan] Well, those are
all the ones that we have.

189
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,214
Which one do you want?

190
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,040
- I want the red one.

191
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,190
- Okay, you can have the red one.

192
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,563
Finn, do you want watermelon
or tropical punch?

193
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,713
That one?

194
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:40,619
All right, save your Pop Rocks, boys,

195
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,338
because we going to the circus.

196
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,680
- Yeah!
- [Bryan] Are you excited

197
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,794
to see some flips and cool stunts?

198
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,210
- Yeah, but we are going to a circus

199
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,573
that doesn't have animals.

200
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,500
- That's right, it
doesn't have any animals.

201
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,530
(laughs)

202
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,417
We talked about that this morning.

203
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,900
You think he remembers.

204
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,131
- [Ollie] The circus!

205
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:00,646
- [Bryan] It's right there, huh?

206
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:01,694
You see the big old tent?

207
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,277
(upbeat music)

208
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:08,567
All right, we got the essentials:

209
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,530
Popcorn and cotton candy.

210
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,730
Want some popcorn, Finn?

211
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:16,526
Yeah, whoa boys, look at this.

212
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,848
We are going into a real circus.

213
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:20,433
Are you so excited?

214
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:25,093
This is gonna be so cool!

215
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,030
Are you excited, Finn?
- Yeah!

216
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,427
- [Bryan] Look at that!

217
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:31,059
- I see a treasure box.

218
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:34,234
- [Bryan] I think, Ollie,
that this circus has pirates.

219
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:35,734
- [Ollie] Pirates?

220
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:41,247
- [Bryan] All right, Ollie,
let's try your Pop Rocks.

221
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,680
How does it feel?

222
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:51,216
(upbeat music)

223
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:14,490
Whoa, I think there's a
big old pirate ship, Ollie.

224
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,575
- Ahh, pirate ship.

225
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:17,778
- [Bryan] There's pirates, huh?

226
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:18,801
- Yeah.

227
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:21,384
(upbeat music)

228
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:32,271
- [Bryan] Huh?

229
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:34,820
- That's a cool captain right there!

230
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,990
Look at that!

231
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,095
- [Bryan] That's the captain, yep.

232
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,678
(upbeat music)

233
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:54,468
Oh no, Ollie, I think the evil
pirate clown's coming out!

234
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:55,968
Ooh, there she is.

235
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:13,944
- She's so high up there!

236
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,642
- She is, huh?

237
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:17,532
- Yeah!
- Wow, I did not know

238
00:08:17,532 --> 00:08:19,976
that there was pirates in this circus

239
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:21,976
or that they could do that.

240
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:22,809
That's crazy!

241
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:25,392
(upbeat music)

242
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:44,773
- That's a big pirate ship.

243
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:47,523
(dramatic music)

244
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:58,171
- [Bryan] Whoa, whoa!

245
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,171
(mumbles)

246
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,921
(dramatic music)

247
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:26,985
- Um, Dada, is that a real mermaid?

248
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:29,735
(dramatic music)

249
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:40,951
- [Bryan] Whoa!

250
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,750
That's a real mermaid, Ollie!

251
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,696
Finn, you see the mermaid?

252
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:47,555
- Yeah.
- [Bryan] Look at the mermaid!

253
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,183
That's so cool.

254
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:54,308
(upbeat electronic music)

255
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,428
- [Bryan] What's she doin' in there?

256
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:01,678
- I don't know.

257
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:03,941
- [Bryan] What happened?

258
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,503
She has legs now!

259
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:12,077
You guys, the mermaid has legs now.

260
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:16,797
(upbeat electronic music)

261
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,172
Whoa!

262
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,517
- Is he balancing up there?

263
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:40,030
- [Bryan] He's balancing, yeah.

264
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,329
Can you do that?

265
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:45,712
No? (chuckles)

266
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,258
Whoa, he's jumping rope.

267
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,489
Whoa!

268
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,993
That is talent right there, huh Ollie?

269
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:06,820
- Yeah.
- He's so good!

270
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,393
Whoa, they brought out knives.

271
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,160
That guy has knives.

272
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Oh gosh, what's about to
happen right now, guys?

273
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:15,699
What?

274
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,324
(upbeat electronic music)

275
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:25,560
- He did a flip!

276
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,700
- [Bryan] They are bringing
out more sharp objects,

277
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,380
oh gosh.

278
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,065
Oh no, are you nervous?

279
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,670
Are you nervous, Finn?

280
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,900
What's gonna happen?

281
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,400
(upbeat electronic music)

282
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,963
Ollie, that's attached to her hair.

283
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,080
(upbeat electronic music)

284
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:03,726
That is the craziest thing ever.

285
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:04,559
I don't think I could do that.

286
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,392
My hair would come out.

287
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:14,682
They're taking him

288
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:16,010
and they're putting him in the box.

289
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,843
Oh no.

290
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,530
What's gonna happen, guys?

291
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:29,870
What?

292
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,635
How did he get out of the box?

293
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:34,144
- I don't know.

294
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,777
- [Bryan] And now she's in there?

295
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:37,843
What?

296
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:40,464
She's getting in the box again.

297
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:43,214
(dramatic music)

298
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,204
No!

299
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:56,395
She's in there!

300
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:02,568
Whoa!

301
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,733
(upbeat electronic music)

302
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,844
That was crazy!

303
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:20,133
This is happening right in front of us.

304
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,216
This is nuts.

305
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:25,792
(upbeat electronic music)

306
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,885
(engines rumbling)

307
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:54,777
Whoa!

308
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:55,610
- So cool!

309
00:13:57,457 --> 00:14:00,957
(upbeat electronic music)

310
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,938
- This is seriously
happening like ten feet

311
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,235
in front of us right now.

312
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:10,997
(laughs)

313
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:13,234
(upbeat electronic music)

314
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,997
(engines rumbling)

315
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:16,580
Whoa!
That's crazy!

316
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,450
Finn, before you fall asleep,

317
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,520
did you like the circus?
- Yeah.

318
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,688
- Yeah, it was pretty neat, huh?

319
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:40,560
(laughs)

320
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,070
They had so much fun, you guys.

321
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,404
They're also exhausted, aren't you?

322
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:46,767
Are you gonna fall asleep in the car

323
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:47,890
on the way home?

324
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,140
- No.
- No? (laughs)

325
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,059
He's being so funny
and talking so quietly.

326
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,880
Ollie, what did you like about the circus?

327
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,702
- About the captain.

328
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,040
- [Bryan] The pirate captain?

329
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,890
- Yeah.
- [Bryan] Yeah, he was so

330
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,250
excited to see the captain

331
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,100
when we walked out.

332
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,417
- Yeah, he was like, "Can
I take a picture with him?"

333
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,327
- That was so cool, wasn't it, boys?

334
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:06,167
- Yeah.

335
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,600
- [Bryan] Did you like it?

336
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,433
- Yeah.

337
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,580
- We had so much fun at the circus.

338
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,419
I seriously did not even know

339
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:12,079
that it was gonna be a pirate themed one,

340
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,089
and they had mermaids.

341
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,400
That was so neat.

342
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,677
