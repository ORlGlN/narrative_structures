It is Valentine's Day for you guys.

For us, it's actually

Yes.

00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:33,580
So, Ollie just got back from school,

(Man laughs)

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,100

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,573

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,165
- She's writing.

46
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:17,480
- Writing your name, right?

47
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,564
- Yeah. I did it.

48
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:20,647

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,787
Oh, so you put that through that hole,

52
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,126

00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,895
(upbeat music)

60
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,780
It's a owl.

61
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,810
- [Man] Oh, that is so cool,
did you do that yourself?

62
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,710
- Yeah.

63
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,050

00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,463

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm so excited, whoa.

68
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,617
You got Fun Dip?

69
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:03,450
- Yeah.

70
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,342
- [Man] Who's that from?

71
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:05,310
- It's from Peyton.

72
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,940
- Oh, cool

73
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,669
I remember getting valentines in school.

74
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,010
It was the funnest thing
ever, passing them out

75
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,700
and getting candy and stuff.

76
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,160
Ooh, what's it say?

77
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,290
- This is from AJ.

78
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,410
- [Man] Oh, that's awesome, it says,

79
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,090
"You are a great friend,"
and it's got Transformers.

80
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,630
This is actually from Ben, Ollie.

81
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,540
Yeah. (laughs)

82
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,190
AJ is his little buddy
at school, it's so funny.

83
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,080
Ollie, find which one AJ got you.

84
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,960
Ooh, you got a Frozen one
from Nicole, that's neat.

85
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,002
And then, ooh, you got one from yourself?

86
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:38,110
- Yeah.
(Man laughs)

87
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,120
- [Man] These are your valentines.

88
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,953
What's that?

89
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,200
- It's chocolate.

90
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,033
- [Man] Oh.

91
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,500
- You can't eat it, you have
to put it in the bathtub.

92
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,723
- [Man] Oh, that's so cool, so you can

93
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:48,774
draw on the bathtub with it?

94
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:49,607
- Yeah.

95
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:50,470
- [Man] That's so neat.

96
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,830
You got a car?

97
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,800
"I like the way you roll,"
that's from Wyatt, awesome.

98
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Ooh, you got M&M's, and PAW
Patrol, that's so cool, Ollie.

99
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,340
- This from Miss Tracey.

100
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,482
- [Man] Really, your
teacher got you something?

101
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:04,315
- Yeah.

102
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:05,740
- [Man] Well, do you wanna
open it up and read it?

103
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,573
- Yeah.

104
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:07,406
- [Man] Okay, here, you take

105
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,370
the lollipop off, there you go.

106
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,420
Ollie, the one from Miss Tracey says,

107
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,870
"Hope your Valentine's
Day is Tricera-tops."

108
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,240
So the one from Miss
Tracey also comes with

109
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,050
a little scratcher, so
scratch the purple heart

110
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,500
and it will reveal something.

111
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,220
Does it smell?

112
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,150
Ooh, I think it smells, smell it.

113
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,270
- Oh, smell it.

114
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,420
- What's it smell like?

115
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,170
Ooh, it smells like grape.

116
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:32,231
- [Ollie] I wanna smell it.

117
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,215
- Oh, that smells good.

118
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:34,196
(sniffs)
Smell good?

119
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:35,360
- Mm.

120
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,302
- [Man] Ollie, I found the one from AJ.

121
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:38,135
- Really?

122
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,370
- [Man] Yeah, he got you a PAW Patrol one,

123
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,203
you wanna open it?

124
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,036
- Yeah.

125
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:41,984
- [Man] Okay.

126
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:44,900
(upbeat music)

127
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,445
Ooh, what is it?

128
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:48,000
- A pa-at-true.

129
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,207
- [Man] Oh, it's a puzzle?

130
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:50,080
- Yeah.

131
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,220
- [Man] That is so cool, it
came with a little puzzle.

132
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,225
And you can take it apart and
put it back together again.

133
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:56,058
- Yeah.

134
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:56,891
- That's neat.

135
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,827
So you had a good Valentine's
Day at school, buddy?

136
00:03:58,827 --> 00:03:59,660
- Yeah.

137
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,570
- That's awesome.

138
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,100
Well, I think, while Mama
is taking care of Nacho,

139
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,830
we should leave something
to surprise her with,

140
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,663
what do you think?

141
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,933
Do you wanna set up your
Valentine's Day surprise for Mama?

142
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:09,766
- Yeah.

143
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:10,599
- [Man] Yeah.

144
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,819
He's like, Uh, I'm gonna dig
into this Fun Dip, though.

145
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,919
(Brad laughs)

146
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,170
All right, so the boys are
working on Mama's card,

147
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,916
and they're doing some drawing right now.

148
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,249
- This is gonna be Mama.

149
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,640
- [Man] That's so cool.

150
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,130
Finn, Mama's gonna love that, huh?

151
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,620
Ooh, that's cool.

152
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,070
- That gonna be her mouth.

153
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,040
- [Man] Okay, then her eyes up there?

154
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,873
- [Ollie] Yeah.

155
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:31,680
- [Man] So do two eyes right there, then.

156
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,820
One, two, oh that's a
great picture of Mama,

157
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,210
I think she'll love that.

158
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,860
- [Ollie] Then I'm gonna draw a nose.

159
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,400
- [Man] Nice, you just drew
a nose, that's pretty good.

160
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,980
All right, Missy just got home.

161
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,890
Walk towards the sound of my voice, babe.

162
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,040
The boys have a little surprise for you.

163
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,873
- Okay.

164
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,706
- [Man] Okay, you ready?

165
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,539
- Yeah.

166
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:51,787
- [Man] Come a little closer.

167
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:52,620
(Missy squeals excitedly)

168
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,514
- [Man] A little closer,
little closer and now.

169
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:00,460
- [Both] Happy Valentine's Day.

170
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,045
(Man laughs)

171
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:05,037
- [Man] Happy Valentine's Day.

172
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:05,870
- So cute.

173
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,057
(gasps) That says "Mom"?

174
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:09,890
- [Ollie] Yeah.

175
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,723
- [Missy] Did you write that?

176
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:11,882
- [Ollie] Yeah.

177
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:14,420
- [Man] Yep, that's an "m,"
that is a ginormous "o,"

178
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,900
and then the other little "m"
is inside the "o." (laughs)

179
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,540
- [Missy] Aw, and a big teddy bear?

180
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,373
- And a flower.

181
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:24,360
- Oh cool, it's so cute.

182
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,870
What's the teddy bear's name?

183
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,995
- I wanna name it Cutie.

184
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,721
- Cutie?
(Man laughs)

185
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:32,900
You're much better than
me, 'cause Daddy got me one

186
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,660
when it was my birthday, and he said,

187
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,493
"What do you wanna name it?"

188
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,400
I said, "I don't know yet,"
and that was his name forever.

189
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,520
- And we name it I Don't Know Yet.

190
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,100
Some of you guys who've
been watching our vlogs

191
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,470
for a long, long time know that, huh?

192
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,303
- Yeah.

193
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,220
- [Man] Open your card.

194
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,880
- So this is a big card?

195
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,900
Oh my goodness.

196
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,250
- [Man] The boys worked
really hard on this.

197
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,720
- Okay.

198
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,997
"Happy Valentine's Day."

199
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:57,970
- Open it, open it.

200
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,350
- Okay, okay.
(Brad laughs)

201
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,910
- "Roses are red, violets are blue,

202
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,500
"some cards rhyme, but this one doesn't."

203
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,180
Happy Valentine's Day anyway.

204
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,371
Love, Brad and Ollie, and Finn."

205
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,384
- Mom, that's you, that's you.

206
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,446
- [Missy] (gasps) That's me?

207
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:12,279
- [Ollie] Yeah

208
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,310
- [Missy] I'm ginormous. (laughs)

209
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,240
- [Brad] Looks just like you, right?

210
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,970
- Does it look just like me?

211
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,888
It's so pretty.
(Brad laughs)

212
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:21,880
That's such a good
drawing, Ollie, good job.

213
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,841
- [Brad] Isn't that cool?

214
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,674
- [Missy] This is so cool.

215
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,507
- [Brad] And then they picked out this

216
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:29,507
giant rose to give you, and
I think it's going to become

217
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,410
a sword in our house.

218
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,260
- I needed a giant rose, honestly.

219
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,340
- [Brad] Everyone needs a giant rose.

220
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,173
- And a giant card.

221
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:36,085
- [Brad] I know. (laughs)

222
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:38,230
- And a big bear.

223
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,120
Where's my giant chocolate?

224
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:43,083
- There's no giant chocolate.

225
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:43,916
(Missy laughs)

226
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:44,870
- [Brad] So normally when we get cards,

227
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,700
we should probably put 'em
right here, that looks like

228
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,780
a good spot, you wanna
set the card up there?

229
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,690
- What about above the fireplace?

230
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,410
- [Brad] Oh, that looks
really good right there.

231
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,320
- I mean, it's really
covering stuff, but okay.

232
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,027
- [Brad] It's quite large. (laughs)

233
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,327
- I think the fireplace.

234
00:06:58,327 --> 00:06:59,450
- [Brad] Maybe on the fireplace.

235
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,310
- [Missy] Okay, let's see.

236
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,679
- [Brad] Could always put it up there.

237
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:05,663
- It can go behind this.

238
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:07,240
- [Brad] There we go.

239
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,140
See, that's not obnoxious at all, babe.

240
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,470
- [Missy] No.

241
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,032
- She doesn't like it.

242
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,180
Wouldn't be Valentine's
Day without some chocolate.

243
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,430
Look at these adorable
chocolate mice, you guys.

244
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,770
They have these tails, so all
you do is pick up the tail,

245
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,180
and then the little mice
comes with it. (laughs)

246
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,338
So, lift it up by its tail,
and then put it in your mouth.

247
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:29,359
(laughs) And then pull
the tail, there you go.

248
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,192
(Finn humming)

249
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:31,025
Is it good?

250
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,640
- [Ollie] I wanna try the black one.

251
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,473
- Okay.

252
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:34,920
They are seriously so good, you guys.

253
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,030
Here, you wanna try it?

254
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,320
Ollie's eating a mouse. (laughs)

255
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,153
- Mm.

256
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:41,760
- [Brad] Nice, and then
just take a big bite.

257
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,768
What do you think?

258
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:43,601
- Good.

259
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:45,380
- It's so good, you guys.

260
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,640
I think it's called Burdick's chocolate,

261
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,950
my sister sent it to me, and she's like,

262
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,580
"You have to try these, these
are the most amazing things."

263
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,246
And they have, like,
the cutest little mice.

264
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:55,829
(upbeat music)

265
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,608
- [Brad] Hey boys, you
know who loves lollipops?

266
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:07,441
- What?

267
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:08,319
- [Brad] Squirrels.

268
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,152
- Squirrels?

269
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:10,310
- [Brad] You wanna go see if your squirrel

270
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,670
in your bedroom likes it?

271
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,962
- Yeah.

272
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:15,529
- (gasps) Wow.

273
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,632
- [Brad] What?

274
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:17,954
- Look.

275
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:19,310
- [Missy] (gasps) What is that?

276
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,700
- [Brad] Ollie and Finn's
squirrel has something,

277
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,800
it's like a card.

278
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,210
Do you think if I give him the lollipop,

279
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,543
he'll give me the envelope?

280
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:26,376
- Yeah.

281
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:27,209
- [Brad] Here, let's see.

282
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:30,370
Okay, squirrel, I'm just
gonna distract you over here,

283
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,083
look at the lollipop, look
at the lollipop, oh, oh.

284
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:32,916
- [Missy] Got it.

285
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:33,750
- [Brad] You got it, okay, you got it.

286
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,582
What is it?

287
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,339
- A note, it says, "Ollie and Finn."

288
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,655
- [Brad] I think we should open it, huh?

289
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:38,488
- Yeah.

290
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:39,322
- [Brad] Do you think this could be,

291
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,823
like, a clue or something?

292
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:41,655
- Yeah.

293
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,501
- [Brad] Well, let's open it and see.

294
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,334
- [Missy] Let's see what it says.

295
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:45,260
- [Brad] Whoa, there's a card in there?

296
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,461
Ooh, what's it say,
let's have mama read it.

297
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,540
- It says, "If you're tweet
like me, follow back."

298
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,190
"Your Valentine's quest has begun,

299
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,080
"and we're excited for
you to have lots of fun."

300
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,913
- [Brad] (gasps) Ooh.

301
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:58,110
- [Missy] "Valentine's Day can be sappy."

302
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,476
"Your first clue is next to the nappies."

303
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,344
- [Brad] What, a clue?

304
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,950
- [Missy] Your first clue.

305
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,020
- Clues.

306
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,950
Does that mean this is, like,

307
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,050
a Valentine's Day treasure hunt, guys?

308
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,883
- Oh, yeah.

309
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,308
- [Brad] Do you guys wanna
go on a treasure hunt?

310
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,141
- Yeah.

311
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:13,974
- Okay, so it says the first

312
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:16,590
clue is near the nappies, do
you know what nappies are?

313
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,423
- Yeah.

314
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,256
- [Brad] What are nappies?

315
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:22,380
- Nappies is another word for diapers.

316
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,050
- It's actually what they call diapers

317
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,800
in England, in Britain.

318
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,400
- So it says your first
clue is next to the nappies.

319
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,650
- So, should we go look for diapers,

320
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,276
and see if we see another clue?

321
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:35,109
- [Ollie] Yeah.

322
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:36,000
- Well, where do we keep the diapers?

323
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,603
Finn, where are your diapers at?

324
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:38,564
- [Missy] Where's the diapers.

325
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:40,220
- Next to the TV.

326
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,053
- [Brad] Yeah.

327
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:46,053
- I think the squirrel just
spit the food out of its face.

328
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,510
- [Brad] Maybe.

329
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,343
Open the cupboard, Finn,

330
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:51,214
this is where we keep all his
diapers, pull out the drawer.

331
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:52,047
(dog barking)

332
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:52,880
What's in there?

333
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,890
Oh, a clue.

334
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,360
Uh, boys, I think we got
a situation on our hands.

335
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,530
This one says "Clue
number one," do you think

336
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,033
it leads to multiple clues?

337
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,120
- [Ollie] Yeah.

338
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,953
- How Brady clues are there?

339
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:06,726
- [Brad] Finn is tearing open the clue.

340
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:08,170
(Finn yells)

341
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,241
- [Brad] What's in there?

342
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,000
(Finn vocalizes)

343
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,248
- [Brad] Is that you?

344
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,081
Oh, and cookies.

345
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,040
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, cookies.

346
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,464
- [Brad] You guys each get a cookie?

347
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:17,640
- I don't need one.

348
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,950
- [Brad] You don't want one? Okay.

349
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,680
- [Missy] All right, it says,
"You're a rawrsome valentine."

350
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:25,378
- [Brad] That is so cute,

351
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:28,220
that's Finn in a dinosaur costume.

352
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,210
- [Missy] So cute, let's see.

353
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,043
- [Brad] What's it say?

354
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,120
- [Missy] "Congrats on
finding your first clue."

355
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,810
"You almost missed it."

356
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,634
"Clue number two is hiding
with the biscuits." (gasps)

357
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:39,467
- Biscuits?

358
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:40,300
- [Brad] Do you guys
know what biscuits are?

359
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,660
Where do you think the biscuits are?

360
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,603
- I don't know.

361
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:47,070
- So, Ollie, biscuits is another
word they use in England,

362
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,731
and that's what they call
cookies, did you know that?

363
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,564
- [Ollie] Yeah.

364
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:53,310
- [Brad] Maybe we should go
look where the cookies are.

365
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,143
Should we?

366
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:54,976
- [Ollie] Yeah.

367
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:55,947
- [Missy] Let's go look.

368
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,256
- [Brad] And there was
cookies in there, you know?

369
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,140
- [Ollie] Yeah.

370
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,940
- [Brad] Finn's like, "Oh
yeah, I get two Oreos."

371
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,773
Okay, let's go look.

372
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,420
I think cookies are
usually in the pantry, huh?

373
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,580
Here, I'll get this
child-safe lock, there we go.

374
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:07,700
- [Missy] Can you see
any cookies, any clues?

375
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,663
- [Brad] Let us know
if you guys see a clue.

376
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,060
- [Finn] Oh, there it is.

377
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,310
- [Brad] What'd you find?

378
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,461
What is it?

379
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:16,294
- Card.

380
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:17,605
- [Brad] Ooh, it's another clue?

381
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:18,438
- Yeah.

382
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:19,271
- [Missy] Ooh.

383
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,310
- [Brad] That one says, "Clue number two,"

384
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,612
should we open it, boys?

385
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:23,445
- Yeah.

386
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:24,690
- This is so cool.

387
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,538
Have you guys ever been on a
Valentine's Day treasure hunt?

388
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:28,371
- No.

389
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,790
- [Brad] No, we haven't, huh?

390
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,210
So let's see what this clue says.

391
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,780
Ooh, that's a picture of you, huh?

392
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,100
- All right, your next clue
says, "Aren't cookies the best?

393
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,110
Take a bite and start to think.

394
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,110
Clue number three is ice-cold
with all the fizzy drinks."

395
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:47,960
Hmm.

396
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,950
- [Brad] Ooh.

397
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,360
- Clue number three, all the fizzy drinks.

398
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,690
And it's gotta be ice-cold.

399
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,060
- [Brad] Hey, hey Finn, do you know

400
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,396
where all the drinks are?

401
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,229
- Yeah.

402
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,062
- [Brad] Where?

403
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:57,895
(Finn hums)

404
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:58,779
- The refrigerator?

405
00:11:58,779 --> 00:11:59,920
- I think he doesn't know.
- Yeah?

406
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,753
- [Brad] Should we go find 'em?

407
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,960
- [Ollie] Yeah.
- [Brad] Let's go see.

408
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,793
(Finn grunting)

409
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:04,935
- [Ollie] Nope, they're not in there.

410
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,376
- [Missy] Nope, that one?

411
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,282
- [Brad] I don't know, it
seems like too cold for drinks.

412
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:10,650
- [Missy] Fizzy drinks, maybe in this one?

413
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,570
- [Brad] Where does Daddy
get his drinks from, boys?

414
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,731
- From here.

415
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:15,703
- [Finn] There it is, right there.

416
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,608
- [Brad] Oh, Finn found it again.

417
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,160
- [Missy] Awesome job, Finn.

418
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,750
- [Brad] Good job, dude.

419
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,583
- [Missy] Do you wanna open it up?

420
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,196
- [Ollie] He (mumbles) me.

421
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:25,190
(Brad laughs)

422
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,603
- [Brad] Is it cold, Finn?

423
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:27,436
- Yeah.

424
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,552
- [Brad] Yeah, 'cause it
was in the fridge, huh?

425
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:30,385
(Finn vocalizing)

426
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:31,218
- Oh yeah, it is cold,

427
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,824
feel it, feel it guys.

428
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:33,721
- [Missy] Wow it's very cold.

429
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:34,938
- Dada, feel it.

430
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:35,938
- [Brad] I know, it's cold.

431
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:36,870
(Finn vocalizing)

432
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,290
- [Missy] Do you want
me to read it to you?

433
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,170
- No.

434
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,500
- [Brad] He's got it.

435
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,800
(Finn vocalizing)

436
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,670
This is clue number
three, are you boys ready?

437
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,503
- Yeah.

438
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:48,336
- [Brad] All right, Mama, read it.

439
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:51,700
- It says, "You guys
work so well together."

440
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,490
"Let's go outside and
play in the weather."

441
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,490
"Put on your wellies, and
don't forget your socks."

442
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,600
"Remember on Valentine's Day, love rocks."

443
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,720
- Whoa, that's a long clue, huh?

444
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,660
First it says, "Put on your wellies."

445
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,680
- [Missy] What's a wellie?

446
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,564
- [Brad] Do you guys
know what wellies are?

447
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:12,397
- No.

448
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:16,995
- So wellies are actually a
type of rain boot from England.

449
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:17,828
- [Ollie] Rain boot?

450
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:19,846
- That's what they call their
boots, did you know that?

451
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:21,483
- Is that a rainbow?

452
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:22,515
(Finn vocalizing)

453
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:23,348
- No, rain boots.

454
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:24,720
I think you guys should put on your boots

455
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,287
and we should head outside, okay?

456
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,120
- [Ollie] Yeah.

457
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,610
- It also says "love rocks,"

458
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,240
so maybe we gotta find some rocks.

459
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,880
- It also has a clue too.

460
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,344
- [Brad] Probably by the rocks, huh?

461
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:34,177
- Yeah.

462
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:35,463
- [Brad] All right, let's
put our shoes on, boys.

463
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:36,296
- [Ollie] Yeah.

464
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:38,280
(upbeat music)

465
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,130
- [Brad] Hey Finn, while
you're getting your shoes on,

466
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,290
what do you think is in this treasure box?

467
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,954
Do you thin there's lots of gold?

468
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:44,787
- Yeah.

469
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:46,940
- And I think there's lots of gems.

470
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,773
- [Brad] Gems?

471
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:48,606
- Yeah.

472
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:49,560
- [Brad] Ooh.

473
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,393
- And necklaces.

474
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:52,280
- [Brad] Yeah, we need to go look, huh?

475
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,150
- Yep.

476
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,870
- [Brad] All right guys,
we gotta find some rocks.

477
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,752
Do you know where any rocks are, babe?

478
00:13:57,752 --> 00:13:58,930
- Um.

479
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,970
- [Brad] We might be able to find some.

480
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,760
- [Missy] Yeah, Ollie, do
you know where rocks are?

481
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,765
- [Brad] What, Finn?

482
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:03,598
(Finn vocalizing)

483
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:04,798
There's rocks over there?

484
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:05,631
- [Finn] Yeah.

485
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:07,390
Ooh maybe there's a clue, go look boys.

486
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,550
(upbeat music)

487
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,880
Oh that's right, we do have

488
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,430
these rocks on our property.

489
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,930
- Look at all the giant rocks.

490
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:16,734
- [Brad] What do you see?

491
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,680
- [Missy] What is it?

492
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,030
- [Brad] Is that marmalade?

493
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,414
What?

494
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:23,247
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

495
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,520
- [Brad] Why is there
marmalade out here, Ollie?

496
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,470
- I don't know.

497
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,856
- [Brad] Oh, and a clue.

498
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:27,689
- Yeah.

499
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,340
- [Brad] A clue, grab it Ollie.

500
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,766
That is so exciting.

501
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:31,599
- [Missy] Wow.

502
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,870
- "Clue number four."

503
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,180
Here, let's open the clue
and see what it says.

504
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,090
It says, "Ooh, marmalade,
what a special treat."

505
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,380
"Does it remind you of a
bear you'd like to meet?"

506
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,593
Do bears eat marmalade?

507
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:43,426
- Yeah.

508
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,510
- Oh, what bear eats marmalade?

509
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,442
- Paddington.

510
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,556
- Oh, that's right, he does.

511
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,530
- [Missy] Oh, and where's Paddington from?

512
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,982
- Um, the movie.

513
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:51,910
(laughing))

514
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,220
- So it says, "To find your last clue,

515
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,440
"you must zip through the trees."

516
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,509
"When you finally land,
look through the leaves."

517
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:00,342
- Okay.

518
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:01,175
- [Missy] Hmm.

519
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:02,008
- What does that mean?

520
00:15:02,008 --> 00:15:02,841
- [Missy] How do we zip through the trees?

521
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:04,990
- So where should we go
to zip through the trees?

522
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,870
- I don't know.

523
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,200
- You can't think of anywhere
at our house where we can zip?

524
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,360
- Yeah.
- Where?

525
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,170
- Zip line.
- Zip line.

526
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,175
Should we go on the zip line?

527
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,008
- [Missy] Should we go to the zip line?

528
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:14,950
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's check the zip,

529
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,510
do we need the marmalade for anything?

530
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,343
- Yeah.

531
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:18,676
- Should we maybe have
some toast or something?

532
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:19,910
(Missy laughs)

533
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,690
Ollie really wants to try the marmalade.

534
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,270
He's trying to open,
oh no, all you gotta do

535
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,862
is turn it buddy, it's a little hard.

536
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:26,915
- [Brad] There's you go.
- [Missy] There you go.

537
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:27,748
(sniffs)

538
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:28,750
- [Brad] What's it smell like?

539
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,120
- Smells, smells not good.

540
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,243
- [Missy] How's it taste?

541
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:34,076
- Good.

542
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:34,909
- [Brad] Yeah?

543
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:35,742
- [Ollie] Yeah.

544
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:36,690
- [Brad] So that's what Paddington likes?

545
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,523
- Yeah.

546
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:38,440
- [Brad] Wow.
- [Missy] Wow.

547
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,081
- Finn, you like Paddington, huh?

548
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:40,914
- Yeah.

549
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:42,471
- Did you know Paddington loves marmalade?

550
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,390
- Yeah.

551
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,800
- Yeah, you wanna try it? No?

552
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,577
Do you know where Paddington is from?

553
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:47,480
- Yeah.

554
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,839
- He's from London, right?

555
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:49,672
- Yeah.

556
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:50,505
- [Ollie] Yeah, London.

557
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:51,338
- Yeah London.

558
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,010
That's probably why all
these messages have had,

559
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,850
little British words and stuff, huh?

560
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,874
- [Ollie] Yeah.

561
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:56,707
(Finn vocalizing)

562
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,900
- Okay, well let's go
and see if we can zip

563
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,910
through some trees somewhere.

564
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,785
Do you know anywhere on our
property where we can do that?

565
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:02,618
- Yeah, zip line.

566
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,320
- [Brad] Let's go to that zip line, okay?

567
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,750
- Yeah, to our zip line.

568
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,340
- Come on, boys.

569
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,460
We are headed to go
find the very last clue,

570
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,680
to zip through the
trees, and hopefully find

571
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,770
a Valentine's Day treasure box, huh?

572
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,485
Do you see any clues from here?

573
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,318
- No.

574
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:20,151
- Maybe we should head down there.

575
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,790
It seems like when we
do what the clue says,

576
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,267
we can find the next clue,
that's pretty cool, huh?

577
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,100
- [Ollie] Yeah.

578
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,933
- Yeah.

579
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:28,961
Okay, so who wants to
zip line first? Finn?

580
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:29,794
- Yeah.

581
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:32,070
- [Brad] Okay, Finn will zip
line and then you will, okay?

582
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,903
- Okay.

583
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:35,010
- All right, I am waiting
at the end of the zip line,

584
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,070
and I think Finn is going first.

585
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,970
Here comes Finny.

586
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,000
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, I caught you.

587
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,171
Hey, buddy.

588
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,004
- Hey.

589
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,837
- [Brad] What that fun?

590
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:46,670
- Yeah.

591
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,503
- All right, grab the rope, and then go

592
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:48,580
bring it back to Ollie, okay?

593
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,430
There you go, go, go, go, go, go. (laughs)

594
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,040
And here comes Ollie.

595
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:59,803
(Ollie yells)

596
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,300
Woohoo, I caught you.

597
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,400
All right guys, now that we're
at the end of the zip line,

598
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,430
we gotta find some leaves, Finn.

599
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,910
Ollie, do you see any leaves?

600
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,710
What's that?

601
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,763
A clue.

602
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,752
- [Missy] A clue.

603
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:15,019
- I found the last clue.

604
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,270
- [Brad] Yes, we only
have one more clue left,

605
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,403
open it up, Ollie.

606
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,236
- Okay.

607
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,900
- [Brad] You guys ready to go
find some treasure? (laughs)

608
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,180
Ooh, what are those, Ollie?

609
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,184
- Keys.

610
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:26,770
- [Missy] Ooh, okay,
let's see what it says.

611
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,380
"You found the keys, I knew you would."

612
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,340
"Hopping on some wheels
will do you some good."

613
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,400
"You're such good boys,
the greatest of blokes."

614
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,426
"The treasure you seek
is hidden under the oak."

615
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,259
- Oak?

616
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,240
- Do you know what an oak is?

617
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,073
- No.

618
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:44,250
- So, we have oak trees on our property.

619
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,350
- Is that an oak tree?

620
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,346
- Nope, not that one.

621
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:48,337
- [Brad] I think it's
the biggest tree, dude.

622
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:50,260
- We gotta go find the biggest oak tree.

623
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,680
- [Brad] And it said
to hop on some wheels,

624
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,578
so maybe we should just
hop in this Polaris, right?

625
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:54,411
- Yeah.

626
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:55,244
- [Brad] All right, you got the key?

627
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:56,077
- Yep.

628
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:56,910
- [Brad] Okay, hang onto the key,

629
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,720
let's hop onto the Polaris.

630
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,815
Are you ready, Finn?

631
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:00,648
- Yeah.

632
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:01,674
- [Brad] You gonna ride
back here with the dogs?

633
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:02,507
- Yeah

634
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:03,340
(Brad laughs)

635
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,776
- [Missy] All right,
boys are all loaded up.

636
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,711
- [Brad] Yep, we got the door shut.

637
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,360
We got seat belts on.

638
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,300
- [Missy] Yep.

639
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,110
Dogs are ready.

640
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,760
- Gonna go see if we can find
some treasure, right boys?

641
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,980
- Yeah.
- [Finn] Yeah.

642
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,070
- [Missy] And you got your key?

643
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,903
- Yep.

644
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:16,949
- [Missy] Okay, let's go.

645
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,180
(engine starts)

646
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,191
- [Brad] Alright.

647
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:20,024
- Here we go.

648
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:20,857
- Here we go guys.

649
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:22,867
Should we head to the great
oak tree on our property?

650
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:23,700
- [Ollie] Yep.

651
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,533
- Yeah.

652
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:25,620
- Okay, I hope the treasure's there.

653
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,470
- [Ollie] Me too.

654
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:28,168
- [Finn] Yeah.

655
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,462
- Is that an oak tree right there?

656
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:30,580
I think that is it.

657
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,413
- I think that big one is.

658
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:32,673
That's our big old oak tree.

659
00:18:32,673 --> 00:18:35,256
(lively music)

660
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,130
We're getting close.

661
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,330
I think we can park right here

662
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,860
and then we got to check under this tree.

663
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,359
That was a fun ride huh?

664
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,890
- [Ollie] Yeah.

665
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,940
- There we go.

666
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,570
This is the big oak tree.

667
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,010
We should go look under it huh?

668
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,970
See if we see anything.

669
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,850
Wow, it's messy down here.

670
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,848
- There's a treasure box, look behind you.

671
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:58,681
- [Brad] What?

672
00:18:58,681 --> 00:18:59,531
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

673
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:00,779
- Look right there.

674
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,110
- [Brad] What? Oh,
there is a treasure box.

675
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,330
That is so cool.

676
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:07,620
- [Missy] Open it.

677
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,790
- [Brad] Let's take it back to the house

678
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,170
and then open it okay?

679
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,323
Does that key fit?

680
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:12,156
- Yeah.

681
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:13,230
- [Brad] Okay, let's take it back

682
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,063
to the house and open it okay?

683
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:14,896
- Okay.

684
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:16,348
- [Missy] You want to carry it?

685
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,460
- [Ollie] Yeah.
- [Brad] Grab a handle boys.

686
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,990
Come on Finn, let's climb up.

687
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:21,710
- [Ollie] Isn't it a cool treasure box?

688
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,670
- [Brad] I know.

689
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,200
I could not believe we
found a treasure box.

690
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,350
We're gonna have to take this back

691
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,274
up to the house, see if we
can open that old lock huh?

692
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:30,480
(Finn jabbers)

693
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,490
Are you so excited?

694
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,320
I can't believe we
found treasure you guys.

695
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,490
We found an actual treasure box.

696
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,609
Look at this thing.

697
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,893
It's so detailed and nice.

698
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:42,310
(slow music)

699
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,201
Alright Ollie, do you know what to do?

700
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:48,034
- [Ollie] Yeah.

701
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:48,867
- [Finn] The key.

702
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:49,700
- [Brad] You put the
key in and now turn it.

703
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,102
Other way maybe? Try the other way.

704
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,620
(gasps) It came undone.

705
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,534
Are you ready?

706
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:55,367
- Yeah.

707
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:56,200
- [Brad] Open it up.

708
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,033
- Wow.

709
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040

730
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,794

731
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:46,627

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,125
Was that so fun boys?

736

- [Missy] Ohh, what's that.

744
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,500
- [Brad] Ohh, chocolate.

745
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,747
I didn't know it came with a little spoon.

746
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,378
- [Missy] I know, I didn't either.

747
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:11,702
Look Finn.

748
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,770
- [Brad] Oh then it's got
a little build toy to do.

749
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,500
- [Missy] You get to put together a toy.

750
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,670
- [Brad] So one side is
candy and one side is a toy?

751
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,503
- [Finn] Yeah.

752
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:20,520
- [Brad] Oh that's so fun.

753
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,603
I'm not really sure what
that stuff is. (laughs)

754
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:24,770
- [Missy] It's chocolate?

755
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,903
- [Brad] It's some sort
of creamy, sweet stuff.

756
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:27,772
- [Missy] You want to try it?

757
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:30,891
(lively music)

758

- Mmm, it actually tastes
like, I don't know.

759
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,260
That is the weirdest flavor.

760
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,094
It's sweet, it's yummy, it's not bad.

761
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:41,230
Do you guys know what that is?

some gems in your backpack?

780
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:23,419
