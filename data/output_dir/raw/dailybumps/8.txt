1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,971
- I actually have something cool

2
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:03,404
that I've been working on with Papa.

3
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:07,149
- [Missy] Boys have their swimsuits on.

4
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:09,920
- It actually looks like
there's four walls of bubbles

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,936
that you can swim and play through.

6
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,727
Ollie what do you think?

7
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:15,560
- [Oliver] Good.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,393
- [Bryan] Is it cool?

9
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:17,226
- [Oliver] Yeah.

10
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,892
- [Bryan] There's so many bubbles, huh?

22
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:40,165
- Good morning guys.

23
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,822
And welcome to a B-E-A-utiful day

24
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:45,066
here in sunny southern California.

25
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:45,899
That's right,

26
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,029
today is beautiful and sunny
and perfect and blue skies

27
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:51,556
and its going to be our last
day like this for a while,

28
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:55,674
because apparently the
forecast this week is all rain,

29
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:56,555
and cold,

30
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,630
but,

31
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,157
we ain't about that today.

32
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:01,110
We are going to enjoy this sun.

33
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,783
A couple days ago I asked
you guys to thumbs up

34
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:05,266
the video if you thought we
should do a pool video soon,

35
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,469
and we got so many thumbs up,

36
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:08,934
I think it's finally time.

37
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,157
I think we need to jump in the pool.

38
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:11,628
We've been heating it,

39
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:15,350
so it's like a very comfortable,
like 85, 90 degrees.

40
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,815
And I actually have something cool

41
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,038
that I've been working on with Papa,

42
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:20,120
that I am going to surprise the boys with.

43
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,317
Let's go see what Ollie's
up to and, uh, show him it.

44
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:24,150
- Good morning.

45
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,292
- Good morning dude!

46
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:26,472
You excited to go swimming?

47
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:27,364
- Yeah.

48
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:28,221
- Yes?

49
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,054
How's the water feel?

50
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,012
- Good. Feel it.

51
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:31,113
- [Bryan] Does it feel warm?

52
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:32,986
Ooo it's so warm you guys.

53
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:35,474
Well Ollie, I thought it
would be a perfect day

54
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:37,396
to go swimming and show you something

55
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:40,249
that Papa and I have been working on.

56
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,999
It's our bubble fort.

57
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:44,442
Which it doesn't look like much,

58
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:45,337
not in the water, does it?

59
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:46,170
- No.

60
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,003
(Bryan laughs)

61
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:47,836
Gotta add air.

62
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:48,669
- [Bryan] You guys will see,

63
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:49,502
but we have a cool plan.

64
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:50,349
- It looks like the Christmas cage.

65
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,573
- [Bryan] It kinda does, huh?

66
00:01:51,573 --> 00:01:53,080
But it's red.

67
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,181
- We almost got it done.

68
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,485
We wanna strap this one down.

69
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:56,318
You got this one Ollie?

70
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:57,766
- [Bryan] Gotta put a couple
more zip ties on here?

71
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:58,933
- [Papa] Yeah.

72
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:00,648
- [Bryan] There you go.

73
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:01,663
- [Papa] And that will
hole the bubbles in place.

74
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,496
(Bryan laughs)

75
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:03,495
- So what we got going on here,

76
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:05,247
is basically a big red cage,

77
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:06,917
that we are going to put in the pool.

78
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,995
As you guys know, Ollie
is an amazing swimmer.

79
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,071
He's been swimming since
he was six months old.

80
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,966
He's been in swim school.

81
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,656
He loves diving, and swimming,
and being underwater.

82
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,489
So we thought this would
be something really great

83
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,687
to incentivize him to practice his diving.

84
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:21,132
So we're going to put this
in the bottom of the pool,

85
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:23,294
and then Papa tell us what
we got going on down here.

86
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:26,184
- Well these are air
bubbles every four inches.

87
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:27,324
They'll come up.

88
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:28,421
We hook an air line to it.

89
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:31,799
And so there'll be a bubble fortress.

90
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:32,632
- [Bryan] Yes.

91
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:34,815
So, Papa attached this to it.

92
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:38,404
This hooks up to the air
compressor line in the garage.

93
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:39,832
And then it basically
pumps air through it,

94
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:42,442
and we're gonna have bubbles
come all around this.

95
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:44,827
And it's gonna look so cool in the water.

96
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:45,924
We've been working on this for a while,

97
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:46,819
trying to get it perfect.

98
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,039
And this is version two.

99
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,996
And I think it is gonna be perfect.

100
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:51,176
Are you excited Ollie?

101
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,009
- Yeah.

102
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,415
- [Bryan] Swim through a
big ol' bubble fortress?

103
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:54,964
Are you looking for more zip ties?

104
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:55,797
Here you go.

105
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:56,759
- [Papa] I think it's pretty good.

106
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,900
- [Bryan] Yeah you can
put one over here dude.

107
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,233
Although maybe right here.

108
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,399
This one's a little
loose right here Ollie.

109
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,812
There we go.

110
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:04,349
Perfect.

111
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,182
Then we don't gotta worry about

112
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:06,550
this thing falling apart
in the water, right?

113
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,403
- Yeah.

114
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:08,940
- [Bryan] Did we do it?

115
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,773
- Yep.

116
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,934
So it's time for bubble fort.

117
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:12,912
- [Bryan] Yeah dude.

118
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:14,012
It's gonna be so cool.

119
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:14,845
- Yeah.

120
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:15,703
(Bryan laughing)

121
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:16,536
- [Bryan] All right.

122
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:19,257
This is the air compressor
from the garage.

123
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:22,066
We normally use this to
fill up balls or bike tires.

124
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:24,960
I don't think we've ever
used it for the pool.

125
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,793
(laughs)

126
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:28,019
(air compressor running)

127
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,527
Got the compressor going.

128
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:32,444
(electronic music)

129
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,110
Can you feel the air Ollie?

130
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,259
- Yeah.

131
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,092
- [Bryan] All right.

132
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,259
Making sure we got all the holes open.

133
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,741
If you guys are new to our channel,

134
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:48,451
and you did not see the
process of remodeling our pool,

135
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:50,405
we actually did this last year.

136
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,605
We've had this pool for about a year now.

137
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:54,398
I've going to have the video
linked in the icard though,

138
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:55,701
so you can check it out the first day

139
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:56,718
we actually filled it up.

140
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:57,654
It was so much fun.

141
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,486
And we are definitely
gonna have a ton of fun

142
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:00,952
with this pool this summer.

143
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:03,512
- [Missy] Boys have their swimsuits on.

144
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:05,919
You guys look so cute.

145
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,667
Are you guys excited to go swim?

146
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,970
- With CJ and Billy?

147
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,521
- [Missy] Oh, are CJ and Billy
going to come over later?

148
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:12,762
These boys are so excited
to get in the pool.

149
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:14,715
And I am excited to go with you.

150
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:16,423
I am so excited to see you guys swim.

151
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,113
You're gonna look so cute.

152
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:21,535
- [Bryan] All right boys.

153
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:25,494
Let's turn on the slide and the waterfall,

154
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:26,919
so we can get this pool moving.

155
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,852
Okay?

156
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,225
(boys cheering excitedly)

157
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:32,916
(electro pop music)

158
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,179
Ollie what are you doing?

159
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:35,360
- I'm the life guard.

160
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,866
- [Bryan] And what does the life guard do?

161
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:40,048
- He swims in the pool and saves people.

162
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:41,473
- [Bryan] And you can do that, huh?

163
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,306
- Yeah.

164
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:43,139
- All right Finnie,

165
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:43,972
are you ready to go down the slide?

166
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:44,849
- Yeah.

167
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:47,817
- [Bryan] All right, let's
see your slide skills.

168
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,427
You got it dude.

169
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:50,760
Wee-hee-hee-hee!

170
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:52,745
Yeah!

171
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,783
That kid is a pro.

172
00:04:54,783 --> 00:04:56,148
(Bryan laughs)

173
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:57,987
These boys love a good pool.

174
00:04:57,987 --> 00:05:00,987
(electro pop music)

175
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,138
Watch this you guys,

176
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:06,858
Finn can climb out of
the pool all on his own.

177
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:07,691
So good.

178
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:10,108
Learned that from swim class.

179
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,032
All right.

180
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,334
We are putting the bubble fortress up here

181
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,167
in the shallow end,

182
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,551
so that Finn can play with the bubbles

183
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:20,895
for a little bit.

184
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,281
See what he thinks of them.

185
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,114
All right Finn!

186
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:23,989
Papa is scooping you up.

187
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:24,822
(Bryan laughs)

188
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:26,150
- Bubbles!

189
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,721
- [Bryan] Look at all these bubbles!

190
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,007
It's like a jacuzzi in the pool, huh Finn?

191
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,840
- Yeah.

192
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,619
- [Bryan] Yeah, what do you think?

193
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:36,869
(rhythmic dance music)

194
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,278
Is that pretty cool? (laughs)

195
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:48,111
Look it,

196
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:48,944
we got the bubbles all going down.

197
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:49,777
How's it look?

198
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:50,610
It look good?

199
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,443
- Looks pretty good.

200
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:52,276
- [Bryan] Okay.

201
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,084
Okay, the bubble fort looks so good.

202
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,490
It actually looks like
there's four walls of bubbles,

203
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,526
that you can just swim and play through.

204
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:01,379
This is gonna be so cool you guys.

205
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,317
I can't believe it worked!

206
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:03,740
- I can't either. (laughs)

207
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,374
My first design did not work.

208
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:06,207
- [Bryan] No. (laughs)

209
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,040
- Me and you worked on it,

210
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,355
and now it's working.

211
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:09,293
- Practice makes perfect.

212
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:10,126
All right.

213
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:12,188
So we have our underwater bubble fort in

214
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,898
the shallower part of the water.

215
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:15,365
It's not in the deep end yet.

216
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,852
It's a little not level,
but I think it will be okay.

217
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:19,327
Let's see how it looks.

218
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:22,827
(electro pop dance music)

219
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:38,626
- Ollie what do you think?

220
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:39,459
- Good.

221
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:40,292
- Is it cool?

222
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,125
- Yeah.

223
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:41,958
- There's so many bubbles, huh?

224
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:42,791
- Yeah.

225
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,624
- And you can swim right through it?

226
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:45,021
- Yeah.

227
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,521
(electro pop dance music)

228
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:45,918
- All right.

229
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:46,751
Ollie and I are gonna swim
through the underwater

230
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,325
bubble fort together.

231
00:07:48,325 --> 00:07:49,158
Hang on tight, okay?

232
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:49,991
Okay.

233
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,366
- We did it.

234
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:01,866
(electro pop dance music)

235
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:07,372
- All right, so they are now moving

236
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:10,112
the bubble fort to the deep end,

237
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:11,489
and we're gonna see how it looks.

238
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,645
Looks cool from up here.

239
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:17,145
(electro pop dance music)

240
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,666
These are some of the craziest
things that we come up with.

241
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,515
And, how cool is it that we have a Papa,

242
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:35,900
that can just literally rig up anything.

243
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,775
(laughs)

244
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:37,608
How is it?

245
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:38,442
- So cool.

246
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,275
(Missy cheers)

247
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,107
It looks like a little
under water fortress.

248
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:40,940
It really does.

249
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:41,774
- [Missy] That's so cool.

250
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:43,357
- It's got like four walls.

251
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,190
- [Missy] Yeah.

252
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,721
I love the bubble idea.

253
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:47,189
I just think that's so cool.

254
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:48,413
- [Bryan] All right Ollie,

255
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:49,246
who do you got?

256
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:50,079
- Hulk.

257
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,390
- [Bryan] And where is he gonna be?

258
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,981
- He's gonna be right there.

259
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:53,814
- [Bryan] In the bubble fort?

260
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:54,647
- Yeah.

261
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,480
- [Bryan] All right, throw him in.

262
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:04,908
- [Missy] You gonna go get Hulk?

263
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:05,741
- Yeah.

264
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:06,574
- [Missy] The bottom of the pool?

265
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:07,407
- Yeah.

266
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:08,240
- [Missy] All right.

267
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,740
(electro pop dance music)

268
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:24,878
- You saved him.

269
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:25,973
He's okay.

270
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:27,823
(Olive roars)

271
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:28,719
(laughs)

272
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,523
Ollie is seriously the most amazing diver.

273
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:32,440
It's the coolest thing to see.

274
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,112
Is that your favorite thing
to do in the pool Ollie?

275
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:34,945
Is dive?

276
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:35,778
- Yeah.

277
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:40,574
(rhythmic synth beat)

278
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:49,305
I'm gonna jump in the middle of the fort.

279
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,479
(Missy cheers)

280
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:54,979
(electro pop dance music)

281
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,276
- That was seriously so much fun.

282
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:09,071
And if you guys wanna
watch more underwater fun,

283
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,821
I'm going to have a video,

284
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:12,249
that our friends Carl and Ginger did,

285
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,225
linked in the I-card.

286
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:15,914
They also did an amazing
underwater box fort.

287
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,097
That was super cool.

288
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:18,525
So, definitely go check
out their video too.

289
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:21,011
And I'm just so excited
we're in the pool again,

290
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:24,731
because that means that
fun times are to be had.

291
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:27,479
But also I'm just like really
excited for summer time,

292
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,802
and warmth, and sun,

293
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:31,368
and I wanna hangout outside in the sun,

294
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:32,343
and get tan.

295
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:33,603
I got a little tan in Hawaii,

296
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:35,110
but it's already starting to fade,

297
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,046
which is really sad.

298
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,277
Because I feel like we're
just cooped up inside.

299
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:39,110
But yeah.

300
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,487
This is like the last of the warms days,

301
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,237
so we're going to enjoy this day,

302
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:45,125
and brace ourselves for the
cold and rain this week.

303
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,539
(blows raspberry)

304
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:49,314
(laughter)

305
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:50,147
(blows raspberry)

306
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:52,434
(laughter)

307
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,567
- [Missy] Is he blowing raspberries?

308
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,400
- Yeah!

309
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,256
- We have had such a fun day swimming.

310
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,131
I actually made it up to the barn.

311
00:10:58,131 --> 00:10:59,311
I didn't take the camera,

312
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,392
but I wanted to give you
a little update on Nacho.

313
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:02,493
If you guys don't know,

314
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:03,797
I've been kind of talking about it,

315
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,321
and I can link up a couple
vlogs you can watch,

316
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,380
if you want more information.

317
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,272
But, Nacho seems to be doing better.

318
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:11,373
We lunged him today,

319
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:14,513
and he's definitely not as sore.

320
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:15,984
It doesn't seem like he's limping.

321
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:18,034
And he's looking really good.

322
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:21,451
I am kind of sure that the abcess popped.

323
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:23,827
I kind of say some pus,

324
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:25,580
and a little bit of like something.

325
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,695
But, it's that I'm not a hundred percent,

326
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,692
so I'm probably going to
have a farrier come out,

327
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:30,790
pretty soon here,

328
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,928
and just kind of like look it over,

329
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:33,108
and give me like an update.

330
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:34,331
And make sure that it's nothing else

331
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:35,310
that it could have been,

332
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,862
like either his leg is sore,

333
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,842
or his back is sore,

334
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:38,740
or something like that.

335
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,690
I actually have a few other
appointments set up for him.

336
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,401
Like a massage therapist.

337
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,558
I had no idea you could
get a massage therapist

338
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:45,391
for your horse,

339
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:46,224
but I am looking forward to that.

340
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:47,652
And a chiropractor,

341
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:49,854
which might be really,
really awesome for him.

342
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:50,997
They do a little adjustment and

343
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:53,034
help so that if he is sore,

344
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,681
it kind of helps things
get back into alignment.

345
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,269
So I think he is on the mend.

346
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,936
He's definitely not a
hundred percent yet though,

347
00:11:58,936 --> 00:11:59,997
so I'm hoping,

348
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,118
with a little bit more rest,

349
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,785
and kind of just taking care of him,

350
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:05,563
he'll be better soon.

351
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:06,396
Uhhhh, boys?

352
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:09,195
I think you have a lot
of cleaning up to do.

353
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,231
(laughs) Did you guys
have a fun day today?

354
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,064
- Yeah

355
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,633
- [Missy] Swimming, and
playing, and having a blast?

356
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:16,529
- Yeah.

357
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,281
- [Missy] You're eyes,
lemme see your eyes.

358
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,561
You have those swimming tired eyes.

359
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:21,394
You know that?

360
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:22,227
- No.

361
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:23,060
(laughs)

362
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,513
- [Missy] It's like a lot of blinking.

363
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:26,179
You just spent the whole
day in the pool huh?

364
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,012
- Mm-hrmm.

365
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,994
- But anyways, we are going
to go ahead and end the vlog.

366
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:30,381
I am exhausted too.

367
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:31,809
We swam today.

368
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:34,458
I went up to my horse to
like take care of him,

369
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,538
and it's just been kind of a crazy day.

370
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,209
But, I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.

371
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,346
We had such a blast swimming
through our bubble fort.

372
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:42,364
Such a cool idea.

373
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:45,661
And big shout out to Papa,
my dad, for doing that,

374
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:47,699
because it is pretty awesome.

375
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:48,801
So anyways,

376
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,799
give this video a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it.

377
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,775
Hey boys, thumbs up!

378
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:52,955
(laughs)

379
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:54,015
They're busy playing.

380
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:55,194
Alright guys, we'll see you tomorrow.

381
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:56,027
Bye!

382
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:58,595
Boop.

383
00:12:58,595 --> 00:00:00,000
