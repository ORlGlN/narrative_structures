1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,510
- We're over here taking
refuge at the adult table.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,230
- This is the safe zone.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,458
- [Bryan] Yeah, and this is the chaos.

4
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,438
- Somebody took their shoe off.

5
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:10,204
(kids giggling)

6
00:00:10,204 --> 00:00:11,618
- It's a stinky shoe now!

- [All] Good morning!

19
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,980
- Hi boys, how are you?

20
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,813
- [Both] Good.

21
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:37,826
- Did you sleep good?

22
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:38,670
- [Both] Yeah.

23
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,503
- Yeah?

24
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:43,425
So this morning, Missy
left very, very early.

25
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:47,680
4:00 A.M. she left, and it's
just me and the boys now.

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,824
We are at home, and we're just
gonna make this work, right?

27
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:51,840
- [Ollie] Yeah.

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,710
- [Bryan] Yeah.

29
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,874
Ooh, are you playing with a wand?

30
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:55,274
- Ow.
- [Bryan] (laughs)

31
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:59,400
As you can tell, Finn had oatmeal
because it's all over him.

32
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,510
Why's it all over you?

33
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,234
It's supposed to be in your
belly, not on your shirt.

34
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,548
(chuckles)

35
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:04,691
Good morning, Ollie.

36
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,710
- Good morning.

37
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,615
- [Bryan] You miss Mama?

38
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:07,448
- Yeah.

39
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:08,695
- [Bryan] Are you excited to
hang out with Dada though?

40
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:09,550
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,152
- So for this vlog, I
thought I would give you guys

42
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:15,830
an idea of what it's
like 24 hours, two kids,

43
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,174
no Mama, no wife.

44
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:20,721
Let's see what happens. (chuckles)

45
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:23,388
(relaxed music)

46
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,874
This is so funny, you guys, look at this.

47
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:35,003
I woke up this morning,
came into the bathroom,

48
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,282
and she left me this little note.

49
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,880
Isn't that sweet of her?

50
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,870
Oh Finny, what do you think you have?

51
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,157
Finn, what do you have?

52
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:45,240
- A doo-dee.

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,321
- [Bryan] You got a cookie?

54
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,154
- Yeah!

55
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,630
- [Bryan] (laughs) You
think just 'cause you ate

56
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,042
all your breakfast, you
get a cookie already?

57
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:50,875
- Yeah.

58
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,040
- [Bryan] Hey, you can't take a cookie

59
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,640
without asking permission, dude.

60
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,500
- No.

61
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,647
- You have to say, "Daddy,
can I have a cookie please?"

62
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:57,480
- Yeah.

63
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,540
- [Bryan] Say it.

64
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,890
- I cookie please!

65
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:02,670
- (laughs)

66
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,233
That wasn't even close.

67
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,662
How did he get that cookie?!

68
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,260
Give me that cookie back, Finn.

69
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,979
Oh, you think just 'cause you can hide

70
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,779
under the table that you're safe there?

71
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,500
Well, Luna's gonna come eat that cookie.

72
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,450
Luna, eat that cookie!

73
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,430
Get it out of his hands!

74
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,399
Get it, Luna!

75
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:17,320
- [Ollie] Can I have a cookie please?

76
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,390
- [Bryan] You can have a cookie if you

77
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,420
finish your breakfast, okay?

78
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,310
You can have it. (laughs)

79
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,290
These kids are going to destroy me.

80
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,170
Send help.

81
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,660
All right, you all done
with your breakfast?

82
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,220
- Yeah, I can balance it with one hand.

83
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,460
- [Bryan] Well, that's pretty good.

84
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,120
One thing we've been
teaching Ollie is that,

85
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,927
when he is done with his food, he needs to

86
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:39,068
put it in the sink and
clean up after himself, huh?

87
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:39,953
- [Ollie] Yeah.

88
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,240
- [Bryan] Pop it in, there you go.

89
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
Thanks, dude.

90
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,480
- I'm gonna get a cookie.

91
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,190
- [Bryan] Okay, you can have
a good old morning cookie.

92
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,600
Looks like Missy was having
a little midnight snack

93
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,100
before she got on the
plane yesterday, huh?

94
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,933
- Yeah.

95
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,790
- We are all dressed for the day,

96
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,091
and we are all wearing Star Wars shirts.

97
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:00,924
- [Kids] Yeah.

98
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:01,757
- Look it, I'm repping Chewie.

99
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:04,070
- I wear BB-8 and, wait, where's?

100
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:07,518
- [Bryan] Yeah, BB-8 and R2.

101
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:08,351
- Yeah.

102
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,420
- [Bryan] Yeah, and Finn.

103
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,253
- All the spaceships.

104
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:11,790
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's so cool.

105
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,940
Finn, show me what you got.

106
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,626
- I got (mumbles).

107
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:17,084
- [Bryan] He's got
stormtroopers and Darth Vader.

108
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:18,390
- [Ollie] Darth Vader, yeah.

109
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,070
- And it says, "Hanging
with my troops." (laughs)

110
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,390
All right, come here,
it's time to do hair.

111
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,298
Put stuff in hair.

112
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:27,863
We gotta look semi-decent, I guess.

113
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,573
You too, you need some of
this, too, 'kay? (chuckles)

114
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:37,327
Oh, you don't like that brush, huh?

115
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,160
- Yeah.

116
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,140
- It's gotta be this brush. (laughs)

117
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,973
All right, let's blow dry this hair.

118
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,241
Looks good, dude. (chuckles)

119
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,520
And the kids are all ready.

120
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,049
You got your hair all done.

121
00:03:59,049 --> 00:03:59,882
- Yeah.

122
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:00,906
- [Bryan] Yeah, are you gonna
have a good day with Dada?

123
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:01,756
- Yeah!

124
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:04,660
- Well, I showed you earlier
the note above the toilet.

125
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,620
There are a lot more. (chuckles)

126
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,590
And Missy said, "Bet you
can't find all my notes, lol."

127
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,587
Here's another one on the Apple HomePod.

128
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,520
"Greatest Showman is perfect for bedtime,"

129
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,936
'cause the boys love listening to that

130
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:16,800
when they take their bath.

131
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,320
Also, this one was sweet.

132
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,450
On the scale she put, "Proud of you."

133
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,910
I love you, babe, and I hope you're having

134
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,287
an amazing time in Hawaii without me.

135
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:26,441
For the second time.

136
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:29,024
(bright music)

137
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:38,690
- You just drive right past my school.

138
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,210
- I know I did, huh? (chuckles)

139
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,850
I am taking the boys out to have some fun,

140
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,850
and let out some energy, and
we drove past Ollie's school.

141
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,850
And every time we drive
past it, he gets so excited,

142
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,794
because he's like, "That's
my school, that's my school!"

143
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:54,220
And I think he always wants
me to drop him off there.

144
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,083
- Oh yeah, this is where the new park is.

145
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,974
- [Bryan] What's up, Amelia?

146
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:03,807
- Good.

147
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:06,120
- [Bryan] Finn, do you
wanna go play in that park?

148
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,060
Go play, go have fun!

149
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,890
Aww, are you nervous 'cause
there's lots of people here?

150
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,893
Finn got a good little nap on the car ride

151
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:17,093
over here, didn't you, huh? (chuckles)

152
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,300
Go, Finn!

153
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,249
He's flying, like Buzz Lightyear, dude!

154
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:26,332
(laughs)

155
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,349
Whoa!

156
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,053
You kind of stalled
there, dude. (chuckles)

157
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:36,380
Finny, you can't go up the slide,

158
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,174
you're supposed to go
down the slide, silly!

159
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:39,007
- No!

160
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:40,820
- Yeah! Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

161
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,180
Can you go down while it's tickling?

162
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,340
While you're being tickled? Oh!

163
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,040
This is seriously the coolest
park ever, look at this.

164
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,840
They, like, modeled it
after Old Town Temecula.

165
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,723
So they have, like, the
General Merchandise Store,

166
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:56,723
the Post Office, so much to
climb, and see, and explore.

167
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,689
And we got Jude in the house.

168
00:05:58,689 --> 00:05:59,822
What's up, man?

169
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:00,803
- What's up!

170
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:02,175
- [Bryan] Ollie and Jude on the swings.

171
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,370
- [Ollie] Really high!
- [Brooke] Really high?

172
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,270
- [Bryan] He wants to
go really high, Brooke.

173
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,023
- [Brooke] Okay, I'm working on it.

174
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:07,514
- [Bryan] (laughs)
- [Jude] Yeah, what's up?

175
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:08,347
- [Brooke] Buzz Lightyear!

176
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:09,500
- [Bryan] Yeah, this kid's
a Buzz Lightyear fan.

177
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,400
They gotta go high.
- [Ollie] Yeah!

178
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,283
- [Bryan] Watch yourself,
there, dude. (laughs)

179
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,889
This is such a cool little rock wall, too.

180
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,480
Ollie loves doing these.

181
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,960
You got it, dude, now put
your foot right there.

182
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,740
There you go, oh!

183
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,747
You okay?

184
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:25,910
Look it, Jude's got it.

185
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,030
Can you go all the way to the top?

186
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,010
Yes you can.

187
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,930
Easy for him, he's tall. (laughs)

188
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,750
Wow, crawl through, guys!

189
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,700
This is so cool.

190
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,750
There's like a huge log
here to crawl through.

191
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,211
Wow. You can climb on top of it.

192
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:40,044
- [Ollie] Yeah.

193
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:41,307
- [Bryan] You're getting
to be a good climber, dude.

194
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:42,960
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

195
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,274
(laughs)

196
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:46,024
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

197
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,940
I think this was a good idea.

198
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,825
First night with the boys on my own.

199
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:52,187
I think that they are
going to be exhausted,

200
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:54,460
and hopefully they go to bed very easily.

201
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,590
And stay in bed.

202
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,423
What?

203
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:57,256
- Again.

204
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:58,343
- [Bryan] Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle!

205
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:00,363
We love having fun together, huh?

206
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,680
Finny, look it, we found some horses.

207
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,246
That's so cool, is that
how you ride a horse, Jude?

208
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:10,264
(laughs)

209
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,551
You just jump right on top of it?

210
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:12,384
- Yep.

211
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:13,556
- [Bryan] These are huge.

212
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:16,750
I don't think these
are just, oh, you okay?

213
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,660
Well, when you fall off a horse,

214
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,493
you know what you gotta do, Finn?

215
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:19,561
You gotta get back on, 'kay?

216
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:20,800
(grunts)

217
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,995
Sit on the horse like Mommy.

218
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:24,450
Sit on it like Mommy, Finn. (chuckles)

219
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,133
Look it, they even got a little colt here.

220
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,033
That's cute.

221
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,703
(chuckling) Isn't that cool?

222
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:31,110
- I think I could jump off.

223
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,121
- [Bryan] You think so?

224
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:33,623
It's kinda high.

225
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:36,555
They have this huge climbing structure,

226
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,640
and Ollie can climb
all the way to the top.

227
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,473
Right, Ollie?

228
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:41,306
- [Ollie] Yeah.

229
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,033
- [Bryan] That is amazing, look at him go.

230
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,363
Get it, dude.

231
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,620
Careful when you get to the top.

232
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,830
Pay attention.

233
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,035
Oh my gosh, he's so high
up there. (chuckles)

234
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:57,214
There is a covered wagon
here, and Ollie just climbed

235
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:58,859
to the top all on his own.

236
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,686
Let me see your muscles.

237
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:03,285
Yeah! (laughs)

238
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:05,280
This is so cool.

239
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,945
There's like a cool little fire pit.

240
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,154
- And I'm in the fire!

241
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,260
Going on the zip line with Jude.

242
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,040
- Yeah, we're both going on the zip line!

243
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,500
- They have this super cool zip line here

244
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,481
that goes around the whole park,

245
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,847
and we finally have
convinced Ollie to do it.

246
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,460
And I think he's going to love it,

247
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,390
if he doesn't get scared
before he gets up there,

248
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,400
but there are kids
smaller than him doing it.

249
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,183
He should be able to do it.

250
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:31,154
All right, Ollie's gonna do it with Daddy.

251
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:31,987
Woo!

252
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,293
(bright music)

253
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,783
Was that cool?

254
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:42,616
- Yeah.

255
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:43,700
- Yeah? (chuckles)

256
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,231
You did it, dude, I'm proud of you.

257
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:47,814
(bright music)

258
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,310
So we are now at Pat & Oscars for dinner

259
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,460
with Brooke and Sean, and we're over here

260
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,799
taking refuge at the adult table.

261
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,866
- This is the safe zone.

262
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:24,699
- [Bryan] Yeah.

263
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:26,323
And this is the chaos.

264
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:27,776
Hi. (chuckles)

265
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,434
You kiddos doing okay?

266
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,680
- Somebody took their shoe off.

267
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,028
(kids giggling)

268
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:34,992
- It's a stinky shoe now!

269
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,270
- [Bryan] (laughs)

270
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,403
Ollie, what's on your straw?

271
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:39,452
- Uh, a bread.

272
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:40,340
- [Bryan] A breadstick?

273
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,896
And how many breadsticks have you eaten?

274
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:42,729
Be honest.

275
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,507
- One, two, three.

276
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:45,600
(adults laugh)

277
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,433
- [Bryan] That's not bad.

278
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:47,870
They've been so good all together,

279
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,931
it's been the cutest thing, honestly.

280
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,580
But yeah, it's a little mayhem.

281
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,523
So we just got back from
something really cool.

282
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:56,262
It was Ollie's first open
house at preschool, huh?

283
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,095
- Yeah.

284
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,270
- He got to see the classroom that

285
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,285
he may be going into next year, right?

286
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:04,320
And you got to show me all the
cool stuff in your classroom.

287
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,292
And look at this, you guys,
he made a little caterpillar!

288
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:07,562
Isn't that so cool?

289
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:09,789
- It's actually an ant, guys.

290
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:10,760
- It's an ant?

291
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,593
- Yeah, there's a lot of ants.

292
00:10:11,593 --> 00:10:12,460
- Well, I thought it was a caterpillar,

293
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,670
'cause you guys are growing butterflies

294
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,810
in your classroom right now.

295
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,590
- I know, we was making this last time.

296
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,630
- [Bryan] Oh, that's cool.

297
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,070
So it's made out of an egg
crate and you painted it?

298
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,903
- Yeah.

299
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:22,736
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

300
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,660
- Then we put the eyes on.

301
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,696
- [Bryan] Yeah?

302
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:28,704
- And these little
tentacles so it can walk.

303
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:29,930
- [Bryan] Oh, that's cool.

304
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,763
And look at this, you guys.

305
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,260
They had this hung up on the wall.

306
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,270
It was what his favorite
Dr. Seuss book is,

307
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,790
is Have You Seen My Dinosaur.

308
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,620
Look at that picture, he's so cute.

309
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,332
Did you guys have a fun day out with Dada?

310
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,165
- Yeah.

311
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:41,998
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

312
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:42,831
- You did, too?

313
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:44,782
You, Finn, was so good, you know that?

314
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:45,864
I am so proud of you, Finn.

315
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:46,820
- Yeah.

316
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,653
- I love you.

317
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:49,430
Well now we are gonna get ready for bed.

318
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,340
It's gonna get time to quiet down.

319
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,515
So you guys have just a couple
more minutes to play, okay?

320
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:55,480
- [Ollie] Okay.

321
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,974
- [Bryan] You all ready for bed, Finny?

322
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:57,807
- Yeah.

323
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:58,660
- [Bryan] Yeah.

324
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,205
I'm getting the boys ready for bed.

325
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:04,712
And while I was doing
so, I found another note!

326
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:07,941
About instructions on how
to give the kids vitamins.

327
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:10,665
(chuckles)

328
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:12,317
Oh look, another note.

329
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:15,939
Don't forget to floss
Finn's two front teeth.

330
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,622
I have instructions, Finn.

331
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:18,840
- Oh.

332
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,103
- [Bryan] Ahh.

333
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:21,642
- Ahh.

334
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:23,525
- [Bryan] There we go, Finny.

335
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,340
(laughs)

336
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,870
This is difficult.

337
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,790
You try?

338
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,013
Oh, it's gotta be wet?

339
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:32,183
Is that better?

340
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,000
- More.

341
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,285
- [Bryan] Gotta brush those teeth,

342
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:37,420
and get rid of all the sugar bugs!

343
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,676
Yes, we do!

344
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:41,255
All right, say ahh.

345
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:43,360
Oh, you got this?

346
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,060
You can do it all on your own?

347
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,850
Look how big my kid is,
he's brushing his own teeth.

348
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,119
No, you're getting too big.

349
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:52,242
(chuckles)

350
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:56,135
All right, we did vitamins, we did shower,

351
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:59,700
we brushed teeth, we had
a really awesome day,

352
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
and now it's time for bedtime.

353
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,533
Right, kiddos?

354
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,158
Yeah, are you tired?

355
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:04,991
- Yeah.

356
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,966
- [Bryan] Oh, hi.

357
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,445
- Hi!
