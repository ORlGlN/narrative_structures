00:00:00,728 --> 00:00:03,311
(spooky music)

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:05,524
- Boo!

3
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:06,357
- Boo!

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:12,775
All right boys, it is pumpkin
decorating time, you ready?

5
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:15,839
(happy screams)

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,672
(laughing)

7
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:18,784
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

8
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,989
♫ This is who we are

9
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,272
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

10
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:25,735
♫ Shot among the stars

11
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,388
♫ Take this shooter, we'll be fine

12
00:00:28,388 --> 00:00:30,597
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

13
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,830
♫ With our lives, let's live it

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,727
♫ Live it forever

15
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:39,936
- Good morning guys, and
welcome to today's vlog.

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,406
Today is an exciting day, because

17
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:43,792
we are finally getting out new fish tank.

18
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,278
You guys excited to get a new tank?

19
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,183
- [Ollie] Yeah!

20
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:47,641
- [Bryan] It'll be so cool, huh.

21
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:49,074
Where should we put it, Ollie?

22
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,742
- [Ollie] Um, we should
put it right there.

23
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:52,608
- Yeah, I think that's
what we were thinking, too.

24
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:53,782
And, it's perfect for a fish tank,

25
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:55,619
and it is central to our house.

26
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:56,452
- Yeah, I--

27
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:57,310
- Might be a good idea.

28
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,143
- The only rea--

29
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,691
We wanted it where we're gonna enjoy it,

30
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,934
and so obviously, living
room, kitchen, would be ideal,

31
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:04,292
and if we do have it there--

32
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,125
- [Bryan] Mm hm.

33
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:08,200
- It's kind of noisy and
kind of bright all the time.

34
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,014
- Yeah, this fish tank
that we're getting is

35
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,795
kind of loud, 'cause it
has to move a lot of water,

36
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:14,980
like every hour, and it's really bright

37
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,747
because we're gonna be
growing an actual reef in it.

38
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:18,985
You guys, it's gonna be so cool.

39
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:20,262
So, we're thinking this
is a good location.

40
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:21,600
We cleared out this spot a little,

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,851
moved that table over there.

42
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:23,889
- It's not like we watch TV.

43
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:24,734
- [Bryan] Yeah.

44
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:27,046
- But we get to still enjoy
it, we're always in this area.

45
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:27,879
- [Bryan] Totally.

46
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,776
- There's a lot of natural
light for the fish, it's cool.

47
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:33,744
It is a beautiful Saturday morning guys.

48
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:36,756
Actually woke up not feeling the best,

49
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:39,423
but I'm feeling a lot better
now that I got some medicine.

50
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:42,734
And so we are playing
outside. (kid grunting)

51
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:43,651
Huh, Finny?

52
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:46,483
Whoo!

53
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:47,925
Are you playing soccer?

54
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,707
Kick that ball, you kick it, whoo!

55
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:51,540
- Ah!

56
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,485
(laughing)

57
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:54,295
- And the puppy dogs are out,

58
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:55,993
and they're ready to play.

59
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:58,307
Come here Karma, hi boy.

60
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,165
Hi, Lenna Lou. (dog barking)

61
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:01,174
Hi Lenna Lou.

62
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:05,462
We don't know, Luna is
actually in heat right nowm

63
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:08,329
which, kind of a bummer
'cause we meant to get her

64
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,206
spayed before that, but now
we're just waiting for her

65
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:12,962
to be done being in heat, and I swear

66
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:15,337
it feels like she's been
in heat for two weeks now.

67
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:17,158
So, as soon as she's done being in heat,

68
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:18,670
we're gonna get her fixed.

69
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,834
That way, no dogs come
smelling around here

70
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,234
to try and get her pregnant.

71
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,709
We don't need any more puppy dogs.

72
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,615
Oh my goodness, this got left open.

73
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,202
Wonder how that's open.

74
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:29,966
Hello, how are my chickens,

75
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,952
I haven't shown you guys in a while.

76
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:36,660
Come on out, here they
are, how are my chickens?

77
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,253
Oh, I've got eggs, even.

78
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,433
That makes me a happy chicken momma.

79
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:44,220
Everyone's good though,
everyone's a happy chicken?

80
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,573
Happy chicken, happy mom. (laughing)

81
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,805
You guys, I have so many
chickens. (laughing)

82
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:52,624
We are having a little bit of
grass issues right over here,

83
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:55,194
so we've got all kinds of torn up dirt

84
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:57,409
and a little temporary
fence so that the dogs don't

85
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,676
go over there, and super bummer,

86
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:01,183
because we just got all
this new grass put in,

87
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:04,293
but the system that we put in and use

88
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,064
just did not end up working.

89
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:07,344
So, now they had rip that all out

90
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:09,069
and out in new sprinklers system,

91
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,270
and that's been kind
of annoying. (laughing)

92
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,315
Let's go put out eggs inside, kay?

93
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:14,858
- Yeah.
- Mm, kay.

94
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,327
- [Bryan] Check it out, your guys,

95
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:19,101
we got coral in the house.

96
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:21,657
And this is my buddy from
Fish Frenzy, hooking it up

97
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:24,685
with the red sea reefer, you guys.

98
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:25,612
What are you doing in here?

99
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:27,650
- Right now, we're
putting in the live sand

100
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,552
and the live rock so we can
get the whole system going.

101
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:31,671
Sand's outta Fiji.

102
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,155
- [Bryan] So, this sand is actually alive?

103
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,908
- Yeah, it's actually alive,
it's got all the bacteria

104
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:35,741
to support--

105
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:36,574
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh.

106
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:37,407
- [Man] All the fish and organisms

107
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:38,380
that are gonna live in here.

108
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,213
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

109
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:40,084
- It's live rock.

110
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:41,427
- [Bryan] So, you're
just placing that rock

111
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:43,557
on top of each other and seeing
how it balances and stuff?

112
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,440
- Yeah, want a lot of
good spots for the fish

113
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,430
to swim around and have really
interesting places to hide.

114
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,796
- [Bryan] That's super
cool, that's super cool.

115
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,841
And, you were just telling me
you have on your Instagram,

116
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,953
you show off all your stuff right?

117
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:54,991
- Yep, right.

118
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:55,824
- [Bryan] So, let people
know where they can find you.

119
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:57,978
- Bansplace is my Instagram.

120
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:58,811
- [Bryan] OK, cool.

121
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,061
- All my fish and corals and tanks and...

122
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,397
- Dude, right on.

123
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:04,197
This is starting to
come together, you guys.

124
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,780
(upbeat music)

125
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,939
So, we got the professional
set up the fish tank right now

126
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,400
and we decided to put
it in the kitchen area

127
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,547
because we actually had them move it

128
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,683
in the foyer and it was so crammed.

129
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,692
I did not realize how big it is.

130
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,178
- Yeah, it didn't look good,
and he did confirm that

131
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:25,635
it's very, very, silent.

132
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:26,468
- [Bryan] Yeah.

133
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:28,222
- You can't really hear
anything, and even the light

134
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:30,038
won't be reflecting off anything.

135
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:32,010
- Yeah, the light is like,
it's like smart lighting,

136
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,400
so it's on a schedule, too.

137
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,775
It turns on at night when
they need it and stuff.

138
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,070
All the coral's in, now just
filling it you with water.

139
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,328
Check this out, they boys
have been so good today,

140
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:43,848
They have been, seriously,
on their best behavior.

141
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:47,260
Ollie is eating lunch
and watching a movie.

142
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,966
You watching Boss Baby?

143
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,369
- Yeah.

144
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:51,202
- [Bryan] Yeah, Finn's asleep.

145
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,779
You're being a good
brother letting him sleep.

146
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:57,446
- Yeah, and can you put
Super Hero Girls on?

147
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,256
- [Bryan] Sure.

148
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:01,923
Mm, so precious, oh.

149
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:05,658
He needed a nap today, he looks co comfy.

150
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:06,544
(laughing)

151
00:05:06,544 --> 00:05:09,127
(gentle music)

152
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:12,613
Here it comes.

153
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,980
- [Missy] Start it up, man.

154
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,896
(water splashing)

155
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:18,242
- [Bryan] Whoa! (laughing)

156
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,490
There we go, guys.

157
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,082
It has begun.

158
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:24,749
(upbeat music)

159
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,688
- Fish tank.
- Fish tank!

160
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:40,574
It's all set up, what do you think, Ollie?

161
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,734
- Um, good.

162
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:42,857
- You think it's really cool?

163
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,766
It's really cool, so we
have the rock in there,

164
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,252
the sand in there, it is
cleaning it all out right now,

165
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:50,578
so it's gonna be a little
bot hard to see anything.

166
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:52,526
Hopefully by tonight or tomorrow morning

167
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,509
it'll all be nice and
clear and you can see.

168
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:56,622
You can kinda see, it's
kinda peeking through.

169
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,165
It's still a little dirty,
it's doing its work.

170
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,481
We also hung two of those plants up here,

171
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:03,165
and I'm thinking these might
actually grow really well

172
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:05,136
because of these UV lights.

173
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:06,771
So, it might be interesting
to see how those plants do

174
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:07,715
right above it.

175
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,313
Now that we have the
fish tank all hooked up,

176
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:12,229
we can actually pick up
fish in a couple of days.

177
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,178
So, we'll probably, middle
of next week just gonna

178
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:17,143
pick up one or two fish and
acclimate them to the tank

179
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,013
and just make sure that everything

180
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:20,804
is running smoothly with that.

181
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:22,858
We get to pick out some
fish in a couple days, OK?

182
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:23,691
- Yeah.

183
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,524
- [Bryan] You excited?

184
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:26,066
- Yeah, I work out.

185
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:26,974
- [Bryan] You do work out?

186
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:27,807
- Yeah.

187
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,882
- [Bryan] Show me, show
me your work out regimen

188
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:31,064
right here, you ready, babe?

189
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,231
- [Ollie] One.

190
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,572
Two. (laughing)

191
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:37,405
Three.

192
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,776
Five.

193
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:40,838
- [Bryan] Kinda missed four.

194
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:41,671
- Four.

195
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,056
- [Bryan] (laughing)
There's four, he did four.

196
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:44,988
- Three.

197
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,372
- [Bryan] (laughing)
He's going backwards now.

198
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,377
- Five.

199
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:48,575
- [Bryan] (laughing) Oh.

200
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,755
- [Ollie] Six.

201
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:51,783
- [Bryan] Bro, you are
working those arm muscles,

202
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,682
aren't you?

203
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:53,515
- Yeah.

204
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:55,251
- [Bryan] Should we get you
an Apple watch like Momma?

205
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,597
You can track your fitness.

206
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:57,430
- [Missy] Keep track of all your pushups.

207
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,349
(laughing)

208
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:00,004
- [Bryan] It's almost October,

209
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,289
should we go get some pumpkins?

210
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,122
- Yeah.

211
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,705
(spooky music)

212
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,263
- Boo!
- Boo!

213
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:18,368
All right boys, it is
pumpkin decorating time,

214
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:19,201
you ready?

215
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,253
(happy yells)

216
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:22,294
(laughing)

217
00:07:22,294 --> 00:07:24,661
- So, since it is the first
of October for you guys,

218
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:28,818
we thought we would do a little
early pumpkin decorating.

219
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:30,774
We're not gonna be doing any carving.

220
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,124
That's probably a little closer

221
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:33,785
towards the end of the month,

222
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:35,615
but we are gonna decorate these pumpkins.

223
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:38,125
- Watch this, guys. (growls)

224
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,301
- [Bryan] Oh are you eating the pumpkin?

225
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:41,790
Oh, you're eating the
pumpkin, too? (laughing)

226
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,650
- We picked up these super
easy decorating kits,

227
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,700
which are perfect for
boys, especially our age.

228
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,451
We are really excited, we've got BB-8.

229
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,284
- [Ollie] Yes!

230
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:52,117
- [Bryan] Nice.

231
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:52,950
- Who is this?

232
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,783
- [Ollie] Chase.

233
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:55,492
- [Bryan] Chase from Paw Patrol.

234
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,548
- Yeah, and who's this?

235
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:57,899
- [Ollie] Marshall.

236
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,687
- [Bryan] Marshall, he puts out the fires.

237
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:01,884
- There's no cutting involved,

238
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,104
they just have little sticks.

239
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:03,937
- [Bryan] Totally.

240
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:06,377
- Yeah, we're gonna
transform our pumpkins.

241
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:08,024
- Yes, and no, we are not sponsored.

242
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:09,890
These are just really cool
ways to decorate your pumpkin.

243
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,859
They've been doing these for like--

244
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:11,784
- [Ollie] They're the best!

245
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,541
- [Bryan] For like six or seven years now.

246
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,986
- Which one do you want to do?

247
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:15,973
- Um.

248
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:16,806
- BB-8?

249
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:18,362
- [Bryan] You want to do BB-8, nice dude.

250
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:20,101
- And Finn, which one do you want to do?

251
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:21,281
- [Ollie] I know how to open it.

252
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,516
- Chase or Marshall?

253
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:23,352
- Yeah.

254
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,161
- [Bryan] Al right, Momma's doing Chase.

255
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,031
- [Missy] Yeah.

256
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,137
- [Bryan] Rip it open, rip 'em open.

257
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:31,231
All right Ollie, here
are BB-8's shield plates.

258
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,653
All you gotta do is put
those on the side of

259
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:34,948
your pumpkin.

260
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:35,794
(growling)

261
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:36,627
- [Missy] Push it in hard.

262
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:38,488
(grunting)

263
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:39,321
- [Bryan] Nice.

264
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:41,635
See, so they have a little pegs on it,

265
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:42,936
and they just stick
right into the pumpkin.

266
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:43,770
That's so cool, huh?

267
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,603
- Yeah.

268
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:45,979
- [Bryan] All right, put
other shield plate on, Ollie.

269
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:46,812
- Push it in, baby.

270
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:47,645
- [Bryan] Push it in.

271
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:48,478
(grunting)

272
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:49,311
- [Bryan] Use those strong muscles.

273
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,188
- [Missy] That was awesome.

274
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:53,952
- [Bryan] Good job, and
now he needs his head.

275
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,375
Where's his head at?

276
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,634
Oh, I found it, found
BB-8's head. (laughing)

277
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:01,092
Let's put his head, how about right there?

278
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:02,210
Is that cool?
- Yeah.

279
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,254
- [Bryan] All right, push
it in, there it goes.

280
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:05,240
Push it on all the way, dude.

281
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,573
Nice.
- Good job.

282
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,915
- [Bryan] Dude, look at your BB-8 pumpkin.

283
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:11,451
Isn't that so cool?

284
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,884
(laughing)

285
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:14,906
- [Missy] That's pretty cool.

286
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:17,990
- [Bryan] Oh, Finn is Marshall. (laughing)

287
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,380
He's ready to decorate.

288
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,383
- I got that stinky.

289
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,981
- [Bryan] Yeah, so with Marshall, we have

290
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,415
front paws, and we have back paws,

291
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:27,235
and then we have his head.

292
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,300
You want to put it together, Finn?

293
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,899
- [Missy] Can you out his head right here?

294
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,720
- Oh, I'm a baby, eh?

295
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,553
(laughing)

296
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:36,136
(upbeat music)

297
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:41,263
- [Bryan] Marshall's gotta have his legs

298
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,597
so he can run super fast to the fire.

299
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:46,180
(upbeat music)

300
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,625
- Boo!

301
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,829
- [Bryan] Whoa!

302
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:55,139
You scared me. (laughing)

303
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,379
These boys are getting in
the Halloween spirit already.

304
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,862
Uh uh, where's Finn?

305
00:09:58,862 --> 00:09:59,695
- Boo!

306
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:01,483
- [Bryan] Whoa.

307
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:02,820
- So cute.

308
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,825
- [Bryan] There's Chase.

309
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:06,012
(laughing)

310
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:08,741
Now that they're all
decorated, you can swap out

311
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,976
body parts.

312
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,187
- Ooh.

313
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:12,044
- [Bryan] Wouldn't that be funny?

314
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,774
So Chase can have Chase's legs, oh,

315
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:17,612
and can have BB-8's head.

316
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:18,911
- Oh my goodness.

317
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:19,773
- [Bryan] Isn't that funny?

318
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:20,922
- [Ollie] Yes.

319
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:21,923
- [Bryan] You want to swap some more?

320
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,606
- Put this one on.

321
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,121
- [Missy] It's a BB Chase.

322
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:27,819
- [Bryan] A BB Chase, that's so weird.

323
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:28,981
What else can we swap?

324
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:32,370
Look what Momma did, Ollie,
she swapped their legs.

325
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,621
- (laughing) Isn't that silly?

326
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:36,287
(laughing)

327
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,547
- [Bryan] Here, let's replace

328
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:41,214
one of Chase's Marshall
plates, there we go.

329
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:45,705
Oh yeah, and then we can out
BB-8's plate right there.

330
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:48,244
Things are all getting mixed
up right here you guys.

331
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:50,210
I don't know if any of
these pumpkins are right.

332
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,398
- [Missy] Hey Ollie, do you
know how to fix all these?

333
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:55,335
- [Bryan] Can you fix
these pumpkins, Ollie?

334
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:56,168
- Hmm.

335
00:10:57,394 --> 00:10:59,954
- [Bryan] Hmm, can you?

336
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:01,753
All right, out 'em all back to normal.

337
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:02,663
(grunting)

338
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,978
Oh! (laughing)

339
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:05,654
- Ollie, it's OK.

340
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:07,212
- [Bryan] So where does the B-8 head go?

341
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:09,597
That one, yeah, we'll
take Chase's head off.

342
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:11,174
(grunting)

343
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:15,573
And then out BB-8's
head back on, good job.

344
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:16,723
That doesn't go there?

345
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:17,842
What goes there?

346
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,434
(grunting)

347
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:22,541
There you go, yeah,
you're getting it, dude.

348
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,525
- It's like a puzzle, it's so cute.

349
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,006
- [Bryan] I know, Ollie, you did BB-8.

350
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:26,283
God job, buddy.

351
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:27,705
So, that one's Marshall.

352
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:29,926
So, you gotta grab Marshall's legs

353
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:32,510
off this pumpkin, put 'em on there.

354
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,202
There you go. (laughing)

355
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:35,035
- That's so cute.

356
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:36,498
- [Bryan] I know, we
turned it into a fun little

357
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:40,171
mix up activity, there you go, dude.

358
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:41,253
Now you gotta put Marshall back--

359
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:42,985
Or put Chase back together

360
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,275
so that Chase can go on the case, huh?

361
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,068
- Yup, Chase is on the case!

362
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:49,755
- [Bryan] Yeah, now put his head on.

363
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:53,742
There we go, now we got out
pumpkins all back to normal.

364
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:54,764
Thanks, Ollie.

365
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:57,014
(grunting)

366
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:00,735
(beeping and booping)

367
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,485
Chase is on the case.

368
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,603
What does Marshall say?

369
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:06,794
Marshall, let's get fired up, right?

370
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:07,961
Good job boys.

371
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:11,378
That was some good pumpkin decorating.

372
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:13,961
(spooky music)

373
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:22,920
- All right, we're out
for a little family walk.

374
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,627
Finn's on my back, and
Ollie's running around here.

375
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,567
I wanted to show you
something super, super cute.

376
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:29,482
- [Bryan] It's really cool.

377
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,607
- You guys are gonna die.

378
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:33,699
Look who's coming with us. (laughing)

379
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:38,355
Jimmy wanted to bring her
but she's kinda skittish

380
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:40,141
around the kids and all of us.

381
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,391
She is so cute.

382
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:43,297
- [Jimmy] Once she
starts hearing the kids,

383
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,130
she's like--

384
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,647
- [Missy] She's like, I'm
just gonna go hide over here.

385
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:47,661
- [Jimmy] Can I just go the opposite way?

386
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:48,494
- [Missy] Dang it.

387
00:12:48,494 --> 00:12:49,407
- [Woman] Imma bring my kitty cat.

388
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:50,567
- [Missy] OK, that's a good idea.

389
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,476
- [Woman] Kitty, kitty, kitty.

390
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:52,899
- [Missy] He's just like a kitty cat, too.

391
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:53,842
(laughing)

392
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:55,684
Hi, so what do you think
about going on a walk?

393
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:57,969
- Uh, think he says, not today.

394
00:12:57,969 --> 00:12:59,727
- [Missy] Nah, no thank you.

395
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,520
- [Jimmy] He's finally just
walking around the house.

396
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,398
- Yeah, yeah.

397
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:05,681
They're still working and
practicing their walks.

398
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,444
Maybe next time, Zuri.

399
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:09,312
Yeah, we really wanted
her to come with us,

400
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,240
it was part of the plan, but she ended up

401
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,403
no loving the walk
'cause of all the people.

402
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:15,986
(upbeat music)

403
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:29,917
- [Bryan] Dude, I didn't
know you could do that.

404
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,279
- I know it, it was a magic trick.

405
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,316
- [Bryan] That's pretty good.

406
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:35,899
(upbeat music)

407
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,358
Look at this dinosaur sculpture

408
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:01,098
in this person's backyard you guys.

409
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:02,661
I'm gonna see if Ollie can see it.

410
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:05,064
Looks so cool. (laughing)

411
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:05,897
- What is that?

412
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:06,992
- [Missy] What is it, right there?

413
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:07,825
- [Bryan] Do you see it?

414
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:08,658
- [Missy] With the light on it.

415
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:11,011
- A, a, a dinosaur?

416
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:12,920
- [Bryan] Yeah, what
kind of dinosaur is that,

417
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,783
you know.

418
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,602
- I think it's a Ranna-saurus.

419
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:16,590
- [Bryan] No.

420
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,031
- It's a Tri-ranna-saurus.

421
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,798
- [Bryan] No, it's a Spine-a-saurus.

422
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:20,904
- [Ollie] Spine-a-saurus.

423
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:22,381
Isn't that so cool?

424
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:24,564
Think it's time we get a
dinosaur sculpture, you guys.

425
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,147
(upbeat music)

426
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:34,114
The boys are doing their
evening workout with Momma.

427
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:34,947
(laughing)

428
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:37,751
So, cute, get fired up, get fired up.

429
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,793
Burn all that energy before bed.

430
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:40,680
- [Missy] They like the high kicks.

431
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,764
- [Bryan] They like the
high kicks. (laughing)

432
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:44,011
Look at you babe.

433
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:45,659
(grunting) (laughing)

434
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,558
- Trying to finish out my circle.

435
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:48,391
Almost done.

436
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:50,422
- [Bryan] And you two, you
guys are trying to finish

437
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,255
your activity circles?

438
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,124
(laughing)

439
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:53,957
- Thanks for watching.

440
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:54,790
(grunting)

441
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,207
Give this video a thumb's up.

442
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:01,733
Ascribing you new, see you later.

443
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,082
- I did it.
- Bye.

444
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,286
- Momma did it, be sure to
leave a comment down below

445
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:08,231
with what you guys are gonna
decorate your pumpkin as

446
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:10,409
this Halloween, and
it'll give us a few ideas

447
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,527
for more pumpkin videos.

448
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:12,360
- Bye.

449
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,416
Boop.

450
00:15:16,416 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
