1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,628
- [Bryan] It's time for
the balloons to go boys.

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:07,218
So I need your help, we need
to, attack the balloons.

3
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:09,052
Oh he ripped his head off, get it.

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,549
- If you don't know we have a

5
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:12,716
Halloween party coming
up and we do a maze,

6
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:14,235
this will be a second year doing a maze.

7
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:16,931
We've got all this scary stuff.

8
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:19,954
And it's going to be so cool.

9
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:24,015
- Today I have a special Lego surprise.

10
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:25,984
These are not just normal Lego

11
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,783
mini figures, these are
magic Lego mini figures.

12
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:31,858
♫ This is our life

13
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:32,943
♫ This is our fun

14
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:35,478
♫ This is who we are

15
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:36,553
♫ This is our dream

16
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:37,849
♫ This is our team

17
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:40,259
♫ Shot among the stars

18
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,592
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

19
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:45,094
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

20
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:47,170
♫ This is our life

21
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,217
♫ Let's live it

22
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,432
♫ Live it forever.

23
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:53,718
- [Boys] Good morning.

24
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:55,118
- Good morning Ollie, how you doing buddy?

25
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:55,951
- Good.

26
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:56,784
- What are you eating?

27
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:57,617
- This.

28
00:00:57,617 --> 00:01:00,617
- Is that a ring pop, for breakfast?

29
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:03,302
Apparently in October anything goes

30
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:07,341
and this kid can have a
ring pop for breakfast.

31
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:08,339
Now he ate breakfast.

32
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:09,203
Hey Ollie guess what.

33
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,036
- [Ollie] What?

34
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,763
- Today I have a special Lego surprise.

35
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:13,889
- Woo hoo.

36
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:14,829
- [Bryan] What do we got here?

37
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:18,996
- We got a zombie, we got
batman, we got Kai, we got witch.

38
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:22,492
- [Bryan] Whoa, and guess what Ollie.

39
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:25,383
These are not just
normal Lego mini figures.

40
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:29,550
These are magic Lego mini
figures, isn't that cool.

41
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:32,655
Should we see what happens
when we put them together.

42
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:33,488
- Yeah.

43
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:35,210
- Alright, go for it, Ollie loves

44
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,534
putting together mini figures.

45
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:39,914
So I thought I would pick
up some very special ones.

46
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:42,839
That have a little bit of a
magic touch, what til you see.

47
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:45,256
(soft music)

48
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:53,312
I love that you're doing this with

49
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:57,479
the ring pop in your mouth,
he's concentrating so hard.

50
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:13,373
Probably one of my favorite things ever

51
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:15,996
is watching Ollie put together Legos.

52
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:19,413
Because he uses his brain and his fingers

53
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:23,380
and he's just so cute
and imaginative about it.

54
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,980
It just like makes me feel so happy.

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,813
- Dad.

56
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:26,646
- Yeah buddy.

57
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,479
- Could you do the cape.

58
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,022
- [Bryan] Yeah you want me to
help you with the witch cape.

59
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:32,951
(soft music)

60
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,629
Ollie, good job on building
those mini figures.

61
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,717
- You're welcome.

62
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:39,432
- [Bryan] You did a good job
buddy, give me high five.

63
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:40,709
Alright that was a good little test

64
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,948
to get your brain going for the day, huh.

65
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:44,112
- Look.

66
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:45,245
- [Bryan] Yeah I know there's

67
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:47,312
so many different ones you can do, huh.

68
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:49,825
- Wait, a ghost with a
(mumbles) that's cool.

69
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,630
- Alright me and John
are working on our maze.

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,364
If you don't know we have
a Halloween party coming up

71
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:57,757
and we do a maze, this will be
our second year doing a maze.

72
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:00,327
And I'm so excited about it, we've got

73
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,827
all this scary stuff, it's so many things.

74
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:09,397
And it's gonna be so cool,
but there's so much work.

75
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,082
We've got about three days, right.

76
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:11,915
- [John] Three days.

77
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:13,868
- Three days til the maze, and we have

78
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:17,217
to put all this together,
but it's going to be so fun.

79
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:18,128
I've got all the stuff, we've been

80
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,719
collecting stuff for a long, long time.

81
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,612
Like for a few months now, and really

82
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:23,192
trying to like come up with good ideas.

83
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:24,513
We're like really dedicated about

84
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:26,261
making it like look cool, like I want

85
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,727
it to be one that like people

86
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:28,985
are like, that was so fun.

87
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,180
So we've got like my dad's been

88
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,863
working on building things,
and doing all kinds of stuff.

89
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:37,036
Yeah, now we just gotta
put it all together.

90
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:38,734
- [Bryan] So for our haunted maze.

91
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:42,709
We are basically recreating
a very old farmhouse.

92
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,372
And so we have this
little wall section built.

93
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:47,918
And we even got wallpaper for it.

94
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,571
That looks so cool too,
look at this wallpaper.

95
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:51,945
- [Missy] We'll see how it turns out.

96
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:53,930
- [Bryan] John's the mastermind.

97
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,897
- [Missy] Perfect.

98
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:55,730
- [Bryan] Cool.

99
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,396
- [John] That looks really good.

100
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:59,185
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh, I was not

101
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:01,366
expecting that honestly, that's creepy.

102
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,949
(spooky music)

103
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:33,376
- [Batman] I'm Batman.

104
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,858
(fast spooky music)

105
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:53,147
- [Bryan] Ollie who are you?

106
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:54,334
- [Ollie] Kai.

107
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:57,667
- [Bryan] You're Kai, and I am a zombie.

108
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:02,520
A Lego zombie, brains, blasted brains.

109
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:07,005
We turned into the Lego mini
figs Ollie what happened?

110
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,137
- I don't know.

111
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:09,677
- [Bryan] 'Member I told
you they were magical.

112
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,510
- Yeah.

113
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,478
- [Bryan] Yeah I guess we turned

114
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,328
into all Lego mini figs, huh?

115
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:14,264
- [Missy] Oh yeah.

116
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,190
- [Bryan] Look at Missy, she looks

117
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,122
so cool she's a Lego witch,
that's pretty neat, huh.

118
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,794
Alright Ollie should we be
the Lego family for Halloween?

119
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:22,627
- No.

120
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:25,223
- [Bryan] No, well shucks, I thought

121
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:26,807
we had our costumes all planned out.

122
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,000
- [Missy] Nope, not this one.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,802
- [Bryan] Guess we're not
gonna be the Lego family, but.

124
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,732
- I don't know if this mask
is gonna work for Finn so.

125
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,939
- [Bryan] It was a cute
idea but I don't know

126
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,947
if it's gonna work for the kids but yes

127
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:39,463
that was a cool Halloween
costume idea right, Lego family.

128
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,195
- I love it, so cute.

129
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,458
- [Bryan] We're definitely a Lego family.

130
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,366
- Yeah, that, Batman looks so cute.

131
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,604
- [Bryan] Whoa, you like being Batman.

132
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:49,852
He thinks I'm a, there he
is, he wore it for a second.

133
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:50,685
- [Missy] (mumbles)

134
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:54,146
- I'm gonna use the magic forces of Lego,

135
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:58,313
to take my head off, wow, it
is very, very hot in there.

136
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:04,985
So, daddy's gonna go take a shower.

137
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:06,690
Alright guys as you know, we had

138
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,917
a huge superhero party for this kid.

139
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,633
Because he is now two years old.

140
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:14,794
And at the party, we had
these really cool balloons.

141
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:15,957
What do you think of these balloons Ollie?

142
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:19,360
They're pretty cool, we've got Spider-Man

143
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,527
and we have got, Batman, in the flesh.

144
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:26,221
But it's time for the balloons to go boys.

145
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:31,040
So I need your help, we need
to, attack the balloons.

146
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,974
Oh he ripped his head off, get it.

147
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:35,322
Get it Finn, get him, get him Finn.

148
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:39,239
Attack the balloon, jump
on him, body slam him.

149
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:43,938
Spider-Man lost his head,
poor Spidey lost his head.

150
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:46,028
(Bryan laughing)

151
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:48,188
Can you pull off Batman's head, whoa.

152
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:52,520
What if we put Spider-Man's
head on Batman.

153
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,353
How funny does that look,
get it Ollie get it.

154
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,510
Get him, whoa get him.

155
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:07,186
- My ring gouged his face.

156
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:09,711
- [Bryan] There you go,
mama's got a special ring

157
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:11,794
- Ready, three, two, one.

158
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,690
- [Bryan] Whoa she punched a hole in him.

159
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,260
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

160
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,340
- (mumbles)

161
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,090
- [Bryan] Batman, 'kay you ready?

162
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:29,964
Poor Spidey and Batman, that was fun, huh.

163
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:31,195
It's kind of gruesome, it's like just

164
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:32,756
a bunch of balloon body parts.

165
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,553
(Bryan laughing)

166
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:39,783
Alright Ollie alright,
I think that's enough.

167
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:42,017
Ollie you're so funny, was that fun?

168
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:44,036
I thought the boys would
enjoy that little clean up.

169
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:48,480
Very nicely, alright, let's
throw them in the trash now.

170
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,563
- Shoot, three, two, one.

171
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,994
- You're going to the trash Spider-Man.

172
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:59,261
- [Bryan] Yep, he's in the trash.

173
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:02,178
That was fun, in the trash they go.

174
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,037
- [Ollie] (mumbles) chicken poo-poo egg.

175
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,686
- [Bryan] Chicken poo-poo egg, what?

176
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:12,616
You're so funny, dude.

177
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:15,546
Hey Luna, Luna's been hanging out with us.

178
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:16,961
And she's been such a good dog,

179
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:19,334
huh, haven't you, yes she has.

180
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:20,829
I feel like she's gotten a lot calmer.

181
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:22,836
Just in the past couple weeks.

182
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,739
She's growing up to be a good doggy, huh.

183
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:29,906
Luna is so into the cars,
Luna, leave it alone, Luna.

184
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:32,789
- (mumbles)

185
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,275
- [Bryan] Luna you're
crazy, do you like it Finn?

186
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,987
- [Missy] Oh my gosh she cannot even.

187
00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:41,150
- [Bryan] Luna calm down, Luna down, down.

188
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,321
(Missy laughing)

189
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,821
- [Missy] Back up.

190
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:50,794
Yeah we just set this
up, she's over there now.

191
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:53,377
(upbeat music)

192
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:28,355
- [Bryan] Ollie's switching
this track back and forth.

193
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:30,022
- [Missy] Ready, go.

194
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:37,745
Good job.

195
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41,292
- [Bryan] Wow Finn, Finn is trying sushi

196
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,680
for the very first
time, what do you think?

197
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,551
He doesn't like it, was that yummy?

198
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:48,000
- [Missy] Good job trying.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,997
- [Bryan] So proud of you buddy.

200
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:52,972
- [Missy] Good job, proud of you.

201
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:56,081
- Missy and I are on a
date at P.F. Chang's.

202
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:58,796
The kids are actually
with the babysitters.

203
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:01,490
So we get to enjoy this time to ourselves.

204
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,640
- Don't lie, you guys do
it too, if you have kids.

205
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,050
- [Bryan] Babysitters as in they're both

206
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,546
watching YouTube Kids,
right Ollie, are you happy?

207
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:12,521
They're happy so we're happy.

208
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:13,354
- Yep.

209
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:15,595
- Those are our babysitters though.

210
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:18,324
But no it's actually
amazing out right now.

211
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:22,108
All the lights just turned
on and it's so nice.

212
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:23,512
- So romantic.

213
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:26,498
- [Bryan] Yeah, here
Ollie can you vlog for me.

214
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,339
Can you vlog mommy and daddy?

215
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,422
Are you vlogging us, do we look good?

216
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:38,288
And there's Finn, do you
wanna try a California roll?

217
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,623
- [Ollie] No.

218
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:42,829

219
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,513
- [Ollie] No thank you.

220
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:47,096
(upbeat music)

221
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,571
- Alright we just got
back from the restaurant.

222
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,408
The boys are so tired,
it's definitely time

223
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:02,575
to go S, L, E, E, P, I think
he knows how to spell sleep.

224
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:06,762
Hey Ollie, did you have a fun day today?

225
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:07,932
- [Ollie] Yeah.

226
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:09,772

up like Lego characters?

227
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:13,033
That was pretty cool, right, yeah.

228
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,390

00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:18,452
and the share letter is C or U.

232
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:20,014
