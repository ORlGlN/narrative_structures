1
00:00:00,337 --> 00:00:03,042
- Okay, so, doctors who
are currently treating

2
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:04,134
these three crazy kids.

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,370
This is how they hurt themselves.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,724
Climbing down the rock, I'm filming this.

5
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:10,454
So, that they have record.

6
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:11,454
Oh, my gosh.

7
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:14,955
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

8
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,274
♫ This is who we are

9
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:19,656
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

10
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:22,177
♫ Shot among the stars

11
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:24,760
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,068
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

13
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,055
♫ This is our life

14
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:31,229
♫ Let's live it

15
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:33,074
♫ Live it forever

16
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,241
- Morning.
- Good morning!

17
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:39,120
It's morning, Finn is such
a good mood, isn't he?

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,696
Yep, he's eating some Teddy Grahams.

19
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:41,720
It's not exactly morning.

20
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,552
Missy just got back from
the gym with the boys

21
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:44,916
and I'm still a little
bit under the weather.

22
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,097
I'm feeling better but
I'm just really weak.

23
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:49,138
So I'm trying to just take it easy.

24
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:51,608
But I miss these boys so much.

25
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:52,803
Love you.

26
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,495
- Love you.
- Did you have fun?

27
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:55,512
- Gah.
- Yeah.

28
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:58,996
I think Missy's taking the
boys somewhere fun today.

29
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:00,775
You excited?

30
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:02,015
Yeah (laughs).

31
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:03,940
This little one is growing
up so fast, you guys.

32
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,972
He's such a big, independent boy.

33
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:08,467
Just walking around the house
with a cup of Teddy Grahams.

34
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,717
- Good morning.

35
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:12,955
Hi.
- Hi.

36
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:14,912
- Did you have so much
fun with Papa yesterday?

37
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:15,745
- Yeah.

38
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:17,454
- I watched, my dad did tons of video.

39
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:18,712
And I know some of it was in the vlog

40
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,618
but they are so cute.

41
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:21,577
I was just loving it.

42
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:23,889
I was like, apparently we
need to get Ollie a snake

43
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:26,113
'cause he's obsessed
and loves them so much.

44
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:29,204
Anyways, me and kids just
got back from the gym.

45
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:30,958
They got to do their little daycare.

46
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,238
Me and Kelsey did a really hard workout.

47
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:34,304
And whew, I'm gonna feel it tomorrow.

48
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:35,872
It was bad, it was really, really bad.

49
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:37,163
But anyways, I wanted to tell you guys,

50
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,639
it is a beautiful, beautiful day.

51
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,313
We have a really fun day planned.

52
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:43,421
But I just came back here
to play with the dogs,

53
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,550
check on my chickens.

54
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,831
And one of my chickens
just cock-a-doodle-dooed.

55
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:50,921
For reals, it's a boy (laughs).

56
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,828
That is kind of a bummer.

57
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:54,343
I love the cock-a-doodle-doo.

58
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:55,483
I think it's the cutest thing ever.

59
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,617
It doesn't wake me up
and doesn't annoy me.

60
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,659
I think it's like super cute

61
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,244
and kind of fun to be
like, "Oh, I'm on a farm."

62
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:06,562
But as soon as that rooster
starts trying to attack me,

63
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:08,098
it's gotta go, it's gotta go.

64
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,345
I had a rooster a few months
ago, some of you don't know.

65
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:13,836
And unfortunately, it just
started attacking the kids.

66
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:14,911
It started attacking me.

67
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,889
I mean, we raised it from a baby, baby.

68
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:20,676
Unfortunately, this one is a rooster.

69
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,259
And I'm really super bummed about it.

70
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,389
Are you guys safe up here from Luna?

71
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:25,222
- Yeah.

72
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:27,083
- [Missy] She is dirty!

73
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,635
She's been playing in the mud.

74
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:30,485
She's like, "You're not safe from me."

75
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,462
(laughs)

76
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,092
- We're going off the mountain.

77
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:37,486
- Yes, that is right, we
are going up the mountain.

78
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:39,120
- Mint in.
- Mint in.

79
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,317
Mountain, Ollie, say, "mountain."

80
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,611
- Mountain.
- Good job, good job.

81
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:45,946
But yeah, so, I have
decided to join the family

82
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:48,759
on this little gathering to the mountains.

83
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,723
I feel like I am getting better.

84
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:53,506
I'm very weak so I'm
just gonna take it slow.

85
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,580
I have a DayQuil so that helps too.

86
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,212
I know, I feel like I just
need to get out of the house

87
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,279
and clear my head a little.

88
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,203
'Cause I've been cooped up there,

89
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,524
'cause I've been really sick.

90
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:03,795
Cough drops.

91
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,953
- Cough drops.
- Cough drops.

92
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,336
What's Finn doing, Ollie?

93
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:09,534
- Sitting, still awake.

94
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:10,367
- [Bryan] He's awake?

95
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:11,866
Is he eating his quesadilla?

96
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,417
- Yeah but no.

97
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,799
- Yeah but no.

98
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,812
The boys are watching

99
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,681
The Nightmare before Christmas right now

100
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,111
on the little TV in the
truck, which is so convenient.

101
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:22,153
And they love it.

102
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:23,975
Well, Finn isn't watching it.

103
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:25,694
He's listening to the
soundtrack, as our we.

104
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:27,996
- He might be able to see
it through the reflection.

105
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:29,187
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

106
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:31,150
We need to get him like a
little mirror so he can see it.

107
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,393
But Ollie loves this movie so
it's keep him nice and quiet.

108
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:35,346
So, yeah, today we are headed

109
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:37,363
up the mountain to Idlewild to explore

110
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:40,082
the little mountain town
for Mimi's birthday.

111
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:42,377
So everyone be sure to
wish Mimi a happy birthday

112
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:43,740
down below in the comments.

113
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,061
This is where she grew up so
it's always fun to come here.

114
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,891
We always do this a couple times a year.

115
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,632
Hang out up there, enjoy
the fresh mountain air.

116
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,947
And there's always fun thing to do.

117
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:53,530
(upbeat music)

118
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:07,363
So, we just got to the lake

119
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,533
where we're doing our
little family picnic.

120
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,243
It's so pretty.

121
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:12,619
Look at that rock up there.

122
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,848
- [Missy] There's fish in the water.

123
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:15,201
- [Bryan] Do you see the fishies, Finn?

124
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:16,034
- Yeah.

125
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:16,867
- [Bryan] Yeah?

126
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,360
- [Finn] Fishies!

127
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,664
- [Missy] (laughs) Fishies!

128
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,505
- [Bryan] Say, "Come here, fishies!"

129
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:23,388
That's so cool, you see
fishies in there, huh?

130
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,479
Uh-oh, we gotta be careful, Ollie.

131
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,509
There's a bear warning here.

132
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,342
- Yeah, that sign says

133
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,437
no bears.

134
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,700
- [Bryan] No, it says
there could be bears.

135
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,303
So we gotta be careful, okay?

136
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:36,136
- [Ollie] Okay.

137
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:36,969
- Okay, come on (laughs).

138
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,405
We're hoping we don't run into any bears

139
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,018
or werewolves for that matter.

140
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,452
It is October, you never know.

141
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:42,863
- I'm not sure about this.

142
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:44,299
- [Bryan] You're not sure about this?

143
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:45,132
- [Ollie] No.

144
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:45,965
- [Bryan] Why?

145
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:46,798
There could be bears.

146
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,102
- [Ollie] We don't wanna wake them up.

147
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,288
- [Bryan] No, we don't
want to wake them up.

148
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,121
What did you find?

149
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,034
- Acorn.

150
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,832
- [Bryan] Oh, it's an acorn.

151
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:53,904
Good find, buddy.

152
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:56,987
(lighthearted music)

153
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:03,534
So, we have nice picnic
set up for all the bees.

154
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,801
- Yeah, we have to walk and eat like this.

155
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,180
(Bryan laughs)

156
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,899
- They're Yellowjackets,
and Yellowjackets love meat.

157
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,282
- [Bryan] Yeah.

158
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:15,728
- I gave them a sacrifice.
I gave them meat,

159
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,203
left it on the table, walked away.

160
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:18,864
(Bryan laughs)
It wasn't enough.

161
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:20,664
- [Bryan] They're still
kind of swarming everywhere.

162
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:21,954
(Bryan laughs)

163
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,550
Finn, what are you eating?

164
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,823
Are those raspberries?

165
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:25,656
- Yeah.

166
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:26,489
- Yum.

167
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:29,072
(upbeat music)

168
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:33,834
Both the boys are watching
them catch them fish.

169
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,608
(laughs) Just don't
fall in the lake, okay?

170
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:39,793
(Finn babbles)

171
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:41,139
Oh, really, what do you see?

172
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,054
(Finn babbles)

173
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:42,887
Oh, cool.

174
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:45,509
Do you have room for that one too?

175
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,212
(laughs)

176
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,503
- Oh, my gosh, that's two in his mouth.

177
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,112
Let's see if we can get a third one in.

178
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:55,355
- [Bryan] How many peanuts
can we fit in his mouth?

179
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,904
So crazy.

180
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:59,239
No way, no way, three?

181
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,640
Oh, he's gonna take that one back.

182
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,682
- [Missy] Say, "I'm a chubby bunny!"

183
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:03,515
(Bryan laughs)

184
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:04,348
- [Papa] Winter's coming.

185
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:05,773
- [Bryan] Don't make fun of him.

186
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:08,084
- [Papa] It's coming,
gotta get ready for it.

187
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:09,791
- He's doing the chubby bunny challenge.

188
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,337
(Bryan laughs)

189
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,218
- [Bryan] Missy is trying
to get over to the rock.

190
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:16,947
And she can only do it
with the help of her dad.

191
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,204
(Bryan laughs)

192
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:19,770
- Hang on, Dad, just hang on.

193
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,265
Hang on to me, guys, hang on.

194
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:23,600
Did it.

195
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,683
- [Bryan] She's so funny.

196
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:28,912
- [Mimi] Did mama get over to the rock?

197
00:06:28,912 --> 00:06:30,589
(Bryan laughs)
- Hi!

198
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,579
- Nice job, babe.

199
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,428
(Ollie grunts)

200
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,646
You can do it, here.

201
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,208
I'll give you a little
boost, grab her hand,

202
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,119
and I'll give you a little boost.

203
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:38,952
There you go.

204
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:39,847
- Get on my hands.

205
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,430
(Ollie whines)

206
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,003
- [Bryan] Don't drop him.

207
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:46,544
Use your feet, Ollie!

208
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:47,466
Hold on, Finn!

209
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,913
You can do it!

210
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,337
- [Finn] Daddy!

211
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:52,535
- You can do it, Ollie!

212
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:53,420
You can do it.

213
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,173
(Finn whines)

214
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,695
(laughs) Hey, Finn wants up there too,

215
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,458
did you guys know (laughs)?

216
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,632
Good job, Ollie.

217
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:00,918
- Okay, now you, Finn.

218
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:02,904
- [Bryan] Finn, do you wanna go up?

219
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:04,154
Good job, Finn.

220
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:06,818
- You can't get me.

221
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:07,741
(Bryan laughs)

222
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,824
(lighthearted music)

223
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,275
- Most of everyone has gotten off the rock

224
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:18,060
and so now Cassie is
stuck with little kids.

225
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,356
And trying to figure out
how to get down (laughs).

226
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,429
(upbeat music)

227
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:25,012
Look at you, Ollie.

228
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:27,830
- [Missy] You did it!

229
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,046
- [Bryan] Yeah!

230
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:31,617
(Ollie screams)
(Bryan laughs)

231
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,557
That was up pretty high.

232
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:36,290
Finn's got the biggest smile on his face.

233
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,195
(laughs) Oh, my gosh.

234
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:39,227
There we go.

235
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,069
Come on, buddy.

236
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,381
Is that cool?

237
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:44,352
- [Missy] Dad, catch
me, I'm gonna jump off.

238
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:47,351
- [Bryan] We just found
a swarm of lady bugs.

239
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:48,342
- They're everywhere.

240
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,276
- [Bryan] I've never
seen anything like this.

241
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,229
I don't know if you guys
can see them down here.

242
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:53,815
But there's just lady bugs.

243
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,073
- [Missy] One, two, three.

244
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:55,923
- [Bryan] They're everywhere.

245
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,631
- [Ollie] Oh, it went on my shoe!

246
00:07:57,631 --> 00:08:01,417
- [Missy] Oh, my goodness,
they're getting on your shoe!

247
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,732
- [Bryan] Whoa, that's so cool.

248
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,390
They must've just hatched or something.

249
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,630
- Yeah, there's tons.

250
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,229
He's on you.

251
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:09,162
- Don't squish him.

252
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:11,237
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

253
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:12,070
- "Don't squish him."

254
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,533
Okay, I'll throw him (laughs).

255
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,366
We're walking around.

256
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,996
This is a lake they have here.

257
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,761
They've got some really cool
trails and bridges and stuff.

258
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:20,168
Definitely is a little low though.

259
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:22,636
'Cause that doesn't have
water but that does.

260
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,219
(gentle music)

261
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:44,799
Missy is putting in all the experience

262
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,204
she got rock climbing
yesterday at the rock gym.

263
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:50,064
And climbing an actual
rock in real life now.

264
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,047
- (pants) I'm a professional!

265
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:52,960
Not yet.

266
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,717
- (laughs) I would probably try

267
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,613
to get up there if I wasn't so sick.

268
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:58,613
Oh, my gosh.

269
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:02,244
Cassie, you look really small up there.

270
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,201
You did it, babe!

271
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,570
How's it feel?

272
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,592
- It feels like I'm gonna throw
up, I'm afraid of heights.

273
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:10,079
- [Bryan] (laughs) Missy just

274
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,163
discovered her fear of heights.

275
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,470
She's freaking out.

276
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,929
All three of them are up there.

277
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,900
- I think there's a jump.

278
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,691
- [Bryan] That's the only
way down is into the water?

279
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,730
- [Missy] Yeah.

280
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,828
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie, I
can't find Mama anywhere.

281
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:22,904
Do you know where she is?

282
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:23,867
- Up there!

283
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,367
- [Bryan] What is she doing up there?

284
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:26,632
- [Ollie] I don't know!

285
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,101
- [Bryan] (laughs)
She's doing what you do.

286
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,157
That weird zen mode thing
he gets in (laughs).

287
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:33,552
- [Ollie] How did you get up there, Mama?

288
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:35,969
- I don't know, I don't know.

289
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,734
- [Mimi] How you getting down, Mama?

290
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:39,960
- I don't know, I don't know.

291
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,306
- You can jump from there.

292
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,077
- Okay, I'll just jump.

293
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:45,994
- [Bryan] Yeah, she can just
jump from this giant rock.

294
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,984
That is the only way
she'll be able to get down.

295
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:50,875
(laughs) Okay, have fun, bye!

296
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,032
Say, "Bye, Mama!"

297
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:53,255
- Bye, Mama!

298
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:54,757
(Finn whines)

299
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:56,490
- Finn's not okay with that idea.

300
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,431
- [Bryan] Okay, so
doctors who are currently

301
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,168
treating these three crazy kids.

302
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:02,547
This is how they hurt themselves,

303
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:03,504
climbing down the rock.

304
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:06,182
I'm filming this so
that they have a record.

305
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:09,548
(Bryan laughs)

306
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:10,456
Oh, my gosh.

307
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,000
- [Papa] One more right here.

308
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,401
- [Bryan] Got it.

309
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:14,639
- [Papa] Down further.

310
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,730
- See, I would've never

311
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,526
have gone up here if dad wasn't here.

312
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:18,907
Like, I don't do that.

313
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:21,243
- [Bryan] (laughs) He does have a way

314
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:23,395
of getting us out of sticky situations.

315
00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:27,667
- [Papa] Okay, there's
another one way down here.

316
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,250
(gentle music)

317
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,866
- [Bryan] He's pulling your foot,

318
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:40,367
he's pulling your foot (laughs).

319
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,745
- I feel like a cat right now.

320
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,835
No, don't pull me down!

321
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,713
- [Bryan] She did it, free!

322
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,910
(laughs) That's quite the rock.

323
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,095
What are we doing?

324
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,505
- We're practicing our cartwheels.

325
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:54,595
I'm gonna show all these
people younger than me

326
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:55,854
that I can do it!

327
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,430
- [Bryan] All right, Ollie's
gonna do it real quick.

328
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,956
You do it first, Ollie.

329
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:01,266
That was close.

330
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,311
Oh, that was close too.

331
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,894
Both were very valiant efforts.

332
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:07,386
Okay, all right.

333
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:09,178
- Okay, Jimmy.

334
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:10,784
- [Bryan] You got this, Jimmy.

335
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:11,617
Let's see.

336
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:15,525
Okay.
- I mean, it was a round off.

337
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:16,858
Round off again.

338
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,282
- [Mimi] To beat a bet right here.

339
00:11:19,282 --> 00:11:21,260
- [Bryan] Finn's still trying
in the background (laughs).

340
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,093
Ready.

341
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:24,478
- I can't do it.

342
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,898
- [Bryan] Oh, wow, yes, okay.

343
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:29,785
- Did I do it?

344
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:30,618
All right, let us know

345
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:31,775
in the comments who did the best one.

346
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,084
- [Bryan] Who did the best cartwheel?

347
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:34,256
- Missy, Jimmy, or Cassie.

348
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:36,412
- [Bryan] Or Ollie or Finn, okay?

349
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:37,294
- And Ollie or Finn.

350
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,930
- [Bryan] Finn, show me
your cartwheel, buddy.

351
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,551
Show me your cartwheel, Finn.

352
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,868
Yeah!

353
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,061
- [Ollie] I can run!

354
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:47,825
- [Bryan] Good flip,
Finn, good flip (laughs).

355
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:50,866
Whoa (laughs).

356
