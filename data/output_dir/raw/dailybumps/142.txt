1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,784
- There is ash falling from the sky.

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:05,011
Oh my gosh, this is really unfortunate

3
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:06,493
it's Missy's birthday and we wanna

4
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:08,102
be like having a good day we're preparing

5
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:11,654
for a huge party and we may
have to leave our house.

6
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:14,237
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,853
- We should do the bath challenge.

8
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:22,686
- [Bryan] We should?

9
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:23,519
- Yeah.

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,352
- [Bryan] Yeah, you wanna do

11
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:25,643
the bath challenge Halloween edition?

12
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,476
- Yeah.

13
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:27,593
♫ This is our life

14
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:29,093
♫ This is our fun

15
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:31,261
♫ This is who we are

16
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,412
♫ This is our dream

17
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:33,687
♫ This is our team

18
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:36,021
♫ Shot among the stars

19
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,318
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

20
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,820
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

21
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,799
♫ This is our life

22
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,892
♫ Let's live it

23
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:47,050
♫ Live it forever

24
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,117
- Happy birthday mama.

25
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:50,216
- [Bryan] Happy birthday to mama.

26
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,049
- Thank you, big hugs.

27
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:56,357
- [Bryan] Luna's getting in there, love.

28
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,161
- This morning Ollie woke up, he said,

29
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:01,714
happy birthday mama I'm gonna
give you a big special hug.

30
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,866
- Aw, happy birthday babe.

31
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:04,699
- Thanks.

32
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:05,773
- We have just been hanging out

33
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:07,401
and getting ready for our party.

34
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,606
And watching the news about
the fire which is frustrating.

35
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:13,027
If you guys didn't see
our video yesterday,

36
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:14,544
I'll have it linked in the
I-card so you can watch it.

37
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:17,028
There's a very large fire
very close to our house.

38
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:19,255
Everyone around us is being evacuated

39
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:21,495
we are now in the evacuation warning zone.

40
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:24,478
Which means that if they say that.

41
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:25,311
- Like be ready.

42
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:26,308
- Yeah we have to, we have to,

43
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:28,344
like get everything ready to go.

44
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:29,199
'Cause if they come to our house

45
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:32,263
and tell us we have to
leave, we have to leave, so.

46
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:34,319
- Yeah, I'm pretty stressed right now.

47
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,735
I don't feel like were at all

48
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,094
at risk of our house being burned down.

49
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:39,869
- No I don't think the fire
is, is close enough anymore.

50
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:40,999
- But we are at risk that like

51
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,855
we'll have road closures, power outages,

52
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,929
things like that which I honestly

53
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,238
feel for everyone who there
house is being threatened.

54
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,197
Which I don't think any structures

55
00:01:49,197 --> 00:01:50,263
are being threatened at the moment.

56
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:51,623
- No, none are being threatened right now.

57
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:52,937
They're kind of just clearing way

58
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:54,603
so that they can get through
the streets and stuff.

59
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:56,267
- But that could mean that all

60
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,891
this work that I'm putting into

61
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:58,724
this party that I'm still probably

62
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:01,864
gonna be doing all day
today, may be for nothing.

63
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:04,582
Which is really stressful, I just

64
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,486
feel like defeated right now.

65
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:08,015
- Yeah, okay, yeah we should probably

66
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:09,526
just like get a basket of all our

67
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:11,959
our certificates and passports, right.

68
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:12,792
- [Missy] Yeah.

69
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,054
- Should probably start doing something.

70
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:20,017
I know, I know, alright boys
we may have to leave okay.

71
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:20,949
- [Finn] 'Kay.

72
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:24,319
- [Bryan] So Ollie pack up
all your favorite toys 'kay.

73
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,699
- I already did.

74
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:26,993
- Oh you already did, he actually

75
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:28,235
already did I saw him carrying

76
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,449
a bag with all his toys in it today.

77
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,353
Alright so you're ready
if we have to evacuate?

78
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,186
- Yeah.

79
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,545
- [Bryan] Okay, Finn, you
got your favorite toys?

80
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:36,378
- Yeah.

81
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,361
- So normally our cars are in the garage

82
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:39,435
but because we're putting the maze

83
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,635
they're all parked outside which

84
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,921
means they are basically
all covered in ash,

85
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:46,588
let me show you, all
of this, is ash, crazy.

86
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:48,845
- [Bryan] Yeah it's like all over here.

87
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:50,579
- And honestly, there's no smell.

88
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,732
Like you can't smell the fire, whatsoever,

89
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,484
there's no like smoke in the air.

90
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,488
We've smelt many fires, you know,

91
00:02:57,488 --> 00:02:59,282
in our time in living in California.

92
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:01,707
There's always like oh
no is that like a fire.

93
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:03,339
But there's one like so close

94
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,273
to the house, and I smell nothing.

95
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,411
Obviously that means the wind

96
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,099
is like blowing another direction.

97
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,123
Which is a good thing, I think too,

98
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,403
because obviously then the fire's

99
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:12,529
not going to come towards us.

100
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:13,777
If the wind is going the other way.

101
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,186
But it's all just very overwhelming.

102
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,003
- [Bryan] I have a safe with all

103
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:20,418
of our, like passports
and birth certificates.

104
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:21,555
Then I have a big basket with

105
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:23,156
all our like, important house stuff

106
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,131
and business stuff, all ready to go.

107
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:27,509
I have a tech bag all ready to go.

108
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:30,651
With chargers and laptops
and stuff like that.

109
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:31,761
So now I think the only thing

110
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:32,675
we would have to do if we had

111
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:34,035
to leave was throw some clothes

112
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:35,923
in a suitcase and get the animals.

113
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:38,274
And then take our cars and go.

114
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:40,235
Just sucks, this sucks you guys.

115
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:42,667
This is really unfortunate I,

116
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,242
it's Missy's birthday and we wanna

117
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,709
be like having a good day we're

118
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,515
preparing for a huge party and

119
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:49,826
we may have to leave our house.

120
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:52,395
I feel really bad for Missy mostly,

121
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:54,482
if we have to cancel the party.

122
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:56,194
Because we've put a lot of time

123
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,802
into it, we've put a lot of money into it.

124
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:59,515
We're really excited about it.

125
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:00,907
And it would definitely be a damper

126
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,188
on the whole thing if we
had to cancel the party, so.

127
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:05,021
I'm just hoping that they get

128
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,756
control of the fire today, if they

129
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,413
get control of the fire we won't have to

130
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,580
leave our house, we won't have to take

131
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,389
all this stuff with us, right.

132
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:12,233
- Yeah.

133
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,140
- [Bryan] Yeah we don't wanna
leave, we like our house, huh.

134
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,973
- Yeah.

135
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,348
- [Bryan] Yeah, I love you.

136
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,874
You guys probably can't see it at all.

137
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:19,867
But I literally just noticed there

138
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,292
is ash falling from the sky, right now.

139
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:26,125
Oh my gosh, what a great
birthday for my wife.

140
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:30,554
Okay I just spoke with our neighbor.

141
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,290
It seems like everything is fine.

142
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,506
The people who had mandatory evactions,

143
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:35,899
deeper near the fire, can't even

144
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,258
see the fire anymore, they're still

145
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:38,818
at their house and everything is fine.

146
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:39,952
So I think we're good and they're

147
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:42,083
actually gonna start letting
people up our street again.

148
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,592
They're moving everything so I think

149
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,146
we're in the safe zone which is good.

150
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,626
I have everything packed still and ready.

151
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:50,330
But today we can actually
focus on the Halloween

152
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,833
party, we are throwing
a huge Halloween party.

153
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,852
And it's gonna be so much fun.

154
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:55,810
And I'm so excited for you guys

155
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,714
to see our costumes and
everyone and everything, so.

156
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:00,714
That's what we're preparing for today.

157
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:03,881
(upbeat creepy music)

158
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,189
Alright you guys we have been

159
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:13,869
decorating for the Halloween party.

160
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:17,921
And we got a special guest
here, Ollie who are you?

161
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:18,964
- Ninja Turtle.

162
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:21,551
- That's right Raphael in the flesh

163
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:25,718
let's see your ninja moves,
whoa, you look so cool dude.

164
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:35,049
Oh Finn, oh, we got Mickey and the

165
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:38,670
Roadster Racers, what's
up dude, come here.

166
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,658
- [Missy] Look at you you're so cute.

167
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:45,713
- [Bryan] Are you a
Mickey race car driver?

168
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,796
- [Missy] You both fell over.

169
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:47,967
- [Bryan] You look so cute.

170
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:48,800
- (mumbles)

171
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,423
- We should do the bath challenge.

172
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:51,363
- [Bryan] We should?

173
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,196
- Yeah.

174
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:54,091
- [Bryan] You wanna do the bath
challenge Halloween edition?

175
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:55,403
- Yeah.

176
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:56,855
- So we're decorating for the haunted

177
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,271
maze in here, it's not complete,

178
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,697
but there is one piece
we're gonna show you

179
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,325
that I think the boys are
really gonna like, that's
