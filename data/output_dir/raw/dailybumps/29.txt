- Good morning.

3
00:00:02,493 --> 00:00:04,067
- Happy birthday.

4
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:05,518
- Thank you.

- [All] Good morning.

17
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,892
- Good morning Ollie, how
are you feeling today?

18
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:31,725
- Good.

19
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:32,797
- Good?

20
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,716
He has no fever today.

21
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:36,532
I think he is all better,

22
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:38,058
and it seems to have lasted like 24 hours.

23
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:41,090
He had a fever all day yesterday.

24
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,133
We've been keeping up on
his medicine and stuff.

25
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,030
But he looks good, so now you
get to play with your friends.

26
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,674
We've got Carl and Ginger's kids over.

27
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,971
We got Luke and Gage and
Kyle's probably somewhere.

28
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:53,780
And it is, guess what?

29
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,131
What is today?

30
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,714
- Daddy's birthday.

31
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:01,173
- So we're going to make
him some breakfast right?

32
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:02,006
- [Finn] Yeah.

33
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:04,328
- We're making our famous pancakes.

34
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:07,034
So we've got the old
fashioned, plain pancakes.

35
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,874
We've got chocolate with chocolate chips.

36
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,354
And then we've got over here,

37
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:15,727
chocolate chips but there
is banana all in it.

38
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:16,729
He loves banana.

39
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:19,519
So I think he's going
to love this breakfast,

40
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,440
and we're gonna go ahead
and start cooking now.

41
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,857
(soft music)

42
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:49,037
Alright, he's out and about.

43
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:51,570
He's still working on his birthday, so.

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,696
- Thanks, babe.

45
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,170
- [Missy] You got smiley face

46
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,535
banana chocolate chip pancakes.

47
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:58,087
- So cute.

48
00:01:58,087 --> 00:01:59,633
- [Missy] Finn, how do
you like the pancakes?

49
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:00,599
- Um, good.

50
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,984
- [Missy] Good? Okay, good.

51
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:05,410
Alright, breakfast is done
and I am now baking cakes

52
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,282
for Bryan and he actually asked
for something very specific.

53
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:10,250
I think he's asked for
it probably every year,

54
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,121
and I just can't imagine making it

55
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,114
because it just doesn't
sound appetizing to me,

56
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,882
but I think to a lot of
people, they're going to think

57
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:18,282
wow, this is gonna be delicious.

58
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:21,712
But anyways, I'm making a
three layer chocolate cake

59
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:24,712
with raspberry filling inside of it.

60
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:27,373
Which does not sound good to me,

61
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:30,768
but he's always wanted it,
so I'm making it right now.

62
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:32,488
And the raspberry is gonna be

63
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:34,216
hopefully from scratch if I can get--

64
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:35,802
This doesn't seem like very many,

65
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,831
so my dad's bringing up
some more raspberries,

66
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:38,916
but we'll see how much he makes,

67
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,886
but he does want it seedless.

68
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:42,092
Which means I have to strain it all

69
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:43,405
and get all the seeds out

70
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,103
before I can actually make the sauce,

71
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:48,093
so we'll see how it turns out.

72
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,510
(soft music)

73
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:05,710
- The zip line.

74
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,480
- [Bryan] Yeah, it is a
beautiful day out here,

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,480
so we are showing Gage,
Luke, and Kyle our zip line.

76
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,440
Have you ever done a zip line, Luke?

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,520
- Um, I have once and I fell off.

78
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,150
- [Bryan] Well this one
we're really safe with.

79
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,690
Make sure there's lots of supervision.

80
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,523
Are you excited?

81
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:23,990
- Yeah, I'm super excited.

82
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:28,097
- Was that fun?

83
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:29,460
- Yeah.

84
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,820
- [Bryan] You did so good, Finn.

85
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,220
Aw, this is so cool.

86
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,180
Hanging with my boys on my birthday.

87
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,680
Check out the sky too,
it's like a beautiful day.

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,930
Alright, here comes Kyle.

89
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,640
He might be a little big.

90
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,983
Keep your feet up.

91
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:49,910
Feet up.

92
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,590
He did it.

93
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,190
I don't think anyone heavier
than him could even try.

94
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,370
We kind of designed it
for like, four year olds.

95
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,770
- It's a zip line in the backyard.

96
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,040
- I know, how cool is that?

97
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,930
- Let's do this.

98
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,970
- Woo, let him go.

99
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,203
Whoa.

100
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,850
Nice catch.

101
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,970
How was that Ollie?

102
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,937
- Was that fun?

103
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:14,910
- Yeah.

104
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,029
- You know what you kind of sound like

105
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,879
when you're coming down
on that wire, Ollie?

106
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,320
He sounds like a TIE
fighter from Star Wars.

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,180
Doesn't it?

108
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,569
Oh hey Finn, what are you doing?

109
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,470
Finn just found this piece of wood.

110
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,880
And he's like, I'm just
gonna sit here and chill.

111
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,940
I love you, dude.

112
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,760
You know where those gold shoes are from?

113
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,593
- What?

114
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:35,920
- [Bryan] From my EP release party.

115
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,753
- Oh really?

116
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:37,950
- [Bryan] For like a lion, yeah.

117
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,260
I think those were the
ones that Ollie wore.

118
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,060
- Vote down in the comments
below, who has cooler shoes?

119
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,987
- [Bryan] Finn's like,
mine are pretty cool.

120
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,570
(upbeat music)

121
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,360
- Okay, the raspberry sauce seems

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,420
to have turned out pretty good.

123
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,680
It's pretty thick, it's not a ton though,

124
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,460
so hopefully it's enough,

125
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,990
and I'm trying to make a three layer.

126
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,260
I've got one layer here,

127
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,050
the other layer completely fell apart,

128
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,050
and so my dad came up with
oil and three of these.

129
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,770
So I have two Ghirardelli boxes in here,

130
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,220
and I'm hoping they turn out better.

131
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,402
You think they're going to be better?

132
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:24,235
- Yeah.

133
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:27,220
- Yeah, so I think I'm gonna
finish with this one as well.

134
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,960
That way, maybe I'll just make this one

135
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,400
a regular chocolate cake
because I can't believe

136
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,320
I'm going to put raspberry in
my delicious chocolate cake.

137
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,480
- Alright, we're winding
down and watching some shows.

138
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,150
Finn cannot even keep his eyes open.

139
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,590
- He's almost out.

140
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,679
- And...I think we lost him.

141
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,320
(music box melody)

142
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,170
Good night, Finn.

143
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,720
- Alright, the birthday
celebrations are starting to begin.

144
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,210
I mean, we've been celebrating all day,

145
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,370
but we've got this delicious cake.

146
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,270
It was going to be three, now it's two,

147
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,845
because it's started falling apart.

148
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:21,046
And we attempted to make
a 28 but you can't tell.

149
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:26,046
Now it just looks ridiculous.

150
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,170
- Papa, can you go grab
the gasoline please?

151
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,870
We're just going to douse
it in one shot, you know.

152
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm trying, I'm getting
them primed, the wicks.

153
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,590
- Okay, this is actually
ridiculous, like...

154
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,996
- Yeah, who bought these
candles? They have no wicks.

155
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:44,012
- [Camerawoman] Where's
that blow torch you had?

156
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:45,920
- It's at the barn.

157
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,170
- We actually just pulled
the tops off of some Q-tips.

158
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,003
- Now you're not going to know

159
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:51,685
if it's white chocolate or wax.

160
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:53,156
(laughing)

161
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:55,739
(upbeat music)

162
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:02,260
- See, these candles are basically done

163
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,580
and those ones aren't lit yet.

164
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,413
- Okay, ready?

165
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:06,661
Okay, three, two, one,

00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:11,312

- Wait, last one, last one.

172
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,843
- Oh my god.

173
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:31,676
Hurry, it's about to go out.

174
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:33,050

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,660
- Thanks buddy, high five.

179
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:50,589
Come here.

180
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:53,189
- [Camerawoman] Bryan, I
hope your wishes come true.

181
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,518
(babbling)

182
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,402
- What are you saying?

183
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,020
(babbling)

184
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,853
- What?

185
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,920
What is this noise you're
making with your mouth?

186
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,710
Alright, Missy made me a very yummy cake,

187
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,010
and I'm so excited.

188
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,890
- What do you mean?

189
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,020
- I don't know, it took me really all day.

190
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,524
- [Bryan] I'm sorry.

191
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:19,357
Ooooh.

192
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,720
- [Child] I want one, I want one.

193
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,870
- How's that look, Finn?

194
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,703
- Good.

195
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,000
- That looks so good.

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,060
It has a raspberry filling too?

197
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,893
- [Missy] Yep.

198
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:31,830
It's raspberry filling.

199
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,230
- [Bryan] Thanks, babe.

200
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,419
- [Missy] Okay, how is it?

201
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,359
Oh, he's been trying it?

202
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,380
What do you think?

203
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,630
- Finn always gets the first bite.

204
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,462
- [Missy] Good?

205
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:40,295
Yeah.

206
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,056
- [Missy] He's like, it
tastes like chocolate cake.

207
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,220
- Good, good.

208
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,680
That's what he said.

209
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,170
This raspberry filling looks dope.

210
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:52,651
- [Missy] Is it good?

211
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:53,484
- Yes.

212
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:54,317
- [Missy] It's not--

213
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,830
- It reminds me of the chocolate
tower cake at PF Chang's.

214
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,922
- [Missy] Oh, yeah.

215
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:00,830
And that's a very dark chocolate.

216
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,850
What do you think of the dark chocolate?

217
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,330
It seemed very dark chocolate.

218
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,163
- I love it.

219
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:05,996
- Mine, mine.

220
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:07,539
- What?

221
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,372
No, mine.

222
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,691
- Mine.

223
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:10,619
No, mine.

224
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:15,619
- Oh, is that one yours?

225
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,850
I love this guy, you're so funny.

226
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,586
Okay Finn, you feed me now, okay?

227
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,460
- [Missy] Okay, feed Daddy.

228
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,293
Good job.

229
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:26,890
That's so nice of you.

230
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,309
- Feed Daddy again.

231
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,303
- No, mine.

232
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,780
- Oh, is that one yours?

233
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,730
- [Missy] No, mine.

234
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,590
Alright, it is finally present time.

235
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,230
Bryan has been looking
at this giant present.

236
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,436
- Finn, are you so excited?

237
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:43,269
- Yeah.

238
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:44,102
- [Missy] Do you know what it is?

239
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:45,150
- Yeah.

240
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,250
- [Missy] Don't say, okay?

241
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,083
- Okay.

242
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:47,916
- [Missy] It's a secret.

243
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,100
- Okay.

244
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,010
- I think this present is
almost taller than you,

245
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,190
it's as big as you are.

246
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,330
Come here, how about you?

247
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,327
Oh see, you're taller.

248
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:02,270
- [Missy] You're definitely taller.

249
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,640
- Okay, should I open it?

250
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,862
What are these?

251
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:06,410
- [Missy] Um, just other presents.

252
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,870
You should probably
open the big one first.

253
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,703
- Oh, okay.

254
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:11,320
It's like a match.

255
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,330
- [Missy] We wrapped it good, huh Ollie.

256
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,670
- Did you boys help mama?

257
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,171
- Yeah.

258
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:20,328
- What is it?

259
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,160
- Oh my god, whoa.

260
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,330
- [Missy] It's a telescope.

261
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,680
- Oh my god, are you serious?

262
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,540
- [Missy] Yeah.

263
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,100
- Look at this.

264
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,280
- [Missy] He's been asking for
a telescope for a while now.

265
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,540
- This is so cool babe.

266
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,020
I would love being outside and like,

267
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,300
we look with our phones
and see certain things.

268
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,133
- [Missy] Yeah.

269
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:40,966
And this one will literally,

270
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,280
you'll say, I want to see Jupiter,

271
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,350
it'll find Jupiter and
like, show it to you.

272
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,410
- Are you kidding me?

273
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,420
That is amazing.

274
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,770
- [Missy] Yay, he likes it.

275
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:53,064
- Thanks guys.

276
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:58,612
- [Missy] He's like,
thanks I picked it out.

277
00:10:58,612 --> 00:10:59,945
- Mimi and Papa.

278
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:02,304
- Don't you guys know?

279
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:04,221
This is my baby shower.

280
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,022
- What is that?

281
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,605
- I don't even know what it is.

282
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,572
Power tank.

283
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:17,060
Oh it's a mobile power
station with a spotlight

284
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,810
for the telescope.

285
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,710
- [Missy] Nice.

286
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,300
- Perfect, thanks guys.

287
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,580
Another one?

288
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,480
Okay what's this one, what's this one?

289
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,340
Oh, it's a smartphone holder.

290
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,616
- [Missy] Oh that's so funny.

291
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:31,449
- That's so cool.

292
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,207
- [Missy] That's cool.

293
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,610
It'll attach to the--

294
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,930
- It's the most high-tech telescope ever.

295
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,143
That's crazy.

296
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:38,980
- [Missy] Yeah, you
can set it up somewhere

297
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,560
and you can look at stars.

298
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,920
- Alright, we are now
getting ready to head out.

299
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,530
We are having a little
birthday dinner for moi,

300
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,660
and we're all ready for the night.

301
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,910
These boys are going to bed.

302
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,840
That's right.

303
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,890
- [Missy] You're tired, you're tired.

304
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,996
- [Bryan] You tired buddy?

305
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:57,260
Yeah.

306
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,990
Kyle, I love your batman PJs.

307
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,170
You look so dope, dude.

308
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,930
Hey boys, you want to end the vlog?

309
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,960
- Yeah.

310
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,520
- Say, thanks for watching.

311
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,550
(babbles)

312
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,400
- Say, give the video a thumbs up.

313
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,740
Subscribe, and we'll see you mañana.

314
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,490
What do you say?

315
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,178
- Bye.

316
00:12:19,178 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
