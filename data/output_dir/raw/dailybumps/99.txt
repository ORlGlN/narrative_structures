00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:28,238
- How do you look for Fred?

6
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:29,993
- Good morning!

7
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:32,508
These boys are looking for Fred.

8
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,195
Like always.

9
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:35,861
- Oh Fred.

10
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:36,938
- [Bryan] Where is he?

11
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:37,952
- [Ollie] I don't know.

12
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:39,117
- [Bryan] Is he in there?

13
00:00:39,117 --> 00:00:39,950
- No.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,783
- Not in the bathroom?

15
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:42,055
Alright, let's keep looking.

16
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:43,565
Good morning you guys.

17
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:45,404
It's a beautiful day.

18
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:47,008
Boys are looking for
their elf on the shelf.

19
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,192
He's up to no good.

20
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:49,883
- Fred's not in here.

21
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,606
- [Bryan] Nope, not in here.

22
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:53,334
- I think he's in my room.

23
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:55,947
- Okay, go check your room.

24
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:57,841
I seriously just love
when they work together

25
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:58,743
and play together.

26
00:00:58,743 --> 00:00:59,755
It's so cute.

27
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,450
And they use their imagination together.

28
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,867
He's not in here?

29
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:04,985
- Fred!

30
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,634
- Oh, you found him?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,165
- [Bryan] What's he doing?

32
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:12,439
- He's on the Christmas
tree and have notes.

33
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,051
- [Bryan] There he is.

34
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:16,681
Oh Ollie, he has your guys' letters

35
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:18,234
that you wrote last night.

36
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:21,092
But look it, they're
like miniature versions.

37
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:22,190
- [Ollie] Don't touch him.

38
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,880
- [Bryan] I didn't touch
him, I touched your ornament.

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,215
Look.

40
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,878
This is what your Christmas letter wrote.

41
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:31,151
And Santa wrote something on the back.

42
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,335
You know how you wrote
Santa a letter yesterday?

43
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:34,354
- Yeah.

44
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:36,114
- [Bryan] Well Santa
replied and turned it into

45
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:37,145
like a little ornament.

46
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:38,214
Do you want me to read it to you?

47
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:39,114
- Yeah.

48
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:40,639
- [Bryan] It says Ollie, I am well

49
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,131
and chocolate chip is my favorite.

50
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,714
Merry Christmas, Santa.

51
00:01:43,714 --> 00:01:45,940
Whoa that is so cool, huh?

52
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,309
(Finn babbles)

53
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:48,857
Your is up there too buddy.

54
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:50,856
And here is Finn's letter.

55
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:53,770
And look it's all shrunk and cute.

56
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,083
And Santa wrote on yours too Fin.

57
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,528
He said Finn, ho ho ho.

58
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,863
Keep being a good boy.

59
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:01,393
Merry Christmas, Santa.

60
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:03,304
That's so cool dudes.

61
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:05,794
So now we get to keep
these letters forever, huh?

62
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,377
(bright music)

63
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:15,590
You know what I just realized Ollie.

64
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,644
- What?

65
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:17,593
- We haven't caught anything

66
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:19,973
in our Christmas cage in a long time, huh?

67
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,806
- Yeah.

68
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:24,472
- I wonder Ollie, if we
should set some bait?

69
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,533
- Yeah.
- Do you know

70
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,669
what bait is?

71
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,062
- What?
- So bait is when

72
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,961
you put something underneath it

73
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:32,893
and then it will attract something
and then we can catch it.

74
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:35,937
- And then the animals will eat the bait.

75
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:37,585
- [Bryan] Yep, alright
Ollie, what do you think

76
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:39,728
we should put under the
Christmas cage as bait?

77
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,003
- Basghetti and candy!

78
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:43,342
- [Bryan] Spaghetti and candy?

79
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:44,232
- Yeah.

80
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,865
- That'd be so weird.

81
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,716
What are you trying to catch?

82
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:50,248
Alright, let's go make some bait.

83
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:52,682
Hey Finn, you wanna make
some Christmas bait with us?

84
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:53,573
- [Finn] Yeah.

85
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,963
- Alright, let's go.

86
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:57,546
(bright music)

87
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:06,000
Alright boys, we have our base ingredient,

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,486
which is what you requested
Ollie, spaghetti, right?

89
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:12,671
We're gonna add a little
bit of maple syrup to it?

90
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,226
I'm not sure what we're
gonna catch you guys,

91
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,517
but all I know is
spaghetti and maple syrup,

92
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:18,718
uh yeah, that sounds amazing.

93
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:20,942
So I was also thinking, Ollie,

94
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:22,888
why don't we just throw in
a couple of other things.

95
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,933
So I have some candy there.

96
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,278
I have got some chocolate chips,

97
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:29,414
some more candy, candy canes, I figured.

98
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:32,123
So why don't you just take
a little and sprinkle it on?

99
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:32,956
There you go.

100
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,890
'Cause we're trying to
catch something fun, right?

101
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,011
We wanna catch something
that is really happy and fun

102
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,183
and likes to joke around.

103
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,737
So we're gonna make the bait reflect them.

104
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:42,763
- Make it once!

105
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,005
- Whoo.
- Oh!

106
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:45,385
Alrighty Finny, put
some chocolate chips on.

107
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,159
We want our new friend
to like chocolate, right?

108
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,857
Which is why we also have M&Ms.

109
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:53,559
By the way, these are the
holiday peanut butter ones.

110
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,870
Which I love.

111
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,479
- [Missy] Does this
look good to you Ollie?

112
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,517
Would you eat this?

113
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:58,752
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

114
00:03:58,752 --> 00:03:59,835
Um.

115
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:02,418
(bright music)

116
00:04:08,952 --> 00:04:10,637
- Finn's just eating the chocolate chips.

117
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:11,666
(Missy and Bryan laughing)

118
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,017
- [Missy] Are those good?

119
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:13,850
- Yeah.

120
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,828
- Okay, we almost have
our Christmas bait ready.

121
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:17,795
I'm just gonna put a couple of candy,

122
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:19,161
Christmas canes in here.

123
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:22,153
Because I want our new
friend to really enjoy

124
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:23,416
the spirit of Christmas.

125
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,010
So now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna place this

126
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,234
underneath the Christmas
cage and hopefully

127
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,179
catch something fun, right guys?

128
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:30,628
Okay, let's go put it under.

129
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:31,461
- Yep.

130
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:34,051
- Alright, we have our bait.

131
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,528
And then we also have our maple syrup.

132
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,857
I figure, you know why not
just include this also?

133
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:40,315
So you boys stay right here, okay?

134
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:41,148
- [Ollie] Okay.

135
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,623
- Daddy's gonna walk
under the Christmas cage,

136
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,680
which looks so festive and fun.

137
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,151
Okay, so this is it.

138
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,224
I'm just gonna set the bait.

139
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:49,605
- That's the drink.

140
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:50,717
- Yeah, oh that'll be the drink

141
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:51,609
and that'll be the food?

142
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:52,787
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

143
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:54,013
So now that we have that all set up

144
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:55,219
underneath the Christmas cage,

145
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:57,386
all we have to do is wait.

146
00:04:58,442 --> 00:04:59,685
That's fun, right?
- Yep.

147
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:00,574
- Okay.

148
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:03,157
(upbeat music)

149
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,983
- Go Finn, go.

150
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,612
Go Finn, go!

151
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:09,502
Are you riding?

152
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:10,668
(laughs)

153
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:12,578
Ollie's riding his bike.

154
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,388
The boys are being so cute today.

155
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:16,709
Finn usually rides his little red bike,

156
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,185
but I thought I'd get out the stride one.

157
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,306
He's like I don't get it.

158
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,822
It's really hard to do.

159
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,744
I'm sure he's like I can't even go fast.

160
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,935
Ollie's doing great on his.

161
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:26,513
It is a beautiful day though today.

162
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:27,934
Definitely not cold at all.

163
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:30,371
And that's just how it is
in December in California.

164
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,690
Actually it feels really nice.

165
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,344
But I will say we had a
lot of threats and worries

166
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:36,322
about fires yesterday.

167
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,522
And it seems like everything
has basically cleared up.

168
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:40,814
Which I know there's a lot
of fires still in California,

169
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:43,165
and it is really sad and devastating.

170
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:45,957
But as far as the ones that
have been threats near our home,

171
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:48,835
not near us I guess specifically,
but near friends of ours

172
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:52,504
in the area, that fire seems
to be basically contained.

173
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:55,874
And then there's another
one about 30 minutes away.

174
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:57,920
And I think that one is almost one too.

175
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,945
It was just so devastating though,

176
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,012
watching a lot of that
footage on Twitter last night.

177
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,541
And the winds had been crazy.

178
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,291
But today, no wind, totally calm.

179
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,057
So hopefully that'll mean good things

180
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:10,374
for the fire season right now.

181
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,829
But wow, look guys, it's fall here

182
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:16,613
because there are leaves
all over our pool. (laughs)

183
00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:18,474
The leaves are finally starting to fall.

184
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,543
Look, that tree is all bare.

185
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:22,903
Look, all the leaves are gone.

186
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:24,403
How crazy is that?

187
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,185
It's turning into fall here.

188
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:30,242
Little late, but that's okay.

189
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:34,968
(playfully pensive music)
(doorbell rings)

190
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,385
- Oh, that's fun.

191
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,883
Santa!

192
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:48,116
Santa?

193
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,533
Oh, that's wrong.

194
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:52,186
There we go.

195
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:53,887
Fred, how's it going?

196
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:55,305
We miss ya at the North Pole.

197
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,805
Hear you're doing a great job.

198
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:02,039
Ooo, no narwhals?

199
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,579
Oh my goodness, it's so festive.

200
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:09,894
- Uh Buddy, what are we doing here?

201
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:11,727
- I smell maple syrup.

202
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:29,182
- (gasps) The Christmas cage.

203
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,303
- Boys, boys did you hear it?

204
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,359
Did you hear the jingle bells?

205
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,192
- Yeah.

206
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,812
- I think we caught something
in the Christmas cage.

207
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:34,645
- Oh yeah.

208
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:35,515
- Let's go check.

209
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:38,050
It's the great Christmas capture time!

210
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,883
What is it?

211
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:39,716
Go look, go look.

212
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:41,352
- I'm so sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

213
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:43,210
- He didn't mean anything,
he didn't mean anything.

214
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,979
- [Bryan] Buddy, the elf!

215
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,642
What are you doing here?

216
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,754

(Bryan laughs)

224
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,090

He got caught in our Christmas cage.

229
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,410
And Jovie, so what did you bring?

230

00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:30,691

- [Ollie] You're welcome.

246
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:39,025

- And he is doing

248
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:42,626
some decorating with Jovie.

249
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:43,696

250
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:44,530

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,015

00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:49,917

266
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:07,741

267
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:08,664
- No, I did not.

268
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:09,703
- I know, we've watched your movie

269
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:11,121

270
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:12,398

275
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,637
- Thank you.
- Look at how cute those are.

276
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,782
- Isn't that festive?

277
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:09,365
(bright music)

278
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,751
- [Bryan] Alright Finn, show

279
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,309
Can you pick it up and show us?

280
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,862
- Whoa, that's so good.

281
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,731

285
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:38,908
- [Bryan] Alright Ollie, let's see yours.

286
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:41,164
It is looking so good.

287
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:45,101
I love the hair and the
gloves and the shoes.

288
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:48,113
Lots of red, 'cause that's
your favorite color, huh?

289
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,979
Oh you really wanna eat it?

290
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:51,729
Alright, take a bite.

291
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:54,719
(laughing)

292
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,595
- [Missy] That was a leg.

293
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:58,373
- [Bryan] Alright Buddy,

294
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,334
- Here's mine.

295
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:00,654
- [Bryan] It's perfect.

296
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:01,487
- I'm a little disappointed.

297
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,489
Papa Elf can do way better.

298
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:04,718
- [Bryan] Buddy, come on.

299
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:06,509
That's beautiful.

300
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,934
Didn't he do a good job?

301
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:08,904
Yeah?

302
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:11,229
- Oh Ollie, do you know what
this gingerbread man needs

303
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,656
before we eat it?

304
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:14,606
- Yeah.
- Maple syrup.

305
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:16,667
I love maple syrup.

306
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,245
- [Bryan] (laughs) He's
like, this guy's crazy.

307
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,328
- [Buddy] Um.

308
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,392
- [Ollie] That is weird.

309
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:25,648
(Bryan laughs)

310
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:27,988
- [Bryan] Do you want some
maple syrup for yours Ollie?

311
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,420
No?
- I've got plenty.

312
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,541
- [Ollie] No!

313
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,529
- Okay.
- I just eat 'em plain.

314
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,946
- Ooo good mouth.

315
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,494
(bright music)

316
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:42,150
- [Bryan] Alright guys,
it's time to say goodbye

317
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,036
to Buddy and Jovie.

318
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,645
Oh, you wanna show 'em out?

319
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:47,321
Alright, let's go.

320
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,404
- [Buddy] Okay, let's go.

321
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,910
(Bryan laughing)

322
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,567
- Buddy, Buddy, Buddy.

323
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,685
- [Bryan] Thanks for coming by Buddy.

324
00:11:57,685 --> 00:11:59,715
- Thanks for having us.
- Jovie, merry Christmas.

325
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:01,033
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.

326
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,558
- Have a good one.
- Bye.

327
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:03,552
- [Bryan] Bye guys.

328
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,079
- Remember the perfect way
to spread Christmas cheer

329
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,746
is singing loud for all to hear.

330
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:10,524
- [Bryan] Did Buddy the elf

331
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,198
just come hang out with us Ollie?

332
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,211
(laughing)
- Yeah.

333
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,775
- Oh well would you
look at this little elf.

334
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:18,482
Hi baby June.
- Say hi.

335
00:12:18,482 --> 00:12:19,815
Hi.
- What's up?

336
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:21,887
Where's Mom and Dad?

337
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,731
Are they on their way?

338
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:23,627
They're gonna hang out with us?

339
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:24,519
- I've been babysitting.

340
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,425
- Yeah.

341
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:28,160
That was so fun, wasn't it Ollie?

342
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,993
- Yeah.

343
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,163
- Buddy the elf actually came over

344
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:33,169
and the boys decorated
Christmas cookies with him.

345
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,588
That is so cool.

346
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,363
But honestly, I think they
really enjoyed themselves.

347
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:39,183
Oh are you teaching her how to dance Finn?

348
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:40,654
Dance, dance.

349
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,106
(Bryan laughing)

350
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:43,748
- [Ollie] Kuku dance.

351
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:44,944
(Bryan laughing)

352
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:48,110
- [Bryan] Aw, her legs
are getting so strong,

353
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,859
aren't they June?

354
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:50,786
Let's rock.
- We're rocking,

355
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,619
we're rocking, we're rocking, wee!

356
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,027
Alright, 'tis that time again.

357
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,835
I've already showered and cleaned up

358
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,425
and this kid passed out on the couch.

359
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:03,245
He asked if he could watch Harry Potter

360
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:04,410
and cuddle with Daddy.

361
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,023
And so while I took a
shower that's what he did

362
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:08,261
and he fell asleep.

363
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,094
So cute.

364
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:13,092
And Finn was actually like
so tired by like 5:30.

365
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,599
So I was like let's just hurry up and eat

366
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,432
and you can go to bed.

367
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:17,091
And he went right to bed after that.

368
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:20,282
But we had such a fun day
playing with Buddy and Jovie.

369
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:21,828
It was just a really fun day.

370
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:23,591
So anyways, make sure you give this video

371
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:24,424
a big thumbs up.

372
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:25,681
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

373
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:26,514
Bye.

374
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,312
Boop.

375
00:13:28,312 --> 00:00:00,000
(bright music)
