- [All] Good morning!

17
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:35,790
- Look how happy these
boys are this morning.

18
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,320
Did you have a good Thanksgiving?

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,153
- Yeah.

20
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:39,457
- And are you excited for today?

21
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,262
Yeah, it is a beautiful day here.

22
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:45,356
The day after Thanksgiving
and it is pretty warm out,

23
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:49,653
I'd say it's probably
in the 90s, maybe 80s.

24
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:51,329
But it's a warm day for sure.

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,938
So we are actually super excited

26
00:00:52,938 --> 00:00:55,656
because we are headed somewhere so fun!

27
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,322
We do this every single year and it is

28
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:01,104
definitely a family
tradition and I just love it.

29
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,691
It's fun to kind of get
away with the family

30
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:07,269
and connect right as
Christmas season is starting.

31
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,102
I don't know.

32
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,418
It always just makes
it feel like Christmas

33
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:11,859
is coming cause we're
spending time with the family.

34
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:12,692
- Yeah.

35
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:13,525
- Yeah.

36
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,437
But yeah, we have just been
like cleaning like crazy.

37
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:17,974
The house is a total disaster

38
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:20,567
after all of the Thanksgiving fun.

39
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,344
And we're packing.

40
00:01:22,344 --> 00:01:23,706
We're packing, huh?

41
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:24,539
- Yeah.

42
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:27,778
- Yeah, we gotta get all
our fun stuff together,

43
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:30,872
games, snacks, warm clothes.

44
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:34,676
And we're headed up tot
he mountains, aren't we?

45
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:35,509
Yay!

46
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,858
- We are all packed up for our cabin trip.

47
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:41,703
I know it seems like we just

48
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:44,966
got back from a trip and here we go.

49
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:45,799
We're doing another one.

50
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,991
This is just how we do it, you guys.

51
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:48,858
This is a really big
family tradition of ours.

52
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,137
It's something we've been doing for,

53
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:53,530
what like, three or four years now?

54
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,858
Five, maybe actually,
about five years now.

55
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,456
And we go up to the cabin, and it's

56
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:58,975
always such a really fun time.

57
00:01:58,975 --> 00:01:59,920
So I'm really excited.

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,608
We have the truck loaded up.

59
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:03,791
Ollie's in here cause he's
excited to go, aren't you?

60
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,781
- Yeah!

61
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:05,984
- [Bryan] You think it'll snow?

62
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:06,817
- Yeah.

63
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:09,011
- No, it's not gonna snow (laughter).

64
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:10,406
We were really hoping it was gonna snow,

65
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:12,363
or be cold, and I really
don't think it is, so.

66
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:14,771
It's gonna be just a nice
mountain getaway, huh?

67
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:15,604
- Yeah.

68
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:16,706
- [Bryan] Alright climb
in your seat, buddy.

69
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:17,539
- Okay.

70
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,125
- [Bryan] Hey, do you know
how to buckle yourself in yet?

71
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,407
- No.
- No?

72
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:24,278
- Yeah, but I can buckle it without me in.

73
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,797
- Oh you can?
- Yeah.

74
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,270
- [Bryan] Well that's pretty smart.

75
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,564
Hey, Finn, you ready to go?

76
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:30,353
- Yeah.
(laughter)

77
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:31,568
- [Bryan] Alright, climb in Ollie.

78
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,659
I'll buckle you in.

79
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,998
- We're going to the cabin.

80
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:37,497
- [Bryan] Yes, we are, and
look who's coming with us!

81
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:38,690
Hi Luna girl.

82
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,018
She's basically like
the best dog ever, so.

83
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:42,177
- She's so good.

84
00:02:42,177 --> 00:02:43,332
- [Bryan] Yeah, we were
like, we're definitely

85
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:45,443
taking her cause she loves Idyllwild.

86
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,806
Idyllwild is such like
a puppy town, you know.

87
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:48,718
- Yeah, yeah.

88
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,484
- [Bryan] So, she's gonna fit right in.

89
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:52,542
- We love Karma-
- Yeah.

90
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:54,208
- We love Karma-
- Obviously.

91
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,268
And Karma is such a good
dog, but he is gonna

92
00:02:57,268 --> 00:02:58,865
be a lot more comfortable at home.

93
00:02:58,865 --> 00:02:59,698
- [Bryan] Yes.

94
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:03,038
- Where he likes his area,
and his space, and his people.

95
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:04,792
- Yeah.
(laughter)

96
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,222
- [Bryan] So he's gonna be
here, holding down the fort,

97
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,594
and Luna's gonna come and play with us.

98
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,619
You excited to go to the cabin Luna?

99
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:11,711
Let's go!

100
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,874
- [Missy] She looks so excited, too,

101
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,152
she's just like, let's do it!

102
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,156
- I hope Luna doesn't
escape from the cabin.

103
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,203
- [Bryan] You know what, me too, honestly.

104
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:22,477
Me too, can you not
escape this time, please.

105
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:25,310
(deep bass music)

106
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,960
- We made it to the cabin!

107
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,623
- [Bryan] Yeah, we have
made it, didn't we boys?

108
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,300
Remember these, Ollie?

109
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,717
Giant pine cones.

110
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,576
Isn't that scary looking?

111
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,815
- Look over here, guys, there's a house.

112
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,279
- [Bryan] Oh, it's like
a little bird house, huh?

113
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,045
- Yeah, it's full of rocks.

114
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:03,878
- [Bryan] It's styled after a wild

115
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:05,745
west saloon, that's pretty cool.

116
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,850
Welcome to our vacation cabin you guys.

117
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,269
We are gonna give you
a little bit of a tour.

118
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,217
We've been here before on the
Vlog, but for those of you

119
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:15,972
who haven't seen this,
you're in for a treat.

120
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:17,783
- Yeah.
- Cause this is really fun.

121
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:19,685
- We're really excited. Yay!

122
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,057
Anyone home?

123
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:22,632
- [Ollie] Yeah.

124
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:24,333
- [Missy] Hello?

125
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,000
Welcome to our home.

126
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:28,412
Alright, Ollie, do you
wanna give a little tour?

127
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,729
Tell us where Finn's sleeping.

128
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,711
- Um, Finn's sleeping in here.

129
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:37,345
- [Missy] Yeah, his bed's
already set up in there, even.

130
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,302
- [Bryan] We have Finn's room.

131
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:41,643
So we've got a bed in here with a table,

132
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:43,544
but we put Finn's bed in here.

133
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:46,315
- Yep, and Ollie stayed in
there last year, but this year

134
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:48,224
we're gonna do something
a little bit different.

135
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:50,283
Alright, what's in this room?

136
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:51,295
- It's a bathroom!

137
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:53,197
- Yep, bathroom!
- Yeah!

138
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:55,503
Alright, now the house,
this is the living room.

139
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,910
And they've actually
changed it up a little.

140
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,328
I feel like it's a little more open now.

141
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:01,038
(child screams)
(laughter)

142
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,020
So we've got the living room
and the TV, and we'll hook up

143
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,361
our Apple TV, so we can
play games and watch movies.

144
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:10,252
And then we've got our dining room table,

145
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,424
and our kitchen, which is so-

146
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:14,347
I love having a kitchen
when we're staying away,

147
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,305
so we can like cook and make our meals.

148
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,645
And you better believe we're
having a second Thanksgiving!

149
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:19,871
(laughter)
- Third.

150
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,368
- Yeah, (laughter) pretty much.

151
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:22,201
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, this is the

152
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,820
dining room, looks really nice.

153
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,644
- And then we even have
a little pantry area,

154
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,602
for all our snacks and food.

155
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:30,942
- [Bryan] We got any good
snacks in there Ollie?

156
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:32,982
- Look, it's a happy birthday hat!

157
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,971
(laughter)
- Oh, there is, yeah.

158
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:38,570
- Then we've got the porch,
where Luna is hanging out.

159
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,548
- [Bryan] Hey Luna.

160
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,955
- [Missy] (mumbles) your little area.

161
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,361
What you go going on?
- What's up Lulu?

162
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:44,778
(cool music)

163
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:47,953
- Look at this beautiful view.

164
00:05:47,953 --> 00:05:51,914
We've got a huge balcony, with
a dining table area to sit.

165
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:54,917
We've even got a bar-be-cue, and a little

166
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,020
sitting area, for in the morning.

167
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,259
We can drink our tea and sit out

168
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,947
and see how beautiful it is.

169
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:03,524
What's funny is that two years
ago, when we stayed here,

170
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:06,707
we came here on this exact
day, and it was snowing.

171
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:07,540
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughter)

172
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,992
- And this year it is about
70 degrees. (laughter)

173
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:10,825
- [Bryan] Yeah.

174
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:11,770
- So, it's not gonna be snowing,

175
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,998
but it's still really
nice, crisp, cool air.

176
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,831
- [Bryan] Yeah.

177
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:17,272
- The boys are playing outside
and we're gonna head inside

178
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:21,423
to our bedroom, which is
just a cozy little room.

179
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,507
We've got a couch, and
a bed, a nice big closet

180
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:28,139
for all our stuff, which we
will definitely be unpacking.

181
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,155
- [Bryan] We got some Lego BB‑8 stuff,

182
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:32,566
that's gonna be fun to put together, huh?

183
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:35,717
- And look at that BB‑8,
that's a little BB‑8.

184
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:36,786
- [Bryan] Yeah.

185
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:41,421
- And we've got a bathroom
with a nice, big tub,

186
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,309
for the kids to take baths,
and me to take a bath.

187
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:46,131
- Nice sink.
- Yeah.

188
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,259
- Can I see the tub?
- You wanna see the tub?

189
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,092
Go check it out, boys.

190
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:48,925
- [Bryan] Go see the tub, Dude.

191
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,282
Hey Finn, will it hold you too?

192
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:53,511
- [Ollie] Whoa, I know how to get in here.

193
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,940
- [Bryan] See if it fits both of you.

194
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,840
Hop in Finn.

195
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,462
- [Missy] Okay, is it enough room?

196
00:06:58,462 --> 00:06:59,699
(kids talking over each other)

197
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,541
(laughter)

198
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,816
- And now we've got the
downstairs, which is

199
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:07,348
pretty neat because we
just have more space

200
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:10,340
so that we can spread
out and get comfortable.

201
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,893
- [Bryan] You coming boys?

202
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:13,142
- [Ollie] Yeah.

203
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:16,944
- I love having a laundry
room when we're on vacation.

204
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:18,632
We've got a nice, big laundry room

205
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:21,253
so we can keep our clothes clean.

206
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:22,086
- [Bryan] Oh check this out.

207
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:24,178
We've got like a separate little-

208
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,011
- [Missy] Yeah!

209
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,844
- [Bryan] Living space.

210
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:27,306
- [Missy] So this is where
Ollie's gonna be staying,

211
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:29,174
just in this area, he'll be sleeping

212
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:31,716
down here, it's nice and cool.

213
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:34,720
We've got a bedroom, this is
where my brother's staying.

214
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,126
Wait, this is where Dad's staying?

215
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,308
- Yeah.
- Oh.

216
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:38,843
Mom and Dad are staying in here.

217
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:39,785
(laughter)

218
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,045
And then actually if you come right

219
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:44,420
over here, it leads into the bathroom.

220
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,410
- [Bryan] Oh cool.

221
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,638
- Yeah, and then if you go through here-

222
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:48,471
Look at this, it's like a maze.

223
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,248
- [Bryan] Can keep going, can keep going.

224
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:51,733
- [Missy] We're back in the living room!

225
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,353
- [Bryan] Finn's like, what?

226
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:54,647
Go, Finn, go.

227
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,436
- It's a circle!

228
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:57,673
How cool is that?

229
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:59,766
And then we've got one
more room over here.

230
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,599
One more room, ow, ow.

231
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,412
Alright, this is where Jimmy's staying.

232
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:05,245
- [Bryan] Cool.

233
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:07,259
- And nice big closet.

234
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,092
- [Bryan] Yeah, a big ole closet.

235
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:09,902
- Are you gonna fill this
whole closet up, Jimmy?

236
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:10,870
- [Jimmy] Uh yeah, definitely.

237
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,052
- [Bryan] And then
there is a second patio,

238
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:14,785
leading out from this space as well.

239
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,798
- Yeah.

240
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:16,631
- [Bryan] It's cool

241
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:18,104
- [Ollie] (mumbles) down there!

242
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:19,814
- [Bryan] You just gotta go around, Dude.

243
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:22,946
- [Missy] And probably put you shoes on.

244
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,667
Luna's going potty.

245
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,960
- [Bryan] Say, hi Luna!

246
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,793
- Hi Luna!

247
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,113
(laughter)

248
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:30,401
- Say hi Meme, Papa.

249
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,651
(laughter)

250
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,006
- Alright, we've made it to Idyllwild,

251
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:40,616
but me and my dad are now
going grocery shopping.

252
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:43,068
We have a lot of snacks, but
we definitely are gonna need

253
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,938
a little bit more food
than just what we have,

254
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,716
especially for like dinner and stuff.

255
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:50,407
And we brought along Finn,
cause he's the craziest.

256
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:53,040
When you leave him alone,
well not alone, but just like

257
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,506
in a house where there's nothing
a lot to do, he goes crazy.

258
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:58,823
Huh Finn?
- Yeah.

259
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:01,005
- You gonna go grocery
shopping with Momma and Papa?

260
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:02,558
(Finn babbling)

261
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:06,124
- Yeah, you guys, it's so
good to be back in Idyllwild.

262
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,149
We love Idyllwild, it's just like,

263
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,457
it just feels so homey and comfortable.

264
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:12,537
So let's go shopping.

265
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:13,684
- Just look at the mountains.

266
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:16,047
- I know, look at those
mountains right there.

267
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,622
Hang on, let's see if I can show you.

268
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,715
Look at that, so pretty.

269
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:20,986
We love it here.

270
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:22,797
Um, what do you have, Finn?

271
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:25,621
(Finn babbling)
Is that a eggplant?

272
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:27,028
- He said egg.
- I know.

273
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:27,861
(laughter)

274
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:28,694
- [Missy's Dad] Is that
what you want for dinner?

275
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:29,527
No (laughter)

276
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,360
- [Missy] Ah, don't do it!

277
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,207
(laughter)

278
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:34,468
Alright, alright, good job.

279
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:36,740
- I didn't see a lot of squirrel.

280
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,325
They're out there, we're gonna find them.

281
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:39,225
- [Missy] Yeah, we are.

282
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,283
- We're gonna catch em, and
we're gonna bring em home.

283
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:43,008
- [Missy] Yeah. (laughter)

284
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:46,000
We got peanuts so we can
get the squirrels, okay?

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,833
- Yeah.

286
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,205
- Finn are gonna get one
candy bar, that's it.

287
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:51,524
- [Missy] No, Dad, that is
a giant candy bar, Finn.

288
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,446
- It does break the rule if it's

289
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:53,605
bigger than your head, you don't eat it.

290
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:54,438
(laughter)

291
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:55,811
Don't eat anything bigger than your head.

292
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:57,059
(laughter)

293
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,915
- [Missy] That is a giant candy bar.

294
00:09:58,915 --> 00:09:59,827
- One candy bar.

295
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:00,783
(laughter)

296
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:02,167
- That sounds like
something Ollie would do.

297
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,237
Momma can I get one candy bar, sure.

298
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,112
And then he grabs the biggest one.

299
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:07,945
(laughter)

300
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:11,730
Alright, our cart is pretty
full, and op, my gosh.

301
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,563
- [Missy's Day] It's
gotta go right here, okay.

302
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:13,496
- [Missy] My dad is just-

303
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,760
- Ahh
- Right here, right here.

304
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,802
- [Missy] We have no where to put it,

305
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:18,539
Finn, so you're gonna have to hold it.

306
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:19,551
- [Missy's Day] We'll put it right here.

307
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:20,384
(laughter)

308
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,217
Right here.

309
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:22,050
- No!

310
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,883
(laughter)
- You sure?

311
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:24,156
- No.
- You sure?

312
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,001
Right here.
- No.

313
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,188
- Okay.
(laughter)

314
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:30,033
- Dad is on a roll today guys.

315
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,126
He doesn't stop making jokes.

316
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:35,220
And we are done, two carts full.

317
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,120
(laughter)

318
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,357
I think we're set for
the weekend, right Finn?

319
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:39,237
- I think we're set for the month.

320
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,520
- [Missy] Yeah. (laughter)

321
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,836
- [Bryan] Ollie, what do you have?

322
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:43,277
- Dinosaur!

323
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,234
- [Bryan] Whoa, who got you dinosaurs?

324
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:46,651
- Momma and Papa!

325
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,532
- [Bryan] And Finn, Finn picked out

326
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:52,198
these awesome toys for you at the store.

327
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,009
- Triceratops.
- Yeah.

328
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:57,092
- Elephant, tiger, and a stegosaurus.

329
00:10:58,926 --> 00:10:59,759
- [Bryan] Yeah.

330
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,270
Although I think this is
one is a lion, not a tiger.

331
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,336
- Tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.

332
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:06,979
- Tiger, tiger.
(growls)

333
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:07,946
(laughter)

334
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:10,084
- The boys definitely needed some toys.

335
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:12,278
So that was very nice of
Finn to pick some out.

336
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:14,820
(growls)

337
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,117
Alright you guys, I have
donned my cabin onesie.

338
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:20,457
It's the classic red flannel plaid.

339
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:24,080
I shoulda got one for your dad
and brother too, pretty cool.

340
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,980
(laughter)
- Yeah, pretty sure.

341
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,298
- And Ollie and Finn are
wearing the cutest pajamas.

342
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:29,862
Finn, come here let me see!

343
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:32,146
Whoa, Buzz Light year.

344
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:34,824
Ollie, show me the laser, laser attack.

345
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:37,071
(laser sounds)

346
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,673
Cool PJs, Dude.

347
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:40,946
(relaxing music)

348
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:41,879
- Onto the pond.

349
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,557
Twirling round and round
and round in the foothills

350
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:47,583
until thump, he fell on his bottom.

351
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,070
Ouch, Little Bear was upset.

352
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,545
He felt dizzy and cold and lost.

353
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,369
Two big tears rolled
down Little Bear's face.

354
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,124
"Come on," said Red Bird,

355
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,475
"you're a very brave bear, remember?"

356
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:03,246
(reading continues)
- So cute.

357
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:05,888
- Slowly and carefully, Little
Bear walked back around the

358
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:09,972
pond, along the stream, up
the hill, and past Snow Bear.

359
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:11,975
♪ I'm walking through the forest ♪

360
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:14,461
♪ A very brave bear ♪

361
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:16,193
♪ My home is in sight ♪

362
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,365
♪ I can see the light ♪

363
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:19,198
- No.

364
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,508
♪ I'm no longer scared ♪

365
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,341
Alright, alright.

366
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:25,860
- [Bryan] It's so funny
how the cutest moments are

367
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,382
when you take a step back
and let them do their thing.

368
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,573
They're so adorable and then

369
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:32,496
they just start fighting randomly.

370
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:33,467
You boys are so cute.

371
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,021
- Alright boys, we gotta lay down.

372
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,537
We're gonna finish this book now.

373
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:38,870
(fun music)

374
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:53,672
- I'm gonna let Missy handle that one.

375
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,798
She's the pro.

376
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:56,182
She reads them Goodnight Moon,

377
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:58,128
and they go to sleep like that.

378
00:12:58,128 --> 00:12:59,546
It's the cutest thing.

379
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,446
Today was a good day.

380
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,822
We're back at the cabin, cabin life.

381
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:04,665
As you can tell, cabin life.

382
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:06,915
Look we just have like giant random

383
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:09,829
pine cones in this sleigh.

384
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,134
What do you think about that, Luna?

385
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,440
(laughter)

386
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,555
Luna has been so good.

387
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:17,333
She hasn't had a single accident.

388
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,458
She's just like following me around

389
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,202
the house and being so cute, huh?

390
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:21,035
Come on, Girl.

391
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,321
Come on, come help me in the Vlog.

392
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,198
Come help me in the Vlog.

393
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:27,202
Anyway, if you click the icon
in the corner, you can watch

394
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:29,362
the video of the last time
we were at this house.

395
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:30,814
We had a blast a couple years back.

396
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,535
I think Ollie was really
little, so it would be

397
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:34,222
a cool throwback for
you guys to check out.

398
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:36,124

in a foreign language)

402
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:43,661
I'm gonna play some Super Mario Odyssey,

00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,878

Say bye!

407
