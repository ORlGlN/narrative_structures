1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,420
- [Bryan] Are you focusing
your energy on the crayon?

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,253
- Yeah.

3
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,223
- [Bryan] Trying to make it fall?

4
00:00:04,223 --> 00:00:05,056
- It's fallin'!

5
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:06,780
- [Bryan] Focus, focus, focus!

6
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,613
Whoa!

7
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:10,568
(gasps) You did that
with your magic powers.

8
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:11,684
- That was you.

9
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:12,517

- [Unison] Good morning!

19
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:38,046
- Good morning, boys, how are you?

20
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:41,200
(ding)
(Finley vocalizing)

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,360
I know!

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,820
So this morning, the boys
and I are kinda matching.

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,810
We're wearing these
short-sleeve sweater thingies.

24
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,250
You guys look so cute all
the time, you know that?

25
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,350
- We have pockets, you don't have pockets.

26
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,240
- Oh, I don't have pockets,

27
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,210
you do have pockets, that's so cool.

28
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,250
Yours has pockets too.

29
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,250
All right, boys, I was thinking,
we should go to breakfast.

30
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:04,340
- Yeah.

31
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,279
- [Bryan] All right, boys,
where should we go to breakfast?

32
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,112
- Richie's!

33
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,110
- You really wanna go to Richie's?

34
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,380
Okay, we'll check out Richie's. (laughs)

35
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,760
Yes, good morning guys, I am going to take

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,816
these two boys to breakfast,
but what is out here?

37
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,010
(yells)

38
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,407
What is it, Ollie?

39
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,240
- Bat.

40
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,650
- [Bryan] Go get it, go catch it.

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,350
There's a vampire bat
hanging out in our courtyard.

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,910
Did you find this, Ollie?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,110
- [Bryan] Where'd you find it?

44
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,660
- We found it from there yesterday.

45
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,540
- [Bryan] That's so funny, it was there

46
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,920
from the Halloween party, remember?

47
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,753
- Yeah.

48
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:39,250
- It's, like, the most beautiful,

49
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,470
blue, clear skies today, you guys.

50
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,990
Oh, I see a little bit of clouds.

51
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,405
Something in there. (laughs)

52
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:47,314
(both vocalizing)
Yay!

53
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:51,040
Taking the boys to breakfast
in the truck this morning

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,690
because of the handy dandy DVD player.

55
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,600
They love taking the truck,
they beg to take the truck.

56
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,160
I think they're watching
"Lego Batman" right now,

57
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,720
and they could not be happier. (laughs)

58
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,469
Makes driving a little bit nicer.

59
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:02,302
(Finley vocalizing)
What, buddy?

60
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:04,410
(Finley vocalizing)
Oh really?

61
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,602
- Yeah.
- Okay.

62
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:07,090
(Finley vocalizing)
(Bryan laughs)

63
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,672
We're also at the longest red light ever.

64
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,074
- Go, it's green!

65
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:13,657
(upbeat music)

66
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,445
- Boys, guess what?

67
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:17,278
- [Oliver] What?

68
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:18,111
- [Bryan] We made it!

69
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,630
Let's go!

70
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,223
Let's go, let's go eat
some pancakes, right?

71
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:24,056
- [Oliver] Yeah.

72
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:24,889
- [Bryan] Favorite food ever?

73
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:25,722
- Mm-hmm.

74
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:27,170
- All right.

75
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,830
These boys are so good.

76
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,940
Look at them, holding
hands, walking together.

77
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,454
Are you guys best friends?

78
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,287
- Yeah.

79
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,500
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

80
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,990
Hey Finn, what are you gonna order?

81
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,562
(vocalizes)

82
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:41,145
(upbeat music)

83
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,590
- Pancakes are this way, guys. (laughs)

84
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:52,289
(upbeat music)

85
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,243
What're you doing, Ollie?

86
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,826
- This is what June used to do.

87
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,048
- [Bryan] Oh really?

88
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:05,881
- Yeah.

89
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,512
- [Bryan] Are you focusing
your energy on the crayon?

90
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:08,345
- Yeah.

91
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,410
- [Bryan] Trying to make it fall?

92
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,243
- It's fallin'!

93
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:12,010
- [Bryan] Focus, focus, focus!

94
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,206
Whoa!

95
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,840
(gasps) You did that
with your magic powers.

96
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,833
- That was you.

97
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:17,666
- [Bryan] Okay.

98
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,249
(upbeat music)

99
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,993
Hey Ollie, what're you doing?

100
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:30,130
- I'm giving him a tattoo.

101
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,148
- [Bryan] You're giving
your brother a tattoo?

102
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:32,981
- Yeah.

103
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:33,814
- [Bryan] On his forehead?

104
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,647
- Yeah.

105
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,240
- [Bryan] Finn, how do you
feel about this? (laughs)

106
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,686
Oh, that's a beautiful tattoo, Finn.

107
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:43,519
- [Finley] Yeah.

108
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,352
- [Bryan] Do you like it?

109
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:45,185
- Is it cool?

110
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:46,018
- Yeah, it's really cool.

111
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,889
Their imagination is just adorable.

112
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:48,869
- Look at my ear.

113
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,861
- [Bryan] Whoa!

114
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:51,996
You have your crayon behind it.

115
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,031
- Is that honey?

116
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:56,180
- Yeah that's honey. (laughs)

117
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,220
They also are nonstop when I take them out

118
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,042
without their mother. (laughs)

119
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,775
- [Finley] Ama!

120
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,774
- [Oliver] Amo!

121
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:06,734
(Bryan laughs)
(both vocalizing)

122
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:09,317
(upbeat music)

123
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:14,720
- So, we just got our breakfast,

124
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,630
and Ollie has learned
how to do something new,

125
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,329
and he's really excited to tell you.

126
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,920
- I just tore my pancakes all by myself.

127
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,850
- [Bryan] Yes he did, he tore up

128
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,380
all his pancakes by himself.

129
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,670
I still had to cut up Finn's,
'cause he's still learning,

130
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,574
but that is so awesome, Ollie,
I'm so proud of you. (laughs)

131
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,157
(upbeat music)

132
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,211
(both vocalizing)
I think it's dance time.

133
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,480
(Bryan laughs)

134
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,691
The boys are so excited
because they had jelly beans.

135
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,260
- Yes! (vocalizing)

136
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,000
- Yeah, so Finn got Wonder Woman,

137
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,810
you got gummy bears, and I actually saw

138
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,966
Coldstone jelly beans and
Krispy Kreme jelly beans,

139
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:06,430
so I grabbed them so that
we can snack on them,

140
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,320
'cause that sounded good, and
anytime you get jelly beans,

141
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,010
it's a good time to dance, right?

142
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,020
Show me your dance move, boys.

143
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,907
Show me your dance moves!

144
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,540
(both vocalizing)
There we go.

145
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,012
All right, crazy kids,
let's go home, okay?

146
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:18,930
- Okay.

147
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,940
- All right, so we are now at the barn,

148
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,840
and Ollie is taking me to go see Cosmo,

149
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,810
the little horse they have.

150
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,700
- Right there, with the white and black.

151
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,750
- [Bryan] Oh, that's him over there?

152
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,583
- Yeah.

153
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,431
- [Bryan] Let's go say hi.

154
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,490
- He's staring out at us.
- Okay.

155
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,710
Ollie really wanted to hop on Nacho today,

156
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,390
and he was so sad he didn't get to do it

157
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,050
the last time they were here, so I think

158
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,550
he's gonna hop on Nacho, right, buddy?

159
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,060
Comfortable Ollie is
with this place already.

160
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,100
He loves all the animals and
horses and people. (laughs)

161
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,240
It's really cool.

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,366
What'd you find?

163
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:48,210
- Rocks.

164
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,419
- [Bryan] Hey, Cosmo.

165
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,438
- Is that Cosmo right there, and that one?

166
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:55,250
They are, like, the same color.

167
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,450
- [Bryan] (laughs) They're
the same color, huh?

168
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,703
You don't know which one is which, do you?

169
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:00,536
- That one is.

170
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,839
- [Bryan] That's Cosmo?

171
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,672
- Yeah.

172
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:03,607
- [Bryan] Okay. (laughs)

173
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:06,190
(mellow music)

174
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,003
Here we go.

175
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,349
Ollie's hopping up on Nacho.

176
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,110
- Yeah, let's go, Nacho.

177
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,457
He's like, "You want pictures, or what?"

178
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,200
(Bryan laughs)

179
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,546
- [Bryan] Nacho's like,
"Wait, am I a pony now?"

180
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:26,810
- Yeah. (laughs)

181
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,896
- [Bryan] "Do I give pony rides?"

182
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:30,479
(mellow music)

183
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,980
- It is so cold today, I
had to put on a jacket.

184
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,678
Ollie got to put on a jacket, huh?

185
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:40,511
- Yeah.

186
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:41,806
- It is chilly.

187
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:46,590
I wanna give a quick little
update on Nacho and his foot.

188
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,870
How're you doing, bud?

189
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,570
Huh? (laughs)

190
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,550
So, I just gave him a little
ride to see how he's doing,

191
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,800
just a really, really brief one,

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,550
and he's actually doing really good.

193
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,780
He's doing better.

194
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,570
I'm really hoping he's
back to 100% really soon,

195
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,830
because I really wanna go on trail rides,

196
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,330
and I've got friends who wanna go.

197
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,250
Hopefully soon he's feeling better.

198
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,720
That foot's just gotta get better, Nacho.

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,763
We're just letting Nacho
do a little grazing

200
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,860
outside the barn.

201
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,560
Hey Nacho, I see a good
piece of grass over there.

202
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,300
C'mon, come over here.

203
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:21,260
What is that?

204
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,220
So, we just put Nacho away,
and he was doing really good.

205
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,116
It's weird just looking down here,

206
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,690
and we've got Cosmo down here,

207
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,120
and then that's Bigsby,
and Ollie loves Cosmo, huh?

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,953
- Yeah.

209
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:39,870
- [Missy] Now, tell me,
why do like Cosmo so much?

210
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,523
- 'Cause he's a baby horse.

211
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:43,230
- [Missy] (laughs) Yes, Cosmo is a pony.

212
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,366
I keep telling him, he's older
than you, Ollie, he's 11.

213
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,887
(laughs) But he's small, huh?

214
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:49,720
- Yeah.

215
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,730
- So he's like a kid's horse.

216
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,490
Ollie's been talking a lot lately

217
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,450
about learning how to ride and
getting his own horsy, huh?

218
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,102
Wouldn't that be so fun?

219
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:58,935
- Yeah.

220
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:00,690
- [Missy] Are you gonna
get your own horse one day?

221
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,523
- Yeah.

222
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,799
- [Missy] And how 'bout,
like, a little pony?

223
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,720
- Mm-hmm, I like little ponies.

224
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,553
- [Missy] You like little ponies?

225
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,350
What color pony do you want?

226
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,800
- White and black.

227
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,420
- [Missy] White and black,
kinda like him, right?

228
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,710
Like Cosmo?
- Yeah, I want one like him.

229
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,530
- So, it sounds like you want a Paint?

230
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,370
That's pretty interesting, huh?

231
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,410
I think that would be so cute.

232
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,420
One day we will totally have
the horses on our property,

233
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,400
and we will totally get the boys a pony,

234
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,700
and you can learn to ride.

235
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,219
You could have your own pony,
wouldn't that be so cute?

236
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:31,130
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)

237
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,770
- But, for now, we just get
to look at them, huh? (laughs)

238
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,440
And we got Nacho to keep
us busy for now, huh?

239
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,578
And you can ride Nacho,
he's not super big.

240
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:40,411
- Yeah.

241
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:42,573
- [Missy] He's not as big as Funs, huh?

242
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:43,549
- Yeah.

243
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,050
- Funs over there, and Dutchess, phew.

244
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,275
They are big horses.

245
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:50,550
(gasps) Are you Spider Man?
(both yell)

246
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,935
Spider Man's kinda crazy.

247
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:53,125
- Captain America.

248
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,735
- [Missy] Oh, and it's Captain America.

249
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,460
It's chocolate Captain America,

250
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,280
you got your Hershey's pajamas on.

251
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,698
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)

252
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:02,561
- Wait, I don't have a shield!

253
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:05,820
- Oh yeah, all right guys,
lay down, it's time for bed.

254
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,720
We gotta read a couple books,

255
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,468
and then it's time for bed, okay?

256
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:10,301
- [Oliver] Okay.

257
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,134
(kisses)

258
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:11,967
- Are you guys ready to go to bed?

259
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:12,861
Did you have a fun day?

260
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:14,340
- [Oliver] Yeah.

261
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,598
- You're being crazy.

262
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:18,070
(vocalizes)
Did you have a fun day, Finn?

263
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,903
Oh my goodness.

264
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:21,880
Ollie, did you have fun riding Nacho?

265
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,410
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

266
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,225
Yes, we had a super fun day,
especially up at the barn,

267
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,690
but we are gonna go ahead and go to bed,

268
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,450
'cause we're exhausted, huh?

269
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,720
We got tired?

270
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,680
Are we tired?
(Finley vocalizing)

271
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,755
Oh yeah, that is a tired face right there.

272
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:36,588
(Finley vocalizing)

273
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:37,970
Oh yeah, we're gonna read this book?

274
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,150
- Yeah.
- Okay.

275
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,720
Anyways, hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.

276
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,564
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did.

277
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,860
Woo!

278
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,969
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

279
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:50,730
- [Oliver] Bye. (blows raspberry)

280
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,745
Bloop.

281
00:09:51,745 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
