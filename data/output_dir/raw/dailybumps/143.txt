1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:01,856
- [Missy] Ollie, what's wrong with you?

2
00:00:01,856 --> 00:00:04,191
- I don't feel good, mama, moo!

3
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:05,104
- [Missy] Moo!

4
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:06,104
Oh, my gosh.

5
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:09,137
Do you not feel good either, Fin?

6
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:10,255
(Fin whining)

7
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,088
No? Meow!

8
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:15,653
Oh my goodness, you
turned into a kitty cat?

9
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:16,590
♫ This is our life

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,805
♫ This is our fight

11
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:20,209
♫ This is who we are

12
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:21,401
♫ This is our dream

13
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:22,555
♫ This is our team

14
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,948
♫ Shout among the stars

15
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:27,391
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

16
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,298
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

17
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:32,026
♫ This is our life

18
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:33,960
♫ Let's live it

19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,726
♫ Live it forever

20
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:36,559
- [Missy] Good morning.

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,282
- Good mornin'!

22
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:39,929
- [Missy] Alright, I
think I got a good one.

23
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:40,923
Good morning!

24
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:41,808
- Good mornin'!

25
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,554
- [Missy] It's time for school, huh?

26
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:45,376
Hi Peyton!
- Hi.

27
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:46,411
- [Missy] Your mommy was smart

28
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:47,501
and gave you a little sweater.

29
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,858
I put him in shorts.

30
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,447
It's a little chilly today.

31
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:52,280
- Yeah.

32
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,050
- Good morning, June.

33
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,720
Did you have a good night's sleep?

34
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,553
Oh hi, Paris.

35
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,386
Good morning, Paris.

36
00:00:57,386 --> 00:00:59,219
I just dropped Ollie off at school,

37
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,403
and then I ended up
dropping Fin off at my mom's

38
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:05,293
before I dropped Ollie off at school,

39
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:07,981
because me and Kelsey
are going to the gym,

40
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,779
and Bryan is just still
not feeling very good,

41
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:13,153
and nights and mornings
tend to be the worst time.

42
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:15,837
Oh, you're just being so gentle petting!

43
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:17,266
So I thought I'd give him a little break

44
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,950
while I go to the gym.

45
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,925
But what's cool, is
that today me and Kelsey

46
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:22,406
are going rock climbing.

47
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:24,268
We're going to a different
gym than we normally go to.

48
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:25,796
We're gonna go to a rock climbing gym,

49
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:27,865
and we are so excited!

50
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:29,067
The kids are all taken care of,

51
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,610
you're gonna stay home with Papa?

52
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,673
Does that sound good?

53
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:32,506
(baby cooing)

54
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:33,798
Yeah, and Paris?

55
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:35,485
But anyways, we are super excited.

56
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:37,116
Alright guys, we are at the rock gym,

57
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:40,641
and this place is so cool,
I've never been here before.

58
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,451
We can even rock climb
alone, 'cause they have

59
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:45,119
these handy-dandy little,
I don't know what they are.

60
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,696
Yeah, and look at this.

61
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:48,493
We have the whole place to ourself.

62
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:50,748
It's so fun!
- Yes!

63
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:52,086
- So, I'm gonna set up the camera

64
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,001
and show you guys our climb.

65
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:53,909
This is gonna be our first climb,

66
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,663
so it might be kind of slow.

67
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:57,390
- Okay, so like he was
saying, the five-five

68
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,973
is the easiest, besides the VO.

69
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:04,031
- [Missy] I think so,
well the VO is like--

70
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:05,564
- [Kelsey] For the bouldering?

71
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:06,764
- I think so.
- We don't know.

72
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:08,783
- [Missy] So I'm doing easiest,

73
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:10,479
you're doing a little bit harder.

74
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,516
- Okay so, it goes like--

75
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:13,538
- [Missy] Oh actually, that
looks really hard, Kelsey.

76
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,007
(Missy laughing)

77
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:15,840
You can do it?

78
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,154
- I have no idea.

79
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,083
I can try.
(Missy laughing)

80
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,457
- This might take us
awhile, but we're excited.

81
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,685
Alright, let's see how we do.

82
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:24,185
(upbeat electronic music)

83
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:46,934
You guys, I got really scared
to jump, I couldn't do it.

84
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:47,981
- You did it, though.

85
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:50,103
- I had to just make sure
that I wasn't gonna fall,

86
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,799
though, watching Kelsey.

87
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,164
Alright, we're gonna switch because I got

88
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:54,881
the really easy side.

89
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:57,276
She got the, I feel like, very hard.

90
00:02:57,276 --> 00:03:00,450
Look at these little,
tiny things to hold onto.

91
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,860
That's like nothing,
that's like a finger grip.

92
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,034
(exhausted exhale)

93
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:05,949
- I'm already dead.

94
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:06,782
Like, dead.

95
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:08,857
I've done one run, and I'm dead.

96
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,279
(Missy laughing)

97
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,754
- So we're gonna go again,

98
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,894
and we're gonna try and
switch it this time.

99
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,095
So, we'll see how we do.

100
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:19,595
(upbeat electronic music)

101
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,291
I could not even close my hand.

102
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,544
- [Kelsey] I know, right?

103
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:31,447
- I can barely hold this
camera, I'm like shaking.

104
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:32,864
My hand's a claw.

105
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:36,533
Did you watch Friends,
where Chandler's hand

106
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,116
turned into a claw?

107
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,819
That's my hand.

108
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,319
Good morning, Fin!

109
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,539
Did you have fun with Mimi and Papa?

110
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:46,372
- Yeah.

111
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,242
- Yeah?

112
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:49,556
I just got to my parents, and oh my gosh,

113
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:51,130
my arms are so bad.

114
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,992
It was really, really fun.

115
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:55,391
It was definitely a
different kind of work out,

116
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:57,226
'cause normally we get
done with our work outs

117
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:02,202
and we usually run, and we
work on a certain thing,

118
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:03,617
and so it's definitely different.

119
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:06,263
My arms are in so much
pain, I can barely hold

120
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:08,402
up the camera, it's like ow!

121
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:10,301
Like, I can finally close
my hand, 'cause earlier

122
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,112
I was like, I can't close it.

123
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,113
Alright, say bye bye, Mimi and Papa!

124
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:16,551
- Bye Mimi and Papa!

125
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:20,034
- Awww, that was a full sentence!

126
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,909
Good job, bud!

127
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:23,875
You're gettin' so good.

128
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,476
So, I had a little bit of a mix up.

129
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:29,319
I left my keys with Kelsey,
and so my dad is now driving me

130
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,576
quickly to Rite Aid
because I just got a call,

131
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:34,257
Bryan is in desperate need of medicine.

132
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:35,921
- You are so absent-minded.

133
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,410
I left my phone at home, so
I can't go anywhere, okay.

134
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,243
- I know.

135
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:43,201
Yeah, I left my keys, my dad
took me, he left his phone.

136
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,245
We're just very much related, and--

137
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,069
- We're not gonna set
anything down in this store.

138
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:47,934
(Missy laughing)

139
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,079
- But anyways, Bryan

140
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,142
- Wait, where's Fin?
- is in desperate need

141
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,751
of medicine, and I feel
so bad, so, here I go.

142
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,334
(bright music)

143
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:18,546
Alright, I am home and I have made

144
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,879
him an entire emergency kit.

145
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,413
He's got bananas, and
applesauce, and graham crackers,

146
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:28,879
and all kinds of medicine,
and cough medicine,

147
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,583
and drinks, and ice
cream, 'cause you know,

148
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,909
who doesn't want ice cream?

149
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,505
I'm gonna go give this to him now,

150
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:38,097
and hopefully this makes him
feel just a little bit better.

151
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,823
I forgot tissues.

152
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:43,098
I gotta give him these tissues,
and then hopefully he's set.

153
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:44,741
Alright Fin, what are we doin' now?

154
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,445
Say, we're gettin' Ollie!

155
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:47,671
(Fin babbling)

156
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:48,790
Say Ollie!

157
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,634
- Owwie.

158
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:50,467
- Ollie.

159
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,436
- Yep, we are gettin' Ollie right now.

160
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,525
Oh, somethin's wrong with his shoe,

161
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:57,265
and we are excited to see him.

162
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:58,098
Oh, hey.

163
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:02,819
- [Fin] Hey!

164
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,280
(Missy shushing)

165
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,197
(gentle music)

166
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,536
- Alright, just got home with the boys,

167
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,991
and they both fell asleep in the car,

168
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:13,138
so they are just a little bit grouchy.

169
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,054
They are needing some
extra little cuddles,

170
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,620
and maybe a little bit more rest

171
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,929
before we do anything else.

172
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:20,570
But, we have actually quite
a bit of fun planned today,

173
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,526
so I'm hoping they snap out of it.

174
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:25,537
I'm hoping they snap out
of it so we can have fun.

175
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:26,370
Okay?

176
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,287
- No!

177
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,377
- No, I don't wanna have fun.

178
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:31,587
You wanna have fun?

179
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:32,705
Nope.

180
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,339
Ollie, what's wrong with you?

181
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,582
- I don't feel good, mama, moo!

182
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:37,436
- [Missy] Moo!

183
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:38,353
Oh my gosh!

184
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:41,589
Do you not feel good either, Fin?

185
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:42,746
(Fin whining)

186
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:43,579
No? Meow!

187
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:48,094
Oh my goodness, you
turned into a kitty cat?

188
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:50,734
You guys turned into farm animals?

189
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:51,567
- Moo.

190
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,664
- [Missy] Oh no!

191
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,552
Ah! They're runnin' out of the house!

192
00:06:56,552 --> 00:07:00,399
This kitty cat seems to be exhausted.

193
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,835
Look at this kitty cat!

194
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:03,789
Meow!

195
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:04,622
And a cow.

196
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,005
Oh my goodness!

197
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:10,672
(playful music)

198
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,661
You guys, they've been saying
they didn't feel good all day,

199
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:24,001
and I cannot believe that they
actually turned into animals.

200
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,764
A little cow and a little kitty cat,

201
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:29,173
and I gotta say, they're
pretty stinking adorable.

202
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:32,209
Ollie is just running around
the yard eating the grass,

203
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:36,186
and little Fin is acting like a kitty cat.

204
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,614
Aww!

205
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:40,543
Look at this cow eating all our grass.

206
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,155
You're gonna ruin our grass!

207
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:45,092
I have one question for you; got milk?

208
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:47,509
And look at miss farmer June!

209
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,298
She's got all her little
animals and she's pettin' them.

210
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,048
You guys are so cute!

211
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:59,219
If you guys wanna see
how she wrangles them all

212
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,975
and their cute little skit
over on Steps to Wander

213
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:03,658
make sure you guys go check the I card.

214
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:06,188
It is so stinkin' cute,
and they're all just like,

215
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:10,175
actually little farm animals
hanging out with farmer June.

216
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:12,008
You guys are so cute.

217
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:15,804
I think Ollie, he's really taken
on his role very seriously.

218
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:16,788
- [Man] He'll only moo.

219
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,728
- [Missy] Yeah, he only
moos and eats grass.

220
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:20,835
- [Man] And shakes his tail.

221
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,611
(Missy laughing)

222
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,442
You're a real cow!

223
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,963
- That was so much fun.

224
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,214
They are still dressed
up in their little cow

225
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,858
and kitty cat costume, but
I did was to say, guys,

226
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:35,326
that since Ollie is gonna
be out tonight, aren't ya?

227
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:36,907
You're gonna be out partyin' tonight?

228
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,496
We are gonna do our
advent calendar right now.

229
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:42,176
So as you guys know, we started
doing this advent calendar,

230
00:08:42,177 --> 00:08:43,010
or is it an advent calendar?

231
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,778
I don't know, it's a Halloween calendar.

232
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:49,117
The boys are gonna pick out
their little candy for today.

233
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:50,647
Yay!

234
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,369
Okay, get the number three!

235
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:53,410
No, not that one!

236
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,797
Oh well, I'll just fill it.

237
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:56,983
Oh, at the top, the top!

238
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,483
Oh, good job, yay!

239
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,137
Alright, we'll just put this one in here.

240
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:04,243
(Missy laughing)

241
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,682
Alright, since Fin got
to pick the candy out,

242
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:10,865
we got the colors, an Ollie
gets to pick the color.

243
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:13,281
Red, and Fin gets orange.

244
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,940
Yay, what do you guys say?

245
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,510
- Thank you.
(Fin babbling)

246
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,541
(Missy laughing)

247
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,291
- Look who's up guys.

248
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:24,215
It's daddy, the boys missed him so much.

249
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:28,121
He's come out of his
cave for a little bit.

250
00:09:28,121 --> 00:09:30,038
- Yeah, just for dessert.

251
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:31,889
- [Missy] Did you miss daddy, Fin?

252
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,315
(Fin laughing)

253
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:34,148
They missed him.

254
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:35,006
- Guess what?
- What?

255
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,589
- Papa gets to take care of me!

256
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:39,980
- [Missy] Yeah!

257
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,951
- Papa's takin' him to
the little hoe down at--

258
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,322
- I know, we're so bummed.

259
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:47,438
We're bummed because Bryan is so sick

260
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:51,521
that he just can't take
Ollie to the dad's night.

261
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:55,158
Such a bummer, but luckily we've got Papa.

262
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:56,430
He's a pretty good dad to me.

263
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,680
So, he is gonna go hang out with Ollie.

264
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:03,550
(Ollie babbling)

265
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,764
- They're real excited, he's gonna go

266
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,060
out tonight and have fun.

267
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,675
But yeah, Bryan's up, we're
havin' a little family time

268
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,783
right now, but I have to
tell Bryan a little story.

269
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:15,950
Earlier today, me and Fin
were sitting on the couch,

270
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:19,284
and me and Fin found something

271
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,501
very disgusting sitting on our couch.

272
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,334
- [Bryan] What'd you find?

273
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,506
- Do you wanna see what we found?

274
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,782
It's okay, I trapped it in here

275
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:27,573
so that you can see it specially.

276
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:29,207
- Oh my god.

277
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:30,843
Oh my gosh, that's scorpions.

278
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:31,915
Oh my god, and they're alive?

279
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:32,748
- [Missy] Yes.

280
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:36,410
- Why are they so small?
- Two baby scorpions.

281
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,398
- In our couch?

282
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:40,180
- On the couch, just
sitting there hanging out.

283
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,161
Chilling.

284
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:45,328
I literally tore this place
apart, flipped everything upside

285
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:49,178
down, vacuumed everything.

286
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:50,011
- Look at 'em.

287
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:52,170
- I haven't found
anymore, there's just two,

288
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,294
but I'm kind of scared,
like where is the mom?

289
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:55,934
- I've never seen scorpions anywhere,

290
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,299
and then all of a sudden we
see those two in the garage,

291
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,940
and then these two are smaller than those.

292
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,956
- I know, those are babies.

293
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:06,625
I'm freaking out, I literally
torn this place upside down.

294
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,252
I just called our pest
guy, so he will be here

295
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,343
in a few days, so that'll help,

296
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:12,705
but I'm definitely traumatized.

297
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,273
Now, first thing you have to know

298
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,774
is that these are not deadly.

299
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:19,031
They will give you a good
sting, and they'll hurt,

300
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:21,547
and they'll probably feel
worse than a bee sting.

301
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,737
But, they're not deadly,
so that's good to know.

302
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:27,100
Second, that's just
disgusting, I don't know.

303
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,413
I'm hoping they just got
brought in maybe on like a towel

304
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:33,407
or something, and then
they just jumped off.

305
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,681
That's what my hope is,
I've cleaned everything up,

306
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:38,250
so hopefully we don't
see any more around here.

307
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,083
So gross.

308
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,791
(upbeat music)

309
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:51,691
Alright, where you heading?

310
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:54,274
(all laughing)

311
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:57,242
So, where are you heading, baby?

312
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,514
- To my school!

313
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,242
- [Missy] Yeah, and who's coming with you?

314
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:01,200
- Papa!

315
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,494
- [Missy] Are you so excited?

316
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:03,327
- Yeah!

317
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:04,424
- Alright, well just so you know,

318
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:08,591
you do have a curfew, so you
better be home on time, okay?

319
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:10,359
- Okay.

320
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,756
(Missy giggling)

321
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,860
- [Missy] Fin doesn't want him to go.

322
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,169
(Missy laughing)

323
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,077
- I'm gonna miss you, Fin.

324
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:19,937
I promise I won't be mean.

325
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,520
I don't walk right.

326
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,059
- [Missy] You're so cute, bud.

327
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,116
I'm gonna miss you, too.

328
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,185
Aww.

329
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:30,018
(laid back music)

330
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:39,847
(Ollie squealing)

331
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:43,200
- [Papa] What do you got there?

332
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,919
Alright, want me to get him off?

333
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,194
(Ollie panicking)

334
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:51,361
(crowd chattering)
(laid back music)

335
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,294
- Is it your bedtime?

336
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:18,429
(Fin babbling)

337
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,914
He's so excited, 'cause he
has his Halloween outfit on.

338
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:22,415
(Fin yelling)

339
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:23,248
Halloween!

340
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:25,626
It is time for bed.

341
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:28,460
Me and Fin are all cleaned
up and ready for bed,

342
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,663
Ollie is out late tonight, and

343
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,561
it's so weird not having him here,

344
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,436
but it is always fun
to have a special night

345
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:36,266
every once in a while which just Fin

346
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:38,127
to read him books and have a special time.

347
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:41,221
I did wanna show you guys Fin's bed.

348
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,687
If you guys didn't know,
he can officially climb out

349
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,336
of the mattress sitting on the floor.

350
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:50,320
It is a pretty far
climb, but he just climbs

351
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,892
right up and climbs right out.

352
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:55,348
And it made nap time basically impossible,

353
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:57,850
and bedtime very difficult, so I had

354
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,904
to go ahead and get a net.

355
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,012
And I'm super bummed about it,

356
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:03,624
because it does make bedtime
a little bit difficult

357
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:05,297
because I basically have to put him it,

358
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:06,626
and then I have to zip him up,

359
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,380
and usually is like,
what are you doing, mom?

360
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,213
What are you doing?

361
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:11,812
He tries to get out, and it's so horrible.

362
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:14,181
I hate it, and another reason
why I hate it is because

363
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:15,718
we have Nest cams all over the room

364
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:19,291
as you guys probably
know, and I can't see him.

365
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,788
I basically can't see
him, I can only hear him

366
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:23,973
through this monitor and hear
him through the Nest cams,

367
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,484
and it's such a bummer,
because I love checking on them

368
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:28,394
throughout the night, making
sure that they're good

369
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:31,200
and sleeping good, and in a good position.

370
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,141
So, if anyone has any
suggestions for that,

371
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:35,986
let me know, because I
am definitely bummed.

372
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:37,444
It's just a big, white net.

373
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,775
He is sleeping good in it, though.

374
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:43,400
It has solved our issue,
at least for bedtime.

375
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,690
Nap time does seem to be a
little bit more difficult

376
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,118
because he doesn't really
wanna go to bed anyways,

377
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:51,304
and then when I go to zip
him up into it at nap time,

378
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,268
he's like, get me out of here!

379
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,323
And I'm like, no, take a nap!

380
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:57,273
If you guys have any suggestions,

381
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,975
let me know down in the comments.

382
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,410
But it is bedtime.

383
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,810
I try and get him to bed by
7:30, and it's 7:15 right now.

384
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,164
So I think that's pretty good.

385
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:06,566
Let me know down in the comments, though,

386
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:08,527
what time do you guys usually go to bed?

387
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:09,662
Do you have a bedtime?

388
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:11,832
I definitely have bedtime for the boys.

389
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:13,653
I like to get Fin in bed by 7:30,

390
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:15,717
and Ollie in bed by eight o'clock.

391
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:18,077
I usually try and be in
bed by like midnight.

392
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:19,115
I know it's a little bit late,

393
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:20,691
but that's what I like to do.

394
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:22,208
Hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

395
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,590
Alright, say, give the
video a big thumbs up!

396
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,753
Yeah!

397
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:26,586
- Halloween!

398
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,511
- Halloween, happy Halloween!

399
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,635
Say, leave in the
comments happy Halloween!

400
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:32,657
(Fin grunting)

401
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:34,213
And say, we'll see you guys tomorrow!

402
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,046
Say, bye!

403
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:38,454
- [Fin] Boop.

404
00:15:38,454 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
