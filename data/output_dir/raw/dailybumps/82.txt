- [All] Good morning, merry Christmas!

19
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,013
- It is Christmas morning, and these boys

20
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,609
slept so good last night in their bed.

21
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,222
Hey Ollie, good morning.

22
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,085
- Good morning.

23
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:01,918
- [Bryan] I love you.

24
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:02,751
- I love you too.

25
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:03,869
- Are you so excited for Christmas?

26
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:04,702
- Yeah!

27
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:05,535
- [Bryan] Okay.

28
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:06,368
- Merry Christmas.

29
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:07,582
- [Bryan] What's going on out here?

30
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:09,415
- Look!
- [Bryan] Whoa!

31
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,764
- He disappeared in the cage, look!

32
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,319
- [Missy] (whispering) What in the world?

33
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,494
- [Bryan] What happened, Ollie?

34
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:16,327
- I don't know.

35
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,802
- [Bryan] The cage fell last night.

36
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:19,751
You guys, there's a note from Santa!

37
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,682
- [Ollie] Really, what did he say?

38
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,428
- Okay, it says, dear Ollie and Finn,

39
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:26,527
you boys are so silly!

40
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,384
You can't catch Santa!

41
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:30,384
Nice try though, ho, ho!

42
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:34,073
Fred has reported that you both

43
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:36,714
have been very nice this year.

44
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:38,420
Keep it up!

45
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,944
Merry Christmas, Santa.

46
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:44,004
P.S. Nice cage, very festive. (laughs)

47
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,618
I think he thought it was really funny

48
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:47,069
that you guys tried to catch him, huh?

49
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:48,079
- [Ollie] Yeah.
- [Finn] Yeah.

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,212
- [Bryan] He obviously
didn't fall for it (laughs).

51
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:51,354
- We should have known
you can't catch Santa.

52
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:52,672
- Stop, guys!

53
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:53,709
- [Bryan] Whoa!

54
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,113
- [Missy] What is that?

55
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:56,109
- What?

56
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:57,756
That is quite the barrier.

57
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,236
Ollie, you wanna know what it says?

58
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,069
- [Ollie] What?

59
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,649
- [Bryan] It says, "No peeking!"

60
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:02,873
- [Missy] Did you peak?

61
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,971
- Yeah.

62
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:05,226
(laughter)

63
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:08,126
- I think they peeked under there.

64
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:10,555
- Alright, we're gonna open this.

65
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,804
(gasps) Looks like there's gonna be

66
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:15,445
some fun to be had though
here, this morning, huh?

67
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:16,278
- [Ollie] Yeah.

68
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:19,479
- [Missy] One, two, three, go!

69
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,646
- [Bryan] Merry Christmas!

70
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:28,309
(soft guitar music with sleigh bells)

71
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:16,091
- [Bryan] Look who's all here, guys!

72
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,197
(laughter)

73
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,030
Merry Christmas, guys!

74
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,591
Whoa, what?

75
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:23,728
- [Missy] Finn, what is that?

76
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,327
(relatives talking)

77
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:27,490
- I did not buy that.

78
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,919
That is so cute!

79
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,298
- [Bryan] Is that from Santa?

80
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:31,131
- Yeah.

81
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:33,583
- [Bryan] He brought
you a little roadster?

82
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,230
That's so cool.

83
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,330
You can zip around the house.

84
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,468
Look, it steers even, that's cool, huh?

85
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:42,488
Go say good morning and merry
Christmas to everyone, Finn.

86
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,571
(upbeat music with sleigh bells)

87
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:54,100
Seems like there's a pile of
presents that we haven't seen.

88
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,184
- I set all of this up, but that is new!

89
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:58,083
(laughter)

90
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,947
- What happened, Ollie?

91
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:02,499
- They ate the cookies.

92
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,296
- And most of the milk, huh?

93
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:06,125
- Ollie, did you check the reindeer food?

94
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:06,958
- Yeah.

95
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,533
- You should go see what it looks like.

96
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:09,562
(Ollie laughing)

97
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:10,395
What!

98
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:12,959
Dasher and Prancer must have been

99
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,866
eating their corn this morning, huh?

100
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:15,699
- Yeah.

101
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:19,103
- It is cold out here!

102
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:22,342
We may not have a white
Christmas here in California,

103
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:24,906
but we definitely have a cold one.

104
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:27,214
(laughing)

105
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:28,860
It is so funny that
Finn just hops right on

106
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,713
this little roadster car and drives away.

107
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:33,206
Oh, look at the steering wheel!

108
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,289
It's all decorated.

109
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:36,815
That looks like Santa's wrapping paper.

110
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,398
(upbeat music)

111
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,034
Alright, we are going through stocking.

112
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,091
What'd you get, Batman?

113
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:47,998
- Yeah.

114
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:50,669
- [Bryan] Ooh, a Pez dispenser, cool.

115
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,415
And what else did you get, Finn?

116
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:55,653
Oh, a bag of unicorn farts cotton candy?

117
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:57,467
(Ollie shouts)

118
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:58,300
What are those?

119
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,154
- These are dinosaurs.

120
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:01,057
- [Bryan] Oh that's so cool.

121
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:01,890
(Finn laughs)

122
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,851
You got a Batman Pez?

123
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:03,684
- Yeah.

124
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:04,934
- [Bryan] Nice.

125
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:13,580
(upbeat music with sleigh bells)

126
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,076
- My stocking had a little
baby can of WD-40 in it.

127
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,053
That's pretty genius, thanks Santa.

128
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,818
Finn's stocking is basically bottomless

129
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:21,769
when it comes to him.

130
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:22,602
What is this?

131
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:23,838
You got a nose, a silly nose?

132
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:24,671
- [Missy] My goodness!

133
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,504
- [Bryan] And who is this, Luke Skywalker?

134
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:28,606
Cool.

135
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:32,077
Reach in, reach in, oh,
reach in, what'd you find?

136
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:32,994
Whoa, cool!

137
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,828
(Finn shouts)

138
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:38,661
BB-8!

139
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:42,837
Hey Finn, look what else
is in here, you wanna see?

140
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:44,087
It's Chewbacca!

141
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:48,120
- [Missy] Oh my goodness, cute!

142
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,953
- Chewy.

143
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:53,221
- Do, do, do, you go (plays kazoo).

144
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,488
Can you do it?

145
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,859
Do, do, do, he's like,
no way, that's weird.

146
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:57,692
(laughs)

147
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,454
- [Bryan] Alright, Finn's
got this cool sucker.

148
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:00,287
I'm gonna show him what he looks like.

149
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:01,432
Look at the screen!

150
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:02,488
(laughter)

151
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,488
Is that you?

152
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:07,710
You got one too?

153
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,207
(laughter)

154
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:11,347
- [Missy] That is so cool.

155
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,180
- Nice smile, dude.

156
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,248
Time to pass out presents!

157
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,111
Oh, that one's for you! (laughs)

158
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,033
(Finn shouts)

159
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,033
We have breakfast in the oven right now.

160
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:23,059
I am drinking my English
Breakfast tea and biscotti.

161
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,557
Check this out, Missy's
drinking hot apple cider

162
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:28,103
in her "Aye Sassenach" cup that Teralyn,

163
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:29,927
which is really cool.

164
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,797
And we are passin' out presents.

165
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:32,811
(Finn yells)

166
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,707
Alright, the boys are gonna
practice opening these two!

167
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:38,129
Rip 'em open, rip 'em
open, what'd you get?

168
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,629
- I got something.

169
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:44,927
- [Bryan] Whoa, you got a grabber!

170
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,106
- It's a claw!

171
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,710
(Finn shouts)

172
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,854
- [Bryan] You got one too,
Finn, oh, it's a claw?

173
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:52,927
- Yeah. I wanted one of
these for three weeks.

174
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,793
- [Bryan] For three weeks
you've wanted this? (laughs)

175
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,439
- Very specific, three weeks!

176
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,463
- [Bryan] Whoa, you got a claw! (laughs)

177
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,283
- Wow, that's a big one for me.

178
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,057
- [Bryan] Yes it is!

179
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:08,223
Are you so excited?

180
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:10,276
Well don't open it yet, we gotta wait.

181
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:11,784
Wait your turn, okay?

182
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:14,217
Alright, go ahead Finn, you
started unwrapping it already.

183
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:15,085

188
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:24,840

227
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:38,111
He's like taking each
individual piece of tape off.

228
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:38,944

00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:06,357
- Ow, ow!

239
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:08,916
- [Bryan] Papa's opening your present.

240
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,255
- That's a collector's
edition though, see?

241
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:12,564
(murmuring)

242
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:14,123

- What did you get me, boys?

247
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:21,839

00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:23,841
It's a Cozmo!

249
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:26,703
- [Missy] Oh my goodness,
your own little robot!

250
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:30,192
- Ooh, collector's edition, liquid metal?

251
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:32,126
- [Woman] You think it
would get along with Geebo?

252
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,178
- It has a thing.

253
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:34,011
Maybe.

258
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:38,608
(Missy laughs)

259
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:41,000
Thank you, thank you for the robot, Finn.

260
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,954
(laughter)

261
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:46,945
- [Missy] I'm not putting
my toy down! (laughs)

262
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:47,778
- Daddy loves robots.

263
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:50,135
Alright, boys, we have two presents here

264
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:51,736

272
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:02,282
- [Bryan] What is it?

273
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,127
- A Mr. Freeze guy!

274
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:05,817
- [Bryan] What, with a robot suit?

275
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:06,813
- Yeah!

276
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,503
- [Bryan] He even knows how it works.

277
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:09,576

278
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,843

(Finn shouts)

281
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:16,624
You wanna open it?

00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:17,922
Alright, rip it open, Finn.

- [Bryan] Open it up, boys!

286
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:24,404
(laughs) How many people does
it take to open a present?

287
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:27,321
These elves, wrapping forever, oof.

288
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:29,580
Grab it, grab it!

289
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,287

- ♪ Sponge Bob Square Pants,
Sponge Bob Square Pants ♪

293
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:38,962
(Bryan laughs)

294
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:40,638
- So, I have a gift here from Pam so-

295
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:41,471
- [Bryan] Pam, who's Pam?

296
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:43,581
- Pam's one of my chickens, I'm like-

297
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:45,342
- [Bryan] Wait, Pam, or Pan?

298
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:46,489
- Pam.

299
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:48,829
- Wait, what do your chickens
get you for Christmas?

300
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:49,662
- One of my chickens got me a gift.

301
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:50,495
- [Bryan] What?

302
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,328
- I'm kinda nervous what's in there.

303
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:53,680
I'm wondering if it's like,
fertile eggs or something,

304
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,204
'cause I know she really
wants more chickens.

305
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:58,511
Oh gosh, what if it is an actual chicken?

306
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:00,637
You can't just put chickens
in boxes, you guys.

307
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:03,281
- Oh, I don't hear anything, so...

308
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:04,608
- She's a pretty good decorator.

309
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:07,040
- I know, she's such a good wrapper.

310
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,905
Oh my gosh, you actually got one?

311
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:11,519
- She got you that.

312
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,477
- [Bryan] I didn't do
anything, what'd Pam do?

313
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,060
Oh, that's so cool!

314
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:19,532
- Do you know how many, like, Tweets

315
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:21,492
I get a day when I show
me bringing eggs in?

316
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:23,073
I usually drop at least one, maybe.

317
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,253
- [Bryan] I know, 'cause you're so clumsy.

318
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:26,826
- It's like a little apron, with slots

319
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:28,799
to put my eggs so I don't drop 'em.

320
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,006
- [Bryan] And it's a nice color.

321
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:30,958
- I love this!

322
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:31,791
- [Bryan] I like that.

323
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,568
- She's really tired of you
wasting all her hard work.

324
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,401
- I know.

325
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,535
I'm gonna need a spot to hang this,

326
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:37,960
so I can just grab it, put
it on, go get my eggs...

327
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,793
- [Bryan] Totally.

328
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:40,330
- Oh my gosh, this is so cute.

329
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,372
- [Bryan] Finn, this is from Ollie.

330
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:44,576
He picked this out just for you, okay?

331
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:45,409
- Wow.

332
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,685
- [Bryan] Ollie, remember
you picked this out for him?

333
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,315
- Yeah, it's the jungle crew.

334
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:52,583
- [Bryan] That is so cool, huh, Finn?

335
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,846
- Open it.

336
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,003
- Wow.

337
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,838
- [Bryan] Finn, say "Thank you, Ollie."

338
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:58,442
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

339
00:11:58,442 --> 00:11:59,827

344
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,217
- [Missy] Yeah, little different.

345
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:13,050
- [Bryan] Oh, I like this a lot.

346
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,509
- [Missy] And it turns,
it's reversible, guys.

347
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,259
So it's a belt, yep, there ya go.

348
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:20,842
- Nice, thanks, babe.

349
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:21,675
- Is there a bag?

350
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,123
- [Missy] Yes, it has to stay in the bag

351
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:24,631
at all times, no. (laughs)

352
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:28,132

- Ooh, just from Ollie?

360
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:44,254
- [Bryan] Yes.

361
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,337
- Oh my goodness, Claire?

362
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:51,270
That is so cute.

363
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,548
- [Bryan] You're very own Claire Randall.

364
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:57,416
- I love it, thanks, Ollie.

365
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,351
- [Ollie] You're welcome.

366
00:12:58,351 --> 00:12:59,739
- [Missy] That is such a cute little gift.

367
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:03,216
- [Bryan] I got you a job for Christmas!

368
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,154
Have fun opening that
duct-tape box (laughs).

369
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:08,252
He's actually using a new
knife that Cassie just got him,

370
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:10,139
which is coming in very handy.

371
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,046
That's what we're gonna
do, we're just gonna

372
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,981
give you tools and things to put together.

373
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:17,064
(upbeat music with sleigh bells)

374
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,217
- Ready?

375
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,631
- [Bryan] Alright, this one is from Finny!

376
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:26,565
- Oh, it better be Jamie,
it better be Jamie.

377
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:28,492
- [Bryan] Finn, Finn knows what it is.

378
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:31,373
- There's that, thank you!

379
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:32,690
I love it.

380
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,955
- [Bryan] Just so you
know, he had to search

381
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:35,587
a lotta comic book stores for that one.

382
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:36,476
It's pretty rare, actually. (laughs)

383
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:38,623
- Oh my gosh, I think it's so cool.

384
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:40,961
Where's my, oh, he took my Claire.

385
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,516
- [Bryan] That's so cool,
you have the whole set now.

386
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:44,131
- Yeah, this is so fun.

387
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:46,289
- [Bryan] Hey, babe, you need
help opening this present?

388
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,376
- Yeah, sure.

389
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,209
(knife clicks)

390
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:49,417
(Missy yells)

391
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:50,800
So scary!

392
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,354
- [Bryan] Nice knife
from Papa, thanks, Papa!

393
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:54,926
- Wow, that cuts really easily.

394
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:56,634
- [Bryan] Like butta. (laughs)

395
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:57,967
- Put that away.

396
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,877
Cashmere gossamer scarf, that's it?

397
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,944
- [Bryan] It's a cashmere scarf, feel it.

398
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:10,527
- Wow, this is cool, I love it.

399
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,132
It's perfect for California
'cause it's not too cold.

400
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:14,965
- [Bryan] Yeah.

401
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:16,743
- And it's fashionable.

402
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:18,108
I love the color.

403
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:18,941
- The color.

404
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,304
- [Bryan] I did good with the color?

405
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:21,137
- Thank you.

406
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:21,970
- [Bryan] You're welcome, baby.

407
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,053
Finn's opening a big one!

408
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:27,362
Nice, Go, Go, Smart Wheels!

409
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,527
What do you say, Finn?

410
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:33,819
- Thank you, Mimi.

411
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,253
- You're welcome.

412
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:36,086
- And who?

413
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:37,600
- And Papa.

414
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,025
- Thank you, Papa.

415
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,321
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

416
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,164
You're getting really good
at opening presents, Ollie.

417
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:46,661
I am very impressed as to how these boys

418
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:48,234
are doing on this Christmas morning.

419
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:49,379
What is it?

420
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:52,118
(gasps) Whoa, that's really him?

421
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:53,876
That's so cool!

422
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,126
You got Miguel!

423
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:58,464
- [Missy] Alright, Mimi's turn.

424
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,306
What do you think it is, Finn?

425
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:02,336
- You got me an Apple watch?

426
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,108
- You got an Apple watch!

427
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:06,872
- I feel like it was time, you need one!

428
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,653
(laughter)

429
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:11,535
You kinda mentioned that
you should totally have one.

430
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,338
- [Bryan] Missy's opening
a package from Jenny M.?

431
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:17,444
I don't know if she knows a Jenny M.

432
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,406
Do you not know a Jenny M.?

433
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:20,239
- Oh!

434
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,619
- [Bryan] Oh, could it be Jamie's sister,

435
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:24,918
Jenny, who likes to cook?

436
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:27,092
- Oh my gosh, that's so funny.

437
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,180
(Bryan laughs)

438
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,506
That is so cool.

439
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:34,141
- Now we can make all the super
yummy things from Outlander.

440
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,027
- I think this'll just be fun to have

441
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:38,321
in the kitchen, but yeah, this is fun.

442
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,646
- [Bryan] And there's a
forward by the author, too.

443
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,254
- I don't, I've heard Scottish food is

444
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:44,260
a little interesting, so
if you're from Scotland,

445
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,368
tell me if your food's good.

446
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:47,559
- [Bryan] Yeah, ooh, those look good.

447
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,309
Whoa, you got dragon?

448
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,065
- Yeah!

449
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:54,531
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

450
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,198
(paper tearing)

451
00:15:58,985 --> 00:15:59,818
Wow!

452
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,933
Finn, what'd you get?

453
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,494
(boys shout)

454
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:05,777
Batman!

455
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:07,290
- What is it?

456
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,021
- [Bryan] They're Allbirds!

457
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,059
Oh, they're Allbirds?

458
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:14,092
- [Bryan] They're the world's
most comfortable shoes.

459
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:16,296
- Whoa, these look so comfortable.

460
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:17,172
- [Missy] They are the
most comfortable shoe.

461
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:19,164
- [Bryan] They're kinda like
slippers with a hard sole,

462
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:21,821
so they're good for lounging.

463
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:22,786
- The boys have the same
ones, I have the same ones,

464
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:23,619
Bryan has the same ones,
we can all be matching.

465
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:25,248
They are very comfortable.

466
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,329
- Thank you, these are awesome.

467
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:28,627
- [Bryan] You're welcome.

468
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:29,460
- What is it, what is it?

469
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,144
- [Bryan] It's Crazy Toaster game?

470
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:33,366
- Yeah.

471
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,480
- [Missy] Ollie and Finn got you a-

472
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,935
- [Bryan] Ollie and Finn
got you a skateboard!

473
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:41,849
Finn, what'd you get, a super smile set?

474
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:42,939
- Yeah.

475
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,839
- [Bryan] For your Batman toothbrush?

476
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,267
We got you a speaker!

477
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,893
- [Missy] (cheers) So you
have something to listen to.

478
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:50,726
- [Bryan] It's the cool
new green one, too.

479
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:51,778
Finn, what'd you get?

480
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:52,611
Lemme see, show me.

481
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,707
Oh, it's another Go Go Smart Wheels?

482
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,271
That's cool.

483
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,329
Say that you, Mimi and Papa.

484
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:00,329
- Thank you, Mimi, Papa.

485
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:04,680
- [Bryan] What you get, what'd you get?

486
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,413
Wow, you're own dragon.

487
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:08,246
- Wow.

488
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,676
- [Bryan] That is so cool,
that matches yours, Ollie.

489
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:10,509
- Yeah.

490
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,063
- Ollie is a pro at Christmas, look.

491
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,612
He's putting all their toys
in a neat pile over here,

492
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:18,779
and Finn's like, I just
wanna play! (laughs)

493
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,755
- [Missy] Alright, Bryan's
opening one from me.

494
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:24,038
What do you think it is Ollie?

495
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:24,871
- I don't know.

496
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:25,834
(Missy laughs)

497
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,299
- Come on, Ollie, you don't know?

498
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,352
- [Missy] Never seen you
do that before. (laughs)

499
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:31,185
- Paper!

500
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:33,604
Oh, cool!

501
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,506
Is it a...oh, it's everything
for like a nice whisky kit.

502
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,618
- [Missy] Yeah.
- That's cool.

503
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:44,203
- [Missy] I wanted you to
have your own little set.

504
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:47,282
- Oh, and a cool little
decanter, that's cool.

505
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:49,017
- [Missy] Yeah.
- Thanks, babe.

506
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,153
- [Missy] You're welcome, all
kinds of goodies in there.

507
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,421
- Yay, I can make the cool ice balls.

508
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:53,945
- [Missy] Yeah.

509
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:57,143
- New pictures for the house!

510
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,872
What a good present, Ollie.

511
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:00,869
- Photos.

512
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:02,755
- And feel free to, you know,
change out those pictures.

513
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:04,129
Those just came with them, yeah.

514
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:05,819
- Those are just stock
photos, those model people.

515
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:06,773
- Do I know these people?

516
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:08,169
- [Missy] Yeah, I shoulda got you the ones

517
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,689
that you know before, but
I just didn't have time.

518
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:13,243
- [Mimi] He's pretty cute, though.

519
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:14,346
I think I'm gonna totally...

520
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:15,748
- [Missy] You should just keep 'em.

521
00:18:15,748 --> 00:18:16,581
- I should just keep 'em.

522
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:18,391
- I mean, they're cute, I
have some in Finn's room that,

523
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,051
you know, I've basically
claimed as my child.

524
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:21,390
(laughter)

525
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,007
Why do I keep getting
gifts from random people?

526
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,152
- [Bryan] What are you talking about?

527
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:26,013
Who's that one from?

528
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,672
- Uh, this one's from Mario.

529
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:30,404
- [Bryan] (laughs) Okay, I dunno.

530
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:31,518
- Mario, is there
something we should know?

531
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:33,137
Awkward.

532
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:34,208
- I know, I'm like, is this like,

533
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,375
a guy named Mario, or is this Mario...

534
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:43,427
Ooh, two red ones, I like it!

535
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,146
- [Bryan] Yeah, red switch controllers.

536
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,230
- I was never like a huge
fan of the pink and green,

537
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,042
so yeah, this is fun.

538
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,383
- [Bryan] Yeah, those ones are cool.

539
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:51,484
Good job, Mario.

540
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:53,817
Ollie, what'd you get Aunty?

541
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,279
- A bracelet.

542
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,305
- You got me a bracelet?

543
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:58,891
- [Bryan] That's so cool,
and it says "Aunty" on it.

544
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:01,685
- Aw, it says, "Because
I love you, Aunty."

545
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:02,518
- [Bryan] Aw.

546
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:03,734
- Thank you, buddies.

547
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:04,579
- You're welcome.

548
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,421
- Alright, Missy is opening her present

549
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:10,588
from me and the boys,
very carefully. (laughs)

550
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:13,762
- You're like so, excited.

551
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,144
Oh my goodness.

552
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:19,102
- [Bryan] What is it?

553
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:22,537
- Oh my goodness, what is
this, what does this mean?

554
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,437
- [Bryan] It's a horse bridle.

555
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:25,854
- Oh my goodness!

556
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:28,782
- Why?

557
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:30,324
- Am I getting a horse?

558
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,496
- [Bryan] So that you
can get a horse, babe!

559
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:33,329
- That's the first, that's-

560
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,019
- Oh my God!

561
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,932
- Don't put it, that's
actually not how it works.

562
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,138
We'll put her in lessons.

563
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:41,203
- I can go like this.

564
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:42,634
- [Bryan] Do you like it?

565
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:43,830
That's pretty though, right?

566
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,707
- Oh my gosh, it is so pretty.

567
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:47,111
Oh my God, I'm freaking out.

568
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:48,215
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, guess what?

569
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:49,048
- What?

570
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:49,881
- We're getting a horse!

571
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,714
- [Ollie] Really?

572
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:52,592
- Oh my gosh, oh my goodness.
- [Bryan] Yeah.

573
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:53,425
- Okay, give me a minute.

574
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,203
- Missy's been talking
about a horse forever,

575
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:57,920
so I figure, well, I'm
gonna get her started.

576
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,636
- Oh wow, this is so, this is so great.

577
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:01,678
- I mean, I feel like that'd be a little

578
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:02,785
fun journey for us, right?

579
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,779
To be able to go look at horses and...

580
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:05,861
- This is just so exciting.

581
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:07,116
This is like, it!

582
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:08,264
This is happening.

583
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:09,456
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool, Finn?

584
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:10,344
- Yeah.

585
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:11,689
- You wanna ride on a horsy too?

586
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:12,522
- Yeah.

587
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:13,355
- Yeah?

588
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:14,188
I love you.

589
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:15,021
- I love you.

590
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:15,854
This is so, I just like-

591
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:16,833
- I'm excited to pick
out a horse with you.

592
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,760
- I know, I can't believe
I'm like, I'm, like,

593
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,726
picturing my horse is gonna wear this.

594
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:22,559
This is so pretty.

595
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,474
Oh, it's so cool.

596
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,947
- [Bryan] I like it, it's
kinda like, Outlander-y.

597
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:28,368
It's very vintage.

598
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:29,201
- It's like vintage-y.

599
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:30,481
Oh, it's so pretty.

600
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,127
- [Bryan] What'd you get, what
do you think it is, Ollie?

601
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,137
- I don't know.

602
00:20:33,137 --> 00:20:35,355
- I'm really excited for
him to open this one.

603
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:38,442
This is a really cool one, Ollie.

604
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:39,740
- Wow!

605
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,006
- His face!

606
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:41,923
What is it?

607
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:45,760
(Bryan laughs)

608
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,337
- [Mimi] Your favorite treat!

609
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,083
- Did Daddy get you Pringles?

610
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,019
- Yeah.

611
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:51,582
- Is that pretty cool?

612
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:53,837
- [Bryan] You like Pringles, right, buddy?

613
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:54,670
- Yeah.

614
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,267
- Merry Christmas, dude.

615
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:57,883
- Merry Christmas.

616
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,079
- He's lucky I didn't wrap a banana.

617
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,246
Jimmy is opening a present
from Leo to him and Zuri.

618
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:05,853
- Oh, it's a cat toy.

619
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,457
Sack? She'll love this.

620
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:10,810
- [Bryan] Oh cool.

621
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,669
- If she sees anything she can crawl into,

622
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:13,588
she'll crawl right in.

623
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:14,421
- [Bryan] Wait, really?

624
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,945
That's so cute.

625
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:18,279
Alright, Ollie, this is from Daddy, kay?

626
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,259
It says, "Do not open until
December 25th, no peeking!"

627
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,426
But, today's December 25th (mumbles).

628
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:29,130
(murmuring)

629
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,000
- [Woman] Oh, that's a cool hat.

630
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,833
- Do you like it, dude?

631
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:32,666
- Yeah.

632
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,499
- [Missy] Wow.

633
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,383
- Smells like leather.

634
00:21:34,383 --> 00:21:35,919
- [Missy] That looks cute on you!

635
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,322
- That looks so cool on you, dude.

636
00:21:37,322 --> 00:21:38,865
Look, it's Darth Vader.

637
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:39,949
- [Missy] Do you like it?

638
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:40,782
- Yeah.

639
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:41,729
- Oh that's so cool, I love you.

640
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:42,651
- Love you too.

641
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:45,265
- [Bryan] Ollie is all Star Wars-ed up.

642
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:47,317
He's got all the Star
Wars stuff, don't you?

643
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:48,150
- Yeah.

644
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,955
- [Bryan] Bet you didn't
know what that was, Papa!

645
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:53,455
The man, the myth, the legend!

646
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:57,012
Finny, what'd you get, a chicken?

647
00:21:57,012 --> 00:21:58,154
(Finn shouts)

648
00:21:58,154 --> 00:21:58,987
(laughter)

649
00:21:58,987 --> 00:21:59,925
- [Missy] Especially if Momma got it.

650
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:01,570
(chicken toy squawking)

651
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,596
- [Bryan] What'd you just get, babe?

652
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:05,235
- My mom just got me a Pooch Selfie,

653
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:07,772
and it clips on my phone and
Karma will totally do this.

654
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:09,253
- [Bryan] Oh, so it's a ball.

655
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:10,306
- Yeah, it's a ball.

656
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:11,815
- [Bryan] So you can capture the perfect

657
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:12,648
selfie with your pet! (laughs)

658
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:13,481
- So you can selfie...

659
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:14,743
I'll literally just say
"ball," and he'll be like...

660
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:16,719
Like, for real.

661
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,552
- [Bryan] That's genius.

662
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:19,363
What are you gettin', Finn?

663
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:21,840
(Finn shouts)

664
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,313
(murmuring)

665
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:25,146
Yeah!

666
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:28,116
He's opening his present from me!

667
00:22:28,116 --> 00:22:30,312
- [Missy] Alright, what'd you get, Jimmy?

668
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:33,156
- Okay, it's one of these ones.

669
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:34,559
- It's one of those
crates that Bryan's been

670
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,761
getting everyone, but
it's a little different.

671
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:38,896
- [Bryan] So what'd it come with?

672
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:40,400
- I got glasses, so
it's probably something-

673
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,850
- [Missy] We got glass-wear, ooh.

674
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,295
I feel like you're gonna
need to go outside for this.

675
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:46,168
- [Mimi] Smash me.

676
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,781
- [Bryan] What else did it come, a hammer?

677
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:48,614
- [Missy] A hammer.

678
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:49,958
- [Bryan] And what else?

679
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,521
- Something that says, "Smash Me."

680
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:54,073
- [Mimi] And then, something in there that

681
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,487
declares that he is great.

682
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:56,803
You are great.

683
00:22:56,803 --> 00:22:58,567
- [Bryan] So you basically
have to smash that giant

684
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:01,465
concrete gift card to get what you want.

685
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,925
- Um, I feel like I
have to do that outside.

686
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,118
(laughter)

687
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:05,951
- [Bryan] Yeah, probably outside.

688
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,449
- It's pretty cool though.

689
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:09,264
The boys are so excited to help

690
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,119
Uncle open up this concrete thing.

691
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,180
- Alright, see how much pressure I need.

692
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,222
(hammer smacking)

693
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:16,659
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

694
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,451
Oh, he got it!

695
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:21,711
(hammer smacking)

696
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:24,248
- [Woman] There ya go.

697
00:23:24,248 --> 00:23:25,228
- [Ollie] What's in it, what's in it?

698
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:26,134
- Alright, let's see what we got.

699
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:26,967
- [Missy] It's a gift card.

700
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:27,859
- Alright, it's a gift card...

701
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:29,615
- Alright, we have finished unwrapping

702
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:32,507
all the presents from
all the family members.

703
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:34,690
We have a pile of Santa gifts that still

704
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,936
need to be opened, but there is one

705
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:40,853
very exciting gift that
we are about to receive.

706
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:45,090
We are four away from hitting
three million subscribers,

707
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,010
- Oh my goodness.

708
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,444
- On this YouTube channel,
and I'm kinda freaking out.

709
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:50,176
- How crazy that it ended
up, that it's gonna happen-

710
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:51,009
- On Christmas Day!

711
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,214
- On Christmas, like, that
is a Christmas present.

712
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:54,401
My mom's holding it up right now.

713
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,244
It's three, oh, four.

714
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:58,649
- [Bryan] Four more,
we only need four more!

715
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:00,213
- [Missy] Three more!

716
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:01,600
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

717
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,854
- This is so exciting.

718
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:03,687
- [Bryan] What an amazing Christmas gift.

719
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:05,618
- Ollie, did you know that we're about

720
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:08,016
to hit three million subscribers?

721
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:09,857
- [Bryan] Do you even
know how to fathom that?

722
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:10,690
- What does that mean to you?

723
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,788
- Um, I don't know.

724
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:12,680
- Yeah, I don't know.

725
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,513
- Do you remember all those-

726
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:14,777
- Oh, one!
- Oh, someone else!

727
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:15,610
There it is!

728
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,925
- [Bryan] Three million!

729
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:19,371
(shouting)

730
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:20,618
- Thank you, guys!

731
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:22,209
- Merry Christmas!

732
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:25,200
We just hit three million
subscribers on this channel.

733
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,124
- You guys actually got
us a gift for Christmas!

734
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:29,103
- That's amazing, seriously,
thank you guys so much.

735
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:31,719
That's incredible, three
million, babe, wow!

736
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:33,404
- I think it was like-

737
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:36,708
- [Bryan] And on Christmas
morning, like, that's crazy.

738
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,049
- I know, I mean, I think it
was like, what was it, like,

739
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,720
six years ago on, like,
I remember near Christmas

740
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,446
we were talking about
starting daily vlogging.

741
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:44,279
- [Bryan] Yeah.

742
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,898
- How long, was it five?

743
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:48,030
- It was actually five years,
'cause we're about to hit

744
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,784
five years of daily vlogging in January.

745
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:53,382
- So we started talking
about it in December,

746
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:55,370
and it was like, I don't
know, I don't know.

747
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,459
- You were just barely
pregnant with Ollie,

748
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,934
and you were so nervous
to start a channel.

749
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:00,767
- I was so nervous.

750
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,830
I was like afraid to start daily vlogging

751
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,953
when I was pregnant with Ollie,

752
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:05,093
especially in the early stages,

753
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,422
'cause I just didn't,
I didn't know if I was

754
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,124
ready to share my every
day, of maybe going

755
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:10,799
through something that
would be really hard.

756
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,112
And, yeah, I was just-

757
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:14,835
- And five years later, here we are.

758
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:16,569
- We're still doing it!

759
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:17,956
- That is seriously so cool.

760
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:18,789
Thank you guys!

761
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:20,099
Three million subscribers, Ollie.

762
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,057
- [Missy] Thank you.

763
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:22,335
- [Bryan] That's crazy,
can you say thank you?

764
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:23,921
- Thank you.

765
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,215
- These kids are having so much
fun opening all their toys.

766
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:27,981
Alright, we have some really special

767
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:30,229
presents from Santa, everyone, so Santa

768
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,562
wants us to open these, okay?

769
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:33,410
- [Missy] We really need
to open up these gifts.

770
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,993
(upbeat music)

771
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:49,741
- [Bryan] Alright boys, let's
open some Santa presents, kay?

772
00:25:49,741 --> 00:25:51,891
This one is to both of you.

773
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:53,974
I'll help you out, 'cause
that's kind of difficult.

774
00:25:53,974 --> 00:25:55,199
- [Missy] Here Finny, you
can open on this side.

775
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,850
- [Woman] Santa's the real deal.

776
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,824
- [Missy] Yeah. (laughs)

777
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:58,819
(paper crinkling)

778
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:00,605
- [Bryan] There you go.

779
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:03,989
Wow, a box, open it, open it, open it!

780
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:07,905
(gasps) Ooh, slippers!
- [Missy] Oh, cute slippers!

781
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:10,003
- [Bryan] Those are dragons?

782
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,119
Those are so cool.

783
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,826
And you got little fox ones?

784
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,471
- [Missy] Wow, thank you, Santa!

785
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:15,304
You wanna put 'em on?

786
00:26:15,304 --> 00:26:16,146
- Yeah.

787
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:18,051
- [Bryan] Oh my goodness, Finn's putting

788
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:19,270
these little fox things on.

789
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,247
Stand up, I wanna see, I wanna see.

790
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,897
- [Missy] Oh my goodness, whoa.

791
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:24,281
(laughter)

792
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:25,114
Are they on all the way?

793
00:26:25,114 --> 00:26:26,555
- [Bryan] Can you walk?

794
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:28,130
- What does the fox say?

795
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,554
- [Bryan] Walk around.

796
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:30,387
(Missy laughs)

797
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:33,488
- [Bryan] It's 'cause the
tails are like, tickling him.

798
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:35,841
That is so cute, Finny, come here!

799
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:38,936
The elves must have made
them in the workshop, Ollie.

800
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:41,284
I wonder if they're magic slippers.

801
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:42,952
There's that one...these look so...

802
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:44,763
these actually look like Toothless, Ollie,

803
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:46,440
from How to Train Your Dragon.

804
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,826
Let's see.

805
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:49,292
- [Missy] Look how cute you guys are!

806
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:50,375
- [Bryan] What do you think,

807
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,193
can they make you run really fast?

808
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,776
(upbeat music)

809
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:02,906
Alright, to Mimi from Santa.

810
00:27:04,078 --> 00:27:05,617
- It's a blanket!

811
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:07,292
(murmuring)

812
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,801
- [Bryan] The elves sewed that.

813
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,078
- The elves did this?

814
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:10,911
- [Bryan] Yup.

815
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:12,243
- Wow, that's really nice.

816
00:27:12,243 --> 00:27:14,386
- [Missy] Cassie, from Santa.

817
00:27:14,386 --> 00:27:16,734
- Alright, let's see what
Santa brought me today.

818
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:19,970
Oh, it's a new speaker, it's the pill one?

819
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,996
(murmuring)

820
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:22,521
Oh, that is so cool.

821
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:24,136
- [Bryan] Santa knows what's up!

822
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:25,962
- Santa knows what's
up, he'll love my music.

823
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:27,835
- [Bryan] Alright, Carlos,
Santa's got something.

824
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:28,668
- [Missy] Santa.

825
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:30,743
- [Bryan] Apple TV, nice!

826
00:27:30,743 --> 00:27:32,145
(murmuring)

827
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:34,213
- [Missy] Nice, Santa!

828
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:37,150
- Santa brought me something
really cool, you wanna see?

829
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,816
I'm so excited to see.

830
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:40,984
What did Santa bring me?

831
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:43,460
(gasps) What?

832
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,352
- [Missy] What is that?

833
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:48,968
- A Star Wars drone that we
can fly around the house?

834
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:49,801
- Yeah.

835
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,357
- [Missy] Oh my goodness,
thank you, Santa!

836
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:53,555
- Oh, thank you Santa!

837
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:54,550
- That's just like you're tattoo.

838
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,622
(Missy laughs)

839
00:27:55,622 --> 00:27:56,891
- I know it is just like my tattoo.

840
00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:57,724
- [Missy] How cool.

841
00:27:57,724 --> 00:27:59,862
(paper crinkling)

842
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:00,989
- [Missy] What is it?

843
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:04,195
- [Bryan] Whoa, another
one, but the speeder bike!

844
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:05,396
- [Missy] Wow.

845
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:07,486
- We're gonna have wars now.

846
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,265
- (laughs) It's gonna be
Star Wars in our house.

847
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:11,831
Alright, Ollie, this is
Santa's present to you, okay?

848
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:12,797
- Okay.

849
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:14,112
- [Bryan] You remember what you asked for?

850
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:14,945
- Yeah.

851
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:18,187

852
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:20,446
(Ollie gasps)

853
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:21,447
- [Bryan] What is it?

854
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:22,801
- This!

855
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,733
- [Bryan] The T-Rex Battle Zorg!

856
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,313
That's what you asked for, huh?

857
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:28,435
- Yeah!

858
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:30,896
- [Missy] Santa, thank you!

859
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:31,997
- That's so cool.

860
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:34,185
What do you say to Santa, Ollie?

861
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:36,102
- Thank you, Santa!

862
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:39,498
- [Bryan] Alright, Finny,
here's yours from Santa.

863
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,427
- [Ollie] I think that he got (mumbles)

864
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:42,745
- He looks at you guys like, ooh!

865
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:44,238
What is it?

866
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:47,642
- [Ollie] Open it, Finn, open it!

867
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,142
(Finn shouts)

868
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:52,492
- [Bryan] What?

869
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:56,387
Mr. Freeze Snow Cat?

870
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:58,907
What do you say to Santa?

871
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:00,718
- Thank you, Papa.

872
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:02,260
(laughter)

873
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,977
- Yeah, what?

874
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:06,755
- [Bryan] This one is to
Missy and Brian from Santa.

875
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:08,188
- Ooh.

876
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:12,400
- [Bryan] Ooh, Santa knows
how to wrap presents, guys.

877
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,233
(paper crinkling)

878
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,041
What's it say?

879
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,512
- More overnight trips.

880
00:29:25,512 --> 00:29:26,345
- [Bryan] S.

881
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:27,236
- S.

882
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:29,486
- [Bryan] Ooh, weekend bag!

883
00:29:33,214 --> 00:29:34,345
- Those are cute!

884
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:35,553
- [Bryan] Oh look, I got one too!

885
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:36,386
- Wow.

886
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,440
- [Bryan] Santa wants
us to get away, babe.

887
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,536
- Yeah, oh yours has
like a little lightning.

888
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:44,850
- [Bryan] Mine's got a lightning bolt.

889
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,811
- This is so cool.

890
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:48,952
- [Bryan] Oh, yours has got
a cool heart, that's cool.

891
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:49,922
- This is fun.

892
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,095
- [Bryan] Santa knows what's up.

893
00:29:51,095 --> 00:29:51,928
- This is perfect.

894
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:54,238
- [Bryan] Alright, Ollie
and Finn got another here.

895
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:56,079
You think it's more cool slippers?

896
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,912
- I don't know.

897
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:58,895
- [Bryan] What is it?

898
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:01,357
(gasps) What?

899
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:02,548
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

900
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:03,740
- [Bryan] Ollie, do you know what this is?

901
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,573
- What?

902
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:06,141
- [Bryan] It's a zip
line for the backyard!

903
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:07,136
- Really?

904
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:08,631
- [Missy] Yeah, Papa's gonna have to

905
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:10,047
hook that up for us, huh?

906
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:11,846
- [Bryan] That looks like so much fun.

907
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,430
Alright, Finny, time for you

908
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,097
to open your present from Santa!

909
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,462
(paper crinkling)

910
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:21,212
What is it, what do you see?

911
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:22,795
- [Missy] His face!

912
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,948
What is that?

913
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:27,802
(Finn shouts)

914
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:29,026
- [Missy] Is that-

915
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:29,859
- [Bryan] Whoa!

916
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:31,141
- [Missy] Papa's workbench?

917
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:31,974
- Yeah.

918
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:34,643
- [Bryan] Whoa, it's your
own workbench set, Finn!

919
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:35,656
- Yeah.

920
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:37,797
- [Bryan] That's so cool,
say thank you, Santa!

921
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:39,488
- Thank you, Papa!

922
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:41,555
(laughter)

923
00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:43,140
- You're welcome.

924
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,706
- [Bryan] He worked
something in, at this point.

925
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:48,513
Alright, Jimmy's opening
his present from Santa.

926
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,850
(paper crinkling)

927
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,827
- [Jimmy] What is it?

928
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:56,615
- [Bryan] Whoa, it's a Star
Wars Tie-Fighter drone.

929
00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:57,731
- That's cool.

930
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,622
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

931
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:00,524
We're gonna have to fly 'em all
around the house and battle.

932
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:01,357
- You can battle 'em.

933
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:02,190
- [Bryan] Oh, you can?

934
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,358
- Yeah, you can like shoot other-

935
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:04,372
- [Bryan] Oh, that's cool!

936
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:05,705
That is so neat.

937
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:10,349
Alright, we are opening the
Propel Star Wars drones.

938
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:12,297
This is the speeder bike.

939
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:14,425
They make you cut this on the side,

940
00:31:14,425 --> 00:31:16,446
so that you can actually get into it.

941
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:18,976
♪ Star Wars theme ♪

942
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:22,453
Oh my gosh, it's lighting
up and playing music.

943
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:23,918
That is so cool.

944
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,057
Open it.

945
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:26,333
♪ Star Wars theme ♪

946
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,166
Oh that's so cool!

947
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,325
And then close it.

948
00:31:28,325 --> 00:31:29,969
- Now it does the scene one, I think.

949
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:32,460
(drone sound effects)

950
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,577
- [Toy] Hey wait!

951
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:36,248
- [Bryan] (laughs) That
is so neat, though.

952
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:38,512
Alright, I am about to
open my rebel fighter.

953
00:31:38,512 --> 00:31:40,610
Let's see what happens.

954
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,995
♪ Star Wars theme ♪

955
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:44,337
Yes!

956
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:45,670
This is awesome!

957
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,935
This is so cool, babe, look at that.

958
00:31:48,935 --> 00:31:50,715
- [Missy] That is so neat, so fun.

959
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:52,368
- I love it, I love Star Wars.

960
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,722
This is so neat.

961
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:56,305
(upbeat music)

962
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,612
What are we playing, boys?

963
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:25,102
- Crazy Toaster game!

964
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:27,668
- [Bryan] How's it work?

965
00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:29,718
- [Missy] Basically,
we're waiting for it to-

966
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:30,551
(toaster pops)

967
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:31,972
- [Bryan] Oh, oh, you gotta catch it!

968
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:33,280
- You catch it in there.

969
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,241
- [Bryan] Are you catching any, Ollie?

970
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:35,840
- Yeah, trying to.

971
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,199
- [Bryan] Oh cool, keep trying.

972
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,437
I wanna see you do it, buddy.

973
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:40,489
- Let's go, let's go,
let's go, no, no, no!

974
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:41,425
(toaster pops)

975
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:42,258
Oh!

976
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:43,644
- [Bryan] Nice, did you get one, Uncle?

977
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:44,477
- No.

978
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:46,139
- [Bryan] No? Oh.

979
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:48,129
Finn's rewarding everyone.

980
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:48,962
You get this one.

981
00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:50,168
- Here we go, here we go.

982
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,251
- [Bryan] Oh!

983
00:32:53,297 --> 00:32:54,214
- So close.

984
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,546
- Sounds like this game is
really hard to play with Finn.

985
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:03,378
Lookit, there's some nasty
pieces of toast in here.

986
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:04,753
(toaster pops)

987
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:06,220
(shouting)

988
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,984
Okay, we figured it out,
we're doing it wrong.

989
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:10,156
You gotta put ten in each slot.

990
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,481
- Yeah, okay, so let's count ten, okay?

991
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:15,148
(playful music)

992
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:18,280
Here we go, we gotta catch 'em.

993
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,200
- Ready Finn?

994
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,091
Hold your pan.

995
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:21,118
Get it, Finn.

996
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:22,855
- Oh, alright, no Momma's gonna do it.

997
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:23,701
- You got one!

998
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:24,534
- I got one.

999
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:25,801
- And then we leave the rest
on the ground, that's right.

1000
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,019
Okay, leave 'em on the ground, ready?

1001
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:29,057
Okay, so then it goes on your plate.

1002
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,671
And then, if it doesn't
match any on your plate,

1003
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:32,181
you get to keep one on the side.

1004
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:33,283
- [Bryan] Oh, I see, that's cool.

1005
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:34,839
- Yeah, okay, ready?

1006
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,684
- [Jimmy] Get your pan.

1007
00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:37,860
- [Bryan] Get ready to catch one!

1008
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,693
(toaster pops)

1009
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:40,547
- Oh, missed!

1010
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:42,430
Alright, Ollie, your turn to push it down.

1011
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,305
- [Bryan] Push it down, buddy.

1012
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:44,286
(toaster clicks)

1013
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:45,433
- Catch it, catch it.

1014
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:46,266
(toaster pops)

1015
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:47,425
Oh, missed.

1016
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,373
Alright, Finn, you wanna push it down?

1017
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:50,337
- [Jimmy] You were so close.

1018
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:51,380
- [Missy] I didn't catch any either!

1019
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,047
(playful music)

1020
00:33:58,382 --> 00:34:00,152
- It's not necessarily dinner time,

1021
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:02,960
but we have lots of yummy food comin' out.

1022
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,229
So I just suvee-ed this filet mignon,

1023
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:08,385
we are snacking on some chips,

1024
00:34:08,385 --> 00:34:11,764
and we have baked potatoes in the oven.

1025
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:13,425
We've got rolls up here startin',

1026
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,489
and it's that time of the Christmas Day

1027
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,330
where you just need some warmth

1028
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:21,123
in your belly with some yummy food.

1029
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:23,206
So that's what we are
doing, making comfort food.

1030
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:26,594
Gravy, dips, chips, yummy good stuff.

1031
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:28,490
- Press it, and say,
"Yeah, I can hear you."

1032
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:29,592
- Yeah I can hear you.

1033
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:31,720
- And then you have to
let go so Mommy can talk.

1034
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:33,011
- Hey, I just wanted-

1035
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:34,021
(feedback ringing)

1036
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:36,216
Hey, I just wanted to
tell you that I love you.

1037
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:37,831
- Hey, I love you, hey.

1038
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:39,746
(Bryan laughs)

1039
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,347
- Ollie's still trying to understand

1040
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:44,456
the concept of a walkie talkie.

1041
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,072
Alright, you guys, don't judge me, okay?

1042
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:49,831
I'm wearing sunglasses
inside, at night, yes.

1043
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:53,375
So this is a Christmas present from Missy.

1044
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:58,222
They're called Zungal Panther,
and they're sunglasses,

1045
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:01,046
but they're also, like,
built-in headphones.

1046
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:03,218
But it's basically, like, sending

1047
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:06,582
the music vibrations into my skull.

1048
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:08,196
What?

1049
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:09,299
Yeah, it's really weird.

1050
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:11,155
So I can hear everything that's going on

1051
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:13,554
and I can talk normally,
but I can also hear music,

1052
00:35:13,554 --> 00:35:15,381
which I think is really cool too.

1053
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:17,125
I think this is gonna be
really fun during the summer,

1054
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,670
like around the pool and stuff.

1055
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,104
This is what they look like,
and basically, that sits

1056
00:35:21,104 --> 00:35:23,892
right above my ear and
just vibrates into it.

1057
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:25,309
It's pretty cool.

1058
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:29,026
Testin' 'em out with some
American Teen by Khalid.

1059
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,814
And they sound pretty cool.

1060
00:35:30,814 --> 00:35:34,147
Alright, we are doing a Inkbox on Missy,

1061
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:38,744
and we're about to show
you guys and reveal

1062
00:35:38,744 --> 00:35:40,660
the whole thing to you right now.

1063
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,493
You ready to see it, babe?

1064
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:42,326
- [Missy] Yep.

1065
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:43,159
- [Bryan] This is really cool, watch this.

1066
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,429
Alright, let's take it off.

1067
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:46,262
- [Missy] Oh wow, ow!

1068
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:47,582
- [Bryan] You did it!

1069
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:50,396
- [Missy] (shouts) Oh, that's pretty cute!

1070
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:52,297
- [Bryan] So what did you get, babe?

1071
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:54,902
- I got little eyes that are closed.

1072
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,506
- [Bryan] Yeah, so they're
like cute little eyelashes-

1073
00:35:57,506 --> 00:35:58,953
- [Missy] Aren't those cute?

1074
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:01,558
- [Bryan] On her wrist,
yeah, that's so cool, babe.

1075
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:02,494
- Do you like it, Ollie?

1076
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,484
(boys murmur)

1077
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:05,975
- So apparently when I
was vlogging yesterday

1078
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:09,972
and showing you guys my
rebel scum Star Wars tattoo,

1079
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:11,829
I think I actually cut the part out

1080
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,548
of me telling you guys that it was fake,

1081
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:16,447
and it's actually just a
special type of Henna tattoo.

1082
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,317
It lasts about two weeks.

1083
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:20,763
And so what we did, is you apply it,

1084
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:22,982
and it's actually really, really light.

1085
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:24,808
And yours is actually a lot
darker than I was thinking.

1086
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,848
- [Missy] Yeah, and then it darkens up.

1087
00:36:26,848 --> 00:36:28,545
- [Bryan] Yes, when you
wake up in the morning,

1088
00:36:28,545 --> 00:36:31,011
it will be much darker, and
it will last about two weeks.

1089
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:32,280
So it's kinda cool to, like, play around

1090
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,045
with different tattoos and stuff.

1091
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:34,878
- Yeah, just to test it.

1092
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:37,020
I feel like I've always been
really tired of the tattoo

1093
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,008
after two weeks, so yeah,
I think it's really fun

1094
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:41,641
to test it out and see what I think.

1095
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:43,813
- [Bryan] I have a cool astronaut
that can go on your arm.

1096
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:45,153
- Oh, an astronaut?

1097
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:46,119
- [Bryan] Yeah, does that sound cool?

1098
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:46,952
- [Missy] It wouldn't even fit on her arm.

1099
00:36:46,952 --> 00:36:47,954
(laughter)

1100
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:52,121
Alright, we have had the
funnest day ever, huh Finn?

1101
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:55,258
Did you get everything you wanted?

1102
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,379
(Finn fusses)

1103
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:57,974
He did not get a nap
today so he is just like,

1104
00:36:57,974 --> 00:36:59,352
I need to go to bed!

1105
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:01,033
He cannot even hold his head up.

1106
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:02,869
He's just so tired, huh?

1107
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:04,120
Did you have fun, though?

1108
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,400
(Finn fusses)

1109
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,082
Yeah, oh yeah, he's got his walkie talkie,

1110
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:08,996
Mama's got her walkie
talkie, and I'm gonna

1111
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:10,546
have it in my room, so they can

1112
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:13,056
talk to me if they need me, okay?

1113
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:15,055
Did you have a good Christmas?

1114
00:37:15,055 --> 00:37:16,921
Did you get everything you wanted?

1115
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:17,838
Everything?

1116
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:21,232
Aw, and more probably, huh?

1117
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:23,380
You got things that you are loving,

1118
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,012
you didn't even know you wanted, huh?

1119
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:25,856
- Yeah.

1120
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:27,466
- Should we ask them
what their favorite thing

1121
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:29,960
they got this year for Christmas is?

1122
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,259
Alright, you guys, let us know,

1123
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,259
down in the comments, what
is your favorite thing

1124
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:34,670
that you got this year for Christmas?

1125
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,050
I hope you guys had an
awesome Christmas this year.

1126
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,619
Remember, Christmas is not just
about the presents, though.

1127
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,579
We love just spending
time with our family,

1128
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:45,700
and celebrating Jesus's birthday, huh?

1129
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,157
Alright, Ollie, tell me,
though, what was your favorite

1130
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:53,422
toy or gift that you got
for Christmas, today?

1131
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:55,902
- Um, the Power Ranger...

1132
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:57,562
- [Missy] The Power Ranger dino thing?

1133
00:37:57,562 --> 00:37:59,843
You have been wanting that forever, huh?

1134
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:00,867
- Yeah.

1135
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:04,129
- Yup, and he got it from
Santa, and he is so excited,

1136
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:05,500
and that's the favorite thing you got?

1137
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,349
- Yeah.

1138
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:08,820
- [Missy] How awesome,
I'm so glad you go that.

1139
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,596
I'm glad you guys had a good Christmas.

1140
00:38:10,596 --> 00:38:12,290
I had a really, really
good Christmas, too.

1141
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,255
Make sure to give this
video a big thumbs up.

1142
00:38:14,255 --> 00:38:16,849

1146
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:26,252
and we're just so thankful, and so happy.

1147
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:28,262
It's just like, it's really, really cool.

1148
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,693
So thank you guys so much,

365 days till Christmas!

1151
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:35,368
Ready, say "bye"!

1152
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:36,425
- Bye.

1153
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:37,964
(Finn fusses)

1154
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:39,873
- [Missy] Boop.

1155
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:41,347
- [Ollie] Bye, boop.

1156
00:38:41,347 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
