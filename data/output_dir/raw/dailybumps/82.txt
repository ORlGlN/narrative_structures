1
00:00:00,576 --> 00:00:01,745
- Hey Ollie, who told you

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:04,609
you could jump on mommy and daddy's bed?

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:05,895
You silly kiddo.

4
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:07,381
(chuckles)

5
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:08,431

17
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:31,324
- Good morning!

18
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:33,796
We are just waking up right now.

19
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,483
Finn fell asleep in his
clothes last night, didn't you?

20
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:37,316
- Yeah.

21
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,332
- Come on guys?

22
00:00:38,332 --> 00:00:39,531
- [Missy] What are we doing right now?

23
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:40,813
- We're gonna find Fred!

24
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:42,081
- We gotta find Fred.

25
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:43,804
Every morning, we gotta Fred.

26
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,604
The kids drag me out of bed

27
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:47,784
to go find Fred bright and early.

28
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:49,536
So let's go do it.

29
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:51,861
Let's look for him.

30
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,130
Where is he, where is he, where is he?

31
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,199
(gasps)

32
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,032
Where is he?

33
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,390
- Skittles!

34
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,307
- [Missy] Oh, Fred what
did you get into today?

35
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:02,474
Or last night?

36
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:07,194
Was he getting into a bag of Skittles?

37
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:08,935
Maybe he was watching a movie.

38
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:13,531
Finn, you have placed
yourself in a very scary place

39
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,079
because you're right on the coffee table.

40
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,962
Right in Finn's reach, aren't ya.

41
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:21,238
So yeah, I'm pretty sure
he was eating Skittles

42
00:01:21,238 --> 00:01:23,374
and he got them all over our table.

43
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,853
Being a little mischievous a little early,

44
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,838
don't you think Fred?

45
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,107
He's already making messes.

46
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:33,082
Well, I think that you guys
can eat some of the Skittles.

47
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:36,445
Maybe one Skittle cause we
haven't had breakfast yet.

48
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:37,445
One Skittle.

49
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,429
(gasps)

50
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:42,090
How many was that?

51
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,923
Alright, Fred.

52
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:44,505
I'm gonna have to keep
a very close eye on you

53
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,455
so you don't get hurt by this little one.

54
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:48,828
You're not gonna touch him right?

55
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:50,253
No way Jose.

56
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:51,702
Do not touch him, kay?

57
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:52,535
- Kay.

58
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,191
- You'll get in big
trouble if you touch him

59
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,438
and Fred gets owies.

60
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,335
Alright, be careful there Fred.

61
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:00,026
Thanks for all the candy.

62
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:02,511
Today has been a crazy morning.

63
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:04,135
We've been trying to
get ready for the day.

64
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:04,968
Look at this.

65
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:06,764
I got this side kinda done

66
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:08,233
and this side not at all done.

67
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,362
It's actually still wet.

68
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,543
It's just been crazy!

69
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:12,526
But this morning we were eating breakfast

70
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,679
and literally magic happened.

71
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:17,840
Fred was just sitting here
with his Skittles everywhere

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,771
and in a bag and he just disappeared.

73
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:20,793
And Ollie was so sad.

74
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:23,378
And then we found him up here.

75
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,931
I think he needed another
safe area to hang out

76
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,264
cause he knew that Finn was
probably gonna touch him

77
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:30,097
and hurt him

78
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:31,110
and that would not be good,

79
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,096
but now the boys are all hanging out.

80
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:35,151
What do you see Finn?

81
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,524
- [Bryan] He literally
just pulled me over here

82
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,738
cause there's a lizard.

83
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:38,962
The dogs are going crazy right now.

84
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:40,370
- A lizard!

85
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,751
- [Missy] A lizard!

86
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,631
There he is.

87
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,265
He's actually a pretty big guy

88
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,707
and the dogs are freaking out.

89
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:49,407
Where are they?

90
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:50,741
Come and get it.

91
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,275
Come and get it.

92
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:53,812
Come and get it.

93
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:54,734
- [Bryan] Go Finn, go!

94
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,465
You dropped your St. Bernard!

95
00:02:56,465 --> 00:02:57,298
Finn!

96
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:58,776
You dropped your St. Bernard!

97
00:02:58,776 --> 00:02:59,951
Look at him go.

98
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,919
He is so obsessed with his bike.

99
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,467
Go, go, go, go, go!

100
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,184
Even in the office.

101
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,170
Go, go, go, go, go!

102
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,752
Come this way!

103
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,171
Come get your doggy!

104
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:10,158
- No!

105
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,501
(chuckles)

106
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:15,472
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

107
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:16,665
Alright, Ollie.

108
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:18,132
I think it's time to give a dog a bone.

109
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,057
What do you think?

110
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:23,065
Karma has been wanting to play
with this pink bone all day.

111
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:23,946
Let's go outside, go.

112
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:24,779
Go, go, go, go.

113
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:25,822
What up guys?

114
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,185
It is a beautiful day.

115
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:29,160
It's actually starting to get cold now.

116
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,552
It's starting to feel a
little more Christmasy.

117
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:33,473
Yeah, how's it feel out here, dude?

118
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:34,306
- Good.

119
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,139
- [Bryan] Good, huh.

120
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,797
Karma, you know that's
actually Luna's bone.

121
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:40,646
Did you ask her permission
if you could play with it?

122
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:42,261
That's the bone we got
her on her birthday.

123
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,558
- I like your Christmas tree, dadda.

124
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,391
- [Bryan] Well, thank you.

125
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,586
I like this Christmas tree, too.

126
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,338
Do you know what kind of tree this is?

127
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:49,171
- What?

128
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,317
- [Bryan] It's a Juniper tree.

129
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,424
- Juniper tree?

130
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,085
- [Bryan] Yeah, just like Kelsey
and Corban's Juniper, huh.

131
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:54,918
- Yeah.

132
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,045
- Yeah.

133
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:59,520
Alright, Ollie tell me
what did Fred do today?

134
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,761
- He dumped all the Skittles out.

135
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:04,594
- He did?

136
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:05,427
- Yeah.

137
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:06,786
- [Bryan] That's crazy.

138
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:08,226
He's a silly elf, huh.

139
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,059
- Yeah.

140
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,745
- So Fred was playing
in the Skittles, huh?

141
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:11,578
- Yeah.

142
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:12,917
- What's he doing now?

143
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:13,750
- He.

144
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:16,978
Let's go out here.

145
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:17,894
- [Bryan] Oh, you wanna show me?

146
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:18,726
- Yeah.

147
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:19,559
- [Bryan] Okay.

148
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,393
(Christmas music)

149
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:24,784
What happened?

150
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:25,758
- He disappeared!

151
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:27,482
- [Bryan] He did?

152
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,315
What?

153
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:29,667
He was sitting up here, wasn't he?

154
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,500
- Yeah.

155
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,532
- [Bryan] That's what I thought.

156
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:33,412
Do you think he went back
to the North Pole already?

157
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:34,245
- Yeah.

158
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,393
- Yeah, so Fred has to
go back to the North Pole

159
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:40,787
every day to tell Santa what
you and Finn were up to, huh.

160
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:41,620
- Yeah.

161
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,620
- [Bryan] Yeah, I don't see him anywhere.

162
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,883
♪ Bells, Jingle all the way ♪

163
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:48,654
- Let's play tag!

164
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,293
♪ Jingle bells ♪

165
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:51,399
(laughs)

166
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,081
We should decorate for Christmas more.

167
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:54,914
- [Bryan] We should?

168
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:55,747
- Yeah!

169
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,403
Well, I actually have something
we haven't put out yet.

170
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:58,236
- [Oliver] Really?

171
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:00,390
- Yeah, you wanna plug it
in and see what happens?

172
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,223
- Yeah.

173
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:02,056
- [Bryan] Alright let's go.

174
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,051
Alright boys, come on!

175
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,089
We got something that we can set up

176
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,151
and I think that it would look great

177
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,510
right on this grassy little patch.

178
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,709
What do you think?

179
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:11,542
- Good.

180
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:12,375
- That's a good idea?

181
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,241
- [Oliver] Yeah.

182
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,192
- Alright, Ollie, you hold the camera

183
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,420
and just point it at me.

184
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,253
- [Oliver] Okay.

185
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:20,266
- We are now going to plug
in our Christmas decoration.

186
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,099
- [Oliver] Yeah!

187
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:21,950
- Yay, you excited?

188
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,783
- [Oliver] Yes.

189
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,984
- Okay and plugged in!

190
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:26,151
- [Oliver] Go!

191
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,385
- Nothing's happening!

192
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:29,218
Hang on.

193
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,051
Wait, wait, keep filming!

194
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:30,884
Oh wait!

195
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:31,717
There it goes look!

196
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:32,550
Look!

197
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,607
- [Missy] Go, go, go closer!

198
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:35,786
- [Bryan] Good job Ollie.

199
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:36,941
What's it gonna be?

200
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:37,774
What's it gonna be?

201
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:39,210
We don't know!

202
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,088
We won't know what it is
till it gets blown up.

203
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:44,270
We got Superman here helping us.

204
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,672
Superman's actually a pro.

205
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:48,143
- Oh my goodness!

206
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:48,976
- [Bryan] What is it boys?

207
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:51,574
What do you think it is?

208
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,070
- Marshall!

209
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,039
- [Bryan] It's Marshall!

210
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,314
Aw look at him.

211
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:58,614
- He's so cute!

212
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:00,388
- [Bryan] What's he holding in his mouth?

213
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:01,221
- This.

214
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,054
- [Missy] A stocking!

215
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:03,610
- [Bryan] It's a stocking.

216
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,443
That's so cool.

217
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:05,358
Well, hello Marshall.

218
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:06,849
How's it going?

219
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,465
You know what Marshall can do Ollie?

220
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:09,298
- What?

221
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:10,131
- [Bryan] He puts out fires right?

222
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,873
What does he use to put out fire?

223
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,706
- Water.

224
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,860
- [Bryan] Water, yeah.

225
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,974
So he'll protect us from fire!

226
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:19,557
Won't that be cool?

227
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,262
Whoa he has a backpack?

228
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,927
Is that where he stores all the water?

229
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:24,760
- Yeah.

230
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,593
- [Bryan] That's cool.

231
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,426
- He puts it in here.

232
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:27,848
- [Bryan] And then what does he do?

233
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:30,017
- He puts out the fire.

234
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:31,196
- Oh that's cool.

235
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,471
What do you think of that Finn?

236
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:34,356
He's like, "I just wanna pull his tail."

237
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:35,189
(chuckles)

238
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,022
This is so cute.

239
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:39,471
So we got a little PAW
Patrol Marshall blow up,

240
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,527
Christmas edition for the house.

241
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,360
- So cute.

242
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,808
I love it.

243
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:44,641
- [Bryan] Should we get more?

244
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,160
We should try to get them all, huh?

245
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,993
- Yeah.

246
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:48,996
- Should we get Chase out here?

247
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:49,829
- Yeah.

248
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,147
I love his nod when he like
actually agrees with something.

249
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:53,980
He's like.

250
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,100
Those are his eyes, huh.

251
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,071
(laughs)

252
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:00,904
(Christmas music)

253
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,161
(knocking)

254
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:14,161
(door squeaks open)

255
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,425
- [Bryan] Oh hi!

256
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,081
(laughs)

257
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:21,914
Got you.

258
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:24,653
Were you trying to scare me?

259
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,486
- Yeah.

260
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,640
- Not gonna happen, Mister.

261
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,352
The house has been
smelling so amazing all day

262
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:33,621
because we have had a pork
shoulder in the crock pot

263
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,819
with a little bit of Barbecue sauce.

264
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:36,751
Look at that you guys.

265
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:37,680
Pulled pork.

266
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,929
Pulled pork in the crock pot

267
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:40,945
is one of my most favorite things

268
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:43,743
because it's something
that's so easy to just, like,

269
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,599
grab and throw on a bun and eat.

270
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,767
I hate spending like
time on preparing food

271
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,281
or cooking food and stuff like that.

272
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:51,750
So, it's super easy.

273
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,241
Karma, you smell it too huh?

274
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,802
He's like, "Hey, ma give me some of that?

275
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:56,330
Ma gonna give me some
of that pulled pork?"

276
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,163
Pulled pork for dinner.

277
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,450
It's what's for dinner.

278
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,762
A fun idea.

279
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:00,673
Let me know on the comments below,

280
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:03,047
what are you guys eating
for dinner tonight

281
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,922
and I feel like that would give

282
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,192
a lot of people dinner suggestions

283
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,818
cause dinner is such a hard,

284
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:09,975
food is hard when you have a family.

285
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:11,384
Cooking for four people,

286
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,437
something that everyone likes

287
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,924
and loves and is healthy
and is convenient.

288
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:15,757
It's difficult.

289
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,792
I feel like if we had a
ton of dinner suggestions

290
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,675
down in the comments below

291
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:22,037
that it'd be super fun for us
and for a lot of you guys who

292
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:23,348
don't know what to eat for dinner.

293
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:24,376
Do you no know what to eat for dinner?

294
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:25,240
Cause you could just look down below.

295
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,916
Lotta people commented, hopefully.

296
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,666
(playful noises)

297
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,109
I tickled you.

298
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:38,726
The boys just got out of a bath

299
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,941
and we are getting them ready for bed.

300
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:41,774
What you got?

301
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:42,659
A little emoji?

302
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,070
Oh, were you chewing on that?

303
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:45,395
Luna is in desperate need,

304
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,755
oh hi Karma.

305
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:48,250
Apparently Karma needs some love.

306
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,848
Luna is in desperate need of some toys

307
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:52,290
so Christmas could not be
coming soon enough for her.

308
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,170
I think we're gonna spoil
these puppies on Christmas.

309
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,553
What do you guys want for Christmas?

310
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:58,475
Oh, we should totally
let them FaceTime Santa.

311
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:00,731
How cool would it be if
Karma FaceTimed Santa?

312
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,419
Oh my gosh Finn!

313
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,502
You're crazy.

314
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,562
Karma, you're such a good dog.

315
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,517
We got so lucky with these dogs.

316
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:10,321
Come on Finn, let's go!

317
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,041
Let's get your pajamas on!

318
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,874
- Day!

319
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:13,736
- Day!

320
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:14,730
That means okay.

321
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,675
You want this Luna?

322
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:17,583
You want this Luna, go get it.

323
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,902
This way Finn.

324
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:21,735
Matching pajamas tonight.

325
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:24,631
Yeah?

326
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,242
Ollie, who's on your pajamas?

327
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:27,075
- Yeti.

328
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:28,819
- [Bryan] Yeti.

329
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,467
Remember that book we
used to read them babe?

330
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:31,300
The yeti book?

331
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,133
- Yeah, I still got it.

332
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:33,539
It's in Finn's room.

333
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,372
Hi.

334
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:37,099
Are you a puppy dog?

335
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:38,899
- They are so cute in
their matching pajamas.

336
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:39,842
They're matching during the day

337
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:41,714
and they even match at night.

338
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,964
(laughing)

339
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,482
Hey Ollie, who told you

340
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:50,575
you could jump on mommy and daddy's bed?

341
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:51,725
You silly kiddo.

342
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:52,766
(chuckles)

343
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,433
He always says papa.

344
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:59,616
(cheerful soft music)

345
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:07,552
Finn, what are you doing?

346
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:08,385
Hey!

347
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,436
Hey Ollie, did you have a fun day?

348
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,786
Don't lick me!

349
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:13,945
Ew!

350
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,115
You silly.

351
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,662
Did you have a fun day today Ollie?

352
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:17,495
- Yeah.

353
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,770
- Yeah, Finn did you have a fun day?

354
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,738
He's literally tearing apart our bed.

355
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:24,053
You're not sleeping in
our bed tonight, dude.

356
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:24,886
- Yah.

357
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:27,920
- We had such a fun day with the boys.

358
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,844
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

359
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:32,218
If you did be sure to
give it a big thumbs up

360
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:33,390
and we'll see you manana.

361
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,893
Ollie, you wanna say good night?

362
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:35,726
- [Oliver] Yeah

363
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:36,559
- Kay, say bye.

364
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,214
- [Oliver] Bye.

365
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:40,281
Boop.

366
00:10:40,281 --> 00:00:00,000
(dance music)
