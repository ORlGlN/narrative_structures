1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,266
- We got a Jawa in our vicinity.

2
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:07,111
- Peekaboo.

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:11,278
- [Bryan] Bet you didn't
know Jawas played peekaboo.

4
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,824
♫ Wherever you are

5
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:23,136
♫ That's where I wanna be

6
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:25,963
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

7
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:30,625
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,690
♫ "This is home"

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,996
♫ Just running around

10
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:36,718
♫ You never looked so cute

11
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:37,698
♫ Hugging you tight

12
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:41,293
♫ Cuddlin' all I could saying

13
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:43,793
♫ "I am home"

14
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,586
♫ And forever you're with me

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,093
- Good morning.

16
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,065
- Good morning Kyle,

17
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:54,944
you hanging out with Ben?

18
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:57,936
He's being a very nice boy
this morning, isn't he?

19
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:00,762
We got breakfast at the
little snack station up here.

20
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:03,673
They have, like, cereal and sticky buns,

21
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:05,105
little egg frittatas.

22
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:06,204
What are we doing today buddy?

23
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:08,479
- We're going on more rides.

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,704
- We're going on more rides, aren't we?

25
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,543
Missy's rocking her bow ears this morning.

26
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:17,520
She also got very
creative in the snack bar,

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,735
and stuffed a croissant
with ham and swiss,

28
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,624
and then burnt it.

29
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:21,457
- It's a little burnt.

30
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,598
- And I got this idea from Luke,

31
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:26,687
it's a ham and swiss bagel sandwich.

32
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:27,520
Oh hey, it's Carl.

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,353
Good morning.

34
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:29,186
- What's up?

35
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,064
- You ready for another day?

36
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:30,930
- Dude, I'm so ready.

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,964
- Dude, we slept so good.

38
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:34,131
- I'm exhausted but ready.

39
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:37,114
- I think we slept, like, over nine hours.

40
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:40,180
It was absolutely
incredible and much needed

41
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,511
because yesterday was a lot.

42
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,987
You're all rested right?

43
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,553
Hey, who we gonna meet today Ollie?

44
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:50,008
- I want to meet Captain
Jake and the pirates.

45
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:51,611
- You want to meet Captain Jake?

46
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,606
Yeah, you can show him
your pirate sword, huh?

47
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:58,523
(orchestral music)

48
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:14,650
We are in Hollywood Studios today,

49
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,961
and I am so excited because

50
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:20,148
the first ride we are
headed to is Midway Mania,

51
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:23,430
Toy Story arcade shooter, so much fun,

52
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,534
and Dave, our guide,

53
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,218
is going to give me
all the tips and tricks

54
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:28,552
on how to score big, right?

55
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:30,035
You're going to share your tips, right?

56
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,702
- Oh, yeah. But not all of them.

57
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:35,564
- We can hear Beauty and
the Beast over there,

58
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:36,759
the live show.

59
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,505
We have Carthay Circle theater right here.

60
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:41,444
- You know, this is a lot
like California Adventure.

61
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,489
- Yeah, well California Adventure
has a Hollywood Studios,

62
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,168
so it's kind of similar.

63
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:47,011
- Bigger version of that part of it.

64
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,114
- Yeah. Totally.

65
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:51,729
Hollywood Studios is where
all the movie themed stuff is,

66
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,856
so they have lots of Star Wars stuff here,

67
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:55,663
there's an Indiana Jones show,

68
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:57,371
Beauty and the Beast,

69
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:58,259
stuff like that.

70
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,285
And lots of Palm Trees,

71
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:02,785
so we're basically back in California now.

72
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:07,376
- We've got a full sized replica

73
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,834
of the Chinese Theater.

74
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:10,667
- Oh, wow.

75
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:17,488
- I just got goosebumps.

76
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,839
We are now headed into
the Pixar Studios section

77
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,149
of Hollywood Studios.

78
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:23,585
And look at the little monkeys, dude.

79
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:24,697
The monkeys in a barrel.

80
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:25,966
- Dude, they are. Right there.

81
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:26,868
- Barrel of monkeys.

82
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:28,180
Look how cool this is.

83
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,985
Ollie, we're in Pixar Studios,

84
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:33,769
so there's going to be a
ton of Toy Story stuff.

85
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,528
Look at that right there!

86
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:36,901
It's Mr. Spell.

87
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:38,582
Do you remember that?

88
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:39,415
- Yeah.

89
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:40,500
- Isn't that cool?

90
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,041
And then look up there. Monkeys!

91
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,458
How neat is that?

92
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:55,955
- The rest of the day,

93
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:56,919
you're going to hear
me talk about the story

94
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,146
as we're going into rides

95
00:03:58,146 --> 00:03:59,409
because some of them are really cool.

96
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:00,529
So, the idea about this one is all about

97
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:02,985
how you've been shrunk
down to the size of a toy,

98
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,780
and Buzz and Woody have been inviting you

99
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,852
to play some old-school
carnival games with them, okay?

100
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:10,861
- We are the size of a toy Luke.

101
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:11,944
Look at that.

102
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,296
Just finished the Midway Mania ride.

103
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,060
Ollie did so good.

104
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,810
He got 23,000 points.

105
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,749
That was, I think, a record for you Ollie.

106
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:28,916
I got 159,000.

107
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,905
I'm really excited to
see what our guide got.

108
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,343
He was doing a bit of trash
talking before we got in here.

109
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,423
Was that fun Ollie?

110
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:38,694
- Yeah. Can you shoot this?

111
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:41,124
- He's still shooting you guys.

112
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:42,606
Alright, Dave. What was your score?

113
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:46,463
- Uh, 232. That wasn't
even my best, come on.

114
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,804
- Oh! I did a modest 159.

115
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:49,971
He did 23,000.

116
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:05,056
We got fans. Got to keep cool.

117
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:07,689
Hey Ollie, look what I got.

118
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:08,636
Does that feel good?

119
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:10,442
- Yeah. I want it.

120
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,323
- You want it? Here you go.

121
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,005
Spray a little bit on yourself.

122
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:16,778
Oh, don't spray Mr. Potato Head.

123
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:17,611
- Halt!

124
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,528
- Excuse me. Pardon me.

125
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,466
Who did we just find?

126
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:24,946
- Captain Jake.

127
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:26,113
- Oh, my gosh.

128
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,199
We're going to go see your show Jake.

129
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,032
- Bye.

130
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:39,537
- Ollie, that was Jake.

131
00:05:39,537 --> 00:05:41,174
That was so cute.

132
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,062
Alright, we are headed into the
Disney Junior Live on Stage.

133
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,125
- I want to tell my people.

134
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,515
- You want to tell your people?

135
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:48,457
He wants to tell his friends.

136
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:49,727
- We'll tell your friends.

137
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:50,560
- You want to tell them?

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,563
- Who did you just run into?

139
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:52,813
- Captain Jake.

140
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,394
Ah, snow in my eyes.

141
00:05:57,394 --> 00:05:58,990
- Ollie just made it snow.

142
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,657
- Yeah, and it's all in my eyes.

143
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,133
- Look at Finn's hat.

144
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,066
You look so cute!

145
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:21,220
Yeah, that will help with the sun Buddy.

146
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,532
Ollie keeps complaining about the sun,

147
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,261
that's why he's staying in the store.

148
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,498
- [Missy] You want a hat?

149
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:29,665
- So as you guys know, Ollie
loved meeting Ariel yesterday,

150
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:33,287
and one thing that they
don't have in California,

151
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:36,086
is the Ariel live performance.

152
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:39,669
So we're headed in to
go see the live show.

153
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:07,085
Alright, we are headed
into Star Wars Launch Bay.

154
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,668
We're going to go meet
someone really cool.

155
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:18,441
Who could be over here?

156
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:21,382
He's big, huh?

157
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:39,915
Ollie was a little
hesitant with Chewbacca,

158
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:41,441
he's met him before and he liked him.

159
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:43,898
- Yeah, it's just you never
know how he's gonna respond.

160
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:44,731
- Yeah.

161
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,522
- Finn, on the other hand,
was like, interested,

162
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:48,163
but then scared out of his mind.

163
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:48,996
- Yeah.

164
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:51,795
Hey Ollie, do you see BB-8?

165
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:53,678
Do you see him?

166
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:56,011
Here, whoa! Isn't that cool?

167
00:07:57,994 --> 00:08:01,110
Hey Ollie do you want to go
meet the bad guy from Star Wars?

168
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,943
Yeah?

169
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:05,574
- Welcome citizens, this way.

170
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,050
- Ollie's hiding already.

171
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,348
Hello Kylo.

172
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:14,232
He's so spooky looking.

173
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:15,499
Oh, my gosh. Look at Ollie.

174
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:18,082
Ollie pull out your blaster.

175
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:18,915
No?

176
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,915
He's like, I don't know.

177
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,361
- By the way, my name's Luke.

178
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,308
Just so you know.

179
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:27,141
- Uh-oh.

180
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:34,657
Go talk to him.

181
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:35,799
Go talk to him, Luke.

182
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,071
It's okay.

183
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:40,450
You have to do it. It's your destiny.

184
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,950
It's your destiny.

185
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:47,107
- His name's Finn.

186
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:48,545
- Say bye.

187
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:52,128
Oh, yeah, we got Finn
and a Luke, don't we?

188
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:55,171
We have a Finn and a Luke.

189
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:00,281
We got a Jawa in our vicinity.

190
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:03,614
- Look at this guy.

191
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:05,296
- Watch out, he'll try to sell our bag.

192
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,605
- No, I know what he wants.

193
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:07,918
Jawas like shiny things.

194
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:08,751
- Ooh!

195
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:14,555
- I know. No, you don't
want that today, alright.

196
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,805
- Oh, peekaboo.

197
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,474
- Bet you didn't know
Jawas played peekaboo.

198
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,851
We are now by the theater,

199
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:29,179
so Dave, tell me,
what's, is all this real?

200
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,636
- all of these are actually,
yes, legitimate and real.

201
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:33,971
- Were the stars right here
doing them, or they were bought?

202
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:37,542
- Yeah, no they were all
right here, done right here.

203
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,690
- That's so cool.

204
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,773
Danny DeVito?

205
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,443
- Yes.

206
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:42,533
- He has tiny hands.

207
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:43,432
George Lucas,

208
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,032
C3PO.

209
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:45,973
There's a lot of really cool ones.

210
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:46,832
Steve Martin.

211
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:48,058
Gina Davis.

212
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:48,964
This is crazy.

213
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:49,866
It literally feels

214
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:52,036
like we're in the middle
of Hollywood right now.

215
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,160
Oh, Ollie. Storm Troopers are coming.

216
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,493
Acting all cool.

217
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,447
- We are on our way.

218
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,117
Back to base.

219
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:03,313
That is affirmative.

220
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:04,884
- Happy birthday Mickey.

221
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,082
That's cute.

222
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:07,434
Babe I'm pretty sure
you and I have a picture

223
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:10,135
next to one of these at
the real one in Hollywood.

224
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:11,552
Isn't that funny?

225
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:00,813
So, from Hollywood Studios to Epcot.

226
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,863
We are now in Epcot,

227
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,899
and they have this really
cool thing going on

228
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,149
called the Flowering Garden Festival.

229
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,414
They have a lot of different
topiaries and flowers

230
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:11,133
decorated like Disney characters,

231
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,571
and I'm going to show you guys right now,

232
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,571
because these are pretty incredible.

233
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,996
So here at Epcot, you can
travel the whole world

234
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:34,320
just by walking around a manmade lagoon.

235
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,035
We went straight to Italy
because let's face it,

236
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:38,800
that's my favorite right?

237
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,824
- My favorite.

238
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:42,201
- Just give us a little taste of Italy,

239
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:44,253
before we actually travel there ourselves.

240
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:46,116
It's time for some food, you guys.

241
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:47,223
We're starving.

242
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,872
- We might be all a little hangry.

243
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:50,031
- Yeah. It's been awhile.

244
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:53,531
We are stopping at Italy to get some food.

245
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:28,980
- When they were building all
of these different countries,

246
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,496
they wanted to showcase
the cultures of the world,

247
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,347
one of the coolest things about this was

248
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,738
they decided that they wanted
to have an African nation,

249
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:38,927
they decided that Morocco
was going to be represented,

250
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:41,213
but when they talked to Morocco about it,

251
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:43,212
they said, well if you want
to create something with

252
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:45,262
authentic Moroccan feel,

253
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:46,818
and you want to create a marketplace,

254
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,219
in order to do that,

255
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:51,091
you need it to be built by Moroccans.

256
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,103
So this pavilion was actually built

257
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:55,021
by representatives of Morocco,

258
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:57,277
they brought them across,
had them build it,

259
00:13:57,277 --> 00:14:00,035
so that it was built
in an authentic manner.

260
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:01,555
As we walk in, you're also going to see

261
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,552
a big opening where it
looks like one big opening,

262
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,915
and then on either side,
it's got a smaller opening,

263
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,587
which is actually the
entranceway to a marketplace

264
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:14,754
with humans on the side.
It's called a babu jelou.

265
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:16,760
- Babu jelou.

266
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:34,000
We are now in France,

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,809
so guess who's here Babe.

268
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:36,726
It's Belle.

269
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:39,669
She's got quite a line.

270
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,513
Belle is very popular right now,

271
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,180
for obvious reasons.

272
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:48,251
- Who is that?

273
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:49,557
- That's Belle.

274
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:50,707
- That's Belle.

275
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:52,637
- Alright Dave.

276
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:55,214
We need an explanation on the golf ball.

277
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:57,503
- So Spaceship Earth is the largest

278
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,505
geodesic sphere in the world.

279
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:02,326
But, really, there aren't
that many geodesic spheres,

280
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,452
so it's not a huge
competition to be winning.

281
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:08,619
There are 11,324 triangles on
the outside of Spaceship Earth

282
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:11,074
- And inside is what?

283
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,846
- An attraction where you get to explore

284
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,239
the history of the world,

285
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:17,319
and you get to listen to
the soft, dulcet tones

286
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:19,079
of Dame Judi Dench.

287
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:19,912
- There you go.

288
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:21,208
So we've just been walking around Epcot,

289
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,872
exploring all of the
different places of the world.

290
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,075
We did ride an amazing ride called

291
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,329
Frozen Ever After in Norway.

292
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,419
If you guys want to go check that out,

293
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,866
head on over to Carl and Ginger's channel,

294
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,699
because he filmed a bunch,

295
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:35,551
but that was incredible dude.

296
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:37,065
Olaf.

297
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:40,029
- Carl bought all the
goodies at the Frozen store.

298
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:43,379
- I filmed Bryan filming the
flowers that you saw already.

299
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,117
- Yes, so be sure to
go check out that vlog,

300
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:47,491
link down below in the description,

301
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:49,293
so you can see a different perspective

302
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,480
of this whole trip.

303
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,276
- Thanks man. Appreciate it.

304
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:56,671
- We are now going on the
seas with Nemo and friends,

305
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,960
with all of our friends.

306
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,793
Hey, Ollie,

307
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,297
how many skittles do you
have in your mouth right now?

308
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,964
Show me. Let me see.

309
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:04,985
Yeah, he's enjoying himself.

310
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:06,498
Come on dude, let's go see Nemo.

311
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,766
♫ We're getting in a giant clamshell

312
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:12,466
This is a nice ride to be
riding after a long, hot day

313
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:13,466
I feel like.

314
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:36,653
Just got out of the Finding Nemo ride.

315
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:39,867
Check this out, Bruce's Sub House, whoa!

316
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:44,034
Finn, you're going to fit
right in, with your fins.

317
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:47,922
Look at all these cool sharks.

318
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,930
Yeah, the Finding Nemo ride was very cool,

319
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,787
and we all just climbed
into that giant shark

320
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:53,758
and got a picture, which I'll put here.

321
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:56,682
(camera shutters)

322
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,915
what can you see in there?

323
00:16:57,915 --> 00:16:59,769
See what he's doing with his legs?

324
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,089
Hey, Ollie, are you
doing the pee-pee dance?

325
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,526
You're kind of doing the
pee-pee dance, aren't you?

326
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,358
- I see sharks.

327
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,778
- You see sharks? I want to see.

328
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,505
You can kind of see sharks, huh?

329
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:11,505
That's cool.

330
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:32,118
Fireworks going crazy!

331
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:06,068
And that was the end of our
Disney World experience,

332
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:06,901
well not quite.

333
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:09,432
We might head back
tomorrow for a little bit,

334
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:12,125
but just want to say a
huge thank you to the

335
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,453
Walt Disney World VIP tour and Dave

336
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:15,933
for being such an amazing tour.

337
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,037
That was incredible right?

338
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:18,395
- So amazing.

339
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,948
- That's how you do Disney guys.

340
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:22,285
So cool that we are able to offer this,

341
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,417
not just to our kids, but to our friends.

342
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,471
It's been a pretty amazing couple of days.

343
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,068
We're headed back to the hotel now,

344
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:28,901
we're going to go to bed,

345
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:29,748
but thank you guys for watching,

346
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:31,056
be sure to subscribe and
check out more videos,

347
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:32,079
we'll see you mañana.

348
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,061
Okay, Finn.

349
00:18:33,061 --> 00:00:00,000
Say bye.
