1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:02,880
- We have something to tell you.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,922
Ollie.
- We have an a-ouncement.

3
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,500
- We do have an announcement!

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,359
- An ouncement!

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,612
- It's also so adorable, the
way he says announcement.

6
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:09,790
Say it again, Ollie.

7
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,980
- A-ouncement!

8
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,477
- We've never done this before.

9
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:13,310
- Nope.

10
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,565
- It's been something that people

11
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:16,998
have requested for so long now.

12
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:17,836
- Yeah.

13
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:19,385
- We are doing--

14
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,239
♫ This is our life

15
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,383
♫ This is our fun

16
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:23,827
♫ This is who we are

17
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:25,104
♫ This is our dream

18
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:26,201
♫ This is our team

19
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:28,592
♫ Shot among the stars

20
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:30,897
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

21
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,379
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

22
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:35,522
♫ This is our life

23
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:37,503
♫ Let's live it

24
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:39,202
♫ Live it forever

25
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:40,338
- Good morning.

26
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:42,359
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,192
(Missy laughs)

28
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:44,765
- We are up this morning and out

29
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:46,077
Where are we going boys?

30
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:48,152
- Class!
- To music class!

31
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:49,797
- Music class!

32
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:51,674
We've actually missed
the last couple weeks,

33
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:53,908
Ollie's only been one
time, and he loved it.

34
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:55,458
So I thought, "I'm just
gonna bring him again,"

35
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,881
and I think he'll like it again.

36
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,950
- I think it helps Finn get
- I will!

37
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,783
(Missy laughs)

38
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:01,483
I think it helps Finn get
a little more into it.

39
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:04,682
But yeah, we're really
excited for music class,

40
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:07,137
and I think we're gonna
have a super fun day!

41
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:08,163
Okay boys?

42
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:09,035
- Kay!

43
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,253
- [Missy] Okay, let's go!

44
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:12,825
- Are you guys ready for music class?

45
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:14,266
- Yay!

46
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,994
- Are you excited?

47
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,577
He's always so shy.

48
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,635
You go play the drums?

49
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:20,468
- Yeah.

50
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:22,385
They got a little drum.

51
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:25,060
Oh my goodness!

52
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,678
That was like big boy moves, huh?

53
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:31,178
(slow instrumental music)

54
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:37,797
- Good class.

55
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,616
Turn it upside down, upside down.

56
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:44,719
- [Missy] Are you at Mimi's house

57
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,888
and you already got jelly beans?

58
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:49,758
You have the best Mimi ever, huh?

59
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:51,032
Yep we're done with music class,

60
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:52,513
and we're now at Mimi's.

61
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,900
And the boys are hanging
out, having a blast.

62
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,595
We're checking out the new upstairs.

63
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:00,195
- So we're getting rid
of the kitty-cat tree

64
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:01,557
'cause they just kinda ...

65
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:02,390
- [Missy] Yeah.

66
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,223
- Starting to fall apart.
- [Missy] Yeah.

67
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,285
- And we decided that we're gonna make

68
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:06,535
a cat shelving.

69
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:09,041
So it's gonna be
- [Missy] That's so cute!

70
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,190
- like a stair stepping.

71
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,876
So she'll go from here to here,

72
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:13,905
and then one here,

73
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:14,917
and then we have

74
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,022
corner pieces
- [Missy] Oh like a corner?

75
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:17,182
- Gonna go up at the very top,
- [Missy] That's so cute!

76
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:19,279
- Cause she likes to be super high.

77
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:21,050
So yeah, we're working
on the little shelves.

78
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,389
- Zuri is basically a
spoiled little brat here.

79
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:24,566
(Missy laughs)

80
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:25,892
She gets to do anything she wants,

81
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,714
and now she gets to
climb up to the ceilings.

82
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,547
- Yeah.

83
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:30,478
- [Missy] That kitty
cat is so spoiled, huh?

84
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:31,382
- Yeah.

85
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:33,763
- He's like, "I'm eating jelly beans."

86
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:34,877
Anyways, I'm actually headed off

87
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:36,804
to go get my hair done.

88
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:38,445
Boys are gonna hang out with Mimi.

89
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:39,278
(Missy laughs)

90
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:40,341
- [Mimi] Okay, bye Mommy!

91
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,589
- [Missy] Say bye-bye!

92
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:43,336
(Finn mumbles)

93
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:44,944
- [Missy] Momma!

94
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:46,330
All done!

95
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,663
We just got our hair done!

96
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:48,739
June, your hair look is,

97
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,189
is looking so good

98
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:51,022
- So fun!

99
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:51,861
- You got a fresh cut,

100
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,900
fresh color.

101
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,733
Just kidding.

102
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:54,566
(laughs)

103
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,998
But yeah, we just got done,

104
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:57,125
and I really like,

105
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,485
I would like it a little bit darker.

106
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,635
- I think it looks really good.

107
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:00,468
- Yeah.

108
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:01,301
- I love when you go dark.

109
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,366
And then the ends are so pretty.

110
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,315
- It's like fall,

111
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:04,341
so it's time to go dark.
- Totally.

112
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:06,116
- And she always just does the tone.

113
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:08,341
- Yeah, I'm trying to
not dye my hair anymore,

114
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:09,174
(Missy laughs)

115
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:11,459
okay, I decided I'm way too
low maintenance for that

116
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,292
(Missy laughs)

117
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,125
I can't handle it.

118
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:13,958
- Yeah.

119
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,196
So anyways, now we gotta go
meet up with all our boys.

120
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,029
Here we go.

121
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:18,409
Alright, I just got back to my parents'

122
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:21,792
and apparently Finn has been
doing errands with my dad,

123
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,929
but he has slept the entire time,

124
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,269
and my dad has carried him,

125
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:28,031
you carried him all
around the hardware store?

126
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,281
- Ace Hardware.

127
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,126
- In the car, taking him in and out,

128
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,340
and he is zonked.

129
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,173
- Brought him in here.

130
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,114
- He's so tired!

131
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,221
He's been so bad at taking naps,

132
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,946
so I'm guessing he probably was just like

133
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:40,519
"Mom, I really need a nap, and
this is how I'm gonna do it.

134
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,458
"I'm gonna sleep on Papa."

135
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,291
That's so cute!

136
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:47,071
I thought for sure he'd wake up when you--

137
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:48,459
Just sleeping.

138
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,751
Check out the project they
finished while I was gone too.

139
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,359
They got their little stuff up,

140
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,727
and looks like Zuri's loving it!

141
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:59,838
You have your own little space now?

142
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:00,671
Oh she's,

143
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,846
(laughs)

144
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:03,439
she's like "I'm gonna kill you!"

145
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,606
She's so mean!

146
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:07,550
Can I pet you?

147
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,896
No, just stay! Oh gosh.

148
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,296
Yeah, she's gonna love this.

149
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,378
This is like her room now.

150
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:19,491
- Oh hey, there's my cute family!

151
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:21,707
- We're all together!
- I missed you guys!

152
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:23,065
Did you have a fun day with Papa?

153
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:23,898
- Yeah.

154
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,289
- [Bryan] Yeah, how 'bout you
Ollie, what'd you do today?

155
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,633
- I hung out with Mimi.

156
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,466
- Oh cool!

157
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,765
That's awesome!

158
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:31,477
What's up you guys?

159
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:34,618
So we have something to tell you.

160
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:36,140
Ollie.
- We have an a-ouncement.

161
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,460
- We do have an announcement!

162
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,293
- An ouncement!

163
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,699
- It's also so adorable the
way he says announcement.

164
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:41,837
Say it again Ollie.

165
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:43,077
- A-ouncement!

166
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:44,383
- A-ouncement!

167
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,150
Hey Finn, can you say "an announcement"?

168
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,095
(Finn mumbles)

169
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:49,535
We have a big family announcement,

170
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,508
we've never done this before.

171
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:52,341
- Nope.

172
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,077
- It's been something
that people have requested

173
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:55,819
for so long now.

174
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:56,661
- Yep.

175
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,828
- We are doing a 2018 family calendar!

176
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,997
(cheering)

177
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:05,380
- Remember when we did that?

178
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,935
- We took so many cool photos you guys,

179
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,182
for this calendar,

180
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:11,053
it was like a 10-hour shoot day.

181
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:12,382
It was so fun.

182
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:13,215
- So much fun.

183
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:14,048
- So much fun.

184
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,997
Do you guys remember when
the fire truck got called?

185
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:17,990
That was the day--

186
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,134
Or the fire engine got
called to our house,

187
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,724
that was the day we were shooting.

188
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,698
So you'll have to get
it so that you can see

189
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,727
what picture we were shooting,

190
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:27,030
but yeah, we put together a
really cool 2018 calendar.

191
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,103
We wanted to do something special

192
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,913
and not just use old family photos,

193
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,735
so we took new family photos
for every single month,

194
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:35,525
and they're themed and
they're hilarious and so cute!

195
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:36,358
- So cute.

196
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,143
- [Bryan] These boys
were so cute that day,

197
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:39,784
it was like one of the best days ever,

198
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:40,632
shooting.
- Yes.

199
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,247
They were so good, they put up with a lot.

200
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,304
- [Bryan] Yeah
- And it was really good,

201
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:44,440
doing it.

202
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,821
- So the Daily Bump's
first ever 2018 calendar

203
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:50,547
is available right now
for order on our website,

204
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:51,865
dailybumpsmerch.com,

205
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:53,625
also linked down below in the description,

206
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,763
so go get yourself one!

207
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:57,769
And we are signing a
limited number of them!

208
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,958
Finn, do you want to sign a calendar?

209
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:00,847
- Yeah.

210
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:02,569
- [Bryan] Ollie, you
wanna sign a calendar?

211
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,731
- Yeah!
- [Missy] Yep.

212
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,998
- We are going to be signing calendars,

213
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,254
- Yay.
- our 2018 calendars,

214
00:06:07,254 --> 00:06:08,128
so when you go to the store,

215
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:09,542
there's gonna be an unsigned option,

216
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:10,836
and there's also gonna be a signed one,

217
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:14,276
we're only doing a very small
amount of the signed ones,

218
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:16,241
so be sure to grab those while you can.

219
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,391
We're so excited!

220
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,761
- This is gonna be so fun.

221
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:19,919
- I'm excited to hang it in our house,

222
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,239
cause it's gonna look so good!

223
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,735
- Something that's really
cool 'bout the calendar,

224
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:24,119
is we just added all kinds of

225
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,390
fun stuff to look forward to

226
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,806
throughout the calendar.
- [Bryan] Yeah.

227
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:28,374
- So I think that will be really cool,

228
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:29,985
'cause it's not just a calendar.

229
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:31,497
There's just gonna be cute little,

230
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,064
you'll have like the boys' birthday in it,

231
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:35,119
and a lot of other special surprises, so.

232
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,528
- It's gonna be cool!

233
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,840
So head on over to dailybumpsmerch.com

234
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,673
I'll have it linked down below

235
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:40,770
in the description as well

236
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,603
so you can click it,

237
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,769
and go order your calendar.

238
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:44,602
I can't believe we're doing a calendar!

239
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:45,435
- I know!

240
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:46,268
- We've never done that before.

241
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:47,101
- I know, we've never done it!

242
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:47,934
- Five years on YouTube,

243
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,160
and we have never done a calendar!

244
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,185
It's a lot of work though,

245
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:51,137
so I kind of understand.

246
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,057
- Yeah, it was a lot of work.

247
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,850
- And I think last year
we wanted to do it,

248
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,633
and it was like November,

249
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:56,935
I was like "Oh."

250
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:57,768
So we planned ahead.

251
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:58,601
- Yes.

252
00:06:58,601 --> 00:06:59,709
- We made it happen.

253
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,490
- [Bryan] Riding his bike,

254
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,740
too cool for school.

255
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,605
Wow!

256
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,236
(dog barking)

257
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,163
- This morning he woke up,

258
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:09,324
got out of bed,

259
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,692
ran straight to his bike,

260
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:11,913
grabbed it, took it outside,

261
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:12,941
and went --

262
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:13,828
- [Bryan] Oh.

263
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:15,916
- Early this morning in his
pajamas, just riding his bike.

264
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,269
- [Bryan] He is obsessed with
this thing all of a sudden.

265
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,349
He likes it.

266
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,553
- I know, he actually is
obsessed with any kind of bike,

267
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:23,303
but like, if he's, during the
day and he's playing with it,

268
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:24,136
and he has to come inside,

269
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:25,056
he brings it with him

270
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,896
and he puts it on the table next to him,

271
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:29,344
puts it on the couch next to him.

272
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:33,344
- [Bryan] Alright boys,
this is the finish line.

273
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:38,028
And this is the starting line.

274
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:39,133
You guys ready to race?

275
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,200
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

276
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,397
- [Bryan] Alright, not yet!

277
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,564
On your mark, get set, go!

278
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,113
And Ollie's in the lead,

279
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,561
but Finn's a close second,

280
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,851
peddling and peddling
his way with his feet,

281
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:54,041
and Ollie crosses the finish line!

282
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,842
Go Finn, you're almost there!

283
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,461
Whoo! Good job dude.

284
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,918
Ollie just kept going.

285
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:00,751
Whoa!

286
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,927
Wheelie! Whoa!

287
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:05,772
You're so cool dude.

288
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:09,272
(slow instrumental music)

289
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:14,661
- [Bryan] Oh hi Mo!

290
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,117
This is Moana.

291
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:16,950
- [Missy] Moana.

292
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,783
- [Bryan] My baby girl.

293
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:18,917
- You guys remember when she was born,

294
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:22,533
held her like, minutes after
she hatched out of her egg.

295
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,072
- Uh oh, I don't --

296
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,311
- [Missy] Where do you want this?

297
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,144
- There.

298
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:26,977
(Bryan laughs)

299
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:28,754
- [Bryan] He has to have it up there, aww.

300
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:29,770
- But now look at her,

301
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,243
she's still like a little baby.

302
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:34,751
- [Bryan] She is, she's
one of our few hens

303
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:35,732
that we got from that.

304
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:36,996
- We got only two hens.

305
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:38,978
- [Bryan] Oh two!
- Two!

306
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:39,812
- [Bryan] Oh geeze.

307
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:40,849
- From that whole batch.

308
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,097
- [Bryan] Yeah. Hi Moana

309
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:43,424
- This one and the other
one is like a scaredy cat,

310
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:46,860
she's kinda like the bottom
of the pecking order, so.

311
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,889
- She's so soft.

312
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,545
- I know, she's so sweet.

313
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:52,001
- [Bryan] Ollie, you're so brave!

314
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:54,322
(Ollie screaming)

315
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:56,314
- Are you scared?

316
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,751
They've never done anything to him!

317
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,285
- [Bryan] Aww.

318
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,471
- Hey guys.

319
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,304
- [Bryan] What?

320
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:03,661
- I got a Lego Batman set.

321
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:05,071
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, you
want to put it together?

322
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:05,904
- Yeah!

323
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:08,487
(upbeat music)

324
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:19,089
- [Bryan] Is that man
going down the slide Finn?

325
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,359
- Yeah.

326
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,411
- [Bryan] Let's see!

327
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:22,578
- [Finn] Whee!

328
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:25,976
- [Bryan] Hey Finn, can
you sing the Batman song?

329
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:27,506
- Yeah.

330
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:29,717
- [Bryan] Na-na na-na na-na na-na Batman!

331
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:30,550
- Batman!

332
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:33,778
- I did it!

333
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:34,695
- [Bryan] Good job dude!

334
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:35,583
- It goes right there!

335
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,475
- [Bryan] Ollie built that
ladder all by himself you guys,

336
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,710
by following the instructions.

337
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,621
Good job Ollie, I'm so proud of you dude!

338
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:46,659
You like putting together stuff?

339
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:47,899
- Does this go here?

340
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,665
- [Bryan] Yeah, it does.

341
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:50,582
Good job.

342
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:53,329
(upbeat music)

343
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,496
Ms. Luna-Loo, she just got
cleaned up and trimmed.

344
00:09:58,902 --> 00:09:59,893
Not really trimmed.

345
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,949
We have a dog groomer
here doing both the dogs.

346
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,861
I told her she needs, like a little trim,

347
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:06,628
and it is so short.

348
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:07,510
Look how short this is,

349
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,816
she looks like a puppy.

350
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,297
Oh, I'm so bummed,

351
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:11,544
I'm sorry.

352
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,832
The dog groomer said they did it right,

353
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:15,910
so she didn't necessarily
shave her undercoat,

354
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,260
which is good 'cause
you're not supposed to

355
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,493
shave a dog's undercoat.

356
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,180
That's actually the
mistake we made with Karma,

357
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,013
a long time ago,

358
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:23,441
which is why we have
to keep his fur short,

359
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:25,787
because it's not very soft anymore.

360
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:28,084
So we're hoping that it's all good,

361
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:30,878
and her coat will be soft still.

362
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:32,788
So she just got a little trim.

363
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:35,362
But yeah, we both saw her and we were like

364
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:37,986
"Oh no. Oh no, that's way too short!"

365
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:38,914
She looks like a puppy!

366
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,065
She's still our little puppy,

367
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:41,892
our little Luna puppy.

368
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,176
Our Luna Christmas puppy,

369
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,185
we've almost had her for a whole year.

370
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:48,430
And she has turned out
to be such a great dog,

371
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,454
and we love her,

372
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:50,711
and she is a part of the family,

373
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:51,854
and it's just really cool

374
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:54,429
when pets become a part of the family.

375
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,429
Scrabble and wine night!

376
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:00,762
Look at Missy and Kelsey
in their matching onesies.

377
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,192
(Bryan laughs)

378
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:03,709
Wait, how many points do you need to win?

379
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:04,626
- 20.

380
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:05,459
- [Bryan] Not happening bro.

381
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:06,379
- [Missy] 19 to tie.

382
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,253
- With two letters.

383
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:08,353
- [Bryan] Okay.
(background talking)

384
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:09,655
Yeah, I know, right?

385
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:10,962
I am currently in first place,

386
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,505
just placed all my tiles!

387
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,361
And we are playing Scrabble
on our new Scrabble board,

388
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,223
check this out.

389
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:17,330
Who's turn is it, Kelsey?

390
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,163
- Is it my turn?

391
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:19,553
- [Bryan] Yeah.
- Yeah.

392
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,386
- [Bryan] Look at you,

393
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:22,019
you guys, she's amazing.

394
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,577
(Bryan laughs)

395
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:25,147
Yeah, we are having such an awesome night,

396
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:27,765
but I think I'm going to go
ahead and end today's vlog.

397
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:30,133
So make sure you subscribe
to Steps to Wander,

398
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,387
I'll have them up in the I card.

399
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:34,520
Go check out the video they
just put up, "Draw my Life",

400
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,353
- Took forever!

401
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:36,201
- And it came out.

402
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,372
So amazing!

403
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:39,066
- I was really stressed out watching it!

404
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,170
- It's a lot like our "Draw my Life",

405
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,837
it's very stressful.

406
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,356
So be sure to check out
that video of theirs.

407
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:45,354
Thanks for watching guys.

408
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:46,713

up if you enjoyed it,

409
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:49,618

410
00:11:49,618 --> 00:00:00,000
