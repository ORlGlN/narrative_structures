00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,863

- What are we doing today?

17
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:36,034
- We're going to Disneyland!

18
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:36,867
- Yeah!

19
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:37,700
(bell dings)

20
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,533
- Disney!

21
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:42,619
- Finn is actually not
going to Disneyland.

22
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,585
(laughs) He is gonna stay here,

23
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,446
he might meet up with us

24
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,279
if we end up staying a

25
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:48,112
little bit longer.

26
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:50,429
He's just not totally up to par yet

27
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,328
and, oh, and my mom and dad were like,

28
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:55,472
we can just watch him

29
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,305
and hang out with him.

30
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:57,138
I think Angie's even gonna
come out and hang out with him.

31
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:57,971
(baby yells)

32
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,795
So he's gonna go get ice cream today, huh?

33
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:00,628
- Yeah

34
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:01,461
- But he has to wear the same thing

35
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,682
Ollie is wearing so he's wearing

36
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:04,452
the Mickey Mouse stuff, huh.

37
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:06,652
- So I'm just wearing a Mickey Mouse top.

38
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:08,073
- Yes and we gotta do your hair, huh?

39
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:08,906
- Yeah

40
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:10,266
- Let's hurry and get you all ready.

41
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:12,849
We gotta go to Disneyland, yay!

42
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:17,357
(upbeat music)

43
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:18,445
- Ollie, where are we at?

44
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,899
- Disneyland!

45
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:21,459
- We made it!

46
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,363
It's just me and my guy today.

47
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:25,363
Finn stayed home and was

48
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:27,102
a little bummed out

49
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:27,935
but I think he'll be happier

50
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:30,123
and we're with our friends,

51
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,956
Ginger and Kyle and Gage and Luke.

52
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:35,471
And we are so excited

53
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,733
to have a big kid Disney day, huh?

54
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:38,566
- Yeah!

55
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,286
- What are you so excited to go on today?

56
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,319
- The drop one.

57
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,440
- He seriously wants to go on

58
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,838
Guardians of the Galaxy.

59
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,112
Did I tell you baby, I went a few days ago

60
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:50,112
with my friends and it was so scary.

61
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:54,346
(upbeat music)

62
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:57,214
Alright, first ride is Toy Story

63
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:59,750
and I don't know if Luke knows

64
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,030
how good I am at this game.

65
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,980
Are you ready?

66
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,630
- Okay, let's see.

67
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,213
(upbeat music)

68
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:10,053
- Alright, how did we do?

69
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:12,332
- I got 22,000 points.

70
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,499
- Oh, I got 63,000 points!

71
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:18,476
- I guess you do play
this a lot more than me.

72
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:20,509
- I do play it a lot and I had to get good

73
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,350
at with playing with a baby on my lap.

74
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,224
- Oh!

75
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:24,099
- So...

76
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:24,932
- That, she's a pro.

77
00:02:24,932 --> 00:02:25,797
- Exactly, I mean, I'm just--

78
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,678
- She's a pro

79
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:30,261
(upbeat music)

80
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:34,106
- Hi!

81
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:35,625
- Hi!

82
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,462

(Woman yells)

84
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:39,744

85
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,449
Ollie how'd you do?

86
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:42,909
- Good.

87
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:43,917
- [Missy] Did you do good?

88
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,254
High five.

89
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:46,578
- I did so good.

90
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:48,052
- You did, alright guys,

91
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,671

92
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,565

93
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:53,034

95
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:57,936
We're playing Head's Up.

96
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:59,770
- Okay what are the headbands

97
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,873

98
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:03,706

00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:04,539

100
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:06,205

102
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:07,911
- Uh, Cinderella.

103
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:09,911
- [Missy] Yeah, what's
the person who did that?

104
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,044
- It's fairy godmother.

105
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,421
- Yeah!

106
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,066

108
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:16,118

109
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:16,951
Alright we're doing a deck

110
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:18,461

And then we're gonna help you guess, okay?

115
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,437
Oh this is something you put

116
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:26,737

117
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:27,967
- [Ginger] Not gloves but...

118
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,069

119
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:30,902

121
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,728
Okay, let's pass that one. (laughs)

122
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:36,337
This is something that you are.

123
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,355
This is something that you are

124
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:38,188

125
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:41,732

126
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:42,950

127
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,587
So if you're not scared of anything,

128
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:46,188
what are you?

129
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,021
- Um, I fight.

130
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,329

Put it down, oh this is something

136
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:55,168
you use to eat your cereal.

137
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,184

138
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:58,451

139
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,049
Oh, this is that movie with the girl

142
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,421
Do you know her name?

143
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:06,254
- No.

144
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:08,625
- [Missy] Do you know
who I'm talking about,

145
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,458

146

I keep squishing you!

189
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:04,008
- [Gage] Oh, no!

190
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,091
There's more?

191
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:14,358
- [Group] (screaming)

192
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,366
Oh, that's fine!

193
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,845
- [Missy] Ollie (mumbles)

194
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:34,153
- Oh my goodness!

195
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:35,391
- Wow!

196
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,391
- He's acting so scared.

197
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,432
Ollie, you didn't like it?

198
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:44,622
Your stomach went like five times!

199
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:45,455
Oh my God!

200
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:47,250
- I know what part got him.

201
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,101
- [Missy] Oh

202
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:48,934
- It got me, too!

203
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:49,767
- [Missy] The fire?
- Really loud.

204
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:50,702
- [Missy] Yeah.

205
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,160
Alright, Ollie, just went on

206
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,144
Thunder Mountain, and I want to know

207
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:56,369
what was your reaction?

208
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:57,963
- It was really scary.

209
00:06:57,963 --> 00:06:59,961
- [Missy] Why were you so scared?

210
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,794
- Because it was...

211
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:01,836
- [Missy] Ollie, look to over there!

212
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:04,117
- Your allegiance should be with the

213
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:05,612
First Order!

214
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:06,473
- [Missy] Sorry!

215
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,348
- Be careful, Citizen!

216
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:10,395
- [Missy] Oh wow, your Disneyland trip

217
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,230
has been so scary!

218
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,151
(laughs)

219
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,588
I'm literally asking him about

220
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:15,463
the Thunder Mountain Ride.

221
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:16,736
So, you were scared?

222
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,569
- Yeah.

223
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:18,554
- Why were you scared?

224
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,118
- Because it was going really fast.

225
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:21,951
- It is a fast ride.

226
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,325
It's one of the big kid rides.

227
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:24,487
Are you telling me you don't like

228
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,788
Thunder Mountain anymore?

229
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:26,621
- No.

230
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:27,454
- Oh my goodness.

231
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,287
- Yeah.

232
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,120
- Yeah, those Storm Troopers just came

233
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,429
by and it was pretty scary.

234
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:31,262
(laughs)

235
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:35,069
(mumbles) Yeah, we are
having such a fun day with

236
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,137
the boys, and just hanging out.

237
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:38,300
And a fun little Mommy Son day, huh?

238
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,916
I think we're actually going to do

239
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,115
a half day so we are headed home

240
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,728
pretty soon here.

241
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,051
Are you ready to start heading out?

242
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:44,884
- Yeah.

243
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:46,056
- We got some fun stuff to take home

244
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:49,325
to Finn, and yeah, we're going to

245
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:50,252
start heading out.

246
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:51,225
Are you ready?

247
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:52,248
- Yeah.

248
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:53,948
- Ollie, where are we heading now?

249
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:56,315
- Into the LEGO store!

250
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:57,732
- Whoo! Let's go!

251
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,125
Wow.

252
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:06,379
So we thought we'd check out the LEGO

253
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,954
store really quick because Ginger

254
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,946
and the boys are all doing The Void

255
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:12,127
which is a really fun experience down

256
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,141
here at Downtown Disney.

257
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,780
It's like a VR Star Wars experience.

258
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,889
Really, really cool.

259
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,792
Me and Brian did it a few weeks ago.

260
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,168
But Ollie's too young.

261
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,053
- This is the one we have!

262
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:25,412
- Yeah, we have that one!

263
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,995
(techno music)

264
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:57,382
- Alright guys, we just ended our Disney

265
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,799
Day and it was so much fun.

266
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,138
- It was the perfect amount of time.

267
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:02,010
We only did a half day...

268
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,843
- Yeah.

269
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:03,676
- And it was perfect.

270
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,509
- So good.

271
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:05,919
We did a few rides, they did The Void.

272
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,192
How did you guys like it?

273
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,031
- Amazing!

274
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:09,656
- Oh, good!

275
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:12,358
- It's kind of scary
when you fly Darth Vader.

276
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:14,377
- I know! It's so, so fun.

277
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:16,173
If you guys have a chance
to go, check it out,

278
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,063
it's so cool.

279
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:17,896
- Yeah

280
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,061
- And I'm glad they
were able to end on that

281
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:20,806
'cause it was a pretty busy day at Disney

282
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:23,239
but at least they got to do The Void which

283
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,163
is really awesome.

284
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,767
I bet your dad would love it.

285
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:26,600
- Yeah

286
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,433
Oh, yeah.

287
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,266
- Yeah.

288
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,085
But anyways, as you can see, it was

289
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:31,918
such a fun day that Ollie is passed

290
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:32,751
out.

291
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,584
- Look at him!

292
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:34,417
Just sleeping.

293
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:38,119
- [Missy] He's just passed out, asleep.

294
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,868
- Yep, he's exhausted.

295
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,759
But we actually are on our way home

296
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,481
and traffic is not even too bad.

297
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:45,943
We have fast track so we're passing

298
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:48,643
up a lot of the bad traffic.

299
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:49,794
- [Ginger] This isn't
even that bad, though.

300
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:51,893
- We're passing up a lot of stuff.

301
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:54,476
We're just (mumbles) 'cause traffic can

302
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:55,309
be a bummer.

303
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:56,541
But I'm excited to go home and see Finn.

304
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,286
We've missed him!

305
00:09:58,286 --> 00:09:59,189
So, you guys, we are going to go ahead

306
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:01,907
and end this video because we're going

307
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:02,868
to go home and relax and chill.

308
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,633
So make sure you give it a big thumbs up

309
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,689
if you guys enjoyed our Disney Day

310
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,701
and let us know down in the comments

311
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:09,567
what is your favorite Star Wars

312
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,400
character.

313
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,572
We did a lot of Star Wars rides today

314
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,283
and we want to know down below

315
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,159
which one your favorite Star Wars

316
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,889
character is and we'll see you guys

317
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:16,722
in our next video.

318
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:17,889
- [Group] Bye!

319
00:10:21,889 --> 00:00:00,000
(techno music)
