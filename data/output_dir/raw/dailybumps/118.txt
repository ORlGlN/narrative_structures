1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:02,821
- [Man] I think that
has too many legs Missy.

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:03,689
- What? Those are tentacles.

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,135
- How many legs does a
spider have? Tentacles?

4
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:09,702
Spiders do not have
tentacles. You're crazy.

5
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:10,558
♫ Watch us shine.

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:12,527

7
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:14,738
♫ Let's live it.

00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:19,047

What are we doing today babe?

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,209

13
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:27,309
- Yeah.

14
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:28,346
- We're eating candy.

15
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:30,982
- I am a very friendly gorilla

16
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,354
(gorilla sounds)

17
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:33,909
- A very tall giraffe.

18
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,446
- And I will be filming it

19
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,727
and giving critiques and judgements.

20
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:38,632
- Yeah.

21
00:00:38,632 --> 00:00:39,594
- Thank you bro.

22
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,184
Okay, we're gonna start
out with something easy.

23
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,017
- Okay.

24
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:44,239
- We're both gonna do a
ghost, and then you guys

25
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,400
are gonna let us know in the comments,

26
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,233
who did it better.

27
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,357
Okay?
- Okay.

28
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:48,274
- [Man] Go.

29
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:51,203
Bryan going with the traditional white.

30
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:52,585
Missy starting with black.

31
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,673
Hmm, what's her technique?

32
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:57,256
(upbeat music)

33
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,686
Bryan mixing it up with the green eyes.

34
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,868
- Heck yeah, dude.

35
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:02,839
- [Man] Wow.

36
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,437
Missy, what's your inspiration?

37
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:07,389
- You know..
- She's copying me.

38
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:09,773
- No I'm not.
- She's just copying me.

39
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:11,545
- I didn't know you were doing that.

40
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:14,128
(upbeat music)

41
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:16,658
- [Man] Oh, what's going on here?

42
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,725
- What is she doing? Oh, she's extra.

43
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,698
She extra up in here.
- [Man] Extra credit.

44
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:22,015
- What are you doing?

45
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,422
- [Man] I don't know what she's doing.

46
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:24,265
- What are all those dots?

47
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:25,847
- [Man] I don't think she
knows what she's doing.

48
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,600
(Missy laughing)

49
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,716
- Oh, are those circles?

50
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,324
- OOOOOO!
- [Man] Oh, cool.

51
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,179
- Ready to flip?

52
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:32,457
- Yeah, let's do it.

53
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:35,457
- Let's see how this turned out. Oh.

54
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,648
Boom! Yes!
- [Man] Yo!

55
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:44,670
- Oh, that's so cute.
- [Man] Oh, shoot.

56
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,396
That is really cool.

57
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,503
- Hang on, hang on. Just give me a second.

58
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:50,237
Just give me a second.

59
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:51,470
Now it's a ghost.

60
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,887
Now it's white.
- [Man] 'cause it's white.

61
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,999
- Next up, spider.

62
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:00,803
- Alright, draw it.
- Let's do it.

63
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,751
(upbeat music)

64
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:04,830
- See, you're copying me.

65
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,973
- No I'm not. You're copying me.

66
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,223
- You just did it after me.

67
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:13,463
- [Man] I think that
has too many legs Missy.

68
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:14,440
- What? Those are tentacles.

69
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,064
- How many legs does a spider have?

70
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:19,443
Tentacles? Spiders do not have tentacles.

71
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:20,890
You're crazy.

72
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,797
- [Man] Bryan, yours
doesn't have enough legs.

73
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:24,812
- Six legs right?

74
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,813
- No, eight.

75
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,764
- [Man] Both of you did
the wrong number of legs.

76
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,025
- No, those are arms.

77
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,797
I mean, those are little tentacles.

78
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,043
- You ready for this?

79
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:32,876
- Yeah.

80
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:37,136
Ridiculous, ridiculous.

81
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:39,524
- It's gonna make it
look really cool, watch.

82
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:40,774
- [Man] Oh wow.

83
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:43,231
- Oh nice.

84
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:45,825
- Whoo, dang!

85
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:48,917
- Good lookin' spider.

86
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:49,750
- [Man] Ready to flip?

87
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,545
- Ready to flip,

88
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:56,313
hoping this whole thing
didn't turn into a disaster.

89
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:57,230
Okay. Boom!

90
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,138
- That's pretty good.

91
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:04,721
(upbeat music)

92
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,497
- Alright, next up we are
going to do jack o'lantern.

93
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:11,938
- Okay, I mean, we all need orange right?

94
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:13,676
- You would think that you
would need to start with orange.

95
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,845
- You're right.
- I might be wrong.

96
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,786
Don't copy me!
- I like this one.

97
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:19,026
- You guys, she's copying me.

98
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:20,823
- Okay, we're doing the jack o'lantern.

99
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:23,406
(upbeat music)

100
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,218
- Hey, your pumpkin's
melting there babe. Sorry.

101
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:42,496
Your pumpkin's melting.

102
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:45,177
- It's just how pumpkins
are. They're lopsided.

103
00:03:45,177 --> 00:03:49,938
- I'm going to flip my
cute little jack o'lantern.

104
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,938
You guys ready for this?

105
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,368
Booyah!
- [Man] Ohh.

106
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,332
- Very basic, very basic.

107
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:58,701
- But you know what, look it,

108
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:02,868
it's a very clear shape,
and it's a cute little face.

109
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,294
Good job babe.
- [Man] Nice.

110
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:07,959
- Look at that beautiful vine.

111
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:08,959
- [Man] Wow.

112
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:13,663
- Good work on that pumpkin, babe.

113
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:14,496
- Thanks.

114
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:15,329
- Surprised me a little bit with that one.

115
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,019
Next up, we are going to
do a Halloween favorite,

116
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,204
Jack Skellington from The
Nightmare Before Christmas.

117
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:22,420
- Yeah. Okay.

118
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,003
(upbeat music)

119
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,581
- Alright.
- [Man] Here is the flip.

120
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,051
- We are going to both flip

121
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:44,527
our Jack Skellingtons at the same time.

122
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:45,360
You ready?

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,248
- Ready.

124
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:48,248
- One, two, three, flip!

125
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:52,588
Those are both cool.

126
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,882
- Which one's better? I mean,
your eyes are pretty cool.

127
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:56,153
- [Man] Yeah.
- Eyes are big.

128
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,361
- [Man] His look authentic.

129
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:58,332
- Jack Skellington is the best.

130
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,106
He's the Halloween classic.

131
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:01,689
- Also, super easy.

132
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:05,378
(upbeat music)

133
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,523
- Alright, we are up in
the difficulty level.

134
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:14,273
For the next one, we
are going to do a witch.

135
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,147
You ready?

136
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,313
- Okay, I'm thinking. I'm thinking it.

137
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:18,267
I just don't know how.

138
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,850
(upbeat music)

139
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:33,447
- Woooo.

140
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:35,563
- That's my witch!

141
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:36,787
- It even has a wart?

142
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,676
- Yeah, heck yeah.
- Wow.

143
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:40,097
- [Man] Wow.

144
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:41,597
- One, two, three.

145
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:47,474
Witch on a broomstick
in front of the moon.

146
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:48,725
- Okay, that was a pretty good idea

147
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,709
because you really didn't plan ahead, so.

148
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:52,553
- I planned ahead.

149
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,916
- Good job, good job.

150
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,559
- She's sitting on,

151
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,021
even her little cape is behind her broom.

152
00:05:58,021 --> 00:05:59,175
- Okay, okay.

153
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,252
- I mean it's literally perfect.

154
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:01,894
- So are her feet the
same color as the broom?

155
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,919
It looks like her broom has feet.

156
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:03,752
- Yeah.

157
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:04,865
- Are those her feet or the broom's feet?

158
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,242
- She's wearing leggings.

159
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,235
- Oh, black leggings?

160
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:09,818
(upbeat music)

161
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:23,493
And there you have it guys.

162
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:26,420
That is the Pancake Art
Challenge, Halloween Edition.

163
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,858
These are all of mine, and
these are all of Missy's.

164
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:33,197
So let us know in the comments,
and in the iCard pool above,

165
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:36,309
who do you think won, Missy or me?

166
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,907
I think that there are some

167
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:40,653
that I definitely feel are better,

168
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:41,975
and some that you did that are probably,

169
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,409
maybe a little better.

170
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:44,383
- Yeah, Yeah.
- You did a good job.

171
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,399
I mean, honestly, I love all of them.

172
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,232
- Yeah.

173
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,155
- I think we did a dang good job.

174
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:50,248
- It was pretty cool, and
that's the thing about art.

175
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:53,557
It's subjective, so we need your opinion.

176
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:55,520
But important opinion is also Finn.

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,038
Hey Finn, who do you think,
who do you think won?

178
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,453
Mommy or daddy?

179
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,361
- Dada.

180
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:01,194
