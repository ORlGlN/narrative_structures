1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,550
- We were moving along really nicely.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,656
We had about 90 miles left.

3
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:07,222
Then, the freeway
completely stopped moving.

4
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:08,200
Just stopped.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,299
The time just went up to like, 3 hours.

6
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:15,675
We had to find a way
to get off the freeway.

7
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:18,525
We're now 125 miles away and climbing.

8
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:20,446
We are going the opposite way.

9
00:00:20,446 --> 00:00:23,068
We have to go a different way so we can

10
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:24,883
try and get back on track.

11
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:26,278
So sad.

(uplifting music)

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,768
- Morning.

25
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,516
Good morning guys.

26
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:06,361
What do you have Ollie?

27
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,202
- I have a dino tooth.

28
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,035
- Whoa.

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,543
It's big.

30
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:14,215
- [Bryan] Alright Ollie,
what are we doing today?

31
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:16,839
- We're going on a field trip.

32
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:17,735
- [Bryan] A field trip?

33
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:20,515
We're actually going on a road trip,

34
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:23,179
and it's going to be our
first family road trip,

35
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:24,334
as a family of four.

36
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,249
A real road trip.

37
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:28,403
Are you ready Finn?

38
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:31,090
Hello guys, yes, everything
is kind of a mess right now

39
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,825
because we are packing for a road trip.

40
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,128
We do not road trip,
if you guys don't know,

41
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:38,174
Missy does not like to road trip.

42
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:39,791
But we're not going very far,

43
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,053
it's about five, six hours away,

44
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:43,690
and it's gonna be the first road trip

45
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,464
that we've ever taken
with both of the boys.

46
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:47,980
We once did a family road trip with Ollie

47
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,741
when we went to go see
Ellie and Jared in Utah,

48
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:52,693
and we've never done
anything like that with Finn,

49
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:55,499
but now I feel like they're
both at the perfect age

50
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:56,913
where they're gonna be really good.

51
00:01:56,913 --> 00:01:59,142
So, knock on wood.

52
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:01,885
Knock on wood, hopefully it goes well.

53
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:04,358
Finn that is my suitcase,
you cannot unpack it,

54
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,261
and no, we do not need
to take this cactus,

55
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,161
this knitted cactus.

56
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,401
Can you go put that back?

57
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,870
Ollie have you started packing?

58
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,703
- No.

59
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:14,714
- [Bryan] We'll you need to
pack, what're you gonna bring?

60
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:15,557
- Toys.

61
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:16,458
- [Bryan] You gonna bring some toys?

62
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,291
- Yeah.

63
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,166
- Well good morning guys.

64
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:22,276
That's right, I'm here getting
ready now for our road trip,

65
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,536
and you know, I'm pretty
good at packing now,

66
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:26,149
I've been packing for a long time,

67
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:28,271
but I am not good at road trips.

68
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:32,489
The trust is, is that my
family and I went on road trips

69
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,012
all the time as a kid.

70
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,748
We would always usually be driving from

71
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:38,598
all the way from Idaho, to California,

72
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:40,478
and that road trip is like,

73
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:42,791
I'll never do that road
trip ever ever ever again.

74
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,806
Don't even try and ask
me to do that Bryan.

75
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:46,270
- Okay.

76
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,069
- But anyways, I'm just like,
not a fan of road trips.

77
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:50,699
I feel like I get so bored,
I feel like claustrophobic,

78
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,622
I feel like I can't move, it's just hard.

79
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:56,005
And probably one of the worst
road trips that ever went on,

80
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:58,455
but I have to be careful
because it's also like

81
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:00,430
a very amazing time with Bryan,

82
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,990
but our trip to New York was torture.

83
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,831
Oh my goodness.

84
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:08,628
- Apparently I have forgotten
to pack a couple of things.

85
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:11,270
- [Missy] Are you guys
gonna ride in the suitcase?

86
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,103
- No mom.

87
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:16,270
I'm trying to get Finn to,
for, from the toys try packing.

88
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:18,624
- [Missy] You're packing those toys

89
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:19,749
but you don't want him to get them?

90
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:20,582
- Yeah.

91
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:21,917
- You guys can actually ride in the car,

92
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,575
you don't have to ride in the suitcase,

93
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,209
you know that right?

94
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,217
- No but our road trip to
Utah where we went to see

95
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:30,936
Ellie and Jared, it was actually
a pretty good road trip.

96
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:33,583
We did it at night, and
it went fairly well,

97
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,943
and so I'm like, "Okay, let's do it.

98
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:37,364
"Let's go on this road trip."

99
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:38,637
Hopefully, it'll be good.

100
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,251
Hopefully, Finn does okay.

101
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:41,672
He still not amazing in the car,

102
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,336
I think that's why we have not

103
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:45,512
braved a road trip with him yet,

104
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,377
but he's finally turned around,

105
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,533
and we've got lots of other
things to keep him busy,

106
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,343
so I'm hoping it's a good trip.

107
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:53,149
And make sure you guys keep watching

108
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,649
to find out where we're
going, it is so exciting,

109
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:56,896
and leave in the comments right now,

110
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:59,060
where you think we are going.

111
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,722
It's gonna be so much fun

112
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,451
and a lot of crazy
things are gonna happen.

113
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,770
- [Bryan] Finn.

114
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,853
What is going on in here?

115
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,924
What are you doing?

116
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,924
There's soap everywhere.

117
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,185
He's like wiping all over his face.

118
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,368
You know what he's doing right?

119
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:19,733
- He just watched you wash your face.

120
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,452
- I just washed my face in our bathroom,

121
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,698
he was looking at me like this,

122
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,674
and then I heard water
running in the bathroom.

123
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:30,359
You just trying to be like
daddy and wash your face?

124
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,192
- Yeah.

125
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:32,880
- I think that's a great
thing for me to teach you.

126
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,283
Yes, thank you for helping
me wash my face too, okay?

127
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:37,116
- Okay.

128
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,699
- You are so cute, have a kiss.

129
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:44,590
I washed my face, doesn't
need to be washed again.

130
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,285
Alright, we have to say
goodbye to the doggies.

131
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,807
They're gonna be staying here with uncle.

132
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:52,012
Uncle's gonna be hanging out
at our house while we're gone,

133
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:54,140
just so that Luna gets the care she needs

134
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,983
since she just had her surgery.

135
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:58,636
We don't wanna be taking
trips or anything,

136
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:01,426
although it'd be so fun to
bring her where we are going

137
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,173
because, where we are
going is always a fun time,

138
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,006
isn't it Luna?

139
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,625
Okay, I love you, kisses.

140
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,458
Kisses.

141
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:10,532
Bye Karma boy.

142
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,184
I love you, be good, okay?

143
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:13,846
They're like, "We got this."

144
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,778
I'm also really excited for this road trip

145
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:17,715
because we're taking our truck,

146
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:20,260
and it actually just had this installed,

147
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,146
and it's basically like a cover

148
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:24,180
for the entire bed of the truck.

149
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,081
So it's unclipped.

150
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,259
So now we have all our
stuff loaded up in there,

151
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,905
you can just close this like so,

152
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:34,826
and then we even lock it
on the inside right here.

153
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:35,734
It's so cool.

154
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:36,864
So now all our stuff will be like,

155
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:38,490
nice and secure in the back of the truck,

156
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,106
and yes, we are bringing
Finn's mattress and cover

157
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,277
because we have the space so, why not?

158
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,715
And let's go.

159
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:47,548
(road trip music)

160
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,332
And, we are off,

161
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:55,861
and listen to that.

162
00:05:58,352 --> 00:05:59,185
- Quiet.

163
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:01,113
- Just listen, it's quiet.

164
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:03,836
The boys are all set up in
the back with the DVD player

165
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:05,849
with their headphones so
that they can hear it,

166
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:07,987
and they're just like, so comfortable.

167
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,154
- I'm watching Scooby Doo.

168
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,056
- [Bryan] Okay that's awesome buddy.

169
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:15,934
And Finn just kind of keeps
taking the headphones on and off

170
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:17,473
but he's still occupied.

171
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:19,744
And when he does put them
on, can you put them on Finn?

172
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,994
When he does put them
on, he like, loves it.

173
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:23,161
He's so happy.

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,667
How are you feeling?

175
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,552
- Pretty good.

176
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:28,385
- [Bryan] First minute.

177
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:31,066
- I know, I'm driving
for like the first hour.

178
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:31,899
- [Bryan] Yeah.

179
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,266
- Just to maybe kill some time,

180
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,889
but then I don't like driving,

181
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,601
so I'm just gonna drive to kill
some time and then I'm done.

182
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:40,434
(road trip music)

183
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:51,510
- [Bryan] Alright, so Missy
packed a good old lunch

184
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,376
for the boys, which by the
way, look at his lunch box.

185
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:56,351
It used to look like this,

186
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,194
and now it looks like this, it's so funny.

187
00:06:58,194 --> 00:06:59,092
This is Ollie's lunch box

188
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:00,690
and she packs both the boys',

189
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,649
peanut butter and jelly,
pringles, apples, and a drink.

190
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,552
And Ollie was like, "I'm hungry",

191
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,641
so he's eating his lunch now.

192
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:08,891
You doing good?

193
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:10,611
He's doing good.

194
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:13,562
And that one's asleep, so, great success.

195
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:16,395
(road trip music)

196
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:28,816
- Ran out of gas?

197
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,999
- [Bryan] No, we didn't run out of gas.

198
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,596
We just need to get some more though.

199
00:07:32,596 --> 00:07:35,162
Because if we keep driving,
we might have, huh?

200
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:35,995
Yeah.

201
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:39,114
We stopped to get gas,
we're filling up the truck.

202
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:40,697
Missy and I are swapping out,

203
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:42,454
so I'm gonna be driving
the rest of the way, okay?

204
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:43,287
- Yeah.

205
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,419
- [Bryan] Alright, did you wanna drive?

206
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,787
- I don't know how to drive.

207
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:49,297
- [Bryan] You don't know how to drive?

208
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:50,287
- You wanna drive?

209
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:51,547
- Yeah.

210
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:53,153
- [Bryan] Okay, we'll let you drive.

211
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,958
- He doesn't know how to drive.

212
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,747
- [Bryan] Probably not, huh?

213
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,260
Alright, we are good.

214
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,499
- We got snacks.

215
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,332
- [Bryan] What're you eating?

216
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:01,911
- I'm eating a wing-pop.

217
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,103
- [Bryan] Whoa.

218
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,132
You got one too?

219
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,774
- Yeah.
- I got wed.

220
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,065
- [Oliver] Finn had to wed too.

221
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,292
- [Bryan] Apparently
we needed lots of candy

222
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,906
for this road trip, so
we got a huge Starburst,

223
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,883
I've never seen these
before, that is ginormous.

224
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:16,034
And we also got some Skittles.

225
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,524
See, it's so big.
- Wow.

226
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:20,942
I wanna see what's inside.
- See.

227
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,143
- [Bryan] I know you do.

228
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:23,232
Candy.

229
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:25,142
- Alright, the sun is behind us,

230
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,142
and we are still drving.

231
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,057
- Driving.

232
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:29,890
- I brought my whole setup.

233
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,467
I've got, really comfy
blanket and a pillow.

234
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:35,028
This is how I've always
done my road trips.

235
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,861
And yeah the boys--
- Not me.

236
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,530
- [Bryan] I am as minimal as possible.

237
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,593
I'm like, I want my wallet and my phone.

238
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:41,158
That's all I want up here.

239
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:43,631
- I think kind of gets
driven crazy when I'm like,

240
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,360
"Okay I have this and
this and this", he's like,

241
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,283
"So many things."

242
00:08:48,283 --> 00:08:49,622
- Like it's a five-hour drive.

243
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,804
- Yeah I know, it is a little
much, but you know what,

244
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:54,118
I didn't bring much other than this.

245
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,213
I'm very comfortable.

246
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:57,257
But the boys are happy right now.

247
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:59,334
Finn has like moments of freak-out,

248
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:01,809
then I just give them a
little candy and he's happy.

249
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,026
How much longer do we
have like, three hours?

250
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,276
- Couple hours.

251
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,207
- We're gonna get there.

252
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,834
They say five hours, but I
think it's like a six-hour.

253
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,667
(road trip music)

254
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,734
So it is officially dark out,

255
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:40,624
and we are almost to Vegas.

256
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:42,537
And I'm actually really excited

257
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:45,256
because I don't think Ollie has ever seen

258
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:48,634
somewhere like Vegas, like
lit up, bright lights,

259
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:50,513
hopefully not the inappropriate but,

260
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:51,831
I think he's going to be really excited.

261
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:54,019
Because we saw like one
vet when we passed through

262
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,413
the California and Nevada border,

263
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,632
and he was like, "Whoa, look at that",

264
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,512
so I think he's going to be
really excited actually Vegas.

265
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:02,853
The boys are still doing good.

266
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:03,686
Finn is now naked

267
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,891
because he spilled an entire
bottle of water on himself.

268
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,475
I didn't feel like going to
get a new outfit from the back,

269
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,180
so I was like, "Well, you just
gonna have to sit naked now."

270
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,112
- I think, you ready for Vegas Ollie?

271
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:15,945
- Yeah.

272
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:18,778
(road trip music)

273
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,648
- Look at that laser.

274
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:29,240
- What do you think of that?
- Now there's lasers,

275
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,990
- [Bryan] and lights.

276
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,647
- [Missy] Do you see how Finn?

277
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,353
- Yeah, I saw a palm tree.

278
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:37,484
- [Missy] A palm tree?

279
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:38,371
- Yeah.

280
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,206
- [Missy] Look at those
big buildings Ollie.

281
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,841
- Wow.

282
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,415
Wait, is it taller than me?

283
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:45,463
- [Missy] Yeah they're taller than you.

284
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:49,804
- Well I'm big, I can't
be taller than my hands.

285
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:51,020
- [Missy] Yeah you
don't think the building

286
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,575
is taller than your hands?

287
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:53,779
- Yeah.

288
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,993
- [Missy] Those are like pretty
tall buildings to me Oliver.

289
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,880
- Whoa, look at that horse.

290
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,945
- [Missy] You see a horse.

291
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:01,360
- Yeah I saw a horse.

292
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,935
It was just a small-town horse.

293
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:05,071
- [Missy] Isn't this a cool town?

294
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:05,904
- Yeah.

295
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,789
- I saw a man on a O.

296
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:17,247
- [Missy] On the letter O?

297
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:18,080
- Yeah.

298
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,838
- [Missy] That was the Bellagio.

299
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:20,671
- Bellagio?

300
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:21,665
- [Missy] Yeah.

301
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:22,622
- So why's it here?

302
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:25,458
- [Missy] Bellagio is a hotel and casino.

303
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,529
Look, there's Caesar's Palace.

304
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,796
- [Oliver] Caesar's Palace?

305
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,036
- [Missy] Yeah.

306
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,351
That one's a big one.

307
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:33,605
Do you see the Ferris wheel?

308
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:34,690
- [Oliver] I saw it.

309
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,011
- [Missy] Yeah that's
the Ferris wheel ride.

310
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,858
So for those of you who have been

311
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,213
wondering where we're going,

312
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:44,089
we just passed Vegas so
we're not headed there,

313
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:46,269
although, that would
been a really fun place.

314
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,407
But we're getting close,
just a few more hours.

315
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,677
So keep your guesses coming
where you think we're going,

316
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,844
passing Vegas.

317
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,175
We have officially been in the car

318
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:54,691
for five and a half hours?

319
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:55,524
- Yeah.

320
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:56,680
- We were moving along really nicely,

321
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,702
we had about 90 miles
left and we were like,

322
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:02,079
"Yes, we're gonna be there
in like an hour and a half",

323
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,405
and then the freeway
completely stopped moving,

324
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:07,565
just stopped.

325
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:10,298
We we're at a dead stop
for like 30 minutes,

326
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:13,993
and the time just went
up to like three hours,

327
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,716
it was gonna be at least three hours,

328
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,558
and I started reading like the,

329
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:19,450
like whatever's going on on the freeway.

330
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,909
It's just completely shut
down because of an accident,

331
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,467
and we're like, "Oh crap",

332
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:24,568
and as you can tell like,

333
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,176
Finn's just like, "Um momma,

334
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,049
"when are we getting out of here?"

335
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,839
- I also want to go to the bathroom, okay?

336
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,827
- Yeah, I told him I, you
know, he can pee in this.

337
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:34,604
(crickets creaking)

338
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:38,771
Anyways, we had to find a
way to get off the freeway,

339
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,878
so that we can turn around.

340
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:43,715
We're now 125 miles away and climbing.

341
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:45,736
We are going the opposite way.

342
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:48,199
We have to go a different
way so that we can

343
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,944
try and get back on track,

344
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:51,495
and we're so bummed.

345
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:53,594
It's probably gonna be by the end of this,

346
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:57,228
at least a seven and a
half hour drive, right?

347
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:59,669
- Yeah, five-hour trip turned into a

348
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:01,050
almost eight-hour trip.

349
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,883
- Yeah.

350
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,349
So sad.

351
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,662
So bummed.

352
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,113
We're going to get through this,

353
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:07,212
we're gonna get there pretty late.

354
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:10,129
Oh wow, look at that lighting guys.

355
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:12,712
It's like it's daytime now.

356
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:15,380
Anyways, it's definitely
about, we're really really sad,

357
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,604
we're kind of upset.

358
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:18,129
But we're gonna get there,
we're gonna make it.

359
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,060
Okay Finn, we're gonna get you there.

00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,064

373
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,638
- [Bryan] It was a
journey, but we made it,

374
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:52,858
and all the boys have
been playing already.

375
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:56,577
It's unfortunately bedtime
because we just got here.

376
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,500
- [Missy] Exactly, how
red Finn's eyes are,

377
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,412

378
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:01,883
- [Bryan] Finn is so
stoked because he's eating

379
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,224
a grilled cheese and chocolate melt

380
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:04,512
with a big boy cup.

381
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:07,429
Look at you.
- Oh that's a big bite.

382
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:10,564
- [Bryan] Anyway, I hope you
