00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:02,086

Halloween stuff over there?

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,253
(gasping)

3
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:08,157
(laughing)

4
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,719
You guys are so excited for Halloween.

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,750
♫ This is our life, this is our fight

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,155
♫ This is who we are

7
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,571
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

8
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:21,180
♫ Child among the stars

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,405
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

10
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:26,279
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,068
♫ This is our life

12
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:30,105
♫ Let's live it.

13
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,935
♫ Live it forever

14
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:33,018
Good Morning.

15
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,053
Good morning Fin.

16
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,863
We are having a good morning.

17
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:41,127
We actually switched around
some furniture in the playroom.

18
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,744
We decided we wanted to get a
little bit of a comfier couch.

19
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,554
With the new couch we
thought it would be fun

20
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:48,160
to kind of switch things up
and see if maybe the couch

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,081
looks better here with the table there

22
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:53,116
and then toy box there,
but I guess we'll see

23
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:55,109
once we get the thing in.

24
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,686
Oh my goodness there's
like all kinds of fun stuff

25
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:00,189
going on here; hey how about
you get down, 'kay Ollie?

26
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:03,252
But anyways we had such
a fun day at Disneyland.

27
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:06,688
The boys have a little bit of
a cough that they woke up to.

28
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:09,337
It's not too bad, but I went
ahead and kept Ollie home

29
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,442
from school 'cause I
didn't want him coughing

30
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:13,515
on all the kids at school, so.

31
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:16,478
They seem fine; they seem
happy, but we're just gonna

32
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:18,068
have him rest so he's not making

33
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:19,885
all the other kids at school sick.

34
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:21,941
Are you bummed that you
missed school today?

35
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:23,157
Yeah.

36
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:27,452
Well hopefully you'll be all
better by Thursday, 'kay?

37
00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:29,967
Fin did you find the
toys at Mimi and Papa's?

38
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,134
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

39
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:34,300
He's having so much fun
playing with the toys.

40
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,974
And I have a quick
appointment I have to do

41
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,127
and then I'm gonna be back so the boys

42
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:41,048
are gonna hang out with Mimi real quick.

43
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:43,972
While Bryan has some meetings
as well and then we're off.

44
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:44,805
Have fun with them.

45
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,312
- Okay.

46
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:48,064
- Have fun with them Leo.

47
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:49,842
He's so scared of them.

48
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:52,541
So I'm out trying to get some errands done

49
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:56,127
while Bryan's doing
stuff and Ollie and Fin

50
00:01:56,127 --> 00:02:00,298
are with my mom and I just
realized I literally drove

51
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,545
like probably 30 minutes out of my way

52
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:05,175
and I do not have my wallet.

53
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:08,991
I actually put all my cards
into like a little easy to carry

54
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:11,102
like thing when I went to Disneyland

55
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:13,970
and I stuck it in the backpack
and the backpack's at home.

56
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,584
So I'm so bummed.

57
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,508
I can't do anything; in
fact, I'm driving around

58
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:20,615
without even a license so.

59
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,420
Ugh, I'm so bummed.

60
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,559
I always forget everything.

61
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:27,263
It's kinda just part of who I am.

62
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,169
I'm pretty much use to it at this point,

63
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,950
but it's still annoying.

64
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,065
If you didn't know, the other
day I even, I lost my phone

65
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:38,668
at Target and yeah, don't have my wallet.

66
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:41,305
So, now I've gotta go home.

67
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:42,388
Hey I'm back.

68
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:45,354
Have you guys been having fun at Mimi's?

69
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,353
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

70
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:48,520
Getting along?

71
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,814
Alright boys, Momma's got her wallet.

72
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:56,424
This is what I carry it in
when I go to Disneyland.

73
00:02:56,424 --> 00:03:00,007
So I got it now; now
I just need to use it.

74
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:02,115
I have to go grocery shopping.

75
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,628
Are you ready to go grocery shopping?

76
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:06,514
Alright I'm kinda hoping Fin falls asleep.

77
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:08,633
He's been having a really
hard time taking naps

78
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:12,008
because he does not sleep
well in his crib anymore.

79
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,788
Which I gotta show you his new set up,

80
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:16,975
but bedtime's good because
he's usually ready for bed,

81
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:19,082
but nap time doesn't go so well.

82
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,617
So I'm like, okay let's sleep in the car

83
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,039
before we go shopping; that might be good.

84
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,546
Off we go shopping, 'kay boys?

85
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:28,510
Alright we are getting
some grocery shopping done.

86
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,750
I've got all kinds of goodies in here.

87
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,650

88
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,081
- [Missy] He's trying to say Halloween.

89
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:34,977
Say it again.

songs and get so excited.

94

00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:22,246
We are in the Halloween aisle
and Ollie just put this on.

108
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:23,913
Show you're brother.

109

get that away from me.

111
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,382
You're scaring him.

112
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,483
Here you can hold, you can wear it.

113
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:35,059
He doesn't like that at all.

114
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:38,559
Look at all this like pumpkin spice stuff.

115
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,413

00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:39,624
- Got into your first accident.

181
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:40,972
Ah!

182
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:41,997
Ah!

183
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:44,424
(laughing)

184
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:45,257
- Whoa.

185
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,147
Excuse me sir, I'd like to
see your driver's license

186
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,733
and registration please, oh!

187
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,813
Oh Geez!

188
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:52,387
(laughing)

189
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,762
Saved you.

190
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:55,204
Are you okay?
- Ollie.

191
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:58,340
You're brother was falling
out, you gotta be careful.

192
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,558
- [Bryan] Are you okay Fin?

193
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:00,725
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

194
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:03,480
Say you're sorry to Fin.

195
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,652
- Sorry Fin.

196
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,962
- Say it's okay.

197
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:07,448
- Okay.

198
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:08,922
- You can get out.

199
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,744
- [Bryan] That's some
reckless power wheels driving

200
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:12,919
right there you guys.

201
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:13,752
Alright.

202
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,028
Bye.

203
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:21,130
They're leaving.

204
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,776
Oh wow.

205
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:26,193
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)

206
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,110
Should we take his
driver's license away Fin?

207
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,159
- Say yeah!

208
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,230
- Yeah.

209
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:38,157
- [Bryan] Whoa!

210
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:39,240
You're crazy.

211
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,204
Stop! Oh!

212
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,858
He was looking behind the whole time.

213
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,275
Ollie you ran into our trees.

214
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:50,322
Geez.

215
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:53,585
Be careful next time okay?

216
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:56,581
I think Fin is actually liking this more.

217
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,414
- Ah!

218
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:04,244
That actually scared me for a minute.

219
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,371
- [Bryan] Well yeah, he's crazy.

220
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:08,548
- [Missy] What are you doing?

221
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,674
- Alright we are stocking
up the Halloween calendar.

222
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:14,934
- [Missy] Yeah! So I grabbed
these little Starburst.

223
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,809
Each Starburst has two
pieces of candy in it

224
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:21,868
so each kid gets a little
candy every day in October.

225
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:22,795
- Yeah if you guys don't know

226
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,531
about our new little
tradition, I'll have that video

227
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,261
linked in the I card.

228
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:28,061
But we gotta get ready
'cause October first

229
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:29,979
starts in four days.

230
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,061
- [Missy] Yeah.

231
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,015
- You guys this is the
best Halloween ever.

232
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:33,889
- Oh yeah.
- Is it gonna be

233
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,083
the best Halloween ever?

234
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,000
- Yeah.

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,538
- [Missy] It's gonna be pretty fun.

236
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:39,170
You guys are gonna be so cute.

237
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,301
- This is an awkward
placement for the candy.

238
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,051
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

239
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:45,188
- What?

240
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,021
- [Missy] We're putting candy in there

241
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:50,033
'cause everyday you get to go
in and get one piece of candy.

242
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:52,428
- Oh!
- Is that cool?

243
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,406
We gotta put all the candies in.

244
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:57,060
(upbeat music)

245
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,172
You gotta take a bite; hurry, hurry.

246
00:09:58,172 --> 00:09:59,587
Oh is it all gone?

247
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:00,920
Not yet? Almost?

248
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:06,052
Okay, oh you gotta take a bite first.

249
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,451
- [Bryan] Missy's playing games with them

250
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,033
to get them to eat all their food.

251
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,479
- Oh it's a winner.

252
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,031
- [Bryan] Ollie wins.

253
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:12,864
Sorry Fin.

254
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,193
- Okay let's each take a bite of carrots

255
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:17,941
and see who eats the fastest ready?

256
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:20,358
One, two, three, take a bite.

257
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:23,499
- Take a bite.

258
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,083
Who's gonna eat it first?

259
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,479
Chew it all up, chew it all up!

260
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:29,510
If you guys watched our picky
eater's challenge this week

261
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,362
you know that we have very picky eaters

262
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:33,224
and sometimes it's hard
to get 'em just to eat

263
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:34,596
what they actually like.

264
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:37,775
Missy has devised a little
game that she plays with them

265
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:41,013
and it's kind of like
makes it competitive.

266
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:43,514
- Ollie's like, I'm the fire boy.

267
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:45,241
- [Bryan] You're fire boy?

268
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,619
And what's Fin?

269
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:47,870
- Fin's the water boy.

270
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,031
- [Bryan] Fin's water boy, okay.

271
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:51,442
- And then they usually run around

272
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,932
and try and eat their food the fastest

273
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:55,374
and show me their mouth.
- That's so cute.

274
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:56,207
(laughing)

275
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:57,547
You're such a good mom.

276
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:59,546
That's seriously so fun
and it actually works.

277
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:00,823
Most of the time, usually.

278
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:02,516
So I am making dinner.

279
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:05,359
I got all the boys to bed.

280
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:07,902
I'm making some Tortellini and Missy is

281
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:09,693
running around our house right now.

282
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:12,355
- I'm just going, catch
up with everyone else.

283
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,557
Everyone's beating me.

284
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:16,179
- As you guys know,
Missy got an Apple Watch

285
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,076
the other day after refusing
to have one for so long.

286
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:21,025
She's like okay I'm gonna
do it because I like

287
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,389
to stay active and I'm
working out and stuff.

288
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,969
And so she got an Apple
Watch and now she shares

289
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:29,136
her activity with a handful of friends

290
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:34,137
and she is very lacking
according to those friends

291
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:34,970
so she--

292
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,571
- I worked out today.

293
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:41,054
I went to the gym, I ran,
but I didn't bring my watch.

294
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:42,406
So it's like it didn't count.

295
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:45,206
- Yeah, so now she's doing
laps around our house.

296
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,160
Because all of our friends
are doing very well

297
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,032
on the activity app, so good for you guys.

298
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,143
(laughing)

299
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,586
And Missy forgot her
Appple Watch this morning

300
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,068
when she went to the
gym which is super sad.

301
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:54,221
You can do it!

302
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:56,297
- We got 15 minutes.
- I believe in you babe.

303
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:57,447
Should I have a water bottle?

304
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,609
Should I be like spraying
water on you or something?

305
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:01,097
(laughing)

306
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:03,680
(upbeat music)

307
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:07,950
- Alright, kids are in bed.

308
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,958
We got all our shopping done today.

309
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,663
It was actually a super
productive day, but now

310
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:14,959
we are tired and it's time for bed.

311
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,569
But I did wanna let you
guys know that there is

312
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,568
a brand new fantastic
family time machine up

313
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:21,088

00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,867
I'll have it linked, make
sure you check that out.

315
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,393
It's super cute; I love what we're doing.

316
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:28,579
It's really fun to go back
and watch some of these

317
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,595
really fun moments that I've
totally forgotten about.

318
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:34,684
They're just so cute, like
I just I just love it.

319
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,230
So anyways, make sure
you guys go check it out.

320
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,251

so make sure you go check it out.

323
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,150
