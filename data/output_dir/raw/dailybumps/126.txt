1
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:10,319
- [Missy] Hey bud, hi.

2
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:11,152
(fast paced, rhythmic rock music)

3
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:13,071
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

4
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:15,772
♫ This is who we are

5
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,853
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

6
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:20,211
♫ Shot among the stars

7
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:22,638
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

8
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,258
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,993
♫ This is our life

10
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:31,050
♫ Let's live it, live it forever

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,126
- Good morning, guys.
Good morning.

12
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:35,923
- How did you sleep?
Good.

13
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:37,763
- (gasps) What's today?

14
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:39,340
- Um, Share day!

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,054
- Yep, it is share day at school.

16
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:42,906
And he is pretty excited about school.

17
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,989
On the other hand, I'm just so tired.

18
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:48,605
Are you tired?
- No.

19
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:49,963
- No, he's not tired.

20
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:51,132
Me and Bryan are just exhausted.

21
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:54,333
We've had such a busy week
and it's not over yet.

22
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,805
But my dad is actually going
to take Ollie to school today.

23
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:00,476
Which is so nice of him.

24
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:03,137
You're so excited to go with Papa, huh?

25
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:04,140
- Yeah.
Yeah.

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,901
- I think that's gonna be really cool.

27
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,389
Oh, don't mess up your hair.

28
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:09,334
(laughs) Today is share day

29
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,416
and what is the letter?

30
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,608
- Unicorn.

31
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:12,972
- U.

32
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,805
- U.

33
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:17,152
- And you are gonna share
a unicorn head. Huh?

34
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:18,110
- Yeah.

35
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,832
- Kind of like those horse
heads that you put on.

36
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:21,445
But we have a unicorn one

37
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:22,836
and we thought that would be really funny.

38
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:26,007
It's actually really
hard to find something

39
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,861
in your playroom that starts with a U.

40
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:31,231
If you guys have any ideas of
a toy that starts with a U,

41
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,963
please let me know in the comments.

42
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:35,553
Because the only suggestion
Ollie can give me is what,

43
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,619
what starts with U?

44
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:37,452
- Underpants.

45
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:38,520
- Yeah, underpants.

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,993
And he thinks it's so funny.

47
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:43,361
I'm like, "Well, you can't
share underpants at school."

48
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:46,094
But we do have like a
Captain Underpants like--

49
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:46,927
- Cape.

50
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:51,094
- Cape. But I mean, Captain
Underpants starts with a C,

51
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,030
not necessarily a U.

52
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,553
So, I debated that one but
we have a unicorn head.

53
00:01:56,553 --> 00:01:57,678
But that's the only thing I could think of

54
00:01:57,678 --> 00:02:02,337
that starts with a U is
underpants and unicorn. (laughs)

55
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:03,553
So, yeah, all right.

56
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:04,816
Are you gonna have a good day at school?

57
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:05,649
- Yeah.

58
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:06,885
- All right. I'll see you later, okay?

59
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:07,718
- Okay.

60
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:09,919
(Missy laughs)

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,755
- [Bryan] Good morning, guys.

62
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:13,286
So, this morning I am going

63
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:15,447
through footage from yesterday's shoot.

64
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:18,587
And there is so much good stuff, you guys.

65
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,549
I'm freaking out (laughs).

66
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:25,004
I honestly don't know how I'm
gonna edit this all together.

67
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,333
But I think it's gonna end
up looking really cool.

68
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,786
So, be on the lookout for the
Tribe music video very soon.

69
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,213
And if you guys have
not gotten the song yet,

70
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,931
I'll have it linked in the iCard.

71
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:35,963
So that you guys can jam out to it.

72
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:37,145
But yeah, I'm really excited.

73
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:38,779
This is gonna be a very long edit.

74
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,617
I may need to get someone
to help me with it

75
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:42,791
so I can get it done this year. (laughs)

76
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,863
Look at this, though, you guys.

77
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,384
Look how epic this shot is (laughs)

78
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:50,119
All of us ready for battle (laughs)

79
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,470
The boys had so much fun yesterday.

80
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,640
So, I'm hoping to spend not
too much time on this today

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,840
because I do have other
things that need to be done.

82
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,193
But yes, I'm very excited
for the Tribe music video.

83
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:05,054
Missy has broken out her old
sewing box and sewing machine.

84
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:08,137
And she is working hard on something.

85
00:03:09,544 --> 00:03:10,953
(laughs) This is so funny.

86
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:12,739
You even got your dress
form from the guest room?

87
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:13,572
- [Missy] Yeah.

88
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,080
- [Bryan] That's technically a decor piece

89
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,914
but sure, we can use it.

90
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:17,340
- [Missy] (laughs) It'll work.

91
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,592
- [Bryan] At the end of
this Halloween, babe,

92
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:22,310
you're gonna be making all
the boys' clothes (laughs).

93
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,522
- I've never done anything like this.

94
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:24,475
Like, I love doing projects.

95
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:28,686
But I've never like sewn
something that has to be worn.

96
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:29,828
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

97
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:30,799
- I'm pretty stressed about it.

98
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,621
There may have been some tears last night.

99
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,842
(Bryan laughs)

100
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:35,833
But today, I'm feeling a
little more optimistic.

101
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,913
It's kind of coming along.
[Bryan] Yeah.

102
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,408
I just don't know if it'll turn
out, but I guess we'll see.

103
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,626
- And if you guys think
you know what costume Missy

104
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:44,406
is making right now let us know
down below in the comments,

105
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:46,849
what your guess is and
maybe you'll be right.

106
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:48,102
- [Finley] Hi!

107
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,539
- [Bryan Voiceover] Hi
Finn! What are you doin?

108
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,493
- Pop.

109
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:52,777
- [Bryan Voiceover] You eatin' a pop-tart?

110
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:53,610
- Yeah.

111
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,670
- [Bryan Voiceover] Finn
misses his brother, don't you?

112
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,830
- (mumbles)

113
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,023
- [Bryan Voiceover]
Yeah, Ollie's at school.

114
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:03,345
He's been running around
with swords and stuff all day

115
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,737
wanting to battle and
I'm like, You need Ollie.

116
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:07,408
Just wait a little, just
a couple more hours, and

117
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:09,121
Ollie will be out of school okay?

118
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:09,954
- (baby mumbles)

119
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:10,862
- [Bryan Voiceover] Then
you can play with him.

120
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:12,768
Hey can I have a bite of that pop-tart?

121
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:14,767
(exaggerates bite)

122
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,606
(Bryan laughs)

123
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,254
- [Bryan Voiceover] So we
got a couple of new additions

124
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:20,244
to the fish tank last night.

125
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:22,661
One of them being a starfish!

126
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:26,583
Look at our starfish you
guys. He has seven arms.

127
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,606
Yes, that's right. Seven arms.

128
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,124
And uh, he's got a little
bit of sand on him.

129
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,989
But he's been moving like crazy. Hi dude!

130
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,909
We got a couple of really
cool aninami's and coral

131
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,855
and stuff that move.

132
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:39,662
So there's one, we have one up
there that I think literally

133
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:42,575
has already doubled in
size, which is crazy.

134
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,908
Check out that one you guys.

135
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:46,886
That one.

136
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,740
We also got a really cool fire angelfish,

137
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,056
but he was just put in,
so he's a little shy.

138
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:55,230
It takes like a week or
two for the fish to really

139
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,939
start coming out and like
interacting with other fish.

140
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,730
Can't seem to find him you guys.

141
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,289
He's hiding pretty good.

142
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,611
The craziest thing happened tho today

143
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:06,818
with the take and I want to tell you guys.

144
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:09,454
Ollie woke up this morning
and he saw his red shrimp

145
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:11,491
sitting in the sand,
didn't look very good.

146
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:13,411
He was very afraid that he may have died.

147
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:15,574
Missy said, "Don't worry,
he's just sleeping."

148
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:16,946
She didn't know what happened.

149
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:21,113
Turns out, his red shrimp Kai
just molted his exoskeleton!

150
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:27,970
So this is actually the
exoskeleton of his shrimp Kai

151
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,321
and he shed it, because
that's what shrimp do.

152
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:35,122
And I had no idea that
it included the legs,

153
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:37,924
the antenna, everything.

154
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:40,670
- [Missy] It's really
just a little shrimp--

155
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,604
- [Bryan] But with no body.
It's like his armor. (laughs)

156
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,177
- I literally was like, oh no I did that.

157
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,307
No it's just sleeping,
it's just taking a nap.

158
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,404
He's like okay.

159
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:51,531
- [Bryan Voiceover] Yeah,
I saw the two shrimp

160
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,543
and then I saw this and
I was like uh-oh did he

161
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:55,540
put in another shrimp last
night and not tell us?

162
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,932
And it died?
It died?

163
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:58,715
I'm like, how does two
shrimp turn into three?

164
00:05:58,715 --> 00:05:59,548
- [Missy] Yeah.

165
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:00,381
- [Bryan] That's how you guys.

166
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,243
- Yeah, no I was literally--
So crazy!

167
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:03,868
- And then I just like had an epiphany.

168
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:06,937
Like I wonder if it's not--
Yeah.

169
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:09,461
- So I googled it and like oh
my god it's just the shell.

170
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,242
- [Bryan Voiceover] It's
cool that it's bright red,

171
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,157
even though, cause a lot
of shrimp moltings are

172
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:14,511
just like clear.

173
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,386
- Yeah. Pretty cool. I wonder
if they would have ate it,

174
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:17,219
if we left it in there?

175
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:18,999
- [Bryan Voiceover] I don't know. Maybe.

176
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:22,020
This guy likes to eat for sure. (laughs)

177
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,458
- [Missy] You guys, it
feels so good today!

178
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,255
It's definitely not
cold, but it's not hot.

179
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:29,951
Yesterday and the day before
were like 100 degrees.

180
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:32,362
It just feels so nice today.

181
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:35,243
I'm actually headed in to get Ollie.

182
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:37,175
Um, Finn is sleeping in the car.

183
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:41,347
My mom is watching him, cause
she's just come along with me.

184
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,352
So it worked out cause
he's sleeping, and I don't

185
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,058
have to like wake him up and bring him in.

186
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:47,754
But I'm super excited to see Ollie.

187
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:50,158
And I am so excited to
eat cause I am so hungry!

188
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:52,177
I've been working all
day, and I need food.

189
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,760
(gentle music)

190
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:05,349
- [Missy Voiceover] Hey bud.
Hi. Did you have a good nap?

191
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:14,050
Hi bud!

192
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,883
- [Ollie] Hi

193
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,352
- Did you have a fun day at school?

194
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,185
- Good.

195
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,680
- Did you have fun, um,
having papa drop you off?

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,423
- Yeah, but--
Is it so cool?

197
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:24,256
But what did papa up at our house?

198
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,664
- Papa's at home, but I can pick you up.

199
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:30,001
Pretty cool, huh?

200
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,705
You were sleepin' huh?

201
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:32,538
- Mmhm

202
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:34,209
Alright I'm gonna check you out, okay?

203
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,955
So, Ollie did you learn about U's today?

204
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:37,867
- Yeah.

205
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,463
- And you drew these U's!

206
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:40,296
- [Ollie] Mmhm.

207
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:42,163
- And you, what start's with a U?

208
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:42,996
- Um

209
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,222
- Umbrella?

210
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:46,703
- Umbrella

211
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:48,224
- Unicorn?

212
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:49,261
- Unicorn.

213
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,953
- How was it sharing
your little unicorn head?

214
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:52,786
- Good.

215
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:53,857
- Did the kids like it?

216
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:54,690
- Yeah.

217
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,905
- That's so neat huh?

218
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:59,657
- [Missy] Well hey there
Finn, are we going shopping?

219
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:03,824
So ya, me and Finn are going
shopping for some things

220
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:08,025
because if you don't know
it's almost his birthday!

221
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:10,892
He's eating a hamburger
right now from McDonalds

222
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:14,203
cause he was a hungry boy. Awe. (laughs)

223
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:17,018
And my mom and Ollie are
at a kid's clothing store

224
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,810
looking for something that I needed for

225
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,715
Finn's Halloween costume.

226
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:24,763
Really trying to work as fast as possible

227
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:27,895
on a lot of this stuff,
so we're basically killing

228
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:30,384
two birds with one stone;
which is always cool.

229
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,111
But now we gotta get some
party stuff for you, huh?

230
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,770
You ready to party?

231
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,602
(baby mumbles)

232
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:35,782
How old are you gonna be?

233
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,784
(mumbles)

234
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:37,924
Say two!

235
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:38,965
- Two!

236
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,559
Two!

237
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,488
- [Missy Voiceover] Awe! Are
you so excited to see Ollie?

238
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,225
You missed him, huh?

239
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,266
- Yeah.

240
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,283
- You guys are so cute!

241
00:08:48,283 --> 00:08:51,171
Ollie, you wanna know something
interesting? Lemme show you.

242
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:53,494
Remember how this morning
we found your shrimp

243
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,625
and it looked like he was taking a nap.

244
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,345
And you were kinda worried about him, huh?

245
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:58,178
- Mmhm.

246
00:08:58,178 --> 00:08:59,011
- Well, guess what?

247
00:08:59,011 --> 00:08:59,844
- What?

248
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:04,091
- We found him! That's not
him though. That's his shell.

249
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:07,139
He took his shell off
and he's still alive.

250
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,960
He's still in there. See,
there's Kai right there.

251
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,152
- (mumbles)

252
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,403
- That's just his shell.

253
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:16,642
Basically, he grew out
of his little outfit so

254
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:19,038
he took it off and he's got a new one on.

255
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,272
Isn't that crazy?

256
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:21,105
- Yeah.

257
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:24,707
- Cause that's not him,
that's just like his outfit.

258
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:26,087
- That's his shell?

259
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,688
- Mmhm, that's his shell.

260
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:30,314
Do you wanna see him inside there?

261
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:31,882
Look.

262
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:32,730
Do you see him?

263
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,608
- I wanna see.

264
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:36,396
- Oh look, he's over there.

265
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:39,228
We thought he was taking a
nap, but that was just his

266
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:41,262
shell he took off.

267
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:42,612
How neat, huh?

268
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:43,445
- Yeah.

269
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,135
I'm gonna go and throw him in the trash.

270
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:47,615
- No. Just leave it there. (laughs)

271
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,425
He's like, um.. that's kinda gross.

272
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:52,008
- Ollie isn't that such good
news that your shrimp is okay?

273
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,172
- Mmhm.

274
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,003
- You thought he died, huh?

275
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:57,071
Yeah, but he's okay!

276
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:59,068
It's just a cool thing that
shrimp's do, apparently.

277
00:09:59,068 --> 00:09:59,977
(laughing)

278
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:02,688
Did you guys know that? That
shrimps can molt their skin.

279
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:04,866
I think that's crazy or
their exoskeleton. Huh?

280
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,048
And you're playing with another fish.

281
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,293
What are you playing with now?

282
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:10,232
- Um, a sea-diver and a saw.

283
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:11,619
- Yeah, that's so cool.

284
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:14,172
(mumbles)

285
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:17,119
Where did you get this cool
little submarine thing?

286
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:20,612
- Um, Coleman picked it
out for me last time.

287
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:22,741
- Oh he did? Oh that's so cool!

288
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:25,184
So you have like a cool
little submarine and

289
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:28,066
this is Kai and he's
wearing a diving suit.

290
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:30,192
Why do you have Kai from
Ninjago wearing this suit

291
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,763
and not the diver guy?

292
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:34,096
- (mumbles)

293
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:39,290
- Oh, I see. I see.

294
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,123
And then you have a--
It has claws!

295
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,739
- Whoa, it has claws?

296
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,572
- Mmhm.

297
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,213
- That's so cool. And then
you have like a cool shark.

298
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,579
- Mmhm, it's a baby shark.

299
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,524
- It's a baby great white shark. Huh?

300
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:48,357
- Yeah.

301
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,914
- Yeah, that's pretty cool. (laughs)

302
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:51,134
How was your day?

303
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:51,967
- Good.

304
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:52,800
- Did you have a good day at school?

305
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,633
- Yeah.

306
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:54,643
- Yeah. What'd you share?

307
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:56,371
- Um, my unicorn head.

308
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,051
- Unicorn head! That's so cool!

309
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,734
- [Missy Voiceover] Alright boys!

310
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,759
Guess who's here?

311
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,994
Mimi and Papa!

312
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:05,321
(children squealing)

313
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,493
(Missy laughs)

314
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:09,061
That's right, Mimi and Papa
are here cause Mommy and Daddy

315
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:10,924
are going on a date!

316
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:12,155
We're going out tonight.

317
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,522
We actually have a
friend of ours birthday.

318
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:14,627
You guys know her.

319
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:17,425
Crystal, who does a lot
of our photography shoots.

320
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:18,299
(cat noises)

321
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,254
He's a kitty cat right now.

322
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:20,829
Yeah, we're going out
and I'm real excited.

323
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:24,336
So, these boys are gonna
hangout with Mimi and Papa

324
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,535
and then go night night, huh?

325
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,593
- Meow.

326
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:29,044
- [Missy] And they just
turned into kittens.

327
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,070
That's it.

328
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,654
(Missy laughs)

329
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:32,999
But anyways, I think we
are gonna go ahead and

330
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,523
end the blog before we head out.

331
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:36,610
So, make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up!

332
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,818
Hey, give thumbs up, kitty cats!

333
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:40,348
Thumbs up kitty cats!

334
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:41,589
(meow)

335
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,210
Oh, look up.

336
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,004
Can you give a thumbs up kitty cat Finn?

337
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:47,311
Oh my goodness.

338
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:50,728

339
