1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:01,199
- Lay down

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,671
- [Bryan] Uh huh, and then what do you do?

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,096
- Oh I'm hungry.

4
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:06,658
I want me some food.

5
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:08,241
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

6
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:11,405
- [Bryan] Is your foot
eating dinner for you?

7
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:12,238
- Yeah.

- Good morning!
- Good morning.

20
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:36,599
- Hey guys good morning.

21
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,632
We are headed out of
the house this morning.

22
00:00:38,632 --> 00:00:40,290
The kids are with Mimi and Papa

23
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,486
and we are going to?

24
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:43,828
- The ranch.

25
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:44,768
- We're goin' to the ranch.

26
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:45,947
We're gonna go see some horses.

27
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,746
And actually Missy is going
to be doing a little lesson

28
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:51,110
to brush her up on all her horse skills.

29
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,675
- I mean I've been in lessons
before and I know how to ride.

30
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:55,461
And and I know everything but I told her,

31
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,343
I just wanna start like from the beginning

32
00:00:57,343 --> 00:00:58,928
and just really get into it all.

33
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:01,214
Because I am gonna be
getting a horse very soon.

34
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:02,760
I think I might have found the one.

35
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,644
And I just wanna be like,

36
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:06,727
totally like, oh yeah,
I know how to do this

37
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:07,953
when the horse comes.

38
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:09,533
- It's gonna be cool for me to see it too

39
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,676
just 'cause like I have
no experience with horses.

40
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:14,259
I don't even know how
fully comfortable I am

41
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,184
around horses still.

42
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,958
I'm gonna observe and Missy's
gonna do all the work.

43
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:18,989
- Maybe you can hop on too,

44
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:19,947
I think that'd be fun.

45
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,882
I'm a little nervous actually because

46
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,559
I've always been horses
and I'm comfortable.

47
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:27,476
But I hope it all comes back to me.

48
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:32,757
(gentle music)

49
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:35,409
- [Bryan] So this morning,
Missy is gonna hop on Rusty

50
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,383
and we have Felicia here.

51
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:38,989
And what are you doing?

52
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,237
- Dutch braiding.

53
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:42,120
- Dutch braiding.
- Isn't that beautiful?

54
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,253
- His tail.

55
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,171
That is crazy.
- I'm upset,

56
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,236
like I have to learn
to do that on my horse.

57
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:47,467
- I don't mind teaching
you and I can teach

58
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,361
you how to fish tail and french braid.

59
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,126
- I already told Michelle
she's my hairstylist

60
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:56,426
and she's like, can I fish tail her braid,

61
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:57,414
on her tail like yeah, go for it.

62
00:01:57,414 --> 00:01:58,480
- [Bryan] That is so funny.

63
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,549
You ready to hop on here?

64
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,716
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

65
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:12,093
- Billy is living his best life y'all.

66
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:16,237
Look at him layin' down with
his legs all spread out,

67
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,846
just eatin' some grub.

68
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,080
What's up dude?

69
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,191
Oh I'm sorry I didn't
mean to make you get up.

70
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:25,353
He's like okay I'll stretch.

71
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,770
(soft music)

72
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,277
I looked away for one
second and Missy hopped up

73
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,290
on that horse, like a pro.

74
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,457
(gentle upbeat music)

75
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,011
Missy is doing so good.

76
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,991
She is now starting to trot a little bit.

77
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,241
She looks so good up there.

78
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:18,919
(inspirational music)

79
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:36,935
Finn!

80
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:39,920
What are you doin' here buddy?

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,860
Are you here to see mama on the horse?

82
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,009
- Yep.
- Yeah.

83
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,441
I like your boots.

84
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,827
Hey big guy and my other
big guy how are you?

85
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,073
You wanna see mama on the horse?

86
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:49,997
- Yeah.

87
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,701
- [Bryan] She's been
riding around on the horse.

88
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,034
Isn't that cool?

89
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:00,400
Can you say horse?

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,259
- Horse.
(giggling)

91
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,176
- [Bryan] Say hi Rusty.

92
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:06,693
- How you doin' up there?

93
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,339
Feel good huh?

94
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,073
- I'm trying to get him to trot.

95
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:13,701
- Yeah Rusty's being a little lazy today.

96
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,660
- [Bryan] That's probably good.

97
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,925
A good started.

98
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,010
Say hi.

99
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,313
- [Missy] You wanna watch mama ride?

100
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:21,199
You guys look like little cowboys.

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,497
- That's your mom.
- I know.

102
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:23,469
- [Missy] Plaid.

103
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:24,516
- I dressed 'em up.

104
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,746
- [Bryan] All right the boys
are hangin' on the fence

105
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,736
watchin' mama ride the horse huh.

106
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,881
That's pretty cool.

107
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:33,547
Feelin' like a cowboy?

108
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,964
(soft music)

109
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,882
Lunch on the ranch huh boys?

110
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:55,661
Look at 'em sittin' up here,

111
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,733
eatin' their peanut butter and jellies.

112
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,917
Make sure the pig doesn't
eat that sandwich okay?

113
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:01,840
- Kay.

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,007
- [Bryan] You gotta eat your sandwich.

115
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,880
Whoa Ollie, look at you dude.

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,797
- Good job.

117
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:17,128
- You're so brave Ollie.

118
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:20,365
This is so cute.

119
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:22,020
The boys have been so
in to like cowboy hats

120
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,559
and cowboy boots lately.

121
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,061
I did not expect Ollie to just

122
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,188
jump up on that horse with Missy.

123
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:27,363
Even me, I'm a little skeptical.

124
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:28,772
I'm like, no thanks.

125
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:31,605
And Ollie's like yeah, sure, cool.

126
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:34,437
You havin' fun Ollie?

127
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:36,870
It's really high up huh.

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,203
(tranquil upbeat music)

129
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:57,876
Good job Ollie.

130
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:00,453
- You wanna give him a pat?
- Thanks Rusty.

131
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:03,451
- You wanna give him a treat?

132
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:04,928
- [Bryan] There you go.

133
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:06,078
Good job dude.

134
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:07,397
Say thank you Rusty.

135
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:08,398
- Thank you Rusty.

136
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:10,194
- [Bryan] You're gonna go up too Finn?

137
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:11,120
- Yeah.

138
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,041
- [Bryan] Okay.

139
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:12,967
- Are you ready?

140
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,172
Yeah you're ready huh.

141
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,238
- [Mama] I think this one's
a little more adventurous.

142
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:19,209
- [Bryan] Yeah, Finn is our brave one.

143
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,126
Whoa there you go dude!

144
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,203
- Whoa!

145
00:06:24,203 --> 00:06:25,137
You ready to go?

146
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:26,061
Kick him.

147
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,440
Say let's go Rusty.

148
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,793
Let's go.

149
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:29,876
Say go Rusty.

150
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:34,586
(upbeat music)

151
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,957
- Alrightys.

152
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:02,707
Good boy Rusty.
- Yay!

153
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,353
Good job Finn.

154
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:06,593
How was that babe?

155
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,517
- It was fun.

156
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:09,573
My legs got a little
wobbly when I got off.

157
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,206
- [Bryan] Yeah she kinda fell off.

158
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:12,215
- Yeah it was really fun.

159
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,839
I definitely have some muscle to build up.

160
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,514
Hi, did you have fun on him?

161
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:19,449
Say thank you Rusty.

162
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,032
(upbeat music)

163
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:31,222
All right I am back from the ranch.

164
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,019
And I had such a blast getting kind

165
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,395
of freshened up on everything.

166
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:36,853
I feel really good about the lesson.

167
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:39,176
I feel like I have a good understanding.

168
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:41,528
And I actually love
that she kinda taught me

169
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,452
some new stuff.

170
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:44,224
She's actually a English rider.

171
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,759
And I've always done Western.

172
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,117
And I feel like we were doing Western.

173
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:50,361
But as you can tell I've
kind of like picked up

174
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,255
a few English items.

175
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:54,895
For instance if you're
a horse person at all.

176
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,107
I was wearing English riding boots,

177
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:57,039
which I've never done.

178
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,139
Which were really
comfortable and pretty cute.

179
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,765
I was wearing and I still
am wearing these English

180
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:04,684
riding pants, which are so comfortable.

181
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,204
And I was even doing a lot of posting

182
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:09,937
while I was trotting,
which I have never done.

183
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,768
I've always just been like bouncing around

184
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:13,431
as a Western rider.

185
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:14,888
I've definitely learned some stuff.

186
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,161
And I was like wow this is really cool.

187
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,084
This is really fun.

188
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:19,275
I'm excited to even
learn more and continue.

189
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:22,475
I'll probably continue just
doing weekly lessons with her.

190
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:26,185
But I'll continue riding my
horse throughout that time.

191
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,298
'Cause I feel like I've
got a good handle on it.

192
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:31,083
It'll just be nice to continue lessons.

193
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,493
But these boys wanna go swimmin'.

194
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:33,419
Should we go in the hot tub?

195
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,343
- [Together] Yeah.

196
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:35,267
- And boy do I need it.

197
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,241
I am so, so sore.

198
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,561
I stumbled a little as I got off the horse

199
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,755
and then I put Finn down
for a nap when I got home

200
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,348
and I stumbled off of
the bed and actually fell

201
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,836
and like heard both my ankles snap.

202
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:49,997
I think I'm still just super weak.

203
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,104
Even after riding hours ago

204
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:55,681
and I just totally like
rolled both my ankles.

205
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,601
They're not, I don't know
if I rolled them but,

206
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:59,116
it hurt.

207
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:00,264
And they still do hurt.

208
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:01,373
So I'm gonna go get in the hot tub

209
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:02,822
just to soak a little bit.

210
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,258
'Cause I'm sure I'm gonna be pretty sore

211
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:05,608
over the next few days.

212
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:06,916
All right, should we get in the hot tub?

213
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,840
- Yeah.

214
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,763
- Let's do it.

215
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:10,485
All right we are done swimming

216
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:11,516
and we had a great time.

217
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:12,829
We were just kinda sitting
in the hot tub hanging out

218
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:15,991
and no we are making a
little family dinner.

219
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:19,101
We are makin' breakfast for dinner.

220
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,538
- Eggs.
- Pancakes.

221
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:21,504
- Ready.
- Yeah!

222
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:24,057
- Those ones are ready.
- Those ones are ready.

223
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,325
We're makin' some sausage.
- Can I touch them?

224
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:26,158
- Sure.

225
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,843
- [Bryan] How's it feel?

226
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,241
- I say it feels warm.

227
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,074
(giggling)

228
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:31,987
- All right let's

229
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:32,911
keep it warm.
- Keep it warm.

230
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,908
- We are actually all sit
down and eat some dinner

231
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,175
which we don't really do a lot.

232
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,112
We're gonna try and get back
into the habit of doing it.

233
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:40,853
I'm trying to really
fix that little habit.

234
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,481
And then I think me and
Bryan are actually headed to

235
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,584
Kelsey and Corbin's tonight.

236
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,703
We actually have some
leftover Christmas presents

237
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:47,632
from my parents.

238
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:49,651
And a birthday present for Corbin that

239
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:50,575
we never gave him.

240
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,923
So we're gonna go hang out
there and have some fun

241
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,192
and all that.

242
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,663
But these boys are gonna go to bed.

243
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,651
They already got their jammies on.

244
00:09:57,651 --> 00:10:00,088
Hey dude, are you tiered?

245
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,011
- No.
(laughing)

246
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,866
- [Missy] Are you tired?

247
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:03,789
- Nope.

248
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:08,033
- [Bryan] Finn loves the
sausage and eggs and pancakes.

249
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,771
Our kids are eatin' so good.

250
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:11,825
We're having like the best dinner ever.

251
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:12,749
- It's really good.

252
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:13,924
- I love pancakes for dinner, honestly.

253
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:15,228
It's one of my faves.

254
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:16,746
- Lay down.

255
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,376
- [Bryan] Uh huh and then what do you do?

256
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,459
- I'm hungry.

257
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:22,041
I want me some food.

258
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,811
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

259
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:26,787

260
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:27,988
- Yeah!

261
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:30,107
(laughing)

262
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:33,567
- [Bryan] That is so funny dude.

263
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,648
- Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

264
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,774
- All right you guys

265
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:40,168
We are puttin' the boys to bed.

266
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:41,822
