1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,000
- And look at poor little Finn.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
He's still just the tiredest--

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,833
- Boo!

4
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:05,830
- Grumpiest baby.

5
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:06,663
- Boo!

6
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:07,916
- This one's not grumpy, huh?

18
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:29,460
Good morning!

19
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,820
It is a beautiful, crisp, cold morning.

20
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,160
And I have a busy, busy day
ahead of me, but I'm excited!

21
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,475
It's gonna be a fun day, as you can see.

22
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:39,769
I'm in my riding clothes.

23
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:40,890
I'm going riding.

24
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,740
So I feel like today's
vlog is actually gonna be

25
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,800
kind of a day in the life,
not a normal day in my life,

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,500
but a day in the life of my life.

27
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,260
Because, one, I am using this spare camera

28
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,435
which actually has a crack in it.

29
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:54,253
My voice is so bad,
guys, I sound ridiculous.

30
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:56,733
And this camera doesn't have a strap,

31
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,309
so it'll be amazing if this camera

32
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,350
doesn't like fall and break.

33
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,636
'Cause I have to put that
on my wrist all the time.

34
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:05,877
But anyways, before I go riding today,

35
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:08,070
I'm actually getting a Brazilian Blowout,

36
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,600
and if you don't know or haven't noticed,

37
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,765
my hair is like really hard to manage.

38
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:13,597
It's not any harder than
probably any other person's hair

39
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:15,699
who is like curly, frizzy, like ugh,

40
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,720
but I'm also super challenged at it.

41
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,170
Like, I can't do my hair, so I'm getting

42
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,122
a Brazilian Blowout, and
that just relaxes my hair

43
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:25,090
and calms it down so that
when I do go to do it,

44
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,244
it's not as difficult.

45
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:29,890
So first things first,
Brazilian Blowout, then horse.

46
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,723
And...

47
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,556
Voila!

48
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:33,460
I have straight, straight hair right now.

49
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,929
With the Brazilian, I can
actually wash it when I get home,

50
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,851
and it'll just be a lot calmer,
and it won't be hard to,

51
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:42,350
like, not make look so crazy.

52
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,850
Like, I can actually let it
air dry, which is really nice.

53
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,986
So, yay, thank you Michelle, once again.

54
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:49,780
She's my hair lady, hair genius.

55
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,767
Look at me, I'm going riding, woo-hoo!

56
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,480
We just had a little bit of a
scuffle getting the bridle on.

57
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,950
He just, sometimes I'm
like, just a little rude,

58
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,500
and I don't always know how
to say, stop it! (chuckles)

59
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,280
But we finally got it, huh?

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,095
We are gonna ride for a
bit, and then he's actually

61
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:10,160
getting a massage today, huh?

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,301
And then once he gets a massage,
he actually can't be ridden

63
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,960
for, like, all of the rest of
the day and then the next day.

64
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,571
So I just gotta ride him one more time.

65
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,880
The arena's a little
wet, so gotta be careful,

66
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,110
but it should be just
a fun, fun little ride

67
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,610
before you get your massage.

68
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,010
Sound good?

69
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,120
I've been trotting around a little bit,

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,720
and it is definitely a little slippery,

71
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,580
so I gotta be careful.

72
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,870
Also, I forgot my helmet.

73
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,860
We're probably just gonna walk,

74
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,130
maybe trot a little bit, not too much.

75
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,114
But yeah, he's so good, guys.

76
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,234
We've come so far in the last two months.

77
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:42,010
Just like, kind of bonding, and learning

78
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,896
each other's cues, and what we want.

79
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,782
And he's relaxed, definitely a lot,

80
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:48,350
but he still definitely has work to do,

81
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,183
just like I do.

82
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:51,110
He still needs muscle, and he likes

83
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,954
to keep his head really high.

84
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:55,610
Oh, right now he's
relaxing, which is nice.

85
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,804
But it's just been such
a fun little experience,

86
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:00,970
and I'm just enjoying
having a horse so much.

87
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,050
But yeah, we're just gonna trot around,

88
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,403
and loving, loving, loving
English, which is so funny,

89
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:08,290
'cause I was like, I want a Western horse,

90
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,817
and I want to trail, and I love Western,

91
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,762
but definitely love
English, so for all of you

92
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:13,195
who are like, "You should try English."

93
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:15,283
Well, I did, and I loved it.

94
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:18,429
The ground is very wet,
so that's like the wettest

95
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,340
it is right there, but you can see,

96
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,810
it's just like very mushy, slippery.

97
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,875
The trail would be so nice today,

98
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,810
but don't really have time for that.

99
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,830
'Cause he's getting a massage,

100
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,916
he's a spoiled little
horsey, so. (chuckles)

101
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,749
He's so funny, too, 'cause he knows

102
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,910
when I want to go over to that stand,

103
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,930
'cause that's where my phone is,

104
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,594
my water is, my camera is,
so he'll often just walk

105
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,100
over there, like, you wanna
stop and stay here? (chuckles)

106
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,431
All right, I'm gonna set up and see

107
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,924
if I can ride around a little bit.

108
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,674
(pleasant music)

109
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,380
Slipped a little there, huh?

110
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,883
Slipped a little.

111
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:18,633
(pleasant music)

112
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,970
Isn't he so cute? Aww.

113
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,760
He's so funny, he knows that I want to go

114
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,640
straight to my camera
right now. (chuckles)

115
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,700
So I don't think I just
caught that on camera,

116
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,814
but the camera was set
up, and I was walking

117
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:39,330
pretty far down to the arena,
and he's doing really good,

118
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,402
I definitely felt him slide a couple times

119
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:44,560
'cause of the, when he's
turning, and the ground's

120
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,500
just a little mush, I
just have to be careful.

121
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,840
He always spooks at
this windmill over here,

122
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,896
and it's so annoying.

123
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,737
He's actually spooked so bad once

124
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:56,248
that I like got control
of him pretty quickly,

125
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:59,510
but then he spooked again,
because he was like,

126
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,977
still totally freaked out about
it, and I totally fell off.

127
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:05,690
(laughs) It's the first time
I've ever fallen off a horse.

128
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,690
It was probably one of
the most graceful falls,

129
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,440
'cause I was like,
spooked, I was like okay,

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,654
lost my balance a little
bit, spooked again,

131
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:13,280
I was like, all right, I'm just gonna go,

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,180
and I just like fell on my butt.

133
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,630
But he just spooked again so
hard because of this windmill.

134
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,830
I'm gonna zoom in and show you.

135
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,343
The wind is already scary
enough to these horses.

136
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:26,300
When the wind blows, that
thing starts blowing harder,

137
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,133
and he hates it!

138
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,920
He did not like the
windmill just a second ago,

139
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,008
and spooked pretty hard, but I'm not sure

140
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:33,870
if you guys saw it on camera.

141
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,550
I'll have to go back and
check, but yeah, he's like,

142
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,970
"Can we be done now?

143
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,640
"I don't like the windmill,
and I've slid a couple times."

144
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,608
So I'm gonna put him away, and get ready

145
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,270
for our massage, yay!

146
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,830
Nacho, are you gonna open the gate?

147
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,380
Show me, there you go.

148
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,830
He's so funny.

149
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,340
All right, Nacho is officially
getting his massage.

150
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,940
This is Claire, and she
has taught me so much

151
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,630
about horses and their muscles,

152
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,040
and how important it is to get massages.

153
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,430
And you might think that's like crazy,

154
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,429
but it has done wonders.

155
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:08,421
You can watch, she'll put pressure,

156
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,405
just a little pressure on like her back,

157
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,827
and he just like, shivers
'cause of the pain.

158
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:14,435
- [Claire] And I work
it out, so there's not,

159
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:15,570
no longer there.

160
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,942
- Yeah, so she works out
all his aches and pains,

161
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,110
and then he just behaves so much better

162
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,420
once we're riding, huh?

163
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,263
He's actually pretty good,
he's not like too bad off,

164
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:25,359
but there's another horse in here that,

165
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,903
when he gets a massage, he kicks

166
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,530
'cause he's just in so much pain,

167
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,199
but by the time he is done, totally fine.

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,118
Perfect.

169
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:34,868
(pleasant music)

170
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:50,230
All right, he's all done!

171
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,495
I didn't get a chance to show you in pain,

172
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,400
but it's like all good now.

173
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,103
- [Claire] No twitching.

174
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:56,060
- Look at that, yeah, before it was,

175
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,750
like, all twitchy and crazy.

176
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,750
He was kind of being a little brat,

177
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,260
but (chuckling) he's happy now.

178
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,600
Yeah (chuckles), thank you!

179
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,730
All right, I am now back with
the boys and check it out!

180
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,265
We just had lunch together, huh?

181
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:10,098
- [Ollie] Yeah.

182
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:12,825
- I just had something funny
that I noticed about Finn.

183
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:15,065
You know, it's just Dad life, it's fine.

184
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:17,160
He's wearing a nine-month jacket.

185
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,993
- Yeah.

186
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:18,826
- [Missy] And Ollie's shoes.

187
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:19,659
- [Bryan] Yeah.

188
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:20,492
- [Missy] (laughs) Couldn't find shoes,

189
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:21,370
couldn't find a jacket.

190
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,620
- It's the world we live in.

191
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,340
- Sometimes things just
aren't where they are,

192
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,680
and so he's like, "All
right, just gonna grab 'em."

193
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,790
- They just need to have one
size fits all for all kids.

194
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,623
- [Missy] They really do.

195
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:29,578
- And they can just throw--

196
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:30,930
- [Missy] They should make like shoes

197
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,810
adjustable to, like, kid's sizes.

198
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,643
- [Bryan] Uh-oh!

199
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:35,992
- Wait a second, am I just
coming up with a genius idea?

200
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:38,181
'Kay, I think that needs to be a thing.

201
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:41,180
Adjustable shoe sizes. (laughs)

202
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,258
So the boys are actually gonna stay here

203
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:46,283
while me and Bryan go
on a little day date,

204
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:48,943
and Auntie is gonna come pick you up,

205
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:53,230
and take you on a fun
little adventure, huh?

206
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,560
And Mommy and Daddy are
gonna go on a fun date, 'kay?

207
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,466
You guys all have to
check out Cassie's channel

208
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,642
to see how her day goes,
'cause she's actually

209
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,450
going to have four kids.

210
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,610
It's gonna be interesting, but anyways.

211
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,130
'Kay, you guys have a fun day, okay?

212
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,963
- [Ollie] Okay.

213
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:05,950
- [Missy] Have fun with Auntie.

214
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,783
Oh, look at that.

215
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:07,620
Have fun with Auntie.

216
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,453
- Okay.

217
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:11,501
- First up on our day
date is pedicures, yay!

218
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:12,334
- Yeah.

219
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,420
- And this is where me
and Kelsey usually go,

220
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,858
and they gave us, like
our own private room

221
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:18,025
so we can talk.

222
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,970
- Nice warm neck pillow.

223
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,840
- [Missy] I know, and tea.

224
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,876
I think we need to do this more often.

225
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:26,738
- Uh, yeah, I'm not gonna say no to that.

226
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:27,700
- [Missy] (chuckles)

227
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,920
We're having a nice time relaxing,

228
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,400
and I think the boys are having a blast.

229
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:36,640
All right, dinner is
basically done. (laughs)

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,110
- We did it, we conquered dinner.

231
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,616
It's always a good feeling
when you conquer dinner.

232
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:43,460
- We had pedicures, and dinner,

233
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,770
and we're like, this is so weird.

234
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,470
We've never done this during the daytime.

235
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,303
We normally, like--

236
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:49,840
- Missy's like, "Do you wanna
hop over to Hobby Lobby?"

237
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,886
I'm like, "Hey, let's get lit!" (laughs)

238
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:54,173
- My sister still,
she's been with the kids

239
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:56,090
at a playground for three hours.

240
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,966
I don't know how she's
doing it, but she's like,

241
00:08:57,966 --> 00:09:00,070
"Yeah, I think we're
gonna do something else."

242
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,100
I'm like, "Okay, we're
gonna go to dinner then."

243
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,744
- Yeah, she will never go back
to that playground, though.

244
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,577
- Yeah--

245
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,060
- That's too long to
be there for one time.

246
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,460
- Who stays there for three hours?

247
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,900
- Then you never go
back, 'cause you hate it.

248
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,530
- I'm like there for an
hour, and then I'm like,

249
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,656
"Hey kids, it's time to go.

250
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,320
"It's time to go." (chuckles)

251
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,980
But yeah, we've had a
really, really fun day, huh?

252
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,246
- Yeah, it's been really cool hanging out.

253
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:19,079
- So fun.

254
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,460
But yeah, we are totally
going to Hobby Lobby.

255
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,340
- Okay, let's go!

256
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,342
- Because I really want
to go to Hobby Lobby.

257
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:23,650
(chuckles) So let's go!

258
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,610
We are back from our
date, and I gotta say,

259
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,960
this has been an interesting vlog,

260
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,960
I've been the only one to
hold the camera and vlog.

261
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,760
And there hasn't been a
lot of other people in it,

262
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,593
other than Bryan.

263
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:34,862
I am now home, I am getting
the kids some water,

264
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:36,580
and they're taking a bath.

265
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,160
They've been playing all
day, and they are filthy.

266
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,014
So I'm doing bath time,
and then it's bedtime.

267
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:46,832
I have got the tiredest, silliest,

268
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:48,790
cutest little baby right here.

269
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,623
(Finn groaning)

270
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,419
Are you the tiredest baby?

271
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,210
(Finn whining)

272
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,760
Yes, he is. (softly chuckles)

273
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,290
Ollie, how much fun did
you have with Auntie today?

274
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,303
- A lot of fun.

275
00:09:58,303 --> 00:09:59,512
- [Missy] A lot of fun?

276
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:00,462
And what did you do?

277
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:03,702
- I went to Uptown Jungle.

278
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:06,480
- [Missy] Oh wow, and so
you went to a playground,

279
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,700
you played, played,
played, played, played?

280
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,524
- Yeah, but I didn't go rock climbing,

281
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:11,656
which I really wanted.

282
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,900
- And look at poor little Finn.

283
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,646
He's still just the tiredest--

284
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:16,710
- Boo!

285
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,543
- Grumpiest baby.

286
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:18,550
- Boo!

287
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,105
- This one's not grumpy, huh?

288
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:22,772
(relaxed music)

289
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,150
And that's how Momma does it.

290
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,557
Both kids are asleep, and I am so ready

291
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,720
to just veg out on the couch.

292
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,973
Bryan's actually playing
video games right now,

293
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:47,030
but I'm gonna get some snacks,

294
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,260
and we're gonna watch a movie.

295
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,430
And it's just so nice to be home

296
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,940
after a very, very busy day.

297
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,517
It was kind of like
nonstop, but it was fun,

298
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:56,500
it was fun, fun day.

299
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,300
Not the usual, but super
fun, and so awesome

300
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,330
that my sister took the kids for us,

301
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,730
and me and Bryan just got
to have a fun day out.

302
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,910
But anyways, I'm gonna go
ahead and end this video.

303
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,220
Let me know what you thought of this.

304
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,440
This was kind of like a video that's

305
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,520
like all about me, I guess.

306
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,590
But anyways, I hope you enjoyed it.

307
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,067
Let me know down in the
comments if you enjoyed it.

308
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,927
Let me know if you're
a mom, and if you would

309
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,370
like to see more stuff like this.

310
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm super interested.

311
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,314
But for now, I will see
you guys in our next video.

312
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:27,527
Bye!

313
00:11:27,527 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
