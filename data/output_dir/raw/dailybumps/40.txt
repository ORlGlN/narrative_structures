1
00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:01,478
- To Disney!
- Yay!

2
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:03,849
- [Bryan] Yay! Disney!

3
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:05,960
We're gonna climb that
mountain together, buddy.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,723
You and I are going on the bobsled.

5
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:11,640
(upbeat pop music)

6
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,312
(steady dance music)

7
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:37,234
- We're going to Disneyland!

8
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:38,474
- That is right!

9
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:40,829
We are taking both the boys to Disneyland.

10
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:41,785
Both boys are getting

11
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:43,464
(ding)
the most amazing nap ever.

12
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:44,742
Oh! Is that, is that a wake face?

13
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:47,234
(Missy whispers)

14
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:49,069
Finn's just started opening his eyes.

15
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,501
Oh hi Finn!

16
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,392
- Hi!

17
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:52,869
- [Bryan] How was your nap?

18
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:53,901
- Good.
- [Bryan] Good?

19
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:55,787
Are you digging for treasure?

20
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:56,990
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,955
- Finn is awake and we are literally about

22
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:00,234
to pull into Disneyland.

23
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:01,653
Yeah Ollie's still, oh! There's Ollie.

24
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,653
Oh hey Ollie!

25
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:04,739
- I told them if they
want to go to Disneyland

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,576
they have to take naps.

27
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:06,409
- [Bryan] Yes.
- And they did.

28
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:07,242
(Bryan laughs)

29
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:08,742
- I haven't actually been to
Disneyland in a while, too.

30
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:09,593
So I'm really excited.

31
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:11,160
- Me neither. I mean,
how long has it been?

32
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,672
We didn't, we missed all Christmas.

33
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,530
- We did miss Christmas

34
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,671
this year.
- Almost all Halloween stuff.

35
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:17,505
- Yeah. We had a really busy holiday.

36
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:18,338
- Yeah.
- So we did not

37
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:19,605
find ourselves at Disney that much.

38
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,450
But we are headed there
now and so excited!

39
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,249
Hey Ollie! You ready to go to Disney?

40
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:28,241
- [Finn] Yeah!

41
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:30,188
- [Bryan] What do you see Finn?

42
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:31,108
(Finn babbles)

43
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:32,775
Really?
- Yeah!

44
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:33,991
(Finn yells)

45
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:37,263
- [Bryan] We're going to Disney!

46
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,244
(Bryan laughs)

47
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:40,035
Whenever we go to Disney
and the kids fall asleep

48
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,807
they must be hyped up and
the best way to do that

49
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:46,975
is to play Disney music in the
car as we're about to park.

50
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:47,808
- [Missy] Yeah!

51
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,576
- [Bryan] So we've got
a little Moana on now

52
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,561
to put the kids in the Disney spirit.

53
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,924
- To Disney!
- Yay!

54
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:55,516
- [Bryan] Yay! Disney!

55
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,882
They're all Disney'ed out

56
00:01:56,882 --> 00:01:58,624
in their Mickey shirts.

57
00:01:58,624 --> 00:01:59,654
You ready to go have some fun?

58
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:00,628
- [Missy] You have a good nap?

59
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:01,461
- Yeah.

60
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:02,481
- [Missy] You gonna be able
to party all night long?

61
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,543
- [Bryan] Oh! You found M&M's?
- Yeah.

62
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,117
- [Bryan] The party's
just begun for this one.

63
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:07,703
Let's go boys!

64
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:09,920
Missy's rockin' Woody!

65
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,535
And we are now headed into Disneyland!

66
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:15,035
(dance music)

67
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,685
So Missy was just telling me

68
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:31,015
this is the first time that
Finn has been to Disneyland

69
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:32,698
since he turned two.
- [Missy] Yep.

70
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:34,399
- He hasn't been since his birthday.

71
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,736
- [Missy] Yeah. He was one
- That's crazy.

72
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:36,992
- the last time he went to Disneyland.

73
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:38,808
- Yeah so it's probably gonna be like

74
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:40,830
a whole new world for him

75
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,971
which is awesome.
- He's just changed

76
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:43,137
so much in the last

77
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:46,212
like four months that this
is gonna be so fun for him.

78
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,045
- Yeah.

79
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:48,220
And that's what's awesome
about taking your kids

80
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,244
to Disneyland is they
experience more of it

81
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:52,659
as they get older, so.

82
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,770
- There's so much for
Ollie to still experience,

83
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,103
it's crazy.
- [Bryan] Yeah.

84
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:57,876
- There's so much for me to experience.

85
00:02:57,876 --> 00:03:00,125
- Seriously. We have
still yet to do it all.

86
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:00,958
Isn't that crazy babe?

87
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:01,933
- Yeah! We have yet to do it all.

88
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,232
- I don't think we've still done it all.

89
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:04,065
(Bryan laughs)

90
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:07,001
(Finn yells)

91
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,167
- [Bryan] So cool!

92
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,667
(dance music)

93
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:18,149
First things first

94
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:20,370
we had to grab these boys some sweatshirts

95
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,245
'cause it's actually a little chilly.

96
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,482
Are you Mickey?

97
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:24,795
(Bryan laughs)

98
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,370
These are actually really cool.

99
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,708
- I'm Mickey!

100
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,576
(Bryan laughs)

101
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,325
(boys play fighting)

102
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,579
- [Bryan] The battle of the Mickeys!

103
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,496
(Bryan laughs)

104
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,362
(in Mickey voice) Oh
hey there, little boy!

105
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:37,051
- Why do you have Mickey ears?

106
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,904
- Because you had Mickey ears

107
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:40,096
and I wanted to be cool

108
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:40,929
like you guys.

109
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,483
(Finn babbles)
- [Missy] These are so cute!

110
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:43,316
I like these.

111
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:45,871
- Yeah, so we found a hat.

112
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:46,979
You like that hat?

113
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:47,812
Did you just hear him say that?

114
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:48,645
- Yeah.

115
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,486
- [Bryan] I think he said,
"I like that hat, daddy."

116
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:53,079
That was so, so cute.

117
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,099
Oh and look at your ears!

118
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,741
(Finn babbles)

119
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,893
Yeah, you got yours out now?

120
00:03:57,893 --> 00:03:58,882
Where are your ears, babe?

121
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:00,015
- I need ears!

122
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:02,526
- Missy is missing her ears, you guys.

123
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:03,359
What?

124
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,738
(prolonged whoop)

125
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:06,571
(Bryan laughs)

126
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,199
- Ollie, what ride do
you want to go on first?

127
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,866
(Ollie babbles)

128
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:15,040
Yes! Going on Buzz Lightyear.

129
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,192
Definitely my ears are a little droopy.

130
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:20,134
There we go. I'm gonna need
like some tape or something.

131
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,740
(Finn exclaims)

132
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,439
They're so happy!
- [Missy] Whoa!

133
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,319
- [Bryan] Climb on, let's go, let's go!

134
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,640
To Buzz Lightyear away!

135
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,099
- Finn, do you want to
go on Buzz Lightyear?

136
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,221
- Yeah!

137
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:34,388
(playful dance music)

138
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,747
- [Bryan] You see Buzz Lightyear?

139
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:46,330
(Finn babbles)

140
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:50,340
(enchanted music)

141
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,572
- [Bryan] Alright, we just
got all our food for dinner

142
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:05,126
and one thing we want to do...

143
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:06,165
(Ollie exclaims)

144
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,855
I do have a BB-8 cup!

145
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:10,299
One thing we love to do when
we are out to eat as a family

146
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,265
is we love to cheers.

147
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:12,681
The boys really like it, too.

148
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:14,488
Alright, Disneyland!

149
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,520
- [Missy and Bryan] Cheers!

150
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,862
- [Bryan] Love you boys!

151
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:19,106
You having fun?

152
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:19,939
(Bryan laughs)

153
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,700
(Finn exclaims)

154
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,533
It's BB-8!

155
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:25,722
He yells at me if I forget
to take a drink after.

156
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:26,840
(Bryan laughs)

157
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,766
- [Missy and Bryan] Cheers!

158
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:30,236
(Bryan laughs)

159
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:33,779
- [Bryan] Whoa! That pizza
slice is bigger than his head.

160
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,428
- This is longer than my head.

161
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:38,515
- [Bryan] Almost, yep.

162
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:41,932
(BB-8 electronic noises)

163
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:48,017
Alright, we may have gone crazy

164
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:49,568
at The Star Trader.

165
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,746
Look what Missy got!

166
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:53,992
- It's so cute! It's Porg!

167
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:55,732
- [Bryan] They're Porg
backpacks. Turn around, babe.

168
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:56,565
Let me seem him.

169
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,840
Oh hey! It's a Porg.

170
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,755
- It actually has a
surprisingly large like pocket

171
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:02,424
to put stuff, so I've
got like diapers and.

172
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,257
- [Bryan] Nice.

173
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:04,090
- Everything I need.

174
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,316
- And I am all decked out

175
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,911
for Mickey's Galactic Empire.

176
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,264
Check out this cool
sweatshirt I've got on.

177
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:10,198
I'm like so comfy now.

178
00:06:10,198 --> 00:06:11,985
- I know I had to get
something warmer, too.

179
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:13,507
And this is really cute.

180
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,785
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, it does look good babe.

181
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:15,736
Alright Ollie, are you ready

182
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:17,988
to ride the bobsleds?

183
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:18,821
- Yeah!
- I haven't been

184
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:19,847
on this ride in so long

185
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:20,771
and it's so much fun.

186
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:21,604
- Me either!

187
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:23,241
- You have never been on it, have you?

188
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,074
- No!

189
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:25,533
- And Ollie is now big enough for it

190
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,796
so we are going to ride the bobsled.

191
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:28,629
- Yeah!

192
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,208
- And we might even see, we might even see

193
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,164
an abominable snowman, okay?

194
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:31,997
- Yeah.

195
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:35,952
If I see I can tell you that is in it.

196
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:38,237
- Okay, you warn me if you see him, okay?

197
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,070
- Okay.

198
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,403
(enchanted dance music)

199
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:04,745
- How do you get on it?

200
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:06,030
- [Bryan] We gotta go up it.

201
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,844
We're gonna climb that
mountain together buddy.

202
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,277
You and I are going on the bobsled.

203
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:13,618
That's so exciting, huh?

204
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:14,510
(Bryan laughs)

205
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,808
I am so excited. This is such a fun ride.

206
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:17,994
I cannot, I still can't believe

207
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:19,969
Ollie's even big enough for this.

208
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:20,802
You did?

209
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:24,385
- Yeah I watched a video
and last time it's BB.

210
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:26,010
- Oh, okay.

211
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,253
- He's prepared. He watched the video.

212
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:29,086
Wow!

213
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:32,649
Look at that you guys, it looks awesome.

214
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:35,316
(steady guitar)

215
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:48,772
(enchanted music)

216
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,666
- So, oh Ollie it's okay buddy!

217
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:58,338
(Bryan laughs)

218
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,740
He's so sad! It's okay.

219
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,696
Hey, it's okay. Come here.

220
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:06,784
Alright, so it turns out
Ollie is not tall enough

221
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:08,224
for the bobsled ride.

222
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:11,518
I thought he was, I
seriously thought he was 42.

223
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:13,459
And on the other one it
kinda looked like it,

224
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,126
so, he's okay right?

225
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:18,798
See, we're still having fun, right?

226
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,383
And all we gotta do is, what?

227
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:21,828
Get a little bit bigger and stronger,

228
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,871
eat all your veggies so you get taller

229
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,269
and then you and I will ride
the bobsleds together, okay?

230
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:27,740
- Okay.
- Okay.

231
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,518
He was so bummed, I felt so bad.

232
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:32,230
I really thought he was tall enough.

233
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,986
I'm sorry, we're gonna
go ride another fun ride.

234
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,270
What ride do you want to ride instead?

235
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,087
(Ollie babbles)

236
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:39,385
Okay, let's go ride Alice, okay?

237
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,218
Okay.

238
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,446
I think the culprit has been found,

239
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:43,480
it's your shoes!

240
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,248
- Oh! He's like so close!

241
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,081
- [Bryan] I know!

242
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,249
- He must've been wearing different shoes.

243
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:48,858
- [Bryan] I think he was!

244
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:49,784
Aww!

245
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,163
- It's okay.

246
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:51,996
- [Bryan] Almost there, buddy!

247
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:54,382
You're almost there,
show me your big muscles.

248
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,671
Show me your big muscles,
you need big muscles

249
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:57,073
you go big and strong, alright?

250
00:08:57,073 --> 00:08:57,906
- Yeah!

251
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,285
- [Bryan] And Finn just threw
our stroller into the road.

252
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,500
Finn, you're silly.
(Fin exclaims)

253
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,247
- Okay, so the lady saw
that you were so sad

254
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:07,144
and she gave us some really cool passes.

255
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:09,502
So she gave you a pass that you can use,

256
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:11,515
go right into Peter Pan right now

257
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:14,119
and you don't have to wait
in the hour long line.

258
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:14,952
- [Bryan] Oh!

259
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,510
- And she gave you something else.

260
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,659
She gave you a pass that you can use

261
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,286
on any other ride any time tonight.

262
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:22,119
- [Bryan] Aww!

263
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:24,490
- And he actually is for sure big enough

264
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,673
for Guardians of the Galaxy

265
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:29,756
or the race car one, which is so fun!

266
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:31,664
- [ Bryan] In Cars Land, Ollie.

267
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,226
Remember that one?
- That one's like my favorite.

268
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:34,350
Have you been on that one?

269
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,183
- Yeah.

270
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,016
- Okay.

271
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,241
- [Bryan] Alright Ollie, so you wanna go

272
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:39,163
on the Radiator Springs Racers?

273
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:40,229
- Yeah.
- [Bryan] And guess what,

274
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:41,737
you're tall enough for that one!

275
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,028
So let's go on that.
- [Missy] It's a 90-minute

276
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:45,216
wait so we can go on it right now.

277
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:46,495
- [Bryan] Oh let's go, Ollie!

278
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,328
Let's do it!

279
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:48,732
- I stopped crying!

280
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:49,565
- [Bryan] Yes you did.

281
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:50,823
I'm proud of you.

282
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,251
Let's go have fun, k?

283
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:53,134
- [Finn] K.

284
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,042
(Bryan laughs)

285
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,041
- [Bryan] Finn's like "k,

286
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,268
I'd like to go on a ride too, please."

287
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:57,101
- Yeah.

288
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:57,934
(Bryan laughs)

289
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:00,517
(upbeat music)

290
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:19,200
- Alright so Ollie has decided

291
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,489
that he wants to go on
Space Mountain, right buddy?

292
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,322
- [Ollie & Finn] Yeah!

293
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,107
- Yeah! And you're gonna be
right there with me, okay?

294
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:27,476
- Is it the one that has stars in it?

295
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:28,596
- It has lots of stars, yeah.

296
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:29,429
- Really?

297
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,523
- You're like in the space.

298
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:31,410
- Does that sound good?

299
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,682
- Hi daddy!

300
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:33,515
- Hi Finn!

301
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:35,703
- It's really really
fast, and it's super dark.

302
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:36,536
- [Bryan] Are you okay with that?

303
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:37,372
- Is it scary?

304
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:38,390
- [Missy] It's not scary.

305
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,424
- Alright, we'll see how this goes.

306
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:41,454
(Finn wails)

307
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,213
- I thought I was gonna throw up and fall.

308
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,844
- [Bryan] Aww!

309
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:49,209
I don't understand, he had so much fun.

310
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:51,058
He hung onto me the whole time.

311
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:53,655
He was like, I thought he was loving it

312
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:54,899
and then we got off
the ride, and he was...

313
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:55,829
- He got to like, sit with you?

314
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:56,910
- [Bryan] Yeah, yeah he got
to sit right next to me.

315
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,293
- So you don't want to
go with momma right now?

316
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,567
- [Bryan] No? Okay.

317
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,907
- Okay, we'll wait 'till
- [Bryan] It's okay.

318
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:02,817
- You're a little bigger.

319
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:03,650
- But you did good.

320
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,483
- [Bryan] You did really good dude!

321
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:05,863
- I'm proud of you.
- [Bryan] I'm so proud of you.

322
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:06,812
That's pretty brave.

323
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:08,083
- He really wanted to
go on a big-kid ride.

324
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:08,916
- [Bryan] Yeah.

325
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:09,749
(Bryan laughs)

326
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:11,226
- You did it.

327
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:12,059
Good job.

328
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:13,920
- [Bryan] He did it.

329
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,084
My kid just did Space Mountain.

330
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:15,917
That's crazy.

331
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,146
Oh hey Finn, what are you eating?

332
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:19,493
Pez?

333
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,227
- Yeah! BB!
- [Bryan] Oh!

334
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:22,097
BB-8 Pez?

335
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:22,930
- Yeah!

336
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,229
- [Bryan] Nice!

337
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:26,504
Alright guys, I hope you had fun.

338
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:29,110
We had so much fun at
Disneyland, didn't we buddy?

339
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,943
- Yeah.

340
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:31,766
- Yeah we're gonna ride
a couple more rides

341
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,472
with Ollie and Finn, and then I think

342
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:35,228
we're gonna call it a night.

343
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,713

00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:41,032
Look at that castle!
Isn't that amazing Ollie?

346
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:41,865
- Yeah.

347
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:43,522
- [Bryan] That's where the princess lives?

348
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:45,328
- Yeah that's a princess castle.

349
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:46,161
- [Bryan] Oh is it?

350
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:46,994
- Yeah.

351
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:47,827
- [Bryan] Oh cool.

352
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:50,129
- And the king's castle
is right over there.

353
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,786
- Oh, the king's castle's over there.

354
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:52,962
- You can't see it.

355
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,795
- Oh, okay.

356
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:54,829
(Bryan laughs)

357
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:55,985
Alright, thanks for watching guys.

358
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:56,818
- Bye!

359
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:58,526
- [Ollie] Boo.
