1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:01,602
- Look, look!

2
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,907
- [Bryan] Look, Payton!

3
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:05,021
- She's like "yeah"

4
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:06,701
- [Bryan] Yeah, who cares.

5
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:08,919
- Is it Barbie, or like, is it Barbie?

6
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:11,263
- [Bryan] So funny.

7
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:14,794
♪ This is our life, lets live it. ♪

8
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:16,676
♪ Live it forever. ♪

9
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:17,926
- Good morning.

10
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,860
- How did you sleep in your new bed?

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,769
- Good

12
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:24,624
- Good? You guys have been
doing it pretty stinking good.

13
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,727
I'm really proud of you.

14
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:28,720
You seem to stay in your bed
better because Finn is there.

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,119
Does he make you feel
like you're not alone?

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,952
- Yeah.

17
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:33,457
- Yeah? That's so good.

18
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:35,750
We have to find Fred today, but first,

19
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,667
we need to get dressed.

20
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,664
We have a fun day planned.

21
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,600
You guys, it's two days
'till Christmas! Two days!

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,433
- (excited exclamation)

23
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,198
- So we have a party tonight,
and a party tomorrow night,

24
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:48,938
and then, it's Christmas!

25
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:50,621
- (celebratory noises)

26
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:51,862
- So, it is basically Christmas Ollie,

27
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:53,426
because we're getting
Christmas presents today,

28
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:55,061
and we're gonna party.

29
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:56,979
It's basically Christmas
for the next three days.

30
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,406
- Yeah.

31
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:01,508
- Alright, we're gonna
go ahead and get dressed.

32
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:04,675
(happy festive music)

33
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:26,993
- Good morning boys.

34
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:28,917
- (excited responses)

35
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,812
- Alright, it is time to show me

36
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:32,896
your Christmas Eve, Eve outfits.

37
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:35,106
Finn you look so cute, you got Snoopy?

38
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:36,425
- [Missy] You got Snoopy dog?

39
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:39,668
- [Bryan] And you got Darth
Vader and Stormtroopers?

40
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:42,509
So cool. You guys are looking good.

41
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,071
- [Missy] Little ripped jeans.

42
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:44,904
- Oh!

43
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:45,737
- [Bryan] What?

44
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:46,570
- (unintelligible response)

45
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,403
- [Bryan] Fred?

46
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:48,780
What happened with Fred?

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,129
Should we go see?

48
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,471
(gasps)

49
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:52,721
Oh my goodness.

50
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,917
- [Missy] That little stinker.

51
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,707
- [Bryan] Fred! What?

52
00:01:58,707 --> 00:01:59,845
Let's go look!

53
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:01,163
Fred loves pranking us,

54
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:05,254
and apparently he loves
toilet papering our tree.

55
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,053
This is out of hand.

56
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:08,495
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

57
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,494
- [Bryan] That naughty Fred.

58
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:11,404
- How original Fred,
you've done this before.

59
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:12,709
What do you think of that Finn?

60
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:13,542
- [Bryan] Isn't that crazy?

61
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:14,375
How do you think he did that Ollie?

62
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,208
That's a lot of toilet paper.

63
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,248
- [Ollie] Yeah.

64
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:17,686
- [Missy] What do you think did that?

65
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,030
- [Ollie] Look at the star!

66
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,804
- [Bryan] He got the star too, yep.

67
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:21,761
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

68
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:24,089
We are gonna have to clean this
up before our party tonight.

69
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:25,028
We can not just let-

70
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,541
I can't count on him to clean it up,

71
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,852
he never cleans it up, huh?

72
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:30,369
- (unintelligible response)

73
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:33,157
- Oh, you're right they
would think it's funny, huh?

74
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:36,267
- Silly Fred, he's always up to no good.

75
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:38,416
And yeah, he's laughing, huh?

76
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,705
- [Missy] So, I forgot
that we had this hanging

77
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:43,394
on our refrigerator.

78
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:45,054
It's a little present,
and what is it Ollie?

79
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:47,258
- It's from me and it's for you.

80
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:49,034
- Did you make it?

81
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,048
- [Ollie] Yeah.

82
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:52,220
- [Missy] (gasps) This
came from school right?

83
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,053
- Yeah.

84
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:54,249
- [Missy] Alright let's see it.

85
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:55,499
Oh my goodness!

86
00:02:56,526 --> 00:03:01,066
Wow, it's your hand print,
and it has sparkles on it.

87
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:03,809
Did you color it and put
the sparkles on this?

88
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,096
- [Ollie] Yeah.

89
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:07,741
- Wow! You put your hand in
paint and put it on there?

90
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:11,734
What did you think of all that
paint all over your hands?

91
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,263
Yeah was that kind of funny?

92
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,096
- Yeah

93
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,408
- [Missy] I love it, this is another thing

94
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:17,417
we're going to have hanging in our house

95
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,304
or on our Christmas tree, huh?

96
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:20,174
- [Ollie] Yeah.

97
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:21,797
- [Missy] I love it, thank you.

98
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:23,098
Go show daddy.

99
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,347
- [Bryan] That is so cool, dude.

100
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:26,180
Look at all that cool glitter.

101
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,156
- How about right here?

102
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:30,323
- [Missy] Looks good, yay.

103
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,547
So we are getting ready to start wrapping

104
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,559
some last minute Christmas
presents that we have.

105
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:39,723
Finn cannot stop talking
about yesterdays adventure.

106
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,816
You just want to go sledding, huh?

107
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:43,468
This is actually a wall decor piece

108
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,079
and Fred used it yesterday

109
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,254
because he was excited about sledding.

110
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:48,087
What?

111
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:48,974
- I want to ride.

112
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:50,217
- [Missy] You wanna ride?

113
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:51,050
- Yeah

114
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,143
- [Missy] Where are you gonna ride it?

115
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:53,976
- Ride.

116
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:54,809
- [Missy] Ride.

117
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:57,593
You guys, yesterday was so stinking fun.

118
00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:59,513
Finn was so cute sledding down the hill.

119
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,231
If you guys haven't seen yesterday's Vlog,

120
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:02,934
it's like a snow miracle.

121
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,788
And make sure you go check it out,

122
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:06,173
I'll have it linked up here in the icard.

123
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:10,141
Alright so, momma is
dressed as a present, huh?

124
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,370
- Yeah.

125
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,864
- And we're wrapping presents!

126
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:15,135
- [Ollie] Yes.

127
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,350
- I think it's actually nap time now

128
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,426
for you, and for Finn.

129
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,694
So, I'm gonna go put them
down for a nap real quick.

130
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:25,843
- So it is now time for
quiet time for both the boys.

131
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:30,134
They are in their room watching
a movie, check this out.

132
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:33,203
Don't get off the bed Finn,
you gotta watch a movie, okay?

133
00:04:33,203 --> 00:04:34,322
We have this really cool projector

134
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:36,949
that just projects the
movie right on the wall.

135
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,203
It's quiet time right?

136
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:39,036
- [Ollie] Yeah.

137
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:40,421
- [Bryan] Okay, I brought a little stool

138
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:43,312
to put your projector on, so
it's up a little bit higher.

139
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:45,124
That's a little nicer, huh?

140
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:47,957
(Slow bass music)

141
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,517
- I feel like a big part of Christmas

142
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:55,285
is trying to distract your little ones

143
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:56,718
while you prepare.

144
00:04:56,718 --> 00:05:00,209
We also are having a little
Christmas party tonight

145
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,879
with some family, which
is gonna be super fun.

146
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,069
We have to wrap presents,

147
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,403
we have to do our big plastic ball game.

148
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:06,907
That was such a huge hit last year.

149
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,894
Everyone's like, "We
need to do that again!".

150
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,102
So, we have to put that together.

151
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,186
We have lots of fun things to
do before the party tonight.

152
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,123
The boys got a great
little nap and a rest,

153
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:16,903
and now we are going outside

154
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:19,936
and we're gonna see if our
snow is still out here, huh?

155
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:20,852
- [Ollie] Yeah!

156
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:22,283
- If you guys did not
see yesterday's video,

157
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:23,428
basically we caught Yeti

158
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:26,748
and we had a winter
wonderland in our backyard.

159
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,242
Do you think the snow's still there?

160
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,075
- [Ollie] Yeah.

161
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,051
- [Bryan] I'm really curious to see

162
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:32,480
how long it lasts in California.

163
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,007
- [Ollie] The snow's still here!

164
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:35,122
- [Bryan] It is?

165
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:38,372
Oh my gosh, you guys it's frozen solid.

166
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,746
- [Ollie] Go! Yey!

167
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:46,067
- [Bryan] Wow! That seems
to work a lot better

168
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,706
than it did yesterday even, huh?

169
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,655
They're so stoked they're like, 'Yeah!'.

170
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:52,572
Here we go!

171
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:59,092
Finn, you went all the way!

172
00:05:59,092 --> 00:05:59,925
- Yeah.

173
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,009
- [Bryan] That was so cool.

174
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,209
Ollie's going again he's doing
it by himself like a big boy,

175
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,792
sit on your bottom!

176
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:08,515
Weee!

177
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:14,547
Nice, this is so cool, the boys love this.

178
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:18,255
I am so glad that Yeti was
able to use this magic powers

179
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,052
and give us a sledding hill, huh?

180
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:23,301
Almost, one more time! There you go, nice!

181
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:25,306
Alright Ollie, Finn is
sitting on the fireball,

182
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:27,350
I just need you to give him a little push.

183
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,183
(Slow bass music)

184
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:41,395
(Fast festive music)

185
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,547
- [Bryan] Look at this beautiful
Christmas eve, eve sunset.

186
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,729
I love it, it's awesome.

187
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,518
Luna and Karma are enjoying

188
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:57,530
their very first Christmas present.

189
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,985
It's an outdoor dog bed,

190
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,617
so that they can,
hopefully, stay off these.

191
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:03,432
You two just love cuddling all the time,

192
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,883
uh-huh, okay, I'm sorry.

193
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,195
I interrupted their cuddle fest. (laughs)

194
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,307
(Fast festive music)

195
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,629
- Alright, so we're preparing

196
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,616
for our first Christmas party tonight.

197
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:19,129
In preparation for that, we
are baking some fresh cookies.

198
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:19,962
The boys actually-

199
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:20,795
- (squeals of delight)

200
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,837
- helped make this yesterday with daddy,

201
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:24,704
while mommy rolled peanut butter balls.

202
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:26,998
So, now we're making two dozen of them.

203
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:28,616
I've got another batch ready to go in,

204
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,064
and these ones are
almost ready to come out.

205
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:32,713
Are you excited to eat them?

206
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:33,546
- Yeah.

207
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:34,379
- [Missy] Yeah.

208
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,589
- You guys look at my
ugly Christmas sweater

209
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,681
I'm wearing tonight.

210
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:41,092
It's got stars and Santa
Claus riding a unicorn.

211
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:43,107
I have a feeling the
boys are gonna love it,

212
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:44,126
so I'm gonna go show 'em.

213
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,969
Hey Ollie, look at my sweater!

214
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:47,802
- Wow!

215
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:49,545
- [Bryan] You like it?

216
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:50,675
- It has Santa Claus,

217
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:53,894
and Santa Claus riding a unicorn in space.

218
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,333
- In space.

219
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,393
- And that is so cool, it has stars!

220
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:00,378
- I know, I didn't even realize

221
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,286
that he was actually in space.

222
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:04,888
Check out Missy's Christmas sweater.

223
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:06,067
It is also a unicorn.

224
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:10,119
So, we're kind of matching
with our unicorns.

225
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,485
- [Missy] The party has started,

226
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:14,762

fam here, and Vinton.

227
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:15,889
Oh, hi!

228
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,932
This is actually my mom's
side of the family party.

229
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,088
We are having so much
fun, just hanging out.

230
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:25,097
We're about to do gifts next,
so yay! It's gonna be fun.

231
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:27,213
- [Bryan] There are so many
presents around this tree,

232
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:29,131
and it's not even Christmas yet.

233
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:30,298
Open 'em guys!

234
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:34,875
- I got the green basketball player!

235
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:37,528

know he's gonna be like 6'10.

236
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:39,195
- [Bryan] Yeah, yes!

237
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,755
They got a midnight, mini hoop, midnight.

243
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,536
- I got the Kylo Ren!

244
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:03,992
- [Bryan] What!

245
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,535
- Payton, look!

246
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,916

248
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:11,208

249
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,347
- Is it Barbie? Or like is it Barbie?

250
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:14,505
- [Bryan] So funny. (laughter)

251
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:17,505
(fun festive music)

252
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,835
- [Bryan] So we are doing a
little white elephant game now.

253
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:25,121
Well not a little, this
is a lot of people.

254
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,996
But, Ollie is showing his
new room to Payton right now,

255
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:32,476
so (whispering) I'm gonna
go see if I can spy on 'em.

256
00:09:32,476 --> 00:09:34,305
What you guys doing?

257
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:37,166
Payton what do you think
of the boys' new room?

258
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:37,999
- Cool.

259
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,108

Did you see this Payton? Watch.

263
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:45,895
- [Payton] Yeah, I saw that.

264
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:46,728
- [Bryan] It's like a real fire.

265
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,299
You share a room with Olivia right?

266
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,132
- Yeah

267
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:49,965

268
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:50,798

273
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,592
They are so cute

274
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,626
and Payton has been so
sick the last couple days,

275
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:00,752
so they haven't been
able to see each other.

276
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:03,419
(Festive music)

277
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,168
- Alright we're starting
the saran wrap ball,

278
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:15,751
and it's humongous!

279
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:18,894
They're for rolling doubles,

280
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:22,010
whatever they get, they win. (laughs)

281
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,780
- [Bryan] So everyone is
really excited about what?

282
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,232
The $10 Starbucks gift card.

283
00:10:27,232 --> 00:10:29,854
- No, in the middle there
is keys to a brand new car.

284
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:30,937
- [Missy] Oh!

285
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,096
- There's a couple of
packs of gum as well.

286
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,598
- [Missy] Actually I've
got the keys to your car,

287
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:36,920
is that okay?

288
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,427
- No bro, I have sweet tug ropes in there.

289
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:40,370

290
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,023

00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:00,016
- And Finn got the pop rocks.

297
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,933
- Nice dude! High five.

298
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,612
Or not, there we go.

299
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:08,105
That's not your laugh,
that's not his laugh!

300
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:09,445
- We got a big one!

301
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:10,529
- That's not his laugh!

302
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,034
Add to your list, plastic

The family goes crazy

00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,600
Cassy, mutilates it every single time.

322
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,564
Carlos is a machine.

323
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,900
Bro, I got a rose gold iPhone holder.

324
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,267

- Oh my gosh, are you kidding me Missy?

330
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,647
Why did you rig this game?

331
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,773
- [Missy] Are you- Stop it!

332
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:28,832

341
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,517
but the fun never ends.

342
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:56,956
The boys are getting ready right now,

343
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:58,948
with Missy, to go to bed.

344
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:00,362
But, I thought it would be really funny

345
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,112
if I walked into their
room, dressed in this.

346
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,652
Yeah. (laughs)

347
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:09,919
How's this look you guys?

348
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,264
So I'm gonna walk in,
I'm gonna be like this.

349
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:15,050
Like, "Whoa! Santa,
santa, santa slow down.

350
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,467
Santa Santa slow down! Whoa."

351
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:21,308
- Alright boys we are
getting all ready for bed.

352
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:23,870
- [Bryan] You guys I
think we caught Santa!

353
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,703
I caught Santa!

354
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,536
- [Missy] (gasps) Oh my gosh!

355
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:26,369
- Whoa

356
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:27,202
- [Missy] Wait what are you doing!

357
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:28,643
- [Bryan] I caught Santa!

358
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,017
(audience gasps)

359
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,684
(festive music)

360
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,718
- [Bryan] I'm on his
shoulders you guys look!

361
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,197
- What is going on?

362
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:39,085
Is daddy on top of Santa?

363
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,014
- Yeah.

364
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,166
- [Bryan] He's running around!

365
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,701
- What is going on? He's
riding on top of Santa!

366
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:46,957
- Yeah, so I caught Santa
in the Christmas cage,

367
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,660
and then I hopped on his shoulders.

368
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,981
- [Missy] Is that so funny?

369
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:50,814
- Yeah.

370
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,090
- [Missy] The boys are so
confused, what is going on.

371
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,770
Do you wanna go give Santa a hug? (laughs)

372
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,872
- [Ollie] (unintelligible question)

373
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,783
- [Missy] Wow, daddy is flexible.

374
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:03,271
- [Bryan] How many legs do I have Ollie?

375
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:05,666
- [Ollie] One, two and three!

376
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,499
- [Bryan] And four!.

377
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:07,419
- [Ollie] Yeah.

378
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,894
- So these are my real legs,

379
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:11,295
they look like Santa's legs though.

380
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:12,917
- [Missy] I feel like it
literally took them a minute

381
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,436
to figure out what was going on.

382
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:16,682
- Does it look like I'm riding on Santa?

383
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:17,515
- [Ollie] Yeah.

384
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:20,378
- See these aren't Daddy's
legs. These are fake.

385
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:21,213
Santa is so cute.

386
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,046
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

387
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:22,958
- [Bryan] Ho Ho Ho!

388
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,669
- [Missy] Look at that beard!

389
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:28,142
- How cool would it be to catch
the real Santa though, huh?

390
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:32,202
But we should put Santa's
cookies in the Christmas trap.

391
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:33,035
- [Missy] (gasps) What if we caught him?

392
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,978
- [Bryan] In the Christmas
cage, wouldn't that be cool?

393
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:35,811
- Yeah

394
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:38,600
- [Missy] Should we catch Santa Claus?

395
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,790
- Santa Claus is gonna come today?

396
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,918
- Not tonight. But tomorrow
night he's supposed to come

397
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:49,636
and bring us all presents,
you guys especially.

398
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:51,966
- [Bryan] have you been naughty? Or nice?

399
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:52,864
- [Ollie] Nice.

400
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:54,029
- [Bryan] Finn have you been nice?

401
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,347
- (unintelligible noise)

402
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:56,180
- [Missy] Ha, he's like-

403
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,825
- [Bryan] Yeah, he's like, I guess.

404
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,490
- I guess we'll leave that
up to Santa to decide.

405
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,496
- Who's judging?

406
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:01,329
- [Missy] (laughs)

407
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,175
We had such a fun Christmas party.

408
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:06,219
I just actually love
hanging out with my family.

409
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:07,514
That was just the first one.

410
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:09,750
We got a big one tomorrow again,

411
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,292
so we're excited to all hang out.

412
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,902
- [Bryan] Whoa.

413
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,531
- Wow, Santa's running around again.

414
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:16,879
Lets go ahead and end today's
video, so we can go to bed.

415
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,305
It is so, so late.

416
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:20,279
Give the video a big thumbs
up if you did enjoy it!

417
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,711
- [Bryan] Thumbs up guys.
Merry Christmas Eve, Eve!

418
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:23,931
- [Finn] (baby gibberish)

419
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,422
- [Bryan] It's almost here.

420
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:26,587
Thanks for watching guys.

421
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:30,754
- Okay, we'll see you guys
tomorrow, bye! (laughs)

422
00:15:32,546 --> 00:00:00,000
(happy upbeat music)
