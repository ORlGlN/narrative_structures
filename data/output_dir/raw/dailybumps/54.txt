1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,820
- [Bryan] That's the scary dragon.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,651
Ready to fight him over there?

3
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:05,350
- But--
- Okay, let's go.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,431
(dramatic music)

5
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:10,079
(metallic scraping)

6
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,523
♪ This is our life ♪

7
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:14,674
♪ Let's live it ♪

8
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:16,518
♪ Live it forever ♪

9
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:19,300
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,133
Good morning, guys.

11
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,210
If you don't know, we are on a little trip

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,359
to the Great Wolf Lodge.

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,713
Yesterday, we spent the whole day

14
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:26,622
playing at the water park, huh?

15
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:27,480
- Yeah.

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,830
- Bryan is actually sleeping.

17
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,440
It's kind of still his birthday weekend,

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,200
and I thought, let's let
him relax in the hotel room

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
and get some sleep and
I'll take these boys out.

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,820
Get some breakfast in them, and
maybe do a couple fun things

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,750
before Daddy comes down and meets us.

22
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,395
We're very excited, though,
it's gonna be a fun day, huh?

23
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:47,728
(peaceful guitar music)

24
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:01,290
Finn, who's that?

25
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,770
Is that the wolf?

26
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,500
- Yeah.
(Mom laughs)

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,199
- Smile, Finn!

28
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,670
Say cheese!

29
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,090
What do you think of that?

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,880
Oh, he says it's yummy.

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,210
I just got them their breakfast,

32
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,181
and it's actually a
delicious buffet for them.

33
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,310
They do really good at buffets.

34
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,674
They got lots of food, lots
of yummy stuff for ya, huh?

35
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:23,174
(happy music)

36
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:30,532
(clapping)

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,670
Finn is very excited to say hi
to Violet the Squirrel, huh?

38
00:01:38,642 --> 00:01:39,900
Is she here?

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,850
Go give her a hug.

40
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,683
Aww!

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,720
Good job.

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,077
Say bye.

43
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:48,910
- Bye.

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,190
- We are done with breakfast.

45
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,130
It was so much fun.

46
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,320
The boys had a blast meeting all

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,465
the little tree animals, huh?

48
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:03,370
- Yeah!

49
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,180
- And what is this, boys?

50
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,518
- A treasure box.

51
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:08,880
- Wow, that is so cool.

52
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,550
Something really cool they
have here at Great Wolf is

53
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,550
a magic map quest that you can
go on with a magic wand, huh?

54
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:19,755
- Yeah.

55
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:23,110
- And he, and Finn, want a wand so badly

56
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,630
so they can go around and
do all kinds of magic stuff

57
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,580
with little things they
have all over the hotel.

58
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,800
I think we're gonna go ahead and go in

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,730
and grab them all their supplies

60
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,563
so they can play with their magic wands,

61
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:35,520
huh?
- Yeah.

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,100
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

63
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,310
- We gotta go pick you out a wand.

64
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,670
I think there's even
outfits they can pick out,

65
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,176
and then we'll go on
our little magic quest.

66
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:46,176
(fantastical music)

67
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:55,860
First thing they get to
do is pick out an outfit

68
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,230
and Finn really liked this one.

69
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,670
He thinks it looks like
Harry Potter, or actually,

70
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,180
Ollie likes this one because
it looks like Harry Potter.

71
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,030
And then this one is a little
bit smaller and simpler

72
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,780
so I'm gonna get that one for Finn.

73
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,568
Do you like that wand?
- Yeah!

74
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:10,240
- [Missy] And which one do you like?

75
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,220
Oooh, look at that.

76
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,140
Next, you get to pick out a gem topper,

77
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,890
and they've got dragons and unicorns

78
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,860
and, ooh, they got all
kinds of cool stuff.

79
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,700
Ooh, they even have a cute little wolf.

80
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,220
Are you leaning towards the dragon one?

81
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,237
That one is pretty cool.

82
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:31,154
(optimistic music)

83
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,020
The boys are ready to
do their magic quest.

84
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,043
Are you ready?

85
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:37,876
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

86
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:38,780
- [Missy] Are you so excited?

87
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,040
- Yeah.
- First off,

88
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,340
they look absolutely adorable.

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,670
They got this cute little wizard outfits.

90
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,090
He's got one kind of the same.

91
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,940
Love these little hoods,
that's the cutest thing ever,

92
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,510
then they have a utility belt.

93
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,200
Show us everything that's
in your utility belt, Ollie.

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,580
- I got a little--

95
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,646
- [Missy] Protection, protection rune?

96
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:56,479
- Yeah.

97
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,160
- [Missy] They each have a
lightning protection rune.

98
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,745
Hopefully that'll keep them safe.

99
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:02,160
- And then we got a little sword.

100
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,110
- [Missy] They got a sword in here.

101
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,170
Just in case they need
to fight some dragons.

102
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,049
Let me see you do it.

103
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,950
(wind rushes)

104
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,030
Careful (chuckles).

105
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,270
And Finn's got one, too,
he's trying to pull it out.

106
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,982
Show us your fighting skills.

107
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:17,300
(wind rushes)

108
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,860
Good job.

109
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,802
And then, the most important
item of all, you've got?

110
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:22,710
- [Oliver] A wand.

111
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,543
- [Missy] A wand.

112
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,141
Pull it out, bud.

113
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:26,250
Wow.

114
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,103
Show me one.
- Watch what I do

115
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,686
with my wand.
- Wow.

116
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,747
- Wingardium leviosa.

117
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,350
(Missy laughs)

118
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,606
- [Missy] Good job.

119
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:37,870
Ollie got this red, fiery

120
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,330
wand, with a very cool dragon on top, huh?

121
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,580
- Fire breathing dragon.

122
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,580
- Fire breathing dragon.

123
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,300
And then Finn over here's
got this blue, icy wand,

124
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,570
with a cool crystal on top, huh?

125
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,222
They each have a game name.

126
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:55,680
What is your wizard game name?

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,970
- Fire Breathing Wizard.

128
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,140
- Oooh, that is pretty cool.

129
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,290
And Finn, do you know your name?

130
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,837
It's Cool Wizard, huh?
- Yeah.

131
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:08,669
- Are you guys ready to play this game?

132
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:09,502
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

133
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,550
- We're going to start
the game at a portal

134
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,040
and it's gonna tell us five
things we have to find.

135
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,410
Let's go start this game.

136
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,860
Ooh!

137
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,600
Tap on the pixie, goblin, or dragon

138
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,310
to begin or continue a quest.

139
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,041
Are you ready?
- Yes.

140
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,458
(soft music)

141
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,330
- [Missy] First things we
need to find our these items,

142
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,410
okay?
- Okay.

143
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,270
- We've gotta find these gems.

144
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,690
Alright, so we are looking for

145
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,540
- Found it!
- Three little gems.

146
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,373
Do you think that's it?

147
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:43,990
Let's see, you can point it at it.

148
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,660
Oooh, good job.

149
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,430
That was really cool but it's not quite

150
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,340
what we are looking for.

151
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,800
We are looking for some blue gems, okay?

152
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,910
Ollie, what's that right there?

153
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,743
- [Oliver] Crystal.

154
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,190
There it is.
- Wow.

155
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,790
Can you put your wand up
to it and see what happens.

156
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:11,640
(twinkling)

157
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,473
Wow.

158
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,760
Good job, you did it.

159
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,760
(fantastical music)

160
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:26,135
(wind rush)
(twinkle)

161
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,387
- Look, I found it!

162
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,810
- Good job!

163
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,250
They are having so much fun.

164
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,380
They actually found something,
I didn't even see it.

165
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,850
I think the game is
technically for ten and up

166
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,960
but I was like, we'll
play and see how it goes,

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,290
and they're actually
doing pretty dang good.

168
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,030
We are on a quest to get five crystals.

169
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,222
We found three already, huh?

170
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:46,055
- Yeah.

171
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:47,580
- [Missy] What colors did we get?

172
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,960
- We got red, blue--

173
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,793
- [Missy] And white.

174
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:52,230
- And white.

175
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,360
- We still need green and purple,

176
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,790
which they say is on the fifth floor

177
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,488
so let's go to the fifth floor, okay?

178
00:06:57,488 --> 00:06:58,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

179
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,730
- [Missy] Do you see one?

180
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,788
- [Finley] Yeah!

181
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,805
- [Missy] Oh my goodness!

182
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,902
(twinkling)

183
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,640
We found the green one, good job.

184
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,100
We still gotta find a purple one.

185
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:11,574
- Look!
- Do you see one?

186
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:16,437
- [Game] You have found
the purple crystal.

187
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,520
- Yeah.
- Yay!

188
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:20,399
- Wow.
- Wow.

189
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,075
- [Game] Look at all the
dazzling crystals you collected.

190
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,338
- [Missy] You've got so many crystals.

191
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,320
- [Game] Well done.

192
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,320
I believe you deserve this
super sparkly dazzle rune.

193
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,300
Have a dazzling day, Magi!

194
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,220
- [Finley] Bye!

195
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,110
- We need five items
for the healing potion

196
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,240
and we just found slime, huh?
- Yeah.

197
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,800
- We still need four more things

198
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,300
and they're all on different floors.

199
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,596
First, we're gonna go get Daddy
so he can come help us play.

200
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,429
Sound good?

201
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,262
(Finley whimpers)

202
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:45,490
Yeah, your cape fell off.

203
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,034
Let's put it back on, 'kay?

204
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,513
(fantastical music)

205
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:51,390
(wind rush)

206
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,070
- Alright, so the boys had
to recruit good ol' dad

207
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,030
because I know my way around
a magic wand, you guys.

208
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,580
Helping them find their ingredients
for their healing potion

209
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,890
but we just found a sword?
- Yeah!

210
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,980
- What?

211
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,040
Can you get it out?

212
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:06,090
(Bryan grunts)

213
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,124
Try it, Finn.
(Finn cries.)

214
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:08,970
(Missy awws)

215
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,836
Alright, I'm gonna use my big muscles

216
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,820
and I'm gonna try, okay?

217
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,750
Okay, ready?

218
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,675
3

219
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,058
2

220
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:16,069
1

221
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:16,960
(metallic sliding)

222
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,290
(Bryan groans)
- [Missy] Ohhh!

223
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,400
So close.
- It is in there.

224
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,480
Let's see what happens when you wave

225
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
your wand at this, boys.

226
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,297
Show me what you do, Ollie.

227
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:27,360
(Oliver casts spell)

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,193
Whoa!

229
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:29,790
- Ohp, I don't think
that was the right thing.

230
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,771
- [Bryan] That wasn't the moss?

231
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,646
- [Missy] Nope.

232
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:34,610
(fantastical music)

233
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,417
- [Bryan] Even wizards need a break, huh?

234
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,539
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

235
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:38,559
- [Bryan] What are you eating, Ollie?

236
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,079
- A donut.
- A donut.

237
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,030
And I had to grab a hot tea.

238
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,830
I sometimes forget that I
drink hot tea in the morning,

239
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,800
so I didn't even order it at first,

240
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,595
and then I was like, "Oh, I
need that in my life right now."

241
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:53,595
(fantastical music)

242
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:57,190
(wind rush)

243
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,140
- It's named moss which
is on the lower level.

244
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,520
And we need fungus which
is on the fifth floor.

245
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,491
- [Bryan] We're looking
for moss down here.

246
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:06,324
- And then fungus.

247
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:07,280
- [Bryan] Of course
moss would be down here.

248
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,113
Look it, you guys.

249
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:10,800
It's all ancient and wet and drippy.

250
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:14,031
Whoa!

251
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:18,050
- [Game] You have found the
green chest and some gold.

252
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,961
- [Bryan] Ollie, you found some gold.

253
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:22,961
(fantastical music)

254
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,030
There is a little friendly
frog over here in this tree.

255
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,847
Do you think he has any moss?

256
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:30,547
(wind rush)

257
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:34,456
- [Game] You have found the shadow moss.

258
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:35,789
- The shadow moss?

259
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,240
- [Bryan] We found the moss.

260
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,931
Good job, Ollie.

261
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:42,597
(fantastical music)

262
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:43,610
(wind rush)

263
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,110
- [Game] You have found
50 gold hidden in my book.

264
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:49,849
- Ooh!
- Nice.

265
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:51,827
(wind rush)

266
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:55,182
(wind rush)
(sprinkling)

267
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:56,015
Whoa.

268
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,577
That's a pretty crown, huh?
- Yeah.

269
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:02,624
(fantastical music)

270
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:07,624
(wind rush)
(birds tweeting)

271
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,370
- [Bryan] Whoa, Ollie.

272
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,720
Fungus!
- Yay!

273
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,460
- [Bryan] We found the fungus, Ollie.

274
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,740
- We need the pixie lady in the lobby now.

275
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,720
- [Bryan] Ooh, we get to
go to the fairies, boys.

276
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,896
- Yay!

277
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:22,855
- We have our healing potion.

278
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,502
- [Bryan] Now what are we gonna do?

279
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:28,501
- We are gonna go see the pixie lady.

280
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:29,640
- Okay, let's go.

281
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,980
The boys have been working so hard,

282
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,220
they have their health potion,

283
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,150
and now we are headed
to go to the fairies.

284
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,030
I think this is gonna be
really exciting for them.

285
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,990
- Yeah, also we've all kind of

286
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,970
taken a part of Finn's costume.

287
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,330
- [Bryan] Yeah.
(Bryan and Missy chuckle)

288
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,660
- There's a princess.

289
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,987
- [Bryan] Yep, wave your wand.

290
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:48,780
(wind rush)
- Nice.

291
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,637
Pixie and princess.

292
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:54,470
- [Game] Hello, Magi, I
am so relieved to see you.

293
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,237
- [Bryan] She's talking to you, dude.

294
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:57,463
- Really?

295
00:10:57,463 --> 00:11:00,463
(fantastical music)

296
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,940
- [Bryan] We need this last
rune here called the Enchant,

297
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,437
and then we unlock the pixie.

298
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,940
- [Missy] Alright, let's see what we need.

299
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,412
- [Game] The Enchant Creature
rune is truly a wondrous item.

300
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:18,677
(Bryan ooohs)

301
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,810
(fantastical music)

302
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,010
- [Bryan] Oh no, Ollie, I found
an evil dark wizard, Carl.

303
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,500
Can you defeat him?

304
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,800
Go get him, defeat him.

305
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,500
(wind rush)
Oh no, he's getting away.

306
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:35,250
(wind rush)
(Carl fakes yells)

307
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,796
You have been defeated, Evil Lord Carl.

308
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:39,850
- He's too powerful.

309
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,853
He's too powerful.

310
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:42,960
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

311
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,869
Now he's breaking out the sword.

312
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,344
- Oh, now he's gotta defeat me.

313
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:46,830
(metallic clank)
(Bryan laughs)

314
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,740
Now I'm done.

315
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,300
- I think you defeated
him, Ollie (laughs).

316
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,580
We're on the hunt right
now for a silver apple.

317
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,110
There it is.

318
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,540
- [Missy] Wave your wand.

319
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,850
- [Game] You now have the silver apple.

320
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,200
- [Bryan] Nice!

321
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,860
Look, it's spinning.

322
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,300
Now we're looking for a painting.

323
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:08,115
- [Game] Awesome, you found a piece

324
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:10,380
of the Enchant Creature rune.

325
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,213
- [Bryan] Nice.

326
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:13,060
Come on, wizard, let's get in the elevator

327
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,130
so we can go to the next enchanted land,

328
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,780
'cause that's I'm sure
what wizards are doin'.

329
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,150
We're looking for a paw chest.

330
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,980
We're in the Cryptic Cavern.

331
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,140
Nice.
- Good job, you did it.

332
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,930
- [Bryan] We need one more piece

333
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,913
of the Enchant Creature rune.

334
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,341
- [Game] Wowee!

335
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:32,744
You found a piece of the
Enchant Creature rune.

336
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:34,245
- [Bryan] I think we
have everything, Ollie.

337
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:36,663
- Let's go check out the portal.

338
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:39,710
(fantastical music)

339
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,470
- Alright, Ollie, it is now time

340
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,380
to fight the giant fire breathing dragon.

341
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,213
Are you ready?

342
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:46,610
- That's the one.

343
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,810
- That's the scary dragon.

344
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,131
Are you ready to fight him over there?

345
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,160
Okay, let's go.

346
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,354
(intense fantastical music)

347
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:55,604
(growling)

348
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,473
(growling)

349
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,501
(metallic scraping)

350
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,834
(wind rush)

351
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:17,402
(loud growling)

352
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,190
Oh, he doesn't like that, Ollie!

353
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,019
Cast one more spell at him!

354
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,352
(wind rush)

355
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,150
I think you defeated the
dragon, Ollie, high five!

356
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,410
Whoo!
- Whoo!

357
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,240
- [Bryan] That was so cool.

358
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,453
What do you got to say to him?

359
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:36,752
- You should be a nice dragon.

360
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,840
(Bryan chuckles)

361
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,570
Apparently, Momma is a real life wizard,

362
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,280
because she made all of
these magical tickets appear.

363
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,790
Missy's like, I know the system now.

364
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,310
We're hijacking the arcade right now.

365
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,290
- Apparently, they have
four of these games

366
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,980
and I beat every single one
so I have over 400 tickets.

367
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,683
Pretty excited.

368
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:03,083
This was the game that Ollie
annihilated the last time

369
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,730
we were at the arcade
and he won 1,000 tickets.

370
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,610
Punch again.

371
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,050
So close!

372
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,380
- We have finally made it back home,

373
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,430
and we had such a blast at Great Wolf.

374
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,166
Did you have fun, Finn?
- Yeah.

375
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,187
- [Missy] And everyone else had fun?

376
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:23,020
(all agree)

377
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,520
We had so so so much
fun and if you guys want

378
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,620
to see more really cool footage,

379
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,430
especially of even me
and the boys and Bryan,

380
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,480
make sure you guys go check out

381
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,200

382
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,270
They'll be a link down below.

383
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,250

384
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,560

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,290
and they make really really
fun and cool content.

386

Go check it out.

387
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,640
We're gonna go ahead and end the video,

388
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,730
because we're all ready to chill

389
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,590
and not do anything for
the rest of the night.

390
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,500
Make sure you give this video a

391
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
big thumbs up if you enjoyed it,

392
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,790
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

393
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,750
What do we all say?

394
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,583
- Bye!

395
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,337
Poop.
