1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:02,517
- [Bryan] Ooh, cool.

2
00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:03,968
- When I was a little
kid I used to read this.

3
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:05,781
- Notice how he lowered his voice?

4
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:06,716
(deep voice) "When I
was a little kid I used

5
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:09,416
"to read the potty book." (laughs)

- Good morning.

18
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:33,744
- [Bryan And Missy] Good morning.

19
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:38,180
- We are off to do something
very exciting today.

20
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,126
If you guys don't know,
on Christmas morning

21
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:42,924
Bryan, as one of my presents,
got me a horse bridle,

22
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:44,607
and that was kinda his way of saying

23
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:46,822
let's start that adventure.

24
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:49,081
We've been talking about
it for a long time.

25
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,341
- We've been talking about getting horses

26
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,873
for, before we were talking
about gettin' kids, obviously.

27
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:55,496
- I know, I've always wanted a horse,

28
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:58,345
and honestly, my parents,
or my mom always had a horse

29
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,232
when she was growing up.

30
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:01,291
My dad always had horses
when he was growing up,

31
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,864
and I even had horses
when I was growing up.

32
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,271
- She tells me these amazing stories

33
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:07,846
of riding bareback on horses when she was

34
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:10,594
just a little girl, and
I'm like, "That's amazing!"

35
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:11,636
- And I've just been kind of waiting

36
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:14,843
for that time when I finally can.

37
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:17,014
I know for one thing,
horses are expensive,

38
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:19,277
and they have a lot of costs that goes

39
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:22,031
along with them, and
growing up, we always didn't

40
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,088
have a ton of money and
I know that was always

41
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,777
a lot of stress on my mom and dad.

42
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:27,610
Well, owning horses is
like, they have vet bills,

43
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,612
and it's fees and it's this and that,

44
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,353
and so I just always
was like, "I don't know.

45
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:32,333
"Maybe one day I will."

46
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,738
Plus time, I mean, you need a lot of time

47
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:37,586
for horses, which I kind
of always am lacking on.

48
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:40,083
- But we're getting more
of, especially with the boys

49
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,805
sleeping together,
they're starting to become

50
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:42,638
more independent.

51
00:01:42,638 --> 00:01:43,694
- Yeah, they're starting to get to a point

52
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:45,638
where I could totally see
myself going out there

53
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,892
and riding for a couple
hours or even taking them.

54
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,141
They're at the age now
where they can learn

55
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:53,399
and kind of grow up
with the horses as well

56
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,133
and kind of have responsibility
with the horses, too,

57
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,462
so I feel like we're ready.

58
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:59,272
I feel excited to take the adventure.

59
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:01,671
Obviously, there's a part
of me that's always nervous,

60
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,213
which I think it'd be
crazy to not be nervous

61
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:06,161
about taking on such a huge decision

62
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:09,219
or responsibility that's
like, it's intense,

63
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,212
but I'm really excited about the decision

64
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:13,168
that we're doing right
now, because we found

65
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,993
a boarding place that's really close.

66
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:17,803
So what I want to do is
I want to get a horse

67
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:20,660
and really kind of grow a relationship

68
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,327
with this boarding place
so they can teach me,

69
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:24,878
because obviously I'm out of practice.

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,601
I really want to know a lot of stuff

71
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,219
before I have a horse on my property,

72
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,370
and so I want them to really teach me,

73
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,046
retrain me how to ride,
how to care for it,

74
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:36,294
and everything, and then once I'm ready

75
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:38,500
I do want to bring the
horse onto our property.

76
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,073
So I don't know how long that'll be.

77
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:41,758
I don't know if that be a few years

78
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:43,480
or if it'll be closer than that,

79
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,369
but I'm really, really excited about this

80
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:47,711
because I feel like this
is the best decision for us

81
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:50,443
and a way to kind of
like really get me ready

82
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:51,963
to own a horse on our property.

83
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,412
So right now we're gonna go
look at the boarding place

84
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:55,404
and maybe she'll have
horses that we can look at.

85
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:57,487
And I've just been doing a lot of research

86
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:59,373
about horses and what
kind of horse we want

87
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:01,692
and I've got friends that know everything

88
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:04,131
about horses too, and
I'm like, "You have to be

89
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:05,788
"with me if I get a horse!"

90
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:07,711
And so I'm just so excited.

91
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,128
This is so crazy.

92
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:11,490
I've always dreamt of this day.

93
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,627
It's gonna be a long process, and I don't

94
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,999
want to make any rash decisions,

95
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,663
and I don't wanna do anything too quickly,

96
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,947
so I'm excited to kind of take our time.

97
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:19,780
- We're getting closer.

98
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,613
- I see horses!

99
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,690
Horses everywhere.

100
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,523
Yay!

101
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:28,229
(soft electronic music)

102
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,770
All right, I am home with
my boys and my puppy dogs.

103
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,061
They're like soaking wet 'cause they were

104
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,287
playing in the (laughs) sprinkler.

105
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,659
I'm gonna go check on my chickens,

106
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,683
but I absolutely loved this boarding place

107
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:48,709
that we just went to.

108
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,542
Really cute and clean.

109
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:53,196
Some really nice trail rides.

110
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:55,241
And I just really liked the lady there.

111
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,931
I feel like she has a lot
that she can teach me.

112
00:03:57,931 --> 00:03:59,741
Sometimes I feel like it can be difficult

113
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:03,014
when you, when there's
someone who knows everything

114
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:04,622
and you're kinda like, "I just wanna know,

115
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,563
"like teach me," and they can sometimes

116
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:07,998
be like, oh, you're never gonna learn,

117
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,414
you're never gonna be
able to figure it out,

118
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:11,259
'cause this is something
you gotta, like, just know.

119
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,172
It's gotta come natural.

120
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,873
And so I really felt like I
didn't get that vibe from her.

121
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:16,725
She was just like, "Yeah,
if you need help picking

122
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,379
"out a horse, I'll come with you."

123
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,213
She's totally like, I'll
teach you everything

124
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:23,372
and you know, hopefully one day you could

125
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:24,530
move your horse to your own property.

126
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,346
So I feel like she was
a great, great lady.

127
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:29,333
She could be someone I really get to know

128
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,199
and a great property.

129
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,327
Lots of pasture area, arena,

130
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:35,437
an indoor boarding area,
outdoor boarding area,

131
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:36,557
it's really really cool.

132
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:37,703
So I'm excited.

133
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,378
Now I'm just on the
lookout for a good horse.

134
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:41,077
Which I don't wanna go too fast at.

135
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:43,912
I wanna find a good
horse that is a good fit

136
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:46,004
for me and my family.

137
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,287
Because I do have kids
that I know are gonna

138
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,814
wanna ride too. (laughs)

139
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:50,367
I'm excited to kind of get on that journey

140
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:51,819
and look for the right one,

141
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:52,919
but for now I'm gonna check on my hors --

142
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,172
On my horses.

143
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:55,422
On my chickens.

144
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,055
How ya guys doin'?

145
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:00,434
Which one of you keeps cock-a-doodle doing

146
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,581
in the mornin', huh?

147
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:04,203
(laughs) Which one keeps doin' it?

148
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,442
One is cock-a-doodle
doing and they all look

149
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:10,021
like hens to me, I guess
except for Ursula back there.

150
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,189
I guess she could be a rooster, but to me

151
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,122
she looks like a hen.

152
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:16,372
You must be a rooster, huh?

153
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,787
And he was, or she was, picked on a lot

154
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,450
when it was a baby.

155
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,352
So maybe now that I got rid
of those other roosters,

156
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:25,758
it's like, "I'm a freak chicken!

157
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,637
"I'm a rooster!

158
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,518
"I'm a king of the pen!"

159
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:29,993
I don't know, so.

160
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:31,539
All right, I gotta grab all my eggs.

161
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,126
I got them scattered;
I think one of them's

162
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,183
playing with the eggs.

163
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,872
All right, I just saw Ursula try and pin

164
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:41,039
down my chickens, so you're
officially a rooster, huh?

165
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,197
Yeah, totally just tried to pin 'em down.

166
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:45,634
Thank you.

167
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:46,593
Look at this!

168
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,806
I get to use my, my little
apron that Bryan got me.

169
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,347
Yay!

170
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:52,597
Check this out.

171
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:56,226
One.

172
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,190
Two.

173
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,607
Three.

174
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:03,192
Four.

175
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:04,792
Five.

176
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:05,625
Six.

177
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,718
Seven.

178
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:10,224
Look at that!

179
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:12,271
This is so cute.

180
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,354
Look at that.

181
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,201
I've got seven eggs in here.

182
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,417
I was like, "There's no
way I could hold these."

183
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,236
I'm like, "I almost forgot my apron!"

184
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,645
So exciting, look, mommy
can hold all the eggs

185
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:23,285
without breaking them!

186
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,118
- I wanna see.

187
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:28,716
- [Missy] See, look how
many eggs we got in there.

188
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:29,636
There's even one up here.

189
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:30,919
Isn't that handy?

190
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,933
Pretty cool, huh?

191
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,296
- Let's go check out the snow.

192
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:36,691
- Yeah, we're gonna go check
out the snow right now.

193
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,299
You guys don't know, we
caught the abominable

194
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,708
snowman the other day and he brought snow

195
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,946
to our yard here in
Southern California, huh?

196
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,779
- Yeah.

197
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,931
- And we went sledding and we
played and played and played

198
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,380
and it was actually kind
of a warm day today,

199
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,413
so I was kinda hoping that
there'd still be a little

200
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,118
bit of snow left.

201
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:55,069
(Finley yelling)

202
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,263
What is that?

203
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:58,346
And I see a snowman, huh?

204
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,675
- Look!

205
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:02,757
- Let's go check out that snowman.

206
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,018
Who built this snowman?

207
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:07,467
What a second, did you
make that snowman, Ollie?

208
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,637
- Yeah.

209
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,887
- [Missy] Yeah?

210
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,832
So you made this?

211
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,914
- [Oliver] No.

212
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:15,677
- [Missy] Wait.

213
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:17,207
What is going on here?

214
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:18,040
- Hi!

215
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:22,564
- [Missy] Wait a second.

216
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:24,067
Is that daddy?

217
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:24,900
- Yeah!

218
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,431
- [Missy] There's a snowman down here.

219
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:30,598
- I'm a snowman and I've come to play.

220
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:33,845
- [Missy] (laughs) Is that so cool?

221
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:37,568
- Will you guys look at this block of ice?

222
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:39,211
- [Missy] Yeah, it's
basically just ice now.

223
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,544
Woo!

224
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,391
Very slippery.

225
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,552
- So you know how in Frosty the Snowman,

226
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,028
they build a snowman and
it comes to life, right?

227
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:46,218
- Yeah.

228
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:47,758
- Well, I'm basically a
snowman brought to life.

229
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,548
I thought we could play with some

230
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:52,070
RC cars!

231
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,718
- [Missy] Do you wanna play with RC cars?

232
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:54,979
- Yeah.

233
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:56,093
- [Missy] Yeah, that sounds so fun.

234
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:57,216
Does that sound fun, Finn?

235
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:59,383
He's even got his RC dino.

236
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,189
He's like, "Let's go."

237
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,606
(rock music)

238
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:09,150
- All right, we are takin'
our Traxxas X-Maxx out

239
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,921
on our huge chunk of ice.

240
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:13,336
A couple days ago this
was a huge sledding hill,

241
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:17,451
and now it is basically
frozen just like my heart.

242
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,151
(Missy laughs)

243
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:20,051
In this snowman costume.

244
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:21,072
- [Missy] Yes, are you cold in there?

245
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:22,560
- I thought it might actually be cool

246
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,059
to ride around on the
snow, see how it does.

247
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:26,483
You guys wanna see how it does?

248
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:27,316
- Yeah!

249
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:28,149
- [Missy] Woo!

250
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:31,018
- [Bryan] We're gonna tear it up.

251
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:33,435
(rock music)

252
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,380
It is slick, it is flying on that ice.

253
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,213
- [Missy] That's cool.

254
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:49,421
And check out this, the snow has made

255
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:52,129
all this clean, it's like all this color

256
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,134
and then you've got like the pink rock,

257
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,246
and you can see all the white rock,

258
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:56,496
so interesting.

259
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,183
Woo!

260
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:03,714
Go, Finn, go! (laughs)

261
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:06,798
All right, we're gonna how
high this thing can jump.

262
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:07,631
- Ready?

263
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,193
- [Missy] Let's do it.

264
00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:11,026
Woo!

265
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,983
Perfect!

266
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:14,908
Yep, perfect.

267
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:18,355
(rock music)

268
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,848
- [Bryan] We're tryin'
to pull Finn in the sled.

269
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:49,479
- Not working, Finn, you're gonna have

270
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,481
to lose some weight.

271
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:51,706
(Bryan laughs)

272
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:52,789
- [Bryan] Oh!

273
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,454
Yeah.

274
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:56,287
- I half-hearted it.

275
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:57,786
- [Bryan] Well, you
probably shouldn't do that.

276
00:09:57,786 --> 00:09:58,703
- Nah, nah.

277
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:01,953
- [Bryan] All right, Missy's
testin' out the sled.

278
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:03,929
(Missy screams)

279
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:05,901
(Bryan laughs)

280
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,306
All right, Ollie's hoppin' in the sled.

281
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,148
Hang onto the reins!

282
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:11,648
- One, two, three!

283
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:14,665
- [Bryan] Woo!

284
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:17,694
Nice.

285
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:19,741
(Bryan laughs)

286
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:23,241
(soft instrumental music)

287
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:31,477
All right, I think this
snowman is melting, guys.

288
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:33,739
It's gettin' really hot out here.

289
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:35,470
I don't think this snow has,

290
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,159
has much longer to go, honestly.

291
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,215
I think it's gonna be done in probably

292
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:39,845
like a week. (laughs)

293
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:41,726
This is also very interesting to wear.

294
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:42,559
What?

295
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:46,022
You wanna sit on the truck?

296
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:53,048
All righty, it is now
time for a birthday party!

297
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:54,798
You so excited, boys?

298
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,643
(Missy laughs)

299
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,256
Birthday party?

300
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:02,089
Anyone?

301
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:03,819
- I guess we should go home.

302
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:06,276
- We're at a birthday party,

303
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:08,897
and both the boys fell
asleep on the way here

304
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,145
and it's kinda cute.

305
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:11,337
They kinda needed a nap.

306
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,240
- Especially Finn, he was like, "Aaaah!"

307
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,668
- Oh yeah, he's been two days without one.

308
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:16,858
- [Missy] They're gonna have a fun time.

309
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,613
- [Bryan] They are gonna have a fun time.

310
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:19,569
- [Missy] But they needed a little nap.

311
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:20,515
- We'll go play in the
bouncy house without 'em.

312
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,171
No, we'll take 'em, I guess.

313
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:25,823
Look how cute they are in
their matching Mickey shirts.

314
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,656
You boys.

315
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,423
- We're home now.

316
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,527
And are you a sleepy bug?

317
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:32,360
- No.

318
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,948
- Yeah, you are.

319
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:35,755
Fell asleep for just a
minute in the car, huh?

320
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:36,588
- Yeah.

321
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:38,783
- Yeah, we are home and I
gotta go get my chickens

322
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,750
in; they've been out all day.

323
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,806
And the dogs have been in the side yard.

324
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:45,289
Since Luna is still a little bit crazy

325
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,111
and I can't totally trust
her with the chickens

326
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:49,284
if I'm not around, so
when the chickens got out,

327
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:53,201
and I did not have the
time to put them back in

328
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:55,918
before I left, it's dark out.

329
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:57,896
Are you gonna help me get the chickens in?

330
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:58,796
- [Oliver And Finley] Yeah.

331
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:00,867
- Oh wait, are the chickens already in?

332
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:01,945
Let me see.

333
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:03,880
Oh, looks like the chickens
actually made it all

334
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,713
into their house and
then a wind must've come

335
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:08,301
and just blown this shut.

336
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,067
Because it was just kinda stuck like that.

337
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:11,968
So good, I'm glad y'all are good.

338
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:12,869
(laughs)

339
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:15,806
Everyone's safe and sound,
and this little one's

340
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:18,593
turnin' into a rooster over here,

341
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:20,631
so he'll be cock-a-doodle
doing bright and early,

342
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:21,563
won't ya?

343
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:23,149
6:30. (laughs)

344
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,575
All right, let's close this up

345
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,525
so nothing gets to them,

346
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:29,400
and we gotta go get
our doggies next, 'kay?

347
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,233
- Yeah.

348
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,066
- Okay.

349
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,818
All right, boys, let's
go get our puppy dogs.

350
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:33,956
I think they're over there.

351
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,680
We gotta go get our puppy dogs.

352
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,656
Here.

353
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,118
We gotta get our doggies.

354
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:39,569
They're over here jumpin'.

355
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:40,643
They're like, "Come get us!

356
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:43,729
"Come get us!" (laughs)

357
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,733
Oh my goodness, Luna, you are so crazy.

358
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,341
(laughs)

359
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:49,546
Gotcha!

360
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:50,590
Woo!

361
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,423
(dog barks)

362
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:53,057
Finn, good thinkin'.

363
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:54,449
All right, let's go, let's go.

364
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:55,282
(dog barks)

365
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:56,607
Get in the house, let's get in the house!

366
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,940
Hey, puppy dogs, missed you.

367
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:02,254
They've only been in
there for a few hours.

368
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:04,043
They act like they've
been in there all day.

369
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,459
(screams)

370
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,959
(soft instrumental music)

371
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,875
- Where are you goin', Finn?

372
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,708
- Hidin'.

373
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,577
- Oh, you're hidin'?

374
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:22,323
They're hiding in their tent. (laughs)

375
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:23,617
Where are they?

376
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:24,460
(Finley screams)

377
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,314
There they are!

378
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:27,501
- Got some new books to read!

379
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,124
- [Bryan] Ooh!

380
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,110
Some new books?

381
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,943
That's cool.

382
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,808
- The Potty Book, we
read this one with Ollie.

383
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:35,782
Bigfoot.

384
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,700
- [Bryan] Ooh, cool.

385
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,959
- When I was a little
kid I used to read this.

386
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,310
- Notice how he lowered his voice?

387
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,795
(deep voice) "When I
was a little kid I used

388
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:45,562
"to read the potty book." (laughs)

389
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:46,471
So funny.

390
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:48,282
I don't know if I've ever really

391
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:50,007
vlogged while coming up here,

392
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:51,632
but I wanted to show
you guys what happens.

393
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:55,222
My shoulders are too large
to fit through the door.

394
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:57,139
I have to angle myself.

395
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,726
(groans)

396
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:00,559
Hey, guys.

397
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,392
- [Oliver And Finley] Hi.

398
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:02,840
- [Bryan] Is it story time?

399
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,673
- [Oliver And Finley] Yeah.

400
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:04,989
- [Bryan] We get to read
books and go to bed?

401
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:07,340
Did you guys have fun
at the birthday party?

402
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,228

- Yeah.

406
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,491

doing so good in their bed

407
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:16,418

bedtime, so we're gonna read

408
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:18,430

Thumbs-ups!

413
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:26,767
And we will see you mañana.

414
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,589
Boys, what do you say?

415
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,522
