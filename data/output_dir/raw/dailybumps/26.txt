1
00:00:00,613 --> 00:00:01,709
- Where are you, Kelly?

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:02,911
Come back!

6
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:10,191
- [Missy And Ollie] Good morning!

7
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,599
- We are up this morning bright and early

8
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,840
and we are making pancakes.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,292
Does that sound good, boys?

10
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:18,125
- [Both] Yeah.

11
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,670
- We actually didn't have any pancake mix,

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,741
but we did have waffle mix, so I attempted

13
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:24,720
to modify the waffle mix,

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,260
and hopefully we're
gonna make some pancakes.

15
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,758
It's actually way past Valentine's,

16
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:29,550
but I just thought it'd be really fun

17
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,278
to make heart-shaped pancakes

18
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,252
out of these little cookie
cutters that I have,

19
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:35,568
so we'll see how it works

20
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,887
and if they actually turn out.

21
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:40,893
This poor kid, how are you doing today?

22
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:41,970
- Good.

23
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,992
- [Missy] Good, what is going on?

24
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:43,991
- My ear hurts.

25
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:47,370
- Aww, so if you guys don't know,

26
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,848
we have been doing a
little bit of swimming

27
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,330
the past few days 'cause
our pool is super warm

28
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,066
and it actually has been pretty nice,

29
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:56,263
although the cold weather is back,

30
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:59,678
but I think Ollie's got
a little earache, huh?

31
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:01,730
It's nothing too major yet.

32
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,300
He doesn't have a fever or anything,

33
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,140
but he just keeps saying it hurts,

34
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,590
which usually means that
he probably has outer

35
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,810
swimmer's ear, which he
gets every once in a while.

36
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,010
I got them a ton as a kid,

37
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,224
and it hurts to the touch.

38
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:13,665
So which ear hurts, bud?

39
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:14,600
- This one.

40
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,847
- [Missy] Oh, it hurts when you touch it.

41
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:18,250
- Yeah.

42
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,712
- Aww, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,479
So something that always
worked when I was a kid was

44
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,953
colloidal silver and so
we're gonna put a few drops

45
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,878
in and put a movie on
while I make the pancakes

46
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:30,240
and let this sit in your ear.

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,710
And this usually actually fixes it.

48
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,940
If it doesn't, we'll
take him to the doctor,

49
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,697
but this, honestly, usually does it.

50
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,600
It dries it all up and you
know what also does it?

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,299
Garlic, but that stuff smells disgusting.

52
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,924
Your kid will start to
smell like an Italian dish.

53
00:01:42,924 --> 00:01:45,220
(laughs)

54
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,060
But I do use it,

55
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,419
they have garlic drops

56
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:49,230
and then they have the colloidal silver,

57
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,300
mix those together

58
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,760
and his ear should be good to go

59
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,178
within the next day or two.

60
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:55,220
All right, let's go ahead
and put some drops in.

61
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,968
You can show all the kids how easy

62
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,477
it is to do so no one's scared, okay?

63
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:03,092
All right, so we just
take this little syringe.

64
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:07,810
We just do two or three drops in his ear.

65
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,643
Good job.

66
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:10,120
Just like that.

67
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,288
Is it a little cold?

68
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:12,300
- Yeah.

69
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,390
(Missy laughs)

70
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,680
- [Missy] And then you
can just massage it in

71
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,781
so it goes into the ear canal.

72
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:20,580
Yay!
Finn, give your brother kisses

73
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,413
and tell him it'll be okay.

74
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:22,246
- [Finn] Be okay.

75
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,168
- Aww, all right, let's
put on a movie, 'kay?

76
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:28,751
(gentle music)

77
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,660
All right, we are dressed and ready

78
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,451
for the day and where are we headed?

79
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,725
- To Auntie's house!

80
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:07,896
- Yeah!

81
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,120
- We're actually headed
to Mimi and Papa's house

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,540
and Auntie is here.

83
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,993
- We are gonna film a video with Auntie.

84
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:15,888
- [Missy] Ooh, he gets so
excited when Auntie comes down

85
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:17,055
to film videos with him.

86
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,926
There she is!

87
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:20,428
- Hi, guys!

88
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:21,645
What are you doin'?

89
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:22,480
- Good.

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,360
- Are you ready to film?

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,411
- Yeah.

92
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:25,244
- You know what we're doin'?

93
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:26,077
- What?

94
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:26,910
- I'll tell you inside.

95
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,030
- (laughs) Okay.

96
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,793
- [Missy] Check it out,
my dad's car is sitting

97
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,191
outside of the house.

98
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,367
How's it been?

99
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,600
- Oh, pretty good.

100
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,790
- [Missy] Have you enjoyed it?

101
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,880
- Yeah, I've been enjoying it a lot.

102
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,088
I mean, I have locked
myself out of it twice.

103
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,670
- [Missy] So you guys know,
it has this special little

104
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,651
key fob 'cause it doesn't
have door handles,

105
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:48,540
which means all you have
to do is leave the keys

106
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,560
in there and close the
door and you can't get in.

107
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,700
- I started it and went, "Oh,
I gotta go get something,"

108
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,372
and I got out and went--

109
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:56,495
(Missy laughs)

110
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:59,087
I spent 30 minutes,
while the car's running.

111
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:00,743
- [Missy] Oh my, it's like
(imitates engine noises).

112
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:02,611
- Probably overheating and stuff,

113
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:03,889
trying to get a wire in there and stuff.

114
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:05,460
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, you're so silly.

115
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
- [Papa] Then I got it.

116
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,410
- [Missy] Yeah, well
hopefully you can fix that.

117
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,200
- Because it was a surprise
car, I didn't get to talk

118
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,801
to the guy and he told me
there's a release cable.

119
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,932
(Missy laughs)

120
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:17,269
You just gotta pull the cable.

121
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,304
- [Missy] Now he knows that,

122
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,755
so it'll probably make it a lot easier

123
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,119
for him to get in, but yeah.

124
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,450
I think Dad's enjoying it.

125
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,560
So I was actually only planning

126
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,310
to leave Ollie at the house,

127
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,700
but like I was thinking,

128
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,000
Finn was not having it.

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,965
I was driving away, he was like (screams).

130
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:36,774
So Auntie was nice enough
to say, "Hey, he can be

131
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,170
"in the video too."

132
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,104
I had to run to Target really quick.

133
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,595
I've got a big old bin back there.

134
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,130
A lot of stuff for my horse,

135
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,070
which I'm headed up to.

136
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,132
He has a training lesson right now,

137
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,793
so I'm gonna go up there

138
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:48,860
and hang out with him.

139
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,900
My dad's gonna help me
kind of spruce up his stall

140
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,920
and all that.

141
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,832
Yay, it's gonna be a fun day.

142
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,096
I get to see my horse.

143
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:55,980
All right, so I just go to the barn

144
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,465
and Nacho had this lesson

145
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,928
and he was pretty good.

146
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:01,292
But I want to show you guys

147
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,940
his new stall area.

148
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,116
Look how cute it is.

149
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:06,207
So I've got my little tack box

150
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,773
and then here I'm gonna get some pictures

151
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:10,363
of us in here, like me and Nacho

152
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:12,190
and the kids and Nacho.

153
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,618
I got some treats for us.

154
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:15,599
Up here, treats for the horses. (laughs)

155
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,927
And then what he eats and his name.

156
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,920
I think I'm gonna put
a little plant there.

157
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,946
So cute, I love it.

158
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,150
It's got stuff for hanging.

159
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,040
I think I wanna get a wreath here.

160
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,160
And this is Cosmo.

161
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,270
I am just totally obsessed
with my little area.

162
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,587
I think it's so cute.

163
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:32,390
And I have all my little letters here.

164
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,290
I'm gonna tear up.

165
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,800
But Finn's like, "I wanna go home!"

166
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,989
And he wants to go home,
so I'm leaving now.

167
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:38,040
Say, "I wanna go home!"

168
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,450
- I wanna go home!

169
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,210
- [Missy] He's just
sitting up here saying,

170
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,810
"Mom, hurry up."

171
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,900
- So Ollie and I just
got back from a haircut.

172
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,407
New digs, look at that, dude.

173
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:50,330
- Yeah.

174
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,360
- Yeah.

175
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,400
I have to say, our new
little Dory is doing so good.

176
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,740
She's getting along
with all the other fish.

177
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,547
No one's tried to attack
her, so that's awesome.

178
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,115
Check out this anemone.

179
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,830
Hey Ollie, can you say anemone?

180
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,420
- A-nem-o-ne.

181
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,146
- [Bryan] An-en-o-me.

182
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:07,979
- An enemy.

183
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:09,830
- [Bryan] An-en-o-me.

184
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,510
- I can't say it.

185
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,530
- He was pressing his
face up against the glass

186
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,594
and trying to say it.

187
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:15,934
- He's really big.
- It's so funny.

188
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:16,767
- Huh?

189
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:17,600
- He's really big.

190
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,919
- [Bryan] That's the anemone.

191
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:19,790
- Yeah.

192
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,840
- [Bryan] Yeah, so this
anemone right now is

193
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,340
actually white because it
has a like an antibiotic

194
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,230
to keep it alive.

195
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,610
But he said it's actually gonna change

196
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,780
to its original color, which is

197
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,800
like a bright purple or red.

198
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,180
And look at Dory, she's so happy, huh?

199
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,070
- She's so cute, and she's getting along

200
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,219
with everyone.

201
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:36,764
We've got some new little plants.

202
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,930
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, those ones are out now,

203
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,810
so we got those.

204
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,908
- [Missy] I love that one.

205
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:42,889
- [Bryan] Yeah, and Patrick's
still hangin' out right there.

206
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,480
- Lookee there, he's
actually getting ready

207
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,295
to bend back and catch some food.

208
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,914
- [Bryan] So he's basically
saying he's in this current

209
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:51,415
right here, he's basically
catching all the food

210
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:52,531
that's coming out of there.

211
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,058
- So I think that means he's gonna live.

212
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:54,891
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

213
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,480
- But look at him, he's
actually slowly taking

214
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,905
each little tentacle down

215
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:02,428
and pulling his little arm back.

216
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:03,750
It's the cutest thing.

217
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,970
- [Bryan] It's crazy.

218
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,567
Yeah, he says, "I'm
gonna get me some food."

219
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,501
That is one of the new additions

220
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,853
that Missy picked out.

221
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:12,473
Very, very cool.

222
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,080
And then this one looks so cool, too.

223
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,228
It looks like a bunch of hands

224
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,360
sort of reaching up.

225
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,539
- Like little eyeballs.

226
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,956
(calm music)

227
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,840
Okay, so we are home

228
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,723
and I'm headed out to
check out my chickens.

229
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:33,150
We had a little bit of an
incident the other day.

230
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,742
Basically what happened
was my chicken coop

231
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:37,557
got so cold, and when it gets cold,

232
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,053
things kind of adjust in it.

233
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,440
It's probably because it's
just not really put down

234
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,010
on a solid foundation, but things adjust

235
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,910
and what happened was
this ended up just getting

236
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,680
so loose because it was
cold that it dropped open

237
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,670
and so one morning, chickens got out.

238
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,610
This was yesterday morning.

239
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,250
The sun comes up and
there's a way to get out,

240
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,623
they always wanna leave.

241
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:00,170
So they got out and I
didn't know they were out

242
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,062
and of course I let Luna out

243
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:03,520
when she wanted to go out,

244
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,526
which was very early, like
five a.m. I let her out.

245
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,490
I didn't even notice
that the chickens were

246
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,760
out until 8 a.m. and I
had already brought Luna

247
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,050
in after that.

248
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,100
So anyways, all my chickens
are there except one,

249
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,646
and no one is hurt, no one had any issues,

250
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,212
because Luna is kind of a crazy dog,

251
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:21,096
she's had some incidents with the chickens

252
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:23,494
a couple times, so here's all my chickens,

253
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:26,293
but I am missing one chicken

254
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:28,184
and the chicken I'm missing is Kelly.

255
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:30,620
I'm missing Kelly.

256
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,386
She was the gray and white speckled one.

257
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,685
Now, good news is she's not dead,

258
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:38,566
or at least didn't die by Luna at least.

259
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:41,111
Because there's no feathers and if,

260
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:43,159
I mean, to be honest, if she was dead,

261
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,108
Luna would have --

262
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,750
it would be around here.

263
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,240
So we haven't seen her.

264
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,340
She's not here.

265
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,870
I'm guessing she got scared and flew away

266
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,670
and is just either waiting for a safe time

267
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,700
when she can come back

268
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,330
or is lost, I'm not really sure.

269
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,447
So we are gonna go look for Kelly,

270
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:59,733
see if we can find her.

271
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm hoping she's okay.

272
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,350
I have lost a chicken before

273
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,930
who's got scared and left,

274
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,335
and I swear it was lots of days later

275
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:09,877
that it actually did come back.

276
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:12,190
So I feel like she's gonna come back.

277
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,940
But we gotta see if we can find her first.

278
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,285
She's probably sitting in a bush, okay?

279
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,120
- [Ollie] Okay.

280
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,450
- [Missy] Let's go see what we can find.

281
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,687
Uh, Ollie, I think I just found a clue.

282
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:35,199
Uh-oh guys, I actually
didn't see this yesterday.

283
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,549
There's a feather.

284
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:38,308
Karma, find this chicken.

285
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,183
There actually is a couple feathers.

286
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:42,198
Oh no, we have this bog ol'
pile of rocks right here

287
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,753
and I'm wondering if she flew in here

288
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:46,232
or got stuck in here.

289
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:47,973
That would be a pretty safe spot.

290
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:50,425
Nothing else would probably get her, but

291
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:53,047
she's gotta come out.

292
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,330
- [Ollie] Yeah.

293
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,163
- [Missy] Is she in there?

294
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,700
Do you guys see her?

295
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,013
Did you see her?

296
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:00,950
- Yeah!

297
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,491
- [Missy] Oh gosh, no you didn't.

298
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:05,590
Kelly, where are you?

299
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,860
All right, we're looking down in here.

300
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,221
I really don't think she's in here.

301
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:17,980
This is honestly pretty
interesting, actually.

302
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,250
I see a feather there.

303
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,800
It feels really deep.

304
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,956
I do see feathers in there.

305
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,039
Look at that.

306
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,918
Those are definitely her feathers, but

307
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,470
I don't see her.

308
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,380
- [Finn] I see it!

309
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,020
- [Missy] What do you see?

310
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,853
- [Finn] I see.

311
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:32,993
- [Missy] Do you see feathers?

312
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:34,408
- [Finn] Yeah.

313
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:35,241
- [Bryan] You checkin' in there?

314
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:36,130
- [Missy] Do you see the chicken?

315
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,280
- [Finn] No.

316
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,890
- I don't see her, I'm looking in

317
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,690
all these crevices, and I
just don't see anything.

318
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,940
I'm wondering if maybe she flew in here,

319
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,080
got scared, climbed up here and then just

320
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,323
flew over here, but gosh,
if she's over there,

321
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:51,892
I don't know where she could be

322
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,461
and I did see a coyote
back here this morning,

323
00:10:55,461 --> 00:11:00,260
so hopefully she was able to hide.

324
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,257
- [Bryan] Where's the chicken, Finn?

325
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:04,070
You really think she's in there?

326
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,160
- Yeah.

327
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,556
- [Bryan] Karma's like,
"Really, really Missy?

328
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,390
"I can't protect you over there."

329
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,940
- [Ollie] I wanna go over there.

330
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,040
- Let's see if it scares her.

331
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,800
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, out of the bushes?

332
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,196
Ollie's got her feather.

333
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,634
You think it's gonna help find her?

334
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,690
- Yeah.

335
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,108
- [Bryan] It's a clue, right?

336
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,104
- Yeah.

337
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:21,206
Maybe this is the wrong clue.

338
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:23,023
- [Bryan] It's the wrong clue?

339
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:23,980
- I think so.

340
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,540
- Yeah, we need to find the right clue.

341
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,594
We're basically on a treasure
hunt for our chicken.

342
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:30,846
- I found another clue!

343
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:31,995
- [Missy] Another one?

344
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,279
- [Ollie] Yeah!

345
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,211
- Another feather?

346
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,220
- [Ollie] Yeah!

347
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,185
- [Bryan] Not over there?

348
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:39,410
- No, well, I need some food.

349
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,732
- [Bryan] Oh, you gotta shake food?

350
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,932
- I don't know how I'm gonna get back,

351
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:44,220
so I just might be lost too.

352
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,680
- [Bryan] Okay, bye.

353
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,109
We lost Mama and the chicken.

354
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:51,234
Lookit, Finn's like, "How do I get over?"

355
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:52,265
There you go, babe.

356
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:54,712
It's just a silly little fence.

357
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:57,177
Ollie's got some chicken food.

358
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:59,680
Maybe we should throw it near the fence

359
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,632
and see if she comes, Ollie.

360
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,181
Here, grab some food

361
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,983
and come over here.

362
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:06,608
Actually, what if we put it right here?

363
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:09,253
Maybe it'll want to
come and get some food.

364
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:11,446
I hope she's okay.

365
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,125
- Yeah, me too.

366
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,860
- So it is cold.

367
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,252
Everyone seems to have abandoned me

368
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:18,300
of looking for the chicken.

369
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,441
I went around, shook food,

370
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,623
and kinda like put food places

371
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:23,183
to see if maybe she'll come out,

372
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:26,295
but my last resort is that I put Luna

373
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,907
in the house and I'm
letting the chickens out

374
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:31,172
and I'm hoping that
maybe by them, you know,

375
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:32,954
making all their sounds and all that,

376
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:35,456
she'll hear them and maybe come out

377
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:38,490
and see that it's safe.

378
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,891
All right, so you find Kelly,

379
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,436
tell her it's safe to come home

380
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:43,707
and she needs to come back

381
00:12:43,707 --> 00:12:47,920
so she can be safe and
eat food and drink water.

382
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,300
I feel so bad that she's lost.

383
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,310
I really am sad that she is lost.

384
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,020
I'm really hoping that
she finds her way back.

385
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,548
And honestly, like I said,
this has happened before

386
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,550
and I remember being like,

387
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,160
I remember, I think it was like weeks

388
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,080
that she was gone, but maybe
it was just a few days,

389
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,190
but she was gone for a long time.

390
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,520
And I was like, "Guess she's gone,"

391
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,330
and then she just randomly
came back one day,

392
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,010
so we'll see.

393
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,416
You find Kelly, okay guys?

394
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,250
I'll keep Luna away from you guys.

395
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,900
Are you guys ready to go?

396
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,739
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

397
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:13,900
- [Missy] Woo-hoo!

398
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,227
We're gonna go to dinner.

399
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,720
- All right, I'm all ready for dinner.

400
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,656
I just had to blow my nose.

401
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:20,986
I had a big old booger hanging from it.

402
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,482
What?

403
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,315
What?

404
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:26,491
Oh, it's another booger?

405
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:30,430
You pulled this booger
out of my nose, Ollie.

406
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:33,610
- [Missy] And your brain didn't pop out

407
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,760
when you pulled it out?

408
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,920
- No, is that happens in your brain?

409
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,232
- [Missy] Yeah, the brain just pops out

410
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,859
of the head.

411
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,970
- [Bryan] That is scary.

412
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,330
- [Missy] Is that so silly?

413
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,190
- Yeah.

414
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,740
- Help me pick my booger.

415
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,616
- [Missy] Oh geez.

416
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,600
- [Bryan] Finn, help him pick his booger.

417
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,150
- [Missy] Pick that booger out.

418
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,713
- [Bryan] Grab it.

419
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:56,210
Oh, you got it.

420
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,941
(babbling)

421
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,108
- [Ollie] You do it, guys.

422
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,557
- [Bryan] Ah, you got a big one.

423
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,876
- [Missy] That actually
consisted of boogers.

424
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:08,783
- [Bryan] All right,
Finn, climb in the car.

425
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,036
It's time to go, right here.

426
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:11,534
There you go.

427
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,385
- [Missy] Do you want me to help you?

428
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,519
- [Finn] No.

429
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,352
- Can I help you?

430
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:16,505
- [Finn] No.

431
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:17,338
- Here.

432
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:18,171
- [Finn] No.

433
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,160
- Here.

434
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,700
- [Finn] No!

435
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,255
- [Bryan] Okay, well then, you get in!

436
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:23,088
- [Missy] Get in your seat!

437
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:24,817
- [Bryan] Mr. Independent. (laughs)

438
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,360
He sees Ollie and he's like--

439
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,314
- [Missy] Can I just help you with this?

440
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:29,147
- No!

441
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:35,900
- Finn, come on then, get in the seat.

442
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,347
So funny because Ollie has been

443
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:40,265
so much more independent
at getting in the seat

444
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:42,030
and taking his buckles off

445
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,863
and putting them on,

446
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:44,890
and I think Finn has been taking notice.

447
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,490
- [Missy] Yeah, you have to let me--

448
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,505
Okay, get in the seat!

449
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:49,946
- [Bryan] He's like, "Don't do it!"

450
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,186
Now he's just teasing you.

451
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:54,131
Whoa, dude, you are quite the climber.

452
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:55,831
Dude, what are you doing?

453
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:56,990
- [Finn] I shoe.

454
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,423
- [Bryan] You're stuck in this giant shoe!

455
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:01,572
- [Missy] Just put one foot in there.

456
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:02,758
- [Bryan] See if you can do it.

457
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:03,830
- [Missy] Just one foot.

458
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,663
- [Bryan] There you go.

459
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:05,954
- [Missy] Look at that shoe!

460
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:08,337
You've got one little
foot and one big foot!

461
00:15:08,337 --> 00:15:09,254
- Hi, guys!

462
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:11,433
- All right, Finn, what do
you say we go eat dinner?

463
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:14,310
(laughing)

464
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,321
He's excited.

465
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:18,543
- All right guys, we had a great dinner

466
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,330
and actually already put the boys to bed.

467
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,900
We had a really fun day.

468
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,250
I think I'm gonna go
ahead and end the video

469
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,730
and I'm gonna get ready for bed,

470
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,315
so make sure you give this video

471
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:30,930
a big thumbs-up if you did enjoy it.

472
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,830
I am really, really hoping

473
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,422
that Kelly comes back.

474
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:36,160
Please be thinking about her.

475
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,130
Hopefully we'll see her soon.

476
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,428
I'll let you guys know if she ends up

477
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,350
making her way back home.

478
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,640
For now, we'll see you guys tomorrow.

479
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,175
Bye, boop.

480
00:15:44,175 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
