1
00:00:00,204 --> 00:00:03,191
- [Missy] Hey Ollie, do
you want to see your room?

2
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:06,191
Alright, come in, what do you think?

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:09,543
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,773
♫ This is who we are

5
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,159
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

6
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,711
♫ Shot among the stars

7
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,928
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

8
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:21,340
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,687
♫ This is our life; Let's live it

10
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:27,443
♫ Live it forever

11
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:28,418
- Good morning

12
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:30,556
- Good morning, where we at, Ollie?

13
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,807
- I'm at Mimi and Papas.

14
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:35,632
- Mimi and Papas, and they
are playing in their little

15
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:36,465
closet.

16
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,705
Look how cute this little closet is.

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,394
Finn is having a blast.

18
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:44,170
And we are really excited that
they have little staircase

19
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,297
closet like this for toys and stuff.

20
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:49,747
And what is really, really cool is we

21
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:53,155
brought out a couple of their
toys that used to be in our

22
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:56,627
playroom and they are actually
like the toys that they love,

23
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:59,285
but, we were cycling through
them and they got actually put

24
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:02,822
up into attic and so I just
never got a chance to like

25
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:04,512
cycle through them.

26
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,695
So, they haven't seen these
toys in probably almost

27
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:09,333
a year and they are so excited.

28
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,904
Like, Mimi and Papa have the best toys.

29
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:14,945
There's actually a lot of
toys there that I'm even

30
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:17,941
attached to because um
their toys they have had

31
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,061
for like when they were
little, little, little, so.

32
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:22,145
Bryan is workin' on some
stuff, so I thought I would

33
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:25,108
come over here and help
some, do some unpacking, and

34
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:27,908
I'm really excited to get
the boys' room all set up.

35
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:30,375
If you didn't know, by the way,
my parents moved (giggling).

36
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,835
This house now has a
bedroom for the boys, and we

37
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:35,021
are super excited about it.

38
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:37,198
So, I think I'm going to
help get that room setup

39
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,312
because she's been doing a
lot of unpacking the past few

40
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:42,899
days and I have barely had
time to help out with anything.

41
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,271
So, the boys are going to
play in the playroom while

42
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:48,701
I get your room all set up, okay.

43
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:49,534
Hey, ollie,

44
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:50,367
- What?

45
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,868
- [Missy] what kind of
theme do you want for your

46
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:53,313
bedroom at Mimi and Papas?

47
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,601
- A bunk bed.

48
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,202
- [Missy] A bunk, oh so
you want a bunk bed here?

49
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:57,367
- Yeah.

50
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,138
- That would be pretty neat.

51
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:00,458
How about dinosaurs?

52
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:04,625
- Oh yes, maybe a toy
dinosaur, like maybe this one.

53
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:08,759
- [Missy] O, Like a dinosaur
theme, that would be so cool.

54
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,254
So, this is the boys' room,
and they have right now,

55
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:17,006
a full or maybe it might
be a queen bed in here.

56
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,898
We'll eventually switch it
out, I think, for like a

57
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:22,121
bunk bed, but now that
might actually work.

58
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,089
Finn doesn't really like
sleeping in cribs anymore,

59
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:28,163
so they can either share
on this bed or when we get

60
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:31,131
the bunk bed, they'll share in here.

61
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:32,699
You're like you're going to
put all your dinosaur toys

62
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:33,569
in here.

63
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,684
- Yeah
- [Missy] Yeah

64
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:36,335
You like that big bed Ollie?

65
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:37,180
- Yeah.

66
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,050
- [Missy] That's pretty cool, huh?

67
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,433
- You gotta jump over these.

68
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,607
- [Missy] Okay, jump over them.

69
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,302
(giggling) good job.

70
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:47,135
(whimsical music)

71
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:53,013
Watch him do this all by himself.

72
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:54,596
Wow, good job, bud.

73
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,762
Alright, this is the boys' room right now,

74
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,130
we set up the bed.

75
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,583
He's already got his toys in here.

76
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,180
And I think me and mom are
actually going to run to the

77
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,685
store and get a few more
furniture pieces and some decor

78
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:08,602
to fill it up a little.

79
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:14,141
- Good morning you guys, from
southern, sunny California.

80
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,906
(giggling) The dogs are
already getting ahead in their

81
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,540
swimming.

82
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,734
Look at that, it is a beautiful
sunny day and the dogs are

83
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:24,974
enjoying it.

84
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,840
They love swimming and they
actually haven't done it in

85
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,952
a while, but I was like it's
hot today, they are going

86
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:30,014
to love it.

87
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:32,446
So, we're playing in the
pool with the puppies.

88
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,829
Oh, okay.

89
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,507
And when you don't have
anything to throw for them,

90
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,530
they get angry.

91
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,053
Oh, here we go, I got some good stuff.

92
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:39,115
Oh, you want this?

93
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:42,086
It's a plush dog toy
made to look like a stick

94
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,505
when I could probably
just go get a stick, huh?

95
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:46,988
(giggling) Get it Carmen, get it.

96
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:48,140
Get it boy, get it.

97
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,114
Get it, get it, you got it, there.

98
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,275
Oh my gosh, they just
jumped on each other.

99
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:58,041
Look, they are fighting for
it in the water (giggling).

100
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,793
Oh, come on.

101
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:02,376
(Upbeat music)

102
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:11,794
- Alright, me and my mom
have made it to Target

103
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:14,199
(giggling) and we are doing
a little bit of some fun

104
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,058
shopping.

105
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:19,218
We are getting stuff for the
boys' room and I'm so excited.

106
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,673
We've got these cute
little lamps, some bedding.

107
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:25,528
Ah, shoot, mom saves the day.

108
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:27,844
A little like bookshelf.

109
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:29,419
I'm really excited to set it all up, but

110
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,960
I am right now looking for a phone.

111
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,118
I had it in the cart I
thought, it was in my

112
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:35,076
mom's purse.

113
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,194
It's not there, but I do
have this handy dandy little

114
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,351
watch, so let's swipe up
and see if it's somewhere

115
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,184
close by.

116
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:44,708
(iphone dinging)

117
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,541
Oh, I hear it.

118
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,133
(iphone dinging)

119
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,649
Okay, it's definitely
not with us (giggling).

120
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:51,899
- [Suzanne] Oh my gosh

121
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:54,365
- (laughing) This always happens to me.

122
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:56,782
We were just down this aisle.

123
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:00,482
(iphone dinging)

124
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:03,716
Oh, oopsie, (mumbling) see it?

125
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:04,638
- [Suzanne] Up there?

126
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,981
- Oh, yup, there it is.

127
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,310
Oh my gosh, this is the worst.

128
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,673
(laughing) Bryan is going to watch this

129
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:14,938
and be like wow, Missy,
typical though, honestly.

130
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,967
- Literally bought you
that watch so you could

131
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,349
find your phone.
- So I could find my phone.

132
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:21,444
It worked, Bryan, see (giggling).

133
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:22,277
I'm such a dork.

134
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:23,937
Anyways, okay, we got the
phone back now we just have

135
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,584
to finish up a few more
items and then we're going to

136
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,417
go set it all up.

137
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:31,169
- [Bryan] Oh my goodness
you guys, look, we have two

138
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:32,305
petals open.

139
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:33,841
If you guys saw yesterday's
vlog, I have it linked in the

140
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:37,465
I card, you saw that we only
had one and now we have two

141
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,481
out and they are getting bigger.

142
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:42,948
These three petals are going
to be breaking off shortly.

143
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:43,808
That is so cool.

144
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:45,969
We are going to have a brand
new little flower there.

145
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,897
I think the coolest thing about
plants and like succulents

146
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:51,369
and flowers and stuff
like that is just so cool

147
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:52,600
to get to see them change.

148
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,153
Remember these string of pearls, you guys?

149
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,593
I'm pretty sure these have
grown have like an inch

150
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:58,800
or two since the last time
I got them and it's just

151
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,320
so cool to know to like
I am the reason that it's

152
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,184
growing still.

153
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:05,615
Like I am taking care of and
watering it and stuff and

154
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,793
I don't know I think it's
just a simple concept that

155
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:11,120
a lot of people don't really
appreciate or know about

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,984
because they just fill
their house with fake plants

157
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:15,295
and all power to 'em, like
that's what we used to do,

158
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,123
but now that we have like
live plants, I just feel like

159
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:20,791
there's so much more energy
in our house, like you can

160
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,544
breathe easier, I don't know.

161
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:24,264
I might be a little, it might
be a little, it might be

162
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:26,097
being a little crazy, but yeah.

163
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:28,840
I love getting to see all my
plants and everything like

164
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,376
change and grow and stuff,
it's really, really cool.

165
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:32,779
I'll be sure to give you guys an update

166
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:33,612
on this little guy before

167
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,554
I end this blog today and
we'll see if those other

168
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:37,362
three open up.

169
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,452
- Alright, so we are back home and we are

170
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:41,445
going to start getting
everything together now.

171
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:44,340
We've got all kinds of goodies.

172
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,840
Papa's going to start
putting that together.

173
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,510
And if you can't tell, we
have a special little theme

174
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,120
we've got going on.

175
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,648
Actually had a lot of extra
leftover dinosaur stuff

176
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:54,790
from like a previous theme
that we had going on.

177
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,415
So yeah, I figured that's a
good theme that like they're

178
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:59,124
not really going to grow
out of it super soon.

179
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:01,880
It's not like a specific
theme and it's super cute, so

180
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,362
we're going to get this all ready now.

181
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:06,945
(upbeat music)

182
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,483
We have made quite a mess (giggling).

183
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:57,013
Okay, we just threw this room together.

184
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:59,727
I'm not going to show you yet,
but it is so stinkin' cute

185
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:01,734
especially compared to what
the before was when I got

186
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,148
here earlier.

187
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:06,612
We did go shopping, but all
together me and my dad put

188
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,071
this together in less than
an hour, and it is so cute.

189
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,152
I am excited to show the boys.

190
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:12,950
So, let's go do the big reveal.

191
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,134
Hey, Ollie, do you want to see your room?

192
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:16,091
- Yeah

193
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,312
- [Missy] Are you excited?

194
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,729
Alright, come in.

195
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:23,343
Wait, what do you think?

196
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:24,380
- It's good.

197
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,337
- [Missy] You like it?

198
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,304
- Yes.

199
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:28,280
- [Missy] Do you want to show them it?

200
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,578
(gasp) There it is.

201
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,245
- Wait, my dinosaur.

202
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:37,902
- [Missy] Isn't this so cute, you guys?

203
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:39,741
Oh my goodness.

204
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,433
See, so like I said, we are
doing a full dinosaur theme

205
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:45,753
and a lot of this stuff is
stuff we used in his other room,

206
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:47,437
and it is just so stinkin' cute.

207
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:50,476
We got a brachiosaurus
on this side, and which

208
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,387
dinosaur is that, Ollie, on this side?

209
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,012
- A tyrannosaurus.

210
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:55,528
- [Missy] Oh yeah, but
what's this one up here?

211
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:57,286
- A megasaurus.

212
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,190
- [Missy] No, that's a stegosaurus.

213
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,354
- Stegosaurus.

214
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:01,752
- [Missy] Yeah.

215
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:02,585
- [Suzanne] A megasaurs.

216
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,735
- [Missy] A megasaurus,
I've never heard that one.

217
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,263
- [Suzanne] That must be
a really big stegosaurus.

218
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:06,667
- [Missy] And then we have
this super cute just like

219
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,789
plaid bedding which is cute.

220
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,931
It's not like dinosaur
but that's kinda easy.

221
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:13,624
And then we kind threw
in some green blanket.

222
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:16,974
We've got lots of different
decor around the room.

223
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,868
We have a little bookshelf,
but we don't have any other

224
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:21,769
books, so we just grabbed some
of uncle and Papa's books.

225
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,213
And this one is Papa's (giggling).

226
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:26,635
And then they have a monitor
in here cause I want to be able

227
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:27,476
to hear them.

228
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:30,202
They've got diapers and
wipes for the boys, err

229
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,768
for Finn I guess.

230
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:35,812
Extra dino eggs if they
want to do some hiding,

231
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:39,182
a little magic trick with
a dinosaur, (giggling)

232
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,929
and then this wall is super cute.

233
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,230
It's just got like a
little dinosaur collection

234
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,252
over here with eggs and some extra decor.

235
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,639
We might end up getting a
few more things from like

236
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,518
Hobby Lobby, but this
is just kind of like the

237
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,056
things I had lying around
the house and then some

238
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:55,659
extra things we bought.

239
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,919
Oh yeah, and I don't want
to forget we have this sound

240
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,954
machine and it's got a
little projector, huh?

241
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:03,246
Just for you.

242
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:06,243
Yeah, so for now the boys are
going to be sharing this bed.

243
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:08,818
Eventually might get like a
bunk bed in here, but I think

244
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:09,816
this is perfect.

245
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:11,574
And it's so cute, Auntie
can still use it but

246
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:14,071
(gasp) I love it.

247
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:14,904
- And I'm sure Auntie will love it.

248
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:17,325
- [Missy] Yeah, she's like
um this is kind of like

249
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,311
the room I've always dreamed of.

250
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:23,305
We are home now, and Finn
is munching on some leftover

251
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:24,338
pancake.

252
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:27,237
He saw it and was like I
have to have that right now.

253
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:29,261
Even though they already had dinner even.

254
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:33,039
I was like, alright I guess
you can have a whole pancake.

255
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,600
It's what we had this morning, huh?

256
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,433
- Yeah

257
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,785
- But, as you can tell, it is late,

258
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,208
we need to get ready for bed.

259
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,570
And go ni-nights, okay?

260
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,403
- Okay.

261
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:45,023
- But we have a super fun
day planned tomorrow, eek.

262
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,455
Well hello there.

263
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:47,803
- Hi.

264
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:49,534
- [Missy] Brian has made
us a delicious meal,

265
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,169
and there's four plates here? (giggling)

266
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,002
- Uh, huh.

267
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:54,544
One, two, wait, one plus

268
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:56,495
- [Missy] Oh, oh hey!

269
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:58,745
(mumbling)

270
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:01,901
- [Missy] They came in
like alright mom, dad

271
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:02,795
what's for dinner?

272
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,344
(giggling)

273
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:05,700
- [Bryan] Kids!

274
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,491
Yep, this looks absolutely delicious.

275
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,361
I am so excited to eat.

276
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:11,194
- [Bryan] It's outlander night.

277
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:12,275
- I'll take this plate.

278
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:14,627
Yes, it is outlander
night and I am so excited.

279
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:19,035
I did however just watch
Kelse and Corbin's vlog.

280
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:21,119
It's so bad, you guys, it was a prank

281
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:25,389
Corbin is not only so mean that
he actually pulled that off,

282
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,582
but it was so hard to watch,
like I felt so bad for

283
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:28,415
Kelse.

284
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:31,273
- Corbin is staying in the
guest room so you know.

285
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,771
- I would think so

286
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:34,217
- He's not coming back with me.

287
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,318
- I had to get her back
for the doughnut, she was--

288
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:38,471
- Just so you know, Corbin
is like the nicest guy

289
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:42,490
and I'm still shocked
that he actually did that.

290
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,832
So, if you guys want to
go check it out, it'll be,

291
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:44,665
clicked up, er here in the i-card.

292
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:45,975
- Look at this.

293
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:46,841
Family dinner, you guys.

294
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,307
- [Missy] Family dinner night.

295
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,552
Kids are alseep.

296
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:51,538
The boys were so tired from
playing at Mimi and Papa's

297
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,151
they were like good
night, I'm going to bed.

298
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:55,262
Bryan made us a delicious
dinner, and now it's time

299
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:56,867
to eat, yay.

300
00:11:56,867 --> 00:12:00,081
- So all the kids are asleep
and Kelse and Corbin are here

301
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:03,065
because we are going to
watch some tv tonight, but

302
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:06,282
I wanted to give you guys an
update on my little cactus.

303
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:09,201
I want to actually see
if it's opened anymore.

304
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:11,738
Oh, look, it's so close.

305
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,787
I'm feelin like it's like
really close to getting

306
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,691
(mumbling) those other three, dang.

307
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:16,524
But, we got two.

308
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:17,573
That's so neat.

309
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:18,542
That is really cool.

310
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,059
We'll probably get like one a day maybe.

311
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,650
But anyway that is all for today's video.

312
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,880
Hope you guys enjoyed it.
