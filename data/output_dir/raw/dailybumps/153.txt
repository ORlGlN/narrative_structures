1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,918
- You're next Fin, he's
like, "Oh, I gotta hide!"

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,467
Get in, get in, get in!

3
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:08,634
(whispers) Now Mama can't
find you! RAWR! RAWR! RAWR!

4
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:16,136
(Fin laughs)

5
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:20,777
♫ This is our life, this is
our fun, this is who we are.

6
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:25,685
♫ This is our dream, this is
our team, shot among the stars.

7
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:28,204
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine,

8
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,507
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

9
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:34,674
♫ (This is our life) Let's
life it, live it forever!

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,340
(cheerful music)

11
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,920
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,705
He took it from my hand! (laughs)

13
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:49,083
- [Missy] Oh my gosh!

14
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,957
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh!
He took it from my hand

15
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:51,969
and now he's outta here!

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,291
- [Missy] That was so good! You just like,

17
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,990
hand-fed your fish! (laughs)

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,113
- I never knew that was
a thing, look at him go!

19
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:58,856
(Missy laughs)

20
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:01,606
(cheerful music)

21
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:05,319
- Good morning, guys!

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,075
We are feeding our fish some breakfast.

23
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:09,179
(Missy laughs)

24
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:11,847
Literally from my hands, how
amazing is that?! (laughs)

25
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:12,680
- So cool!

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,980
- And today is an exciting day
as well because these fishies

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,371
are probably going to get a
new little fishy friend, huh?

28
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:21,120
We are on the schedule to
have our tank serviced today,

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,392
so someone's gonna come
by, the professional,

30
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,377
make sure everything's running smoothly,

31
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,931
I told him, "Bring by a couple extra fish,

32
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,299
and some corals", so we
can add some to this baby.

33
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,192
So, that's exciting, and
that's happening today.

34
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,483
What's all over my face, babe?

35
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:35,316
- I don't know...

36
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,647
- Did you see this, what's...?

37
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:38,048
- What's on my face?

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,345
- What's all over your face?

39
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:40,506
- I don't know, that's so weird.

40
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:41,371
- What did you do?

41
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,777
Hey Olly, what's all over your face?

42
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:45,014
- Um, I don't know.

43
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,524
- [Bryan] You got war paint on?

44
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,429
- Yeah.

45
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:48,972
- [Bryan] Were you in a battle today?

46
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:49,805
- Yeah.

47
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:50,968
- [Bryan] Really?
- Yeah.

48
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:52,599
- No, Olly, tell them the real reason

49
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,106
we have some face paint on.

50
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:57,162
- We shot the Tribe music video!

51
00:01:57,162 --> 00:02:00,714
- That's right! Today has
been such a crazy day!

52
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:02,333
We have been shooting all day,

53
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,451
we filmed the Tribe music video today,

54
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,268
and as you can see, there's a common theme

55
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:08,484
because we all have some
really cool war paint on.

56
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:10,440
But, you're gonna have to wait to find out

57
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,879
when you go watch the music video,

58
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,524
which will be up, #soon.

59
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,699
Alright Fin, show me your war paint!

60
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,750
- Ehhhh ehhhh

61
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,467
- You got war paint on
too? Ooooh, his is cool.

62
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:25,495
Where's your war paint, where's
your war paint? (laughs)

63
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:27,420
Fin has been working very hard today.

64
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,851
We ALL have been working
very hard today, huh?

65
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:30,684
- Mmhmm, tired!

66
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,474
- [Bryan] It's crazy, our day is over,

67
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:33,890
and the vlog has just begun!

68
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,279
- Well, this month is just crazy,

69
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:40,427
we always have crazy months,
but October especially is.

70
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,979
- Yeah, we found ourself with
a lot of projects this month.

71
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:47,140
So, we're trying to stay
ahead and shoot those,

72
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,320
but sometimes it's like, an
all day thing, and it just gets

73
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,698
a little crazy.
- Yes.

74
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:52,373
And now we're walking
around with war paint on.

75
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,580
- (laughs) Yeah, just like, "hi".

76
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,852
- [Bryan] I guess we're
just gonna wear this today.

77
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:57,610
- (laughs) Yeah, I
actually really like mine,

78
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,511
I'm like so proud of it.

79
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,792
- [Bryan] You look really cool.

80
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,459
(playful music)

81
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,540
Hey Olly?
- What?

82
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,765
- [Bryan] What are you doing?

83
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:20,720
- I'm getting into mac and cheese.

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,177
(Bryan laughs)

85
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:23,292
- [Bryan] That's quite a genius way

86
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:24,806
of getting into the pantry.

87
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,520
- I want that for dinner!

88
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,782
- This pantry you guys,
it's not even that big!

89
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:31,998
It doesn't even hold that
many amazing, good snacks,

90
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:34,118
yet, the boys are obsessed, right?

91
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:34,951
- Yeah.

92
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:36,317
- [Bryan] The pantry is our lifeline.

93
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,562
- Yeah.
(laughs)

94
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:39,750
- [Bryan] And you really want

95
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,330
macaroni and cheese for dinner?

96
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,220
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES!

97
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,920
- I think that's a yes.

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,084
(faint yell in background)

99
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:49,450
No, it's okay babe, I don't
need a makeup wipe, I got it!

100
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,602
(laughs)

101
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:51,498
- [Missy] Okay!

102
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,331
- It's not coming off!

103
00:03:57,164 --> 00:04:00,196
Trying to wipe off the war paint,

104
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,994
and it's becoming an issue.

105
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:03,119
Hey Olly!
- What?

106
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,410
- Do I have anything on my face?

107
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,314
- No!
(laughs)

108
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,402
- It's um...
- [Missy] Just everywhere now.

109
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:11,311
- It's still there.

110
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:12,327
Look at this eyebrow, it's like,

111
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,564
darker than this one now too,

112
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,590
because all the black just
went into it. (laughs)

113
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,423
- You basically just made it even.

114
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:25,909
- What is this sorcery, you guys?!

115
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:29,891
What's in makeup wipes that
makes all this stuff come off?

116
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:32,605
Is that good for your face even? (laughs)

117
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,363
Okay, I think that's better.

118
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:35,765
(slow music)

119
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:38,182
(beep, beep)

120
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,175
Gonna throw some cinnamon
rolls into the oven,

121
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:55,169
but first, I wanted to
ask you guys a question.

122
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,957
Cinnamon rolls, or cookies?

123
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:59,748
I want you guys to vote,
and I want you guys to vote

124
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:01,874
with the little ICard poll in the corner,

125
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:04,295
so click that ICard in the corner,

126
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:07,223
and choose your favorite,
cinnamon rolls or cookies.

127
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,306
Excited to see how these
cinnamon rolls turn out.

128
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,887
- AaaaaaaAaaaAaAaaa

129
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:18,693
- [Missy] Is daddy giving you a ride?

130
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,502
- MmmMmmm
- He was a little grumpy.

131
00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:21,335
- [Missy] Yeah.

132
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:22,483
- [Bryan] So he needs a little ride.

133
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,630
- [Missy] It's been just
one of those days. (laughs)

134
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,213
- AaaaAaaaAaaAaaAaa

135
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:29,723
- Say hi!
- Hi!

136
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:31,870
- [Missy] Hi!

137
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,965
- Hey, do you wanna do helicopter?

138
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:33,798
- Yeah!

139
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,927
- [Bryan] (gasp) Let's go do helicopter!

140
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,361
Are you ready for the helicopter?!

141
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,435
- [Missy] Oh God, oh God!

142
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:41,309
(Fin giggles)

143
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,809
- Three, two, one!

144
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:46,402
(Fin giggles)

145
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:47,714
- [Missy] Ugh, that
makes me really nervous.

146
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,636
- [Bryan] Fin, wait, wait, wait, Fin!

147
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:51,083
You got somethin' all over your face!

148
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,274
(laughs)

149
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:53,765
- [Missy] What's on your face?

150
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:54,930
- [Bryan] You want me to spin you again?

151
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,914
- Yeah!

152
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,164
(giggling)

153
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,612
- [Missy] Woooo!

154
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,589
- As soon as they land, "Again!"

155
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:08,685
- [Missy] Yeah (laughs)

156
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:11,185
- [Bryan] 'Do that agaiiiiin!"

157
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:15,421
- [Missy] Waaah! Scared me!

158
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:16,531
- [Fin] Me!

159
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:18,300
- You too? Okay.

160
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,329
- [Fin] AaayAaayAaay Yay!

161
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:24,246
- Ah, careful!
(Missy giggles)

162
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,889
Oh my gosh, okay, making
me really nervous.

163
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,056
(squeals and giggles)

164
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,545
It is really hard to take myself seriously

165
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:47,722
when I've got this war paint on,

166
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,485
but I wanted to tell you guys I am

167
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:52,764
breaking out my sewing machine!

168
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:55,007
That's right, look how dirty
and dusty this thing is.

169
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,422
I actually did use it earlier this year

170
00:06:57,422 --> 00:07:00,698
because I was making
something special for June,

171
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:03,490
but now I'm making a costume for Fin.

172
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,936
And, what's funny is, because
when I made my costume

173
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:08,682
for Olly, which was the cutest costume!

174
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:10,367
If you guys don't know, I made his costume

175
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:14,154
for his, I believe it
was his second Halloween,

176
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:18,816
I'll have it in the ICard
up above, he was a munchkin,

177
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:20,297
and it was the cutest thing.

178
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:22,212
But, I did not have to sew anything,

179
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:23,686
I think I might have had to sew, like,

180
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:26,276
a little piece of his collar,
but for the most part,

181
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:27,809
it was like, buying the things and like,

182
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:30,041
cutting them, and just
like, making his hair

183
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,022
and stuff look cute.

184
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:35,259
This is legit, I have to make his costume,

185
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,738
and I'm really nervous
about it, and I'm just like,

186
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:38,988
I really hope I can do it!

187
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,731
And I still don't even
know how I'm gonna do it,

188
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:43,377
I'm just planning to sit
down at my sewing machine

189
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:45,628
and hope that it all just comes to me.

190
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:47,455
And of course, YouTube,
YouTube always helps.

191
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,021
You know, just search,
"How do you make this?",

192
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,970
and then it usually will tell you.

193
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,074
But, we'll see how it turns out,

194
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,301
I really hope it looks cute.

195
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,884
Alright boys, it's shower time!

196
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,003
Are you guys ready for shower time?

197
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:02,170
(giggles)

198
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:05,252
They're all trying to get a ride.

199
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,266
(laughs and squeals)

200
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,933
- Got 'em, got 'em babe.

201
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,873
- [Missy] Okay (laughs)

202
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:15,373
Karma's like, "I don't think that's safe."

203
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,312
Are you gonna go take a shower?

204
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:20,126
- [Fin] Yeah.
(Missy laughs)

205
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,155
- [Bryan] Alright, say
goodbye to the war paint.

206
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,738
That was fun, huh?
- [Fin] Yeah.

207
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:30,948
- [Missy] There's nothing
that can't be done

208
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:32,166
with a makeup wipe.

209
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,390
- [Bryan] (laughs) The faces we make

210
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,187
when they're coming off
though, are like, so funny.

211
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:38,412
You're next Fin.

212
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,448
(squeals)

213
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:41,856
He's like, "Oh, I gotta hide!".

214
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:45,818
Get in, get in, get in,
get in Fin! Get in, get in!

215
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:49,310
(whispers) There we go,
now Mama can't find you!

216
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,310
RAWR! RAWR! RAWR! (Fin giggles)

217
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:00,313
- Alright, kids are in bed,

218
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:03,896
and I am surrounded by
all kinds of fabric,

219
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:08,042
I'm completely overwhelmed,
I thought I could do this,

220
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:10,433
but I'm starting to feel like I can't.

221
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:13,482
But, we're actually
watching The Ring right now,

222
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:16,774
which I don't think I've watched before.

223
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,593
I don't recognize it, I feel
like I've watched, like,

224
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,284
bits and clips of it, but it's Halloween,

225
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,898
and I feel like I should
probably, you know,

226
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,618
get in those scary movies
that I haven't watched before.

227
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:31,087
- It's fun to watch
scary movies sometimes.

228
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,949
- Yeah, totally, like,
we've been trying to watch

229
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,803
a little bit more,
we're not normally like,

230
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:37,239
scary movie people anyway, so.

231
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,373
But, let me know in the comments,

232
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:40,117
what is your favorite scary movie?

233
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:41,964
Maybe we'll end up watching it,

234
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,863
and we'll see which one we like.

235
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:47,565
So, super overwhelmed,
not sure what I'm doing,

236
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,712
I've got this going on, but
I've never actually made,

237
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:55,614
like, an outfit that you
have to wear. (laughs)

238
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:57,760
So, I don't know what to do!

239
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,663
And I can't even find like,
any kind of instructions

240
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:05,416
anywhere, or like,
ideas on how to make it,

241
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,447
anywhere online, which might seem crazy,

242
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:09,231
but I'm serious, like, I can't find it.

243
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:11,125
So that's what I'm working on so late.

244
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,412
- [Bryan] You can do it! I believe in you!

245
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,433
- I'm so tired, I'm so tired!

246
00:10:14,433 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
