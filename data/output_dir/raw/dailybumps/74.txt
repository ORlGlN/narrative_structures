00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:01,862

00:00:01,862 --> 00:00:03,397
Ready or not, here I come!

3
00:00:03,397 --> 00:00:04,564
Where are you?

4
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:06,742
I see you!

5
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:09,976
(laughs)

6
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,610
Okay we gotta find your brother.

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,746
Go find your brother!

20
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:36,546
We're back home!

21
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:40,039
What about Fred?

22
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,223
What happened?

23
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:42,613
Show me, show me Fred!

24
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:43,446
Show me!

25
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:45,457
What?

26
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,778
What did he do?

27
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:50,498
Missy and I just got back from our little

28
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:51,921
winter getaway.

29
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,187
We had so much fun

30
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:57,097
and Finn was very excited
about Fred this morning,

31
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:58,260
weren't you?

32
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,897
So he did a puzzle for you?

33
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:02,035
Oh you guys had to finish it together huh?

34
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:03,368
That is so cool.

35
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,186
Look at that cute puzzle he brought that.

36
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:09,774
(laughs)

37
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:11,469
Fred is the best isn't he?

38
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:14,052
(upbeat music)

39
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:19,306
Looks like our Christmas
cage is doing well.

40
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:21,106
Nothing was caught last night.

41
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:23,334
If you guys missed yesterday's video

42
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,612
where we talk about this

43
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:27,519
and we decorate it and hang it up,

44
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,588
you have to go check it out.

45
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,236
It's in the I code above Ollie

46
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:31,723
and the boys had so
much fun decorating it.

47
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:33,641
We're really excited
to see if we can catch

48
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,747
anything in it

49
00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:35,878
and we did catch something in it yesterday

50
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:38,109
so go check out yesterday's
vlog to see what it was

51
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:39,393
but I love this.

52
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:40,713
I think it's just cool too

53
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,095
'cause it kind of just adds to the

54
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:43,778
Christmas decor everywhere.

55
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:44,932
It's not too bad.

56
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:46,043
- Hi Ollie!

57
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:46,994
- Hi.

58
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:47,944
- I missed you.

59
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:48,895
Did you have fun with Mimi and Papa?

60
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:49,863
- Yeah.

61
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:51,486
- And you had fun at school?

62
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,558
You just got home?

63
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:54,539
Papa went and got and picked him up

64
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,895
and he said that he was sleeping

65
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:59,232
and did not want to wake up huh?

66
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:00,709
Are you pretty tired?

67
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,599
Well I'm glad you got a god nap.

68
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,954
We have just been having a really nice day

69
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,060
at home.

70
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,306
We've actually been working
on something really cool.

71
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:09,283
Let me show you.

72
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:12,055
We have been signing calendars.

73
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,180
Are you gonna sign some calendars with us?

74
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,266
- Yeah.

75
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,236
- [Missy] Yeah.

76
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,982
Yes we have been signing

77
00:02:16,982 --> 00:02:19,399
lots and lots of calendars.

78
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,872
It's just been really fun to finally

79
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:22,849
get that done.

80
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,125
We want to get these
done as fast as possible

81
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,470
so we can get them out as possible,

82
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,802
especially if they're
like Christmas gifts.

83
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:29,949
We want to be able to get
them to you as possible

84
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,968
so we've just been signing like crazy,

85
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,624
just trying to get that done

86
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:35,617
and actually what we've also been doing

87
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,897
is listening to the wind outside.

88
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:40,028
It is so intense.

89
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,573
Let me show you that.

90
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:45,219
So the wind advisory for
this area is on extreme high.

91
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,140
It's never been this high before.

92
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,559
What that means is that we
are a very huge potential

93
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,165
of fires.

94
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:52,236
Look at my flagpole.

95
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,428
It does not look happy.

96
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:54,948
They're saying that the gusts right now

97
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:58,531
are reaching about 75
to 80 miles per hour.

98
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,809
It is really intense

99
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:04,357
and unfortunately a fire just broke out.

100
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,457
Look at that.

101
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:08,930
You can see it right down there.

102
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,437
It's pretty far away but

103
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,509
we have two fires now in the area.

104
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:15,883
There's four or five in LA right now

105
00:03:15,883 --> 00:03:17,893
and it's just so scary.

106
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:18,842
It's so scary.

107
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:19,971
And as you guys know,

108
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:22,496
we had a fire a few
months ago near our house

109
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,928
and it was really scary

110
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:25,521
and with the winds like this,

111
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:27,803
anything could break out at any moment

112
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:30,049
and be very, very bad.

113
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:32,147
It could just get really bad very fast.

114
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:35,430
Yeah we are just praying that
nothing breaks out nearby

115
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,972
with the winds so close

116
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:38,483
but the other fires are,

117
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:39,988
they are close too.

118
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,964
The one that I just showed
you is actually pretty close

119
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:44,968
to my aunt's house, my Aunt Kristy

120
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:48,275
which is Jeffrey's mom,
if you guys don't know

121
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:50,058
so that's really scary.

122
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:53,247
These winds can just make them just fly.

123
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,748
It's just like, it's so scary.

124
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:57,864
So anyways, the wind's
just been crazy all day

125
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,216
so we're just listening to it

126
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,579
and luckily we have a pretty sturdy house

127
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:02,786
but it's still scary.

128
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:05,054
Like we got trees and
stuff and I've never seen

129
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:07,274
winds like this ever, like this bad

130
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:08,346
in this area.

131
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:09,308
It's pretty crazy.

132
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,199
Just hanging out with
the boys in the playroom.

133
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,315
Finn's playing

134
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:15,554
and I'm watching the news right now on

135
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:19,023
the myriad of fire where we live

136
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:22,048
and it is getting really bad.

137
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,017
It now is at 200 acres and
zero percent contained,

138
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,182
at least actually what it
was like 30 minutes ago

139
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:32,575
so I hope it's not any
worse but definitely

140
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:34,346
surrounded by a lot of houses

141
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:35,962
and it's just like (groans)

142
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:37,431
it's so sad and so scary

143
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:40,986
and I know at least one
house has already been

144
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:44,382
burned so just hoping it
doesn't get any worse.

145
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,215
So sad.

146
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,104
Nine, 10.

147
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,177
Ready or not here I come!

148
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:51,344
Where are you?

149
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,154
I see you!

150
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:56,983
Okay we've gotta find your brother!

151
00:04:56,983 --> 00:05:00,054
Let's go find your brother!

152
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,544
Finn's really good at
playing hide and seek.

153
00:05:02,544 --> 00:05:05,057
Wait, I heard something.

154
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,926
(shouts)

155
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:07,900
Did you find him?

156
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,006
(laughs)

157
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:11,148
Did you say cockle doodle doo?

158
00:05:11,148 --> 00:05:14,818
- All right boys, guess what today is.

159
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,245
- What?

160
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:19,730
- [Bryan] It is national
letter writing day

161
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,087
I was thinking on national
letter writing day

162
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:24,142
we should write a letter to Santa.

163
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:25,143
- Oh yeah.

164
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:26,836
- [Bryan] Do you want to
write your letter to Santa?

165
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:29,432
- Okay so I know that
you already told Santa

166
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:31,191
that you want that Power Ranger toy right?

167
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:34,304
But now we're going to write
a letter so that you can

168
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:35,882
write down everything that you want

169
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:37,147
and he won't forget it.

170
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,502
We're going to send it to him okay?

171
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:40,736
Does that sound good?

172
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,090
- How are we going to do it?

173
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,257
- Well Mrs. Clause actually
sent me some official papers

174
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,879
that we can use to write

175
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,784
and what we do is we
actually will get to color

176
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:54,646
a picture and send him it

177
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,944
and we're going to put it
right into his little mailbox

178
00:05:56,944 --> 00:06:01,382
and then Fred is going to
take it to Santa tonight.

179
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:02,343
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

180
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:04,182
See I know you guys have been wondering

181
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:08,239
why we have this special
delivery Santa mailbox

182
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,609
and this thing can actually
send letters to Santa.

183
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:11,820
All right Ollie, I'm
going to help you write

184
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,775
your letter.

185
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:13,855
Do you want to say Hi Santa or Dear Santa?

186
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:15,327
- Dear Santa.

187
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:16,434
- Okay.

188
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:17,267
Dear Santa

189
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,851
and now what do you want to say?

190
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:23,071
Let's ask him how he's doing.

191
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:24,028
- Okay.

192
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:24,983
- Should we say how are you?

193
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:25,936
- Yes.

194
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:26,892
- Okay.

195
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:27,851
Dear Santa,

196
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:28,851
how are you?

197
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:32,482
I had an idea of a
question to ask him Ollie.

198
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:35,405
Since on Christmas Eve
night we're going to leave

199
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:37,172
him cookies, maybe we
should ask what his favorite

200
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,210
cookies are.

201
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,627
What is your favorite cookie?

202
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,069
Finn is getting started
on his Christmas letter

203
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,300
right now.

204
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,973
You just let me know
when you need the green,

205
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:54,140
okay buddy?

206
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,577
Actually you want to switch me?

207
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:56,597
Okay I'll take that.

208
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:57,568
Okay.

209
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,681
So now is the time you
tell him what you want

210
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:01,336
for Christmas Ollie.

211
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:03,151
So what do you want for Christmas?

212
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:04,838
- A new toy box.

213
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,096
- [Missy] A new toy box?

214
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,192
Why do you want a new toy box?

215
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,137
- For toys.

216
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,511
So what else do you want
to ask for Christmas buddy?

217
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,585
- The Power Ranger toy.

218
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:11,577
- Okay.

219
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:15,102
So I'm going to put on
here the Power Rangers toy.

220
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,752
He probably knows which
one you're talking about

221
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:18,360
'cause we already told him.

222
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,319
- [Missy] Yeah we told him.

223
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,418
- A floatie.

224
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:21,716
- [Missy] A floatie?

225
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:22,998
(laughs)

226
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:24,021
Okay.

227
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,087
What kind, do you know?

228
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:29,254
- I want a red one that
comes with a deep sea tank.

229
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,973
- Oh okay.

230
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,602
All right well we'll ask for that one too.

231
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,313
Anything else you want
to say or do at the end?

232
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:37,352
You want to say love Ollie?

233
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:38,527
- Yeah.

234
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:39,484
- Okay.

235
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:43,651
So I will write love and
then I'll have you sign it.

236
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,281
Hold this Ollie.

237
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:48,587
I'm going to help you sign your name okay?

238
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:50,670
So you need an O-l-l-I-e.

239
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:57,994
Perfect!

240
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:00,955
All right Finn already
started his Christmas letter

241
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:03,280
but we'll add a couple more
things on there for you okay?

242
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,541
- Okay ready?

243
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,291
We'll say Dear Santa,

244
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:12,890
Finn.

245
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,501
Yay that's your name!

246
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:17,480
- [Bryan] Yay!

247
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,449
He's so cute.

248
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:19,743
He's so excited.

249
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:22,097
- Do you want to do a little
coloring on it really quick?

250
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:24,113
Not too much so we can still read it.

251
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,696
(upbeat music)

252
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:44,181
- [Bryan] All right boys.

253
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:47,765
Put your letters into
this magical mailbox!

254
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:50,022
Put them on in there!

255
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:50,994
That's good.

256
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:51,975
You can put them in there.

257
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,807
That's the package slot.

258
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:55,514
You can also use the letter slot.

259
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:56,499
That's okay, that's okay.

260
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,474
It goes there.

261
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:58,427
Good job!

262
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:00,260
Now rub it on the top.

263
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:05,108
All right now tap it three times.

264
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:06,427
One, two, three.

265
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,010
Now blow it a kiss.

266
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:12,867
Okay none of that does nothing.

267
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:13,946
I was just making you do funny things.

268
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:15,270
(laughs)

269
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,530
But this is a magical mailbox

270
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,395
and it's going to send
your letter to Santa.

271
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:20,429
Are you excited?

272
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:23,195
(cheers)

273
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,429
I don't know if it flies.

274
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,724
- I think Fred's going to take it.

275
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:26,706
- Fred's going to take it, okay?

276
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:27,740
- Kay.

277
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,062
- Kay, the boys' letters
are in this magical mailbox.

278
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,281
Letters to Santa.

279
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,474
Do you remember writing letters to Santa?

280
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,583
What did you ask for?

281
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,680
- I never wrote a letter to Santa.

282
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,638
- [Bryan] Never?

283
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:38,584
- No.

284
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:40,179
- Missy was deprived.

285
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,191
- Santa still came to my house

286
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,626
and he still delivered to us.

287
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,742
- Aw I remember writing letters to Santa

288
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:47,107
and I would like make it look so official

289
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:50,145
and like nice on the computer like

290
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:52,466
it was good times, good times.

291
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,241
Pillow fight!

292
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:56,324
(laughs)

293
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:58,271
Whoa!

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,482
He gets no pillows and you get two?

295
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:02,441
That doesn't seem fair buddy.

296
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:04,322
Is there something under this pillow?

297
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:05,920
Is there something under this pillow?

298
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,058
- [Missy] All right showers are done.

299
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:08,288
We're running to Ollie's room.

300
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,259
Ollie, Finn's going to win!

301
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,215
Finn's going to win!

302
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:11,520
Oh my goodness!

303
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,663
Finn he won!

304
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:13,643
Yay!

305
00:10:13,643 --> 00:10:15,117
Say good job to Finn.

306
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:17,066
Give him a hug.

307
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,027
He never wins.

308
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:19,918
You are always the winner huh?

309
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,539
Ollie usually always wins

310
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,766
and I think he was like wait a second.

311
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:25,188
Why is Finn winning right now?

312
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:26,264
Pretty funny.

313
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:27,928
I'm going to go get their
advent calendars for them

314
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:28,937
so they can open them.

315
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,198
All right boys.

316
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:32,667
18 days 'til Christmas!

317
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:36,386
And Momma's done no Christmas shopping!

318
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,678
18 days!

319
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,096
You guys, 18 days, well 18 days for us.

320
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:41,503
That means 17 days for you guys.

321
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:42,336
Ah!

322
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:46,586
That's like not a lot of days left.

323
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:48,086
Finn what you get?

324
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:51,728
(shouts)

325
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:52,750
Dory!

326
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,706
You knew that!

327
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:54,669
That's such a good job!

328
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:55,635
Let's see.

329
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:56,726
Hang on.

330
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:58,373
Oh oh!

331
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,786
So what you just watched
was me trying to show you

332
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,393
the Dory and Finn actually biting me.

333
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:04,624
Well he was like playing

334
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,759
and he's like really sad about it.

335
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,786
I screamed really loud
'cause it hurt very badly

336
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:11,133
and I think it scared him.

337
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,147
I know.

338
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:14,010
He said I sorry Mama.

339
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,576
It's so sad.

340
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:16,652
You're okay.

341
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:17,786
It's okay.

342
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:18,745
I forgive you.

343
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,007
I love you.

344
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,681
All right Ollie, you show
us what you got from yours.

345
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,348
- I got assault guy.

346
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,202
- [Missy] Wow!

347
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:28,702
That is very cool.

348
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:30,178
I like things like that.

349
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:31,223
I like the mini figures.

350
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,712
Bed time was a little rough with the boys.

351
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:36,911
I think they were just a
little overly exhausted

352
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:39,093
and Finn was just having a rough time.

353
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:41,271
So anyways, I was going
to have them end it

354
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:43,125
but it just wasn't working so

355
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,946
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

356
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:47,081
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did.

357
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,948
We have some really
fun plans for tomorrow.

358
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:52,069
Make sure you stay tuned and check us out

359
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,055
and we'll see you guys later.

360
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:55,009
Bye!

361
00:11:55,009 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
