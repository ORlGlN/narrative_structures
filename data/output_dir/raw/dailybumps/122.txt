1
00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:01,913
Alright we've got our turkey all ready

2
00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:03,148
to throw it in the oven.

3
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:04,140
- [Missy] It looks so beautiful.

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,804
- [Bryan] Yay, we have
our own Friends door.

5
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:09,252
We have a whole houseful.

6
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:11,056
Happy Friendsgiving you guys.

7
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:11,892
Are you ready?

8
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:12,725
Yeah!

9
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:15,057
- [Bryan] Alright, climb up there.

10
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,073
He's so excited to jump in the pool.

Good morning guys.

23
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,446
As you guys might know,
we are getting ready

24
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:44,176
for a really awesome party
today, Friendsgiving,

25
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:45,781
and I am super excited.

26
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,857
We've never had a real
Friendsgiving before, huh?

27
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:50,336
A real Friendsgiving where
everyone brings something...

28
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:51,169
- [Missy] Yeah, it's like a potluck.

29
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:52,002
and it's, yeah.

30
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:53,934
We are in charge of just the turkey

31
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:55,468
and the cranberry sauce?

32
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:56,386
And the gravy.
And the gravy.

33
00:00:56,386 --> 00:00:58,867
So it's really really minimal.
Gravy is essential,

34
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,761
but the person doing the
turkey has to make the gravy.

35
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,687
Yeah, for sure.

36
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,563
'Cause you need the turkey
drippings and stuff.

37
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,774
But I couldn't just leave it at that.

38
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,105
I felt like I needed to do more.

39
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:09,579
So I'm in charge of also fudge.

40
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,188
Really just wanted to
make some yummy fudge.

41
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:13,585
I'm also in charge of some cookies.

42
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:15,365
I'm gonna make some cool little cookies

43
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:19,240
and I'm also going to
even dip strawberries.

44
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,217
So I'm really excited.

45
00:01:20,217 --> 00:01:22,392
I gotta get started on
all my little projects.

46
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm not too worried about it.

47
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,799
I think it's going to
be pretty fun and easy

48
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,665
and not too stressful of a Thanksgiving.

49
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:31,819
Honestly, our real
Thanksgiving is gonna be

50
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,735
so much more stressful than this.

51
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:36,235
(funky music)

52
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:48,487
Oh morning boys.

53
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:49,641
- [Oliver] Good morning.

54
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:51,881
- [Missy] Are you guys watching some TV?

55
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:52,811
- [Both] Yeah.

56
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:55,846
Well I was thinking it might be really fun

57
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:57,346
if we go swimming.

58
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:00,007
Yeah!

59
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:02,519
- [Missy] You wanna go swimming?

60
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,017
- [Oliver] Yes, yes, yes!

61
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:06,375
We do have a hot tub that is nice and warm

62
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,760
that the boys can swim in,

63
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,238
but Ollie has been begging
to go into the big pool

64
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:13,478
and so I was like--
Cool pool.

65
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:14,311
Cool pool.

66
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,611
- [Missy] Maybe I'll let
you go in there, okay?

67
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:16,444
Yeah.

68
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:20,876
So I actually just went
and turned on the hot tub

69
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:23,867
so that the hot tub is nice
and warm, that's the heater.

70
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:28,392
Ollie is going to jump
into this ice cold water,

71
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,474
but we're gonna play
a little trick on him.

72
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:33,144
We've done this before, so I
know he actually enjoys it,

73
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:35,456
but it will still be really, really funny.

74
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,724
He probably thinks the water is like

75
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:37,821
a nice, normal temperature,

76
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,422
but it's literally freezing cold.

77
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:42,801
Not freezing cold, but
it's probably like 60, 62.

78
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,371
And then we have the hot tub on,

79
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,964
so I'm gonna see if we
can get a funny reaction

80
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:48,938
of him jumping into a very cold pool.

81
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,782
Ollie, are you excited
to jump in the pool?

82
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:51,869
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

83
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:52,829
- [Bryan] You're so excited!

84
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,105
We haven't been swimming in so long, huh?

85
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,497
Yeah.

86
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:58,211
- [Bryan] Finn, are you
excited to swim in the pool?

87
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,584
Whoa!

88
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:02,120
- [Oliver] That's the
fastest Lightening McQueen.

89
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,953
- [Bryan] Oh really?

90
00:03:02,953 --> 00:03:04,465
- [Oliver] Let's see
if he can run into me.

91
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:05,715
- [Bryan] Whoa!

92
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:08,576
Alright Ollie, let's
get our bathing suit on

93
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:10,326
and jump in the pool.

94
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:14,433
Ollie, I love your Star Wars swim shorts!

95
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:17,101
Yeah, 'cause the new
Star Wars is coming out.

96
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,238
Yes, Ollie is so excited to go see

97
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:21,000
the new Star Wars in December.

98
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,440
I've already bought tickets and
we're gonna dress up, right?

99
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,616
Yeah.

100
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:28,032
We find little victories, with Star Wars--

101
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:31,676
I'm gonna be Kylo Ren and
I'm gonna be the (mumbles)

102
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:32,509
Really?

103
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:33,943
Okay!

104
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:35,187
Finn is so happy too.

105
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:38,202
He's like, I've got my bathing suit on.

106
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,753
Do you wanna see my punches?

107
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,693
- [Bryan] Sure.

108
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:44,387
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

109
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:45,220
Careful.

110
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,589
Okay, let's get in the pool.

111
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:49,089
(funky music)

112
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,875
- [Bryan] Alright Ollie, are you ready?

113
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,744
Yeah!

114
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:03,266
- [Bryan] Alright, climb up there.

115
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:06,266
He's so excited to jump in the pool.

116
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,204
Oh my gosh!

117
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:15,280
How's it feel?

118
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,023
- [Oliver] Not good.

119
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,452
- [Bryan] Not good?

120
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,129
What's wrong?

121
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,046
Is it cold?

122
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:23,933
(laughs)

123
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,016
He's so cold.

124
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,029
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

125
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,968
You just did the Polar Plunge Challenge,

126
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,554
I'm so proud of you dude.

127
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:34,298
Finn, you wanna try it?

128
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,131
- [Finley] No.

129
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,100
- [Bryan] No?

130
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,764
Finn, you jump in the pool, come on.

131
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:39,334
No?

132
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:42,001
(playful music)

133
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:45,901
Whoa, hot tub time.

134
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:48,468
How's that water feel?

135
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,533
(laughs)

136
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,029
I'm guessing this water
feels a lot better.

137
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,362
Here comes Finn.

138
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,784
Finn's like, uh, I don't think

139
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,027
it's quite up to temperature yet.

140
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,441
How cold is it Ollie?

141
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:58,274
Good.

142
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,115
- [Bryan] Is it not bad?

143
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:00,473
No?

144
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,723
It's good enough for Ollie.

145
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,560
Finn is seriously like, keep testing it.

146
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,227
He's like, yeah, no.

147
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:09,794
Oh, he splashed you.

148
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,149
Awe (chuckles)

149
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:14,982
Oh, Ollie.

150
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:18,385
(laughs)

151
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:21,261
Boys are so cute.

152
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:23,928
(playful music)

153
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,453
That's crazy, why are you in there?

154
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:30,703
Don't spray me.

155
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:33,769
- [Bryan] I think he's getting used to it.

156
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,515
Uh oh, he's coming back.

157
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:37,932
- [Missy] No, no!

158
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:40,376
- [Bryan] Go get mama.

159
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:41,605
- [Missy] Hey!

160
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:43,734
- [Bryan] Oh, careful.

161
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,717
(laughter)

162
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:48,001
I need some more.

163
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,834
- [Bryan] Oh, careful.

164
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:53,365
(playful music)

165
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,933
Ollie keeps filling up
his mouth with water

166
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,474
so he can squirt mama.

167
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:03,526
(chuckles) Careful.

168
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:05,776
- [Missy] You can't get me.

169
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,950
- [Bryan] Go get her Ollie, go get her.

170
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,536
Get her, get her, spray her.

171
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,786
He laughed (mumbles)

172
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:24,041
- [Bryan] Are you getting
used to the temperature?

173
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,703
It's not so cold now, huh?

174
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,370
(playful music)

175
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:35,260
So we are getting ready
for Friendsgiving all day

176
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,454
and then we have our dinner tonight.

177
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:38,771
Ollie and Finn are actually going

178
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:40,549
to go hang out with MiMi and Papa

179
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:42,200
and spend the night there,
so they're super excited.

180
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,809
The last time Finn spent
the night at my parents,

181
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:45,392
it did not go well.

182
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,572
He didn't have a crib and so

183
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:50,326
and that's what he
sleeps in now is a crib.

184
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,087
He had to sleep next to my
mom, which he doesn't do that,

185
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:54,675
so he was kind of like all over the place.

186
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:55,837
It was just kind of hard,

187
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:57,762
and I've been trying to
figure out a solution

188
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:00,110
because we are actually going
on our Thanksgiving vacation

189
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,718
in a few weeks and so I was
like, what am I gonna do?

190
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:05,968
He doesn't sleep in a Pack 'N Play

191
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,630
and we can't take a crib with us.

192
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,487
So I figured it out; I did it last night

193
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:14,058
and I basically put his
mattress inside of this net.

194
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,114
Inside the netting that
usually goes into his crib

195
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:18,512
and then I put something
on both sides of the bed

196
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:21,247
so he doesn't roll off of
it, and it totally worked.

197
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:22,486
I'm so excited.

198
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:26,005
So yeah, I think this is
going to be a good solution

199
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,715
so that he sleeps at my parents

200
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:31,871
and doesn't just go run
around everywhere crazy

201
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:33,124
and not sleep well.

202
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:34,218
He'll get a good night sleep

203
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,909
in his crib with his
bedding and everything.

204
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:38,300
So, yeah, I'm just gonna start
packing up the boys right now

205
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,495
so they can go hang out with MiMi and Papa

206
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:42,275
and I think Auntie's
actually coming down too

207
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,686
and they're gonna film some videos

208
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:46,712
and do some fun stuff, so
they're like super excited.

209
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:49,597
Alright, the boys are loaded up.

210
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:51,133
Are you excited?

211
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:54,083
Yes, we're going to open toys.

212
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,938
- [Missy] You're gonna go do
something fun with Auntie?

213
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:57,035
Yeah.
Yeah.

214
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:58,648
- [Missy] And are you excited Finn?

215
00:07:58,648 --> 00:07:59,641
Yeah.

216
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:00,551
- [Missy] Yeah, alright.

217
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:01,521
You guys have a good night.

218
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,325
Be good for MiMi and Papa, 'kay?

219
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,158
I mean it.

220
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,690
I love you guys, I'll miss you.

221
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,004
Finn's crib is all loaded up.

222
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:10,411
They've got all their jammies
and everything they need.

223
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:12,118
Alright, have a good night, 'kay?

224
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:12,951
- [Both] 'Kay.

225
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,799
- [Missy] Love you.

226
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,434
Love you too.

227
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,080
- [Missy] Oh gosh, it smells like

228
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,241
I'm gonna cry.

229
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:22,020
I am cutting onions and I am doing,

230
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,853
God it's really coming on strong.

231
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:26,600
- [Missy] It really is, I think
I'm gonna have to walk away.

232
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,407
I'm gonna film you over here.

233
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,171
I'm doing roasted vegetables

234
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:32,080
in the bottom of the turkey pan this year.

235
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,794
- [Missy] Look how cool that looks.

236
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:35,818
So I'm just putting a ton of vegetables,

237
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,409
and then I'm gonna put
olive oil all over them,

238
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,797
and then put our turkey right on top.

239
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,946
We don't really eat onion,
but onion is good flavor.

240
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,434
- [Missy] It's good flavor, yeah.

241
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:45,405
Onion has good flavor,

242
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,050
so we're just gonna throw it in there

243
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,147
with some olive oil, and
salt and pepper and stuff.

244
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,673
- [Missy] Looks good.

245
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:53,256
(upbeat music)

246
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,330
Alright we've got our turkey all ready

247
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,371
to throw it in the oven.

248
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,704
- [Missy] It looks so beautiful.

249
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:02,313
It's got veggies underneath,

250
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:03,929
it's all seasoned in olive oil

251
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:08,076
and then I got lots of
rosemary and thyme and sage.

252
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:09,131
- [Missy] Yum.

253
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,548
Those are my cookies beeping.

254
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,247
- [Bryan] For sure, look at that.

255
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,090
- [Missy] Oh wait, you forgot to tent it.

256
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,923
Oh we gotta put some foil over it.

257
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:17,756
(Missy laughs)

258
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,443
- [Missy] Okay.

259
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:20,697
Alright you guys.

260
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:22,508
So Missy and I are throwing
a Friendsgiving tonight,

261
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,311
which means we're just gonna have

262
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:26,036
a bunch of couples come
over that we're friends with

263
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:28,083
and we're gonna eat a Thanksgiving meal.

264
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,393
So we had to have a little fun with it,

265
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:31,798
so we decorated our front door,

266
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:35,232
so it looks like Monica's
front door at the apartment.

267
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:38,347
So it's got the apartment
number, and then, close it.

268
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:39,780
The other side of her house is--

269
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,840
- [Bryan] Purple!
Purple!

270
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,697
And of course we have to
have the famous frame.

271
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:46,191
- [Bryan] Yes, so we have
to put the frame on the door

272
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,410
and hopefully it stays up.

273
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,650
I just think this is gonna be

274
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,670
so cool for pictures, you know?

275
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,503
- [Missy] Right there?

276
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:51,350
Yeah, I think that's good.

277
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,661
This is like our first
ever, official dinner party.

278
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:56,399
I'm so excited to have friends over, food,

279
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,822
and get to hang out.

280
00:09:57,822 --> 00:09:59,975
Plus it's always fun
having Thanksgiving early,

281
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,251
because I love Thanksgiving food.

282
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:02,178
I mean, who doesn't?

283
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:03,859
And I like to do Thanksgiving, so--

284
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:05,461
- [Bryan] Babe, that looks so good.

285
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:08,460
Yay, we have our own Friends door.

286
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,127
(playful music)

287
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,569
So Missy and I just finished
setting up this table.

288
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,178
Which by the way, I am so impressed.

289
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,355
We fit 14 chairs around this table.

290
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:50,428
Like, we can't invite any more than

291
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:53,116
14 people to these dinner parties.

292
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:56,399
But we did it, look, this is awesome Babe.

293
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,328
Yeah, I love it.

294
00:10:57,328 --> 00:10:58,563
And I love how it turned out.

295
00:10:58,563 --> 00:11:00,530
Me and Bryan did this all ourselves.

296
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,121
- [Bryan] Yeah, we picked everything

297
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:04,171
and we knew how we wanted
it to look and stuff.

298
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,731
And we agreed on what we wanted even.

299
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:07,827
- [Bryan] Yeah.

300
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:09,455
Usually one of us has to give
up and let the other one--

301
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:10,462
(Bryan laughs)

302
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,811
And look how cute this is,

303
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:14,176
we even have a placemat for Juniper.

304
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:16,239
She'll be the only kid
at this dinner party,

305
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,605
because she's a baby.

306
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,377
So she gets to sit with all the cool kids.

307
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,618
Friendsgiving has begun.

308
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:24,285
(playful music)

309
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,560
Just came outside and found
this cat lying around.

310
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,893
Oh look at this cat, oh he's kinda cute.

311
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,424
Oh, smelly cat.

312
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:50,627
Smelly cat has come to
join our Friendsgiving.

313
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,460
Happy Friendsgiving!

314
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,877
- [Both] Happy Friendsgiving.

315
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:57,508
- [Bryan] We got Juni,
we got Kelsey and Corbin,

316
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,034
and we have a whole houseful.

317
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,035
Happy Friendsgiving you guys.

318
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:02,132
(crowd cheers)

319
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:03,433
Hey I have an announcement to make,

320
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:04,813
thank you guys all for coming.

321
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,266
Food is now ready and on the table,

322
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:09,849
so dance your happy faces over.

323
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:12,818
Crystal made mulled wine.

324
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:15,664
I'm about to drink it.

325
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:17,586
- [Bryan] Oh, it smells so good,

326
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:18,886
and it looks so good,

327
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:20,636
and look at your cup.

328
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:23,096
Princess Consuela banana hammock,

329
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,653
and you can take it home.

330
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:26,680
We bought a ton of
Friends themed cups here.

331
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,434
Here, this one's yours, crap bag.

332
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:31,003
You gotta have a crap bag.

333
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:33,136
So we just got done with dinner

334
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:35,330
and now we are all coming to the fountain.

335
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,972
(laughs)

336
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,467
[Man In Striped Vest] The water is nice.

337
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,863
- [Bryan] The fountain!

338
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:40,696
- [Woman In Black] Can
you like edit it in?

339
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:41,529
Woo!

340
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,362
- [Bryan] Everyone has to like, yeah,

341
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,532
everyone has to dance in the water.

342
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:46,115
(upbeat music)

343
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:42,229
That was such a fun time you guys.

344
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,451
We've never really thrown like

345
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:45,956
a dinner party like that or anything.

346
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,613
It was so cool just to get
to hang out with everyone

347
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:50,985
and we played board games
and ate a ton of pie,

348
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:52,251
so that was basically it.

349
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:54,235
But before I end today's
vlog, I wanted to remind you

350
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:56,139

a comment down below
