1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,172
- This is the perfect time to do something

2
00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:05,207
with Ollie that I've been
wanting to do for a while.

3
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:07,626
And we're gonna do a little, father-son

4
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:10,559
Halloween costume DIY, let's get started.

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,409
♫ This is our life.

6
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:12,763
♫ This is our fun.

7
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,194
♫ This is who we are.

8
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:16,337
♫ This is our dream

9
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:17,558
♫ this is our team

10
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:20,052
♫ shot among the stars.

11
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:22,231
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine.

12
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,793
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine.

13
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:26,770
♫ This is our life.

14
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,956
♫ Let's live it.

15
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:30,875
♫ Live it forever.

16
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:31,720
- Morning.

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,416
- [Bryan] Good mornin' Finn.

18
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,044
Did you have fun yesterday?

19
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:36,877
- Yeah.

20
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:39,052
- [Bryan] Yeah, who came
to your party, Batman?

21
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:39,885
- Yeah.

22
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:41,178
- And what did Batman give you?

23
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:42,200
- (mumbles)

24
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,606
- He gave you this.

25
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:46,954
- [Bryan] A very special medal.

26
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:48,703
- [Missy] Birthday hero.

27
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:50,306
- [Bryan] Look at it, he loves it.

28
00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:54,473
He's like oh my gosh I am
wearing a real superhero medal.

29
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,328
This is the medal that Batman gave him

30
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:59,693
yesterday, it says birthday hero.

31
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,372
Is that your favorite thing ever now?

32
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:03,899
- (mumbles)

33
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,442
- So Finn's real birthday is tomorrow.

34
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,275
- Yeah.

35
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,840
- And I think we just got
out of giving him a present.

36
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,259
Because Batman gave him a superhero medal,

37
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:11,557
so I don't think it gets
any better than that.

38
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:13,683
- (mumbles)

39
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:15,714
- Yeah, (laughing), if
you guys have not seen

40
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:17,774
yesterday's vlog I'll have
it linked in the I-card.

41
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:19,590
We had an amazing
superhero birthday party,

42
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,663
for this special little boy who is

43
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:23,496
gonna be two years old tomorrow

44
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:25,982
and I just love him to
pieces, I love you so much.

45
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:29,051
And I love you, because you gave

46
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:31,153
birth to him, we should be
celebrating you as well.

47
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:33,670
- Well we made him, so we
should celebrate you too,

48
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,731
- Oh cool let's all just party.

49
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:39,502
Finn's like wait you guys
that was my birthday party.

50
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:42,058
Hey Finn, cool thing about
medals you don't have

51
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,619
to hold it 'cause it just hangs
on your neck, there you go.

52
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:45,555
- [Missy] Say, thank you.

53
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:46,880
- Thank you.

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,423
- [Bryan] And he's all sad.

55
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:51,006
(upbeat music)

56
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:54,350
Hey Ollie, do you see what's over there?

57
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,928
- Spider, black spider.

58
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:57,958
- [Bryan] That is a giant spider isn't it.

59
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,721
- Look at that giant spider.

60
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,346
- [Bryan] There's giant
spiders everywhere?

61
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:03,431
Ooh that one's fluffy.

62
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,440
- There's lots of spider web on it.

63
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,932
- Yeah it's covered in spider webs, huh.

64
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:10,217
They have the restaurant
all decked out for Halloween

65
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,241
and Ollie is like, in love with all of it.

66
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,658
(soft music)

67
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:21,057
Hey, Finn, how's your
breakfast, is it good?

68
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,979
Just make sure Batman
doesn't eat any of it okay?

69
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:23,812
- Yeah.

70
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:24,645
- [Bryan] Yeah.

71
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,338
Check out these chicken and waffles

72
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,672
we got you guys, this is definitely

73
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,970
the kind of food you need after

74
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,741
a long hard party like
yesterday (laughing).

75
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,112
Comfort food, I'm probably gonna

76
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,522
eat like an eighth of this but,

77
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,675
it looks so good, so I had to get it.

78
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,120
- Alright now that we're
done with breakfast

79
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,853
we are going grocery shopping huh.

80
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:43,452
- Yeah we gonna make
get milk and chocolate.

81
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:45,073
- Yeah we're out of milk (laughing).

82
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,118
Grocery shopping with two kids

83
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:48,465
can be really hard and so I was like

84
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:49,882
mom do you have to go grocery shopping?

85
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:51,509
So we're both going grocery shopping

86
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,950
and we're both gonna take care of kids.

87
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,050
I've got Oliie, and my mom has got Finn

88
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,864
and she's like off doing her own shopping

89
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:58,898
and she's like super organized

90
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:00,795
when she shops, she's like I'm going here,

91
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,385
I'm going here, I'm going
here and then I'll be done.

92
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:04,031
I'm like, I'm gonna walk all the aisles

93
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,701
and til I feel like I have everything

94
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,239
and I'm probably forgetting something.

95
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,072
So let me know in the comments

96
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:11,350
what kind of shopping you do.

97
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,266
Do you, super planned out for your

98
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,689
shopping trips, or do you just walk

99
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,685
in and go alright what do I need.

100
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:19,792
Finn just turned two, well
he's turning two tomorrow.

101
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:22,082
And he's all of a sudden demanding

102
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:24,286
that he wants like little sippy cups,

103
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:27,293
like baby sippy cups,
almost even like a bottle.

104
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:29,215
So I'm buying him like a baby

105
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,584
bottle type of sippy
cup, it's not a bottle

106
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:33,807
so we're not going like that far backwards

107
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:35,158
but he doesn't like the ones that

108
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:36,750
we have now, he always cries,

109
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,972
he goes, baby bottle,
baby bottle, baby bottle.

110
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:41,501
I'm like you've never had
a bottle in your life.

111
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,010
But he really wants them so, I went ahead

112
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,708
and got him some little baby
ones, hopefully he likes them.

113
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,445
- Alright you guys, so Missy and the boys

114
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:52,024
just got back from doing
some grocery shopping.

115
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,601
And I think that this is the perfect

116
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,984
time to do something with Oliie

117
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,408
that I've been wanting to do for a while.

118
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,445
Hey Ollie, what movie you watching?

119
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:01,469
- Big Hero Six.

120
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,052
(upbeat music)

121
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:06,527
- He came home, he really wanted

122
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:07,919
to watch Big Hero Six, it's one of

123
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,655
the movies that he's been into lately.

124
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:11,424
Finn not so much but
Ollie really likes it.

125
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:14,755
We are going to dress
up as the characters.

126
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,338
I picked up all the individual things

127
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:19,476
I would need for his costume,
and I got my costume.

128
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,997
And we're gonna do a little father-son

129
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:25,357
Halloween costume DIY, let's get started.

130
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:26,622
So I googled this on my phone

131
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:29,591
and this is what I came up
for Hiro from Big Hero Six.

132
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:32,583
This is what is our end goal for Ollie.

133
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,964
And this is what we're gonna try

134
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:38,007
and pull off for me,
hoping this costume works.

135
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:40,356
Hey, Ollie, you wanna dress up today?

136
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,758
I was thinking of a really cool costume.

137
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:45,777
I figured you could be Hiro,

138
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:48,735
and I could be Baymax from Big Hero Six.

139
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,088
Does that sound like fun buddy?

140
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:51,921
Should we do it? Okay.

141
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,250
- Does Hiro wear this?

142
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,544
- So Hiro doesn't really wear this

143
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:58,598
he already has this, this is his hair.

144
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,363
So we have Ollie partially dressed up

145
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:05,111
but to complete the costume,
we need to use a wig.

146
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,359
And I do not think that Ollie

147
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,044
has ever worn a wig before, so

148
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:10,554
I'm gonna put this on
him and see if it works.

149
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:11,834
You ready, are you excited?

150
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,382
It's a lot like wearing a hat, kay.

151
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:14,481
- Okay.

152
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,019
- See it's like a little hat.

153
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,056
Gonna put it on, it's a lot like

154
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,883
wearing a hat but it might
be a little itchy okay.

155
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,978
See, now you have Hiro hair.

156
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,187
Alright, we gotta try
with the wig cap first.

157
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:25,342
What do you think, how's that feel?

158
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,249
- Good.

159
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:27,883
- [Bryan] See it doesn't
feel all itchy, right?

160
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:29,972
It's really soft, so now we have

161
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:31,293
to put the wig on top of it, kay.

162
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:35,783
Try this again okay, kay,
gonna put it on right,

163
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,884
on there, and it's going this way now.

164
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:40,533
That looks cool, what do you think?

165
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,073
Do you like it?

166
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,169
- Yeah.

167
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,539
- Yeah, that's your new hair bro.

168
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,401
You guys Ollie is wearing a wig

169
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:51,752
and he looks just like Hiro (laughing).

170
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,776
What do you think dude, can
you see your reflection?

171
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:54,825
- [Ollie] Yeah.

172
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:56,216
- [Bryan] What do you think?

173
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:57,182
- Good.

174
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:59,417
- [Bryan] It looks cool, yeah,

175
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:03,708
look at this long, black
rocker hair he's wearing.

176
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,754
It's so cute, alright daddy's

177
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:08,361

00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,761
kinda sad, I don't know, sadder, sadder,

197
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,947
really sad, or mad which one are you.

198
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:01,201

Alright we're gonna go walk

205
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:15,026

206
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,426
C'mere Finn, I'm gonna hug you.

209
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,839

210
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,819
- Dada.

211
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,591

212
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,719
- Yeah.

213
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:33,916

you're my bestest friend.

214
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,499
(upbeat music)

215
00:07:50,518 --> 00:07:52,688
- Okay first of all, I
love him in dark hair.

216
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,730
- [Missy] I know isn't it cute.

217
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,878
- Oh sorry I didn't see you over there.

218
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:58,511
(Missy laughing)

219
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,224
- [Missy] Isn't he so cool, that is

220
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:02,088
like the coolest costume right.

221
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:02,921
- That's cool.

222
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:04,534
- [Bryan] I am Baymax your personal

223
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:07,534
health assistant, what is your mood?

224
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,382
- [Suzanne] Right now it's, it's this one.

225
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:13,320
(Missy laughing)

226
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,015
- [Bryan] Beep, you are happy, I can tell

227
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:18,474
'cause of your smile and
the redness in your cheeks.

228
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:20,185
- Oh my gosh.

229
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:23,446
- [Missy] Alright dad
you have to, (laughing).

230
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:25,048
- [Suzanne] But, it makes his eyes,

231
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:28,633
look at his blue eyes,
dark hair blue eyes.

232
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,845
- [Jim] That don't look like
Ollie, you sure that's Ollie?

233
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:30,728
- [Missy] I know it doesn't
look like Ollie at all.

234
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:32,895
- [Bryan] Hiro, high five.

235
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,677
Jim, what is your current mood.

236
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:39,499
Beep, you could be happier, try taking

237
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,528
some time to breathe and relax today.

238
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:43,145
(girls laughing)

239
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:46,108
- [Jim] Yeah, I don't do that.

240
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,621
- [Suzanne] Well I don't
suppose you'd be able to.

241
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:48,610
- [Missy] What do you think of that?

242
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,162
- [Suzanne] Think he'd be able
to trick-or-treat in that.

243
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,334
- [Missy] Yeah I know, this is

244
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:53,308
what you should be for Halloween.

245
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:54,415
- [Bryan] You're my best friend Hiro.

246
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:55,582
- [Missy] Aww.

247
00:08:56,793 --> 00:09:00,960
- [Bryan] Hold my hand and
guide me through your house.

248
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:06,423
I need to lose a couple
pounds, slow down Hiro.

249
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:11,095
- [Missy] You gotta slow
down, he can't walk that fast.

250
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:12,946
You gonna show him your room?

251
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:15,999
- [Bryan] What, this is your room?

252
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:16,845
- [Ollie] Yeah.

253
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:18,808
- [Bryan] This room's amazing.

254
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,563
(Missy laughing)

255
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,346
- [Missy] Say, take a nap Hiro.

256
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,795
- [Ollie] Take a nap Hiro.

257
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,096
- [Bryan] You want me to take a nap?

258
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,699
- [Ollie] Yeah.

259
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,149
- [Bryan] Okay, I'm not really sure

260
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,176
how beds work 'cause I'm a
robot, but I'll give it a shot.

261
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:38,176
- [Missy] Oh my gosh (laughing)

262
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,808
There we go, wow, he's relaxing.

263
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,248
- [Bryan] That was great.

264
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:50,121
- [Missy] That was so good.

265
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,243
- [Bryan] Hey Hiro, can
you show me the kitchen?

266
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,251
- Yeah.

267
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,084
- [Missy] Go show him the kitchen.

268
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,046
- [Bryan] I wanna make sure that

269
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:56,986
you have nothing but healthy foods.

270
00:09:56,986 --> 00:10:00,089
- [Missy] Alright we're gonna
go show him our kitchen.

271
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:01,757
Maybe he could do our dishes.

272
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:02,590
- Yeah.

273
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,423
- [Missy] 'Cause he's a robot, so.

274
00:10:03,423 --> 00:10:06,684
- [Bryan] Baymax does not
do dishes, unfortunately.

275
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:07,874
- [Missy] Why not?

276
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,395
- [Bryan] Maybe in version two.

277
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:14,562
- [Missy] Alright we need to
upgrade to Baymax number two.

278
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,170
Ollie how is that wig?

279
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,003
- Good.

280
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,200
- [Missy] He's kinda been like

281
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,024
the wig is a little uncomfortable.

282
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:34,738
Ahhh where'd your hair go?

283
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:35,738
- [Jim] Hey.

284
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,380
- [Missy] There's Ollie.

285
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,449
- [Bryan] Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

286
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:43,699
Battery low, powering down.

287
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,573
(Missy laughing)

288
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,073
- [Bryan] Still powering down.

289
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,627
Whoa, whoa.

290
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:55,540
- [Missy] Whoa.

291
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,334
- I got swallowed by a big robot.

292
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:01,388
- [Missy] Look, Ollie's
back and daddy's back.

293
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:04,888
- Hey, what's up dude, was that fun, yeah.

294
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:08,712
Just bringing a little Baymax IRL.

295
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:11,670
- [Missy] Yeah, I think
Finn liked that to.

296
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,152
Finn, did you like that?

297
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:13,985
- Yeah.

298
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:14,818
- [Missy] Yeah.

299
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:16,597
- [Bryan] Papa's got some hair.

300
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,526
- Yeah look at that, this would be you

301
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:20,429
if you were like a rocker dude.

302
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,621
- I mean this is about like
1982 I'd say (mumbles).

303
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:25,416
- I feel like this is the hair
you had when it was brown.

304
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,793
- I had a tail.

305
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:29,257
- [Bryan] Oh my god, I got lucky I found

306
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:32,370
a kid size wig too, it
fits his head really well.

307
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,651
(everyone laughing)

308
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,358
Let's try it on Finn, see what he thinks.

309
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:39,775
- Oh look at that, that you are adorable.

310
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:43,148
- Look at you.

311
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:46,111
- Oh my gosh that actually looks so cute.

312
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,548
- [Bryan] Look at these layers.

313
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:51,474
- [Missy] And it's Hiro,
why do you look so cute.

314
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:53,103
- He's like and I'm done.

315
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,553
- We got like ten seconds.

316
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:56,115
- [Jim] (mumbles) Goldilocks back.

317
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,073
- [Bryan] I'm surprised we got

318
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:59,264

00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,953
it's probably like 60 degrees

351
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:13,175
and so we're not really
feeling like going in it.

352
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,430
But, I've got the dogs out and Luna

353
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,978
is getting so good at
being with the chickens.

354
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:19,552
The chickens are out too, getting

355
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:22,524
some fresh grass and fresh bugs.

356
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:25,021
We've got a big old rooster
here if you can't tell.

357
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,385
Alright, my mom just discovered

358
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:28,685
that we have one more rooster

359
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:29,784
but we don't know which one it is.

360
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:32,428
I think it's one of the silkies
one of these white ones,

361
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,330
but I can't figure out which one it is.

362
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,448
Either way though it's definitely

363
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,200
not like a big rooster he's not

364
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,735
like the king of the,
the what is it called

365
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,090
king of the hill, yeah like this one's

366
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,295
in charge man, they follow him everywhere.

367
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:48,187
But I don't know which one,
which other one's the rooster.

368
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:50,946
But we could hear two
cockle-doodle-dooing.

369
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,995
He can only cockle-doodle-doo once.

370
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:55,058
- One very quiet, and one's really loud.

371
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,016
- [Missy] Yeah, so we'll see what happens.

372
00:13:57,016 --> 00:14:00,076
You guys, check out my fruit trees.

373
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:03,059
This one just burst, but
yeah these are oranges.

374
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,991
We got lots of oranges on here.

375
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,600
Got lemons, we gotta pick these.

376
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,890
- [Suzanne] We gotta pick
them, perfect, feel that.

377
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,360
- Look at our fresh lemon, smells so good.

378
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,749
- Oh my god, oh it smells good.

379
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:20,332
(upbeat music)

380
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:40,246
Alright that concludes
our nighttime reading.

381
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,482
It has been so nice because the boys

382
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,087
can now like cuddle together in bed.

383
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,327
And we can read books and it makes

384
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,441
bedtime a little more, a little easier.

385
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:50,586
Although right now they
are both very tired.

386
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:52,396
I'm excited for the day
that they can share.

387
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:54,493
They can't quite share a room yet.

388
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,359
Finn's just a little to young still.

389
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,783
But it is cool that we can merge

390
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,551
some of their bedtime together.

391
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:01,252
And that way when we go to let them

392
00:15:01,252 --> 00:15:03,756
like share rooms, it
won't be to much different

393
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:06,214
then their already, like, bedtime routine.

394
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,491
We're getting ready for bed, we're

395
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,671
gonna go ahead and end this video.

396
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,486
So make sure you give

397
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:12,599

398
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,947
Ollie's still giving a thumbs up

399
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,061
even though he's having a hard night.

400
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:17,548
You have such a fun little life, huh.

401
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:21,303

Baymax, how cool is that?
