1
00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:02,787
- I'm hoping that this goes a
little better than last time.

2
00:00:02,787 --> 00:00:04,780
He really wants to show
you guys how brave he is.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,537
So I'm gonna let him tell
'em what we're doing.

4
00:00:06,537 --> 00:00:08,169
- I can cry if I want.

5
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:09,822
- [Missy] Yes, of course
you can cry if you want.

6
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:11,910
- [Bryan] Hey boys, I know I've been gone

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,840
for a couple of days, but I
brought something back for you.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,673
- What?

9
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:15,979
- You wanna see?

10
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,702
- [Missy] Ollie, where are we now?

11
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:18,982
- A new motorcycle.

12
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:21,477
- Should we get you a motorcycle, Ollie?

13
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:22,706
- Maybe.

14
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:23,587
- What did you do?

15
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:24,806
- I got a new ...

16
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,061
- A new what?

17
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:26,894
♫ This is our life

18
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:27,999
♫ This is our fun

19
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,480
♫ This is who we are

20
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,561
♫ This is our dream

21
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,911
♫ This is our team

22
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:35,470
♫ Shine among the stars

23
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,555
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

24
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:40,086
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

25
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:41,996
♫ This is our life

26
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:44,097
♫ Let's live it

27
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:46,205
♫ Live it forever

28
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:48,596
- Good morning!
- Morning!

29
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:51,682
- Good morning boys, I got up super early.

30
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:54,086
Actually stayed the
night in LA with Bryan,

31
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:55,639
but I came home really early,

32
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,448
so I could be with my boys.

33
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,555
(baby babbling)

34
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:00,809
You hang out with Papa and Mimi?

35
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:01,642
- Yeah.

36
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:02,822
- Was that fun?

37
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:03,655
- Yeah.

38
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:07,226
- Finn's already working on another knot.

39
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:10,416
I need to get Finn a haircut like ASAP.

40
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,430
Because he just keeps making
knots, and it's so sad.

41
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,258
The fishies are doing good today.

42
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:20,258
There's Lloyd and Pearl
and there's our big one.

43
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,783
We still haven't named him actually.

44
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,104
You guys should let us
know in the comments

45
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:25,758
what you think we should name him.

46
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:26,731
He's a pretty big guy.

47
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:28,298
Bryan likes to call him Dude.

48
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:30,160
He's just a big dude, I don't know.

49
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,343
But I've got some food for him.

50
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:32,176
Should we feed him?

51
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,009
- Yeah.

52
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,191
- Yeah? Okay.

53
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:36,639
We've got a little strip of seaweed here.

54
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,307
And it's clipped onto this little clamp,

55
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:42,474
and then we're just gonna put
it right in here like that.

56
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:45,789
And then we wait.

57
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,630
(Oliver murmuring)

58
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,446
Lloyd's coming to say hi to you, huh?

59
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:52,362
- He's singing that's shining!

60
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,728
- He's singing Shining? (laughs)

61
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:56,687
We are at our first stop of the day.

62
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,147
Chickens need some food.

63
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:01,490
I've got Ollie with me.
- See the kitty cats!

64
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,559
- Yes, he really loves
those baby kitty cats.

65
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:06,067
I've got Papa with me,
and we're gonna go get

66
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:09,166
some chicken food and
some other extra things.

67
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,489
We just have like a few errands to do,

68
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,297
and Papa thought he'd tag
along, hang out with Ollie.

69
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:16,040
(gasps) Chickens!

70
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,622
- [Oliver] So cute!

71
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:19,376
- [Missy] Oh my goodness!

72
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:23,847
They have the little chicks
that Susan or Hayhay is.

73
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,347
That one, so cute.

74
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:29,014
All kinds of babies.

75
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,696
What'd you find over here?

76
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:31,655
- Balls.

77
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,337
I can get one for Luna.

78
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:35,109
- [Missy] Okay, you wanna get a ball

79
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:36,472
for Luna and a ball for Karma?

80
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:37,800
- This one's for Luna.

81
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
The red one's for Karma.

82
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,675
- [Missy] Should we
get a big one for Luna?

83
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:44,658
Because she's kind of a bigger dog.

84
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:46,111
That might choke her.

85
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:46,944
- [Oliver] Okay.

86
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:48,236
- [Missy] Yeah, there we go.

87
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:50,368
- [Oliver] I think I'm
gonna give her a red one.

88
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:51,461
- [Missy] You gonna get two red ones?

89
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:52,294
- Mm-hm.

90
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:53,816
- [Missy] All right, let's do it.

91
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:56,334
All right, got our chicken food.

92
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:58,083
Then we got some fun stuff for the dogs.

93
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,593
I got these yummy cookies for the dogs.

94
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:01,953
I thought that that would be fun.

95
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:03,585
It's almost Luna's birthday.

96
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:04,940
Ollie! Who is that?

97
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,395
- Santa Claus!

98
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,346
- [Missy] Santa Claus, how cool.

99
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:12,204
Now he's checking out
these Halloween things.

100
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,854
Ollie, does this stuff scare you at all?

101
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:14,687
- No.

102
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:15,662
- No?

103
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,829
What are you playing with?

104
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:21,252
He's eating your arm!

105
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:24,289
So we just ran into PetSmart

106
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,102
and got dog food for Karma and Luna.

107
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:28,913
And they had so many cool things

108
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,493
for dogs who it's their birthday.

109
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:34,480
So I got the cutest stuff for Luna.

110
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,106
Her birthday isn't til next week,

111
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:37,821
but I'm still really excited.

112
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:39,908
She's gonna have like a cute little outfit

113
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:42,078
and little toys and treats

114
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:44,401
and we even can decorate our own treats.

115
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,599
They have like so much that
you can get at PetSmart.

116
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,432
It was crazy.

117
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:48,754
Way more than like the feet store.

118
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:51,221
But anyways, off to the next place, right?

119
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,572
Ollie, where are we now?

120
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:55,794
- A new motorcycle.

121
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:56,852
- [Missy] Motorcycle.

122
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:58,160
Are we gonna get a motorcycle?

123
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,013
- No.

124
00:03:59,013 --> 00:03:59,930
- No. (laughs)

125
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,897
Should we get you a motorcycle, Ollie?

126
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:03,647
- Maybe a little one.

127
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:06,817
- A little one just for you?

128
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,781
Let's find some that fit you.

129
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,473
Ollie's like in heaven right now.

130
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:12,496
Hey wait, Ollie come sit
on this one right here.

131
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:13,746
Oh my goodness!

132
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:15,711
- [Papa] This is to go faster.

133
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:16,622
Vroom, vroom, vroom!

134
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:19,510
- [Missy] You are basically
big enough to ride that.

135
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,005
Oh my gosh!

136
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:23,090
(Papa mumbling)

137
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,923
Yeah!

138
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:26,679
- [Papa] Look at this one.

139
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:27,512
It looks smaller.

140
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:28,761
- [Missy] Look at this one, Ollie!

141
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:29,863
- [Papa] You gonna put training wheels?

142
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:30,844
- Oh my gosh, I know, right?

143
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,594
Wow, is that so cool?

144
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,449
So we are at this motor sports store

145
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,639
because we are looking at
getting another Polaris.

146
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,587
Our Polaris right now is just kind

147
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:46,529
of like not running super well,

148
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:47,880
so we kinda know it's out the door.

149
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,567
And we use it a lot to do a
lot of stuff around the yard.

150
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,323
And we've been kind of
looking at something

151
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,554
that has a little more power

152
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:57,290
and maybe won't break down on us.

153
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,489
Let me show you what we're looking at.

154
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:01,246
So we really want one that is two rows,

155
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:02,633
so all the family can sit in it.

156
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,586
But we don't want these
bucket seat type things

157
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:08,953
because we want a lot of
people to be able to fit in it

158
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:10,904
because the bucket seats, I mean really,

159
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,313
only two people can sit in there.

160
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,467
But when you have like bench seating,

161
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,478
multiple people can sit in that row.

162
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,586
So for instance, this one is a bench.

163
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,795
I mean we can put the kids in between us,

164
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,102
and me and Bryan can sit there.

165
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:23,538
Then there's a whole 'nother row

166
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:25,249
if like my mom and dad wanted to hop on.

167
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:27,207
Bryan originally picked out this one.

168
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:28,139
He's like, "I wanna get this one.

169
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,590
"I think it's a good
price and a good deal."

170
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,780
But we found this one which is

171
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,697
more power, way nicer, and cheaper.

172
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:38,428
And he's really working a deal for us.

173
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,007
So I'm super excited that
we were able to find it.

174
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,321
But I'm also nervous because I don't

175
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,496
normally do this stuff without him.

176
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,964
And I'm like, "Bryan, call me."

177
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,636
But he's driving and he's just
super busy and can't call me.

178
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:50,459
I think that he's gonna be
really excited about this choice.

179
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,540
I really like the color.

180
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,000
I like that it's got a lot
more power than that one.

181
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,743
I like just the look of
it is super, super nice.

182
00:05:57,743 --> 00:05:58,883
And the seats are nice.

183
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:00,528
Like really, really comfy, nice seats.

184
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,812
And it's a great price.

185
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:02,903
So I'm super excited.

186
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,658
I think this is the one,
and I think I'm actually

187
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:06,841
just gonna go ahead and purchase it.

188
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:10,131
Because we really need to
get one, and my dad's here.

189
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,197
He gives me the thumbs up.

190
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:12,924
I feel pretty good about it then.

191
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:15,123
All right guys, we have
been doing errands all day.

192
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:18,698
We ended up getting the
Polaris that we wanted,

193
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:19,764
so I'm really excited about that.

194
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:22,088
But now we are doing the thing

195
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,404
that Ollie has been not
looking forward to all day.

196
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:26,363
He really wants to show
you guys how brave he is.

197
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:27,872
So I'm gonna let him tell
'em what we're doing.

198
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:29,597
- I can cry if I want.

199
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,411
- [Missy] Yes, of course
you can cry if you want.

200
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:32,436
What are you thinkin'?

201
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:33,365
Where we going?

202
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:34,850
- The doctor's place.

203
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,558
- Yeah, we're going to the doctor's?

204
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:38,103
- I'm supposed to ...

205
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,353
The shots hurt.

206
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:44,039
- Yeah I know, you gotta
get one shot today, okay?

207
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,852
Just one. You're gonna be super brave.

208
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:49,107
I love you.

209
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,944
You know we do it so you
don't get sick, right?

210
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,980
Okay, then you're all done.

211
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,455
I'm hoping that this goes a little bit

212
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:57,425
better than last time.

213
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:00,366
Last time was pretty
traumatic for both of us.

214
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,838
He only has to get one,
and we're just going in,

215
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,568
getting it done, and then we can leave.

216
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:06,861
But I feel so bad whenever
the kids get shots.

217
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,942
I'm like, I hate it too.

218
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:10,692
I totally get it, it's hard.

219
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:14,182
I told him he can cry if he
wants but he is super brave,

220
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,069
so I think he's gonna do really good.

221
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,111
Okay, Ollie?

222
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:17,944
- Yeah.

223
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,448
- You're gonna do so good.

224
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:22,281
(uplifting music)

225
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,072
All right, it's done.

226
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:42,159
How did it go, baby?

227
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,092
(Oliver whimpering)

228
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:44,955
Didn't go well.

229
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:49,337
It was pretty traumatic,
which again, I understand.

230
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:51,267
It's very scary to get shots.

231
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:53,018
- They poked a hole in him!

232
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,851
- I know, why'd they do that, huh?

233
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:58,808
We're all done, but I think now

234
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:00,302
we're gonna get a little cupcake

235
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:02,545
because we all need a
little cupcake right now.

236
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:03,625
(laughs)

237
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,802
- [Papa] I'm getting chocolate.

238
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:06,688
- [Missy] That was traumatic
for all of us, I feel like.

239
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:07,697
- What are you getting?

240
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,114
- Vanilla.

241
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,360
- Vanilla. Maybe we'll get Daddy one.

242
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,193
Poor guy.

243
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,335
- [Bryan] Hey buddy.

244
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,619
- Hey, I got a shot and it hurt.

245
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,619
- [Bryan] Aw, I'm sorry.

246
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:22,649
I'll be sure to give you lots of hugs

247
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,318
and kisses when you get home, okay?

248
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:27,151
- I'm gonna get a vanilla cupcake.

249
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,223
- [Bryan] Oh, nice!

250
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:33,905
- You're gonna get a strawberry one.

251
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,491
- [Bryan] Okay, I'll
eat the strawberry one.

252
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:37,825
- And Finn's gonna get chocolate,

253
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:40,011
and Papa's gonna get chocolate.

254
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:41,430
- [Bryan] Pops?

255
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:42,881
Did you just call Papa Pops?

256
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,089
(Missy laughs)

257
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,234
- [Missy] Did you call him Pops?

258
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,067
- Mm-hm.

259
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,338
- [Bryan] That's a cute name.

260
00:08:48,338 --> 00:08:49,399
I miss you!

261
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,816
- I miss you too.

262
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,697
- [Bryan] Guess what?

263
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:55,637
I'm home!

264
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:56,887
And you're not!

265
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,691
- [Missy] We need to get
home and see Daddy, huh?

266
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:02,723
All right, since Ollie did so good,

267
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,142
he's getting a little cupcake.

268
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:04,975
Actually we're all getting

269
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,172
a cupcake.
- Little cupcake?

270
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:07,608
- Apparently they don't have cupcakes.

271
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:08,933
- We got these giant cakes.

272
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,136
We're gonna be splitting them.

273
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:11,804
- [Missy] There are cupcakes over here.

274
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:12,974
Let's see what's over here.

275
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,951
All right, I think we've
compromised with this one.

276
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,527
It's got all kinds of cupcakes.

277
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:19,257
One for Finn, one for Daddy
and Mommy and Papa and Mimi.

278
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,358
That looks good, huh?

279
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:21,838
All right, hold onto those.

280
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:24,157
- I wanna eat them.

281
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:25,235
- [Missy] I know.

282
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:26,816
We're gonna eat them
when we get home, 'kay?

283
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,649
- Hey Ollie!

284
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:28,482
- What?

285
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:29,415
- Dad is home!

286
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:30,248
- Yay!

287
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:31,964
- Are you so excited? Yeah?

288
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:33,035
What did you do?

289
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:34,285
- I got a new ...

290
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:35,268
- A new what?

291
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:36,601
- A new Polaris!

292
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:40,390
- Yes, show it to us!

293
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,932
So I just got home, and this
was sitting in the driveway.

294
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,068
- Look what I got today!

295
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:47,458
- [Bryan] Babe!

296
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,008
We got a new toy, you guys.

297
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:51,805
Look at this.

298
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:54,122
- I'm pretty proud of
myself for doing this.

299
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:55,768
- [Bryan] You found a good deal.

300
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:56,880
- Do you like it?

301
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,997
- [Bryan] I do like it.

302
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,390
- It looks really slick, I feel like.

303
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,416
- [Bryan] Yeah.

304
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,941
The seat's are super nice.

305
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:04,057
- [Missy] There's even
a bar here to hold onto.

306
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:05,264
- [Bryan] Yeah yeah, that's neat.

307
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:09,116
Lots of storage for moving
things around the property.

308
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:11,621
- It's got a lot more
power than our last one.

309
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,869
- [Bryan] Yeah, I already
whipped it around.

310
00:10:13,869 --> 00:10:14,932
- Oh, you did?

311
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:16,979
How was the power steering?

312
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:17,858
- [Bryan] Amazing.

313
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,910
- The other one, we're like (panting).

314
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,655
- We didn't even have
power steering on it, yeah.

315
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,488
You like it, dude?

316
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,276
You helped Momma pick this one out?

317
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:25,248
- [Oliver] Yeah.

318
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:27,250
- [Bryan] Nice, you did a good job.

319
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,333
Safety first.

320
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,719
- Safety first!

321
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:31,709
- [Bryan] You all buckled in?

322
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,471
And then look, it has
this little mesh thing

323
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,907
which I like a lot more than those doors.

324
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:38,328
It feels like it's safer.

325
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:39,436
- It's totally safer.

326
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,130
The doors come to your knees.

327
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,671
I would literally still fall out.

328
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,417
- Look who else is here!

329
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,755
Finn's been hanging out
with Mimi and Papa all day.

330
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:49,046
- [Missy] He's so tired,
he's like out of it.

331
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:50,003
- Hi, Finn!

332
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:51,614
Do you wanna go for a ride?

333
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:52,450
- Yeah.

334
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,364
- Yeah?

335
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:55,776
All right, we got the boys in.

336
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,396
We got Karma in.

337
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:00,229
(engine starting)

338
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,845
- [Missy] Here we go!

339
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:05,762
- [Bryan] Safety first!

340
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,832
- Whoa! It takes a little
more getting used to.

341
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:10,665
Wow, this drives nice!

342
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:15,537
- It's like driving a car.

343
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:18,495
- [Missy] How's it feel back there?

344
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:19,446
- Good!

345
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,863
- Oh my goodness!

346
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:25,017
(shrieking)

347
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,950
Daddy's being way too crazy.

348
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,690
(laughs)

349
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,147
It feels really nice.

350
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,957
It feels way less bumpy, like comfortable.

351
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,519
- Yeah, it's really
smooth, and the steering.

352
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,945
Oh my gosh!

353
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:43,528
(wind blowing)

354
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,530
(upbeat music)

355
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,224
- [Bryan] Hey boys!

356
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,554
I know I've been gone for a couple days,

357
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:07,783
but I brought something back for you.

358
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:08,616
- What?

359
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:09,699
- You wanna see?

360
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:10,532
Chickens!

361
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:15,361
That one's yours, and
this one's yours, Finley.

362
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:17,233
Isn't that a cute little chicken?

363
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,093
- Thank you, Da-da!

364
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:19,797
- You're welcome.

365
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:22,694
Finn, can you say thank you?
- Thank you, Da-da!

366
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:24,361
- Aww, thanks buddy!

367
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:26,886
No problem.

368
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:29,256
Ollie, who is on your cupcake?

369
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:30,691
- [Oliver] Buzz!

370
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:33,433
- Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

371
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:36,018
That's so cool Momma
got you boys cupcakes.

372
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:37,890
Finn, who's on yours? Can I see?

373
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,010
Oh is that Jessie and Bullseye?

374
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,882
I got the one with all
the little friends on it.

375
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:45,164
So we got Hamm and Mr. Twinklepits.

376
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,252
You want it off?

377
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,726
- [Missy] I think he wants Woody.

378
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,879
- [Bryan] Oh you want Woody, Finn?

379
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,384
- It's the same thing.

380
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:54,204
- Same exact cupcake,
different decoration.

381
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:55,037
That's okay.

382
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,200
Here you go, kiddo.

383
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,166
What do you say?

384
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,087
- Thank you.

385
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,505
- You're welcome.

386
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:02,088
(upbeat music)

387
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,896
Aw, you giving Luna some love?

388
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:14,033
So I am taking Luna out
for a much needed walk.

389
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:17,112
I put the leash on her and
she is so good on it still.

390
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:18,743
We haven't been working with her a ton.

391
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:20,285
She's kinda just been doing her own thing

392
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,085
in the yard and in the house and stuff.

393
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,062
And she's been really good
but when she's on a leash,

394
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,787
she's still a very, very good dog.

395
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:29,469
One thing though, Luna is
still in heat, you guys.

396
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:32,040
And I am just flabbergasted because

397
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,850
I believe it's been five weeks now.

398
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,650
We're thinking Karma might be the issue.

399
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,595
So we're actually gonna
try and separate them

400
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:39,637
for a little bit until she gets fixed.

401
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:42,296
They cannot have puppies
in case you're wondering.

402
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:43,313
Because Karma's fixed.

403
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,376
But it might help her a bit.

404
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,818
She's loving the love
though from all the boys.

405
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:48,862
Hi, Luna!

406
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,102
You're such a good puppy, yes you are.

407
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:53,695
Oh, did you hurt yourself?

408
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,278
Want me to kiss it?

409
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,209
Is that better?

410
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:03,717
Look at all the love,
all the love I'm getting.

411
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,842
Finn just climbs up me like a monkey.

412
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:07,031
(laughs)

413
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:08,263
Was that fun, Finn?

414
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:09,228
- Yeah.

415
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,154
- Okay, we'll both walk
her together, okay?

416
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,312
(laughs)

417
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:16,145
(energetic music)

418
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,253
Look what Ollie can do.

419
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:22,635
Whoa! That's cool, dude.

420
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:24,459
Finn, you playing with the pirate ship?

421
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,292
- Yeah.

422
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:29,115
- All right, it's almost
time for bed, okay?

423
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:31,041
He's like, "'Kay no."

424
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,829
You gotta go to bed tonight, okay?

425
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,370
Did you have a good day, dude?

426
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,290
- Yeah.

427
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,500
- You wanna help me end the vlog?

428
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,802
- Give this video a thumbs up.

429
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,516
- That's right, give
this video a thumbs up.

430
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,484
Leave a comment down below with

431
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,000

Say bye!

437
00:14:57,948 --> 00:00:00,000
