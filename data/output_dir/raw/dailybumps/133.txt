1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,900
- [Bryan] Oh no here we go!

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,733
Whoa!

3
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:07,346
That was a wipe-out if I
ever did see one (laughs).

4
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:10,403
- Basically there was a
morning, not to long ago,

5
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:14,154
where I woke up to the sound
of my chickens screaming.

6
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:17,275
- [Missy] Ollie, you're doing
so go with your up angles.

7
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:18,560
You know how to get the best shot.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,893
You gotta lift up like that.

9
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,581
♫ This is our life, this is our fun,

10
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:26,937
♫ This is who we are.

11
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,338
♫ This is our dream, this is our team.

12
00:00:29,338 --> 00:00:31,893
♫ Shot among the stars.

13
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:34,221
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine.

14
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:36,573
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine.

15
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:38,782
♫ This is our life.

16
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:40,803
♫ Let's live it

17
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:42,661
♫ Live it forever!

18
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:45,729
- Good morning!

19
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,982
- [Everyone Together] Good morning!

20
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,815
- Hey guys, look I'm a fox!

21
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,496
Good morning Ollie and Finn.

22
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:57,141
- Hey guys, check us all out
in our Christmas onesies.

23
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,527
- Yeah, we all have onesies on today.

24
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,785
- Mainly just because
they're so comfortable.

25
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:02,740
- [Missy] So comfy.

26
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,766
- So comfy, I wish ours
had booties like these.

27
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:06,939
- I don't know, I like my feet out,

28
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,507
I don't like to feel trapped.

29
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:09,371
- We've been having such a good morning

30
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:10,470
haven't we boys?

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,328
- [Ollie] Yeah

32
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:13,211
- Yes, the boys have been
playing with the Animoji

33
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:14,433
on my phone, which they love.

34
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:15,599
Ollie you wanna try it?

35
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,432
- Yeah.

36
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:17,440
- [Bryan] Which one do
you want to be Ollie?

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,107
- [Ollie] I want to be the um...

38
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:21,811
- [Bryan] The bunny?

39
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:22,840
- [Ollie] Yeah, bunny.
- [Bryan] Okay.

40
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,247
Do you see it sees you?

41
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:25,612
Say hi.

42
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:26,941
- [Ollie] Hi.

43
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,339
(Finn humming)

44
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,202
- [Bryan] Finn you wanna try?

45
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:30,768
Say hi!

46
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:32,055
- [Finn] Hi!

47
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:33,964
(Bryan and Missy laughing)

48
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:35,567
- [Missy] You are just so cute.

49
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:36,853
- [Bryan] Isn't that a cute little bunny?

50
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:38,090
Yeah.

51
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,648
- Yeah!

52
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:40,481
- [Robot] A robot.

53
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:41,688
- [Bryan] He's a robot.

54
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:43,682
- [Robot] I'm a robot.

55
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:45,496
He's a robot.

56
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,515
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, guess what.

57
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,348
- [Ollie] What?

58
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:50,555
- [Bryan] Our new music
video went up today.

59
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:51,460
- [Ollie] For real?

60
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,378
- [Bryan] Yes, it went up yesterday.

61
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:55,199
For you guys, if you have not seen it,

62
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,003
I'll have it linked in the
I-card and in the description.

63
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:58,730
Excuse my crazy bed head by the way,

64
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,990
that's just how it goes sometimes.

65
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,536
But, yeah music video went up today.

66
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:03,619
You like the music video?

67
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,452
- [Ollie] Yeah.

68
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:05,665
- [Bryan] Yeah, can you sing
a little bit of the song?

69
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:09,836
- [Ollie] This is our
pride, this is our pride...

70
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:11,307
- [Bryan] (laughs) You guys are so cute.

71
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:13,282
The boys love the song
still, they dance to it

72
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:14,343
all the time.

73
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,039
If you guys don't know,
it's our new theme song,

74
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,739
Tribe, we did a lyric video for it, we did

75
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:18,658
a music video for it.

76
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:20,523
All that is gonna be in
the I-card, so go check

77
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:21,530
that out.

78
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,429
We have a fun day today
though, it's Saturday.

79
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:25,804
What do you boys wanna do?

80
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:28,661
- I want to go to a bouncy house.

81
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:30,687
- [Bryan] He really wants
to go to a park and play.

82
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:32,177
- [Missy] I wanna lay in bed all day.

83
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:33,494
- [Bryan] Yeah, we wanna
lay in bed all day,

84
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:34,327
(Missy laughs)

85
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:35,229
and play Nintendo.

86
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:36,330
- [Missy] Yes!
(Bryan laughs)

87
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,199
- [Bryan] Oh no, here we go, oh!

88
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,127
Whoa!

89
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,503
That was a wipe-out if I ever did see one.

90
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:44,910
(Bryan laughing)

91
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,512
I love how Finn just
stays on the ground like,

92
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:48,090
"Yup, I'm down."

93
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,305
Get him, get him Finn, get him!

94
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,835
Oh geez! (laughs)

95
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:56,567
Are you okay mister?

96
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,973
(laughs)

97
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:00,496
They're having so much fun
right now pillow fighting.

98
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:03,204
Or Ollie might be having
fun, he's the one winning.

99
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:04,927
Oh, alright Ollie.

100
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:08,067
Hey, you gotta let Finn hit
you a couple times, kay?

101
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,123
Kay, Finn get him!

102
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,560
Finn can you get your brother?

103
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,859
Payback, he's coming in for revenge!

104
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,541
He's coming in for revenge, he (laughs)

105
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:18,333
just basically hit himself
with a pillow (laughs).

106
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,969
You're so silly.

107
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,858
(Finn giggles).

108
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,148
Get him Ollie, get him!

109
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:24,946
Ahhhh! (laughs)

110
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:28,420
Sorry Finn, I love you, you lost.

111
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,795
Alright get him, now's your chance,

112
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,302
pick up your pillow Finn.

113
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,411
Hit him with it, hit him with it!

114
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:34,340
Hit him with it!

115
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,327
Oh, I think the pillows
are too heavy for Finn.

116
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:41,827
That's my wife, still playing video games.

117
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,466
You really into this right now?

118
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:45,501
Oh, are you about to die?

119
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,681
Can you stop the game?

120
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,528
(Missy whines)
Awe.

121
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,814
- I hate this game!

122
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,517
Just kidding, I love it, I'm obsessed.

123
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:57,233
- [Bryan] Look at these good
dogs, they just wanna play.

124
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,405
Beautiful weather.

125
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,162
Alright, go fetch! (laughs)

126
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:03,813
Just playing fetch with a
simple stick, they love it.

127
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:04,956
Hey, be nice Karma.

128
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,435
Oh, look he gives it to her.

129
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:08,081
Luna is such a stick hog,

130
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,496
and Karma will let her have anything.

131
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:10,329
(dog barking)
What?

132
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,066
Oh, you know there's toys in here?

133
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,134
Is there toys in there?

134
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:14,259
Look, what do you see?

135
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:15,306
Alright, what's in here?

136
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:16,178
What's in here, what do you want?

137
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:17,011
What do you want?

138
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:19,562
Just a bunch of junk in here honestly.

139
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:22,700
Any toys, any toys Finn for the puppies?

140
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,533
- [Finn] No.

141
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,254
- [Bryan] No?

142
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:28,421
(bright upbeat music)

143
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:39,534
- It is so funny, he
does not want her playing

144
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:40,911
with his stick.

145
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:42,420
It's just a stick, it's okay.

146
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,253
- [Finn] Yeah?

147
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:44,510
- Yeah, she's 'gon play with it.

148
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,343
You ready Finn?

149
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:46,176
- Yeah!

150
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:50,382
- [Bryan] Okay, it's
swinging time (laughs)!

151
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:51,918
(Finn laughs)

152
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,268
Awe, the hose is in the way.

153
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:57,218
Weee!

154
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:59,046
What do you think about
that Finn, is that fun?

155
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:00,334
- [Finn] Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)

156
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,793
- So I have finally got ready for the day.

157
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:06,047
I did my hair and I did my
makeup, and I was looking

158
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:09,750
for one little item and I
couldn't find it anywhere.

159
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,325
And then I found this little boy.

160
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:15,762
And this little boy.

161
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,490
(Missy laughs)

162
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,335
And I asked them, where is my eyeliner?

163
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:24,563
It's on your face, it's on your face!

164
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:27,272
It's literally dried to their faces.

165
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:28,622
- We need to wash it off.

166
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:29,760
- [Missy] Yeah, we need to wash it off.

167
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,042
And how did this happen Oliver?

168
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,970
- Finn just put the marker on my face.

169
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,549
- [Missy] He put it all over you?

170
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:37,281
And then he put it all over himself?

171
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:38,114
- [Ollie] Mmhmm

172
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,452
- [Missy] Wow, and you
just let him do that?

173
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:41,285
- No.

174
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:42,687
- [Missy] No, you didn't let him do it,

175
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,053
but I see it all over your face,

176
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,248
so how did he do it?

177
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:46,509
- Here's more on my finger

178
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,378
- [Missy] Oh my goodness, you
got it on your finger too.

179
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:50,471
And let me tell 'ya,
that stuff is hard core.

180
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,861
It does not come off (laughs)

181
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:53,815
with just water.

182
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:55,847
I'm gonna need to break
out the makeup wipes.

183
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:56,680
Kay?

184
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,152
Let's do you first.

185
00:05:58,152 --> 00:05:59,720
If you're wondering what marker it is,

186
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,753
it's the Two Faced Sketch Marker and

187
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:07,244
it is honestly awesome,
as you can tell (laughs).

188
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:09,269
Okay, here we go.

189
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,511
(light techno music)

190
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,843
- [Ollie] And under my hair.
(Missy laughs)

191
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:15,676
- [Missy] You gotta hold the camera

192
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,593
so we can see it come off.

193
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,252
Here, let Daddy do it.

194
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,767
Alright.

195
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:29,422
- [Bryan] Finn was drawing on you?

196
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,342
- [Ollie] Yeah.

197
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:32,193
- [Missy] And your finger.

198
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,965
Anywhere else he got 'ya?

199
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,598
- [Ollie] Yeah.

200
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:37,379
- [Missy] I think that's it, looks good,

201
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,577
now we gotta do Finn.

202
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:39,410
- [Bryan] Hey Finn, you got something on

203
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,602
your face there dude.

204
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:41,435
- [Finn] Yeah.
- [Missy] Do You like

205
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,268
your makeup?

206
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,101
- Yeah

207
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,472
- [Missy] Is it just how you wanted it.

208
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,296
Oh, no? (laughs)

209
00:06:46,296 --> 00:06:49,546
Alright, get it off.

210
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:53,314
I've never put eyeliner on my lips.

211
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,173
- [Bryan] Or face or cheeks.
(Missy laughs)

212
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:58,566
Or forehead.
- [Missy] Anywhere.

213
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,123
- [Bryan] Nice job, Finn.

214
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,647
- Ow! Ow!

215
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,153
- [Missy] Yeah, you put a lot on there,

216
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:04,825
so it's gonna take me a minute.

217
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,531
- [Bryan] Now, it looks like
he has a five oh'clock shadow.

218
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:10,348
- [Missy] I know, it's
like a little, black.

219
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:12,312
- Ow, Ow!

220
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:14,155
- [Bryan] There you go boys.

221
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:15,209
- [Missy] I think you're all clean.

222
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,740
- [Bryan] Good as new,
let's not play in Mommy's

223
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,975
makeup, kay?

224
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,275
- [Missy] Look's good.

225
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:21,798
- [Bryan] Been playing some Mario,

226
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:24,076
Super Mario Odyssey, the new Mario game

227
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,533
on the Switch, is amazing.

228
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,161
I've been playing in my office.

229
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:29,017
But, the boys were in the middle of lunch

230
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:32,087
and I think they are done which means

231
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,581
I have to pay up.

232
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:35,094
Let's see what Missy is doing in here.

233
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:37,326
Same thing (laughs)

234
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:39,531
- I'm so much further along though now.

235
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:42,841
- [Bryan] I know, Missy is
a lot farther than I am.

236
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:44,995
So, I try not to look 'cause
I don't want spoilers either.

237
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,879
Alright boys, you finished your lunch?

238
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,712
- [Ollie] Yeah.

239
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,549
- [Bryan] Alright, you
cleaning you face off?

240
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:50,781
Yeah, Okay.

241
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,110
I promised the boys that
if they ate their lunch,

242
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,142
they could have a piece
of Halloween candy.

243
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,763
Yes, we still have Halloween candy.

244
00:07:56,763 --> 00:07:58,824
Please, let me know in the comments below,

245
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:01,084
do you still have Halloween
candy in your house?

246
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:03,809
'Cause sometimes it gets
thrown out November first.

247
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:04,959
But we still have some.

248
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,127
Alright boys, so you get
to each pick one piece

249
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:09,531
of candy, okay?

250
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,599
- [Finn] Yeah!

251
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,776
Alright, wait, wait.

252
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:12,961
You have to say "Trick or Treat!"

253
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,564
- [Boys Together] Trick or Treat!

254
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:15,892
- [Bryan] Alright, go ahead.

255
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:16,977
- [Ollie] I want Skittles.

256
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:18,277
- [Bryan] You always want the Skittles,

257
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:19,375
and you want Reeses?

258
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,232
- [Finn] Yeah!

259
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,500
- [Bryan] That's 'cause
you're a lot like Momma

260
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,077
who loves Reeses and
you're a lot like Daddy

261
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:25,553
who loves Skittles.

262
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,087
Yeah but really, I don't know how long

263
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:29,863
the Halloween candy is
gonna be in our house.

264
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:33,955
So, we're just tryna treasure it

265
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:36,342
while we can, haha.

266
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:37,966
What, oh you want me to open it for 'ya.

267
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,813
- I opened mine all by myself.

268
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:41,178
- [Bryan] Yeah you did.

269
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:44,212
Wow, you should be opening your brother's.

270
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:45,914
He's like, "Hey, give me one of those."

271
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:47,901
- Here Momma,

272
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,030
too slow!

273
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,231
- I wasn't even too slow,
you took it out of my hand.

274
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,542
- [Bryan] Finn thinks its funny.

275
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,375
- [Missy] You think that's funny?

276
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,614
- [Bryan] Try again, okay Ollie,

277
00:08:57,614 --> 00:09:00,976
really give her one.

278
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:03,282
- Too slow (laughs)!

279
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:04,997
- I mean that time I was kinda slow.

280
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:06,465
(Bryan laughs)

281
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:09,671
Luna, what are you doing?

282
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:12,503
Missy let her chicks out to play

283
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:15,847
and Luna is being very
good at not attacking them.

284
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,675
Luna has had an interesting past with some

285
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:19,550
of these chickens.

286
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,877
She's gotten a little too
friendly and playful with them.

287
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:24,362
And we actually lost a couple.

288
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:27,597
- Basically, there was a
morning, not too long ago,

289
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:31,290
where I woke up to the sound
of my chickens screaming.

290
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,383
And I came out, they were
all fine except for one.

291
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:36,138
One did not make it.
- [Bryan] Yeah.

292
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:39,515
- And I watched the camera, it's my fault,

293
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:41,429
I accidentally had left the coop open,

294
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,934
which I seriously messed
up with that 'cause

295
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:45,300
it wouldn't have been Luna.

296
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,823
It could've been a coyote.
- [Bryan] Yeah.

297
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:49,180
- But yeah, she just was
playing with them honestly

298
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,673
and she just went a
little too far with one.

299
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,844
And it was really, really,
really sad and hard.

300
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,413
But, since then we've done a lot of work.

301
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,185
- [Bryan] Yeah, look at this.

302
00:09:58,185 --> 00:10:00,609
- I still wouldn't trust
her if I wasn't here.

303
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:01,983
- [Bryan] Like leaving them alone, yeah.

304
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:04,813
Yeah, she's been pretty good around them.

305
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,740
- So, the truth is, is that we hatched six

306
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,735
chickens in May and four,
actually, were roosters.

307
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:13,834
'Cause I have three now and one died.

308
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:16,236
Now I only have two hens
that hatch from that

309
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:18,398
whole batch, that's crazy.
- [Bryan] Sheesh!

310
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:21,534
- Both of these white ones
are roosters it turns out.

311
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:23,692
And that big one is a rooster.

312
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,998
- [Bryan] Oh really?
- [Missy] Yup.

313
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,808
But Luna is being so good.

314
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:29,349
- [Bryan] I know.

315
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:30,573
Come here Luna.

316
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:33,428
- [Missy] "I don't know if
I'm supposed to be down here."

317
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,642
- [Bryan] It's okay.

318
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:37,308
- [Missy] You're doing a good job.

319
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:39,306
- [Bryan] Hey chicks.

320
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,389
(light guitar music)

321
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:51,000
- A dinosaur just pooped
out a baby dinosaur.

322
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,938
- [Bryan] A dinosaur
pooped out a baby dinosaur?

323
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:57,085
That is the funniest
thing you've ever said.

324
00:10:57,085 --> 00:11:00,698
You're so funny dude, here you go.

325
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:01,962
Go, go, go!

326
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:05,295
Whoa, Finn, you have to slow down, dude.

327
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:08,269
This kid's got way too much energy getting

328
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:12,269
ready for bed tonight (laughs).

329
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,088
Woo!

330
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:18,171
(light guitar music)

331
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,085
- [Missy] Alright, what are we doing?

332
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,244
- We are doing helicopter.

333
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:25,682
- [Missy] We're doing a helicopter?

334
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:27,005
- [Ollie] Yeah.
- When was I strong enough to

335
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:27,991
do a helicopter?

336
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,769
- Daddy's going to.

337
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,276
- [Missy] Oh, is Daddy coming?

338
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:32,314
- Yeah.

339
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:35,355
- [Missy] Ollie you're doing
so good with your up angles.

340
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:36,188
- Yeah.

341
00:11:36,188 --> 00:11:37,545
- [Missy] You know how
to get the best shot,

342
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:39,878
you gotta lift up like that.

343
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,869
He just grabbed the camera and was like,

344
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,826
"I'm gonna vlog."

345
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:47,427
Do you wanna vlog anything else?

346
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:48,971
- Professor Poopy Pants.

347
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:50,423
- [Missy] Professor Poopy Pants.

348
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,295
- That's from Captain Underpants.

349
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,890
- [Missy] Well, you better get Daddy if

350
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,410
you wanna do helicopter.

351
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,316
Do you wanna go get him.

352
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,811
- I can't, I'm afraid.

353
