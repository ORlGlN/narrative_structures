1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,114
- Hey guys, look!

2
00:00:01,114 --> 00:00:04,211
Luna's been a stuck in here!

3
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:05,916
- [Bryan] Luna!

4
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:06,749
Finn!

5
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:08,750
Oh, Finn's got the
biggest smile on his face.

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,142
He's totally the culprit.

Good morning!

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,550
Good morning, Finn.

20
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,816
How you doing this morning?

21
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,000
(excited baby cooing)

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,800
So something amazing happened

23
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,640
when Finn woke up this morning,

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,450
he was actually in a good mood.

25
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,780
I feel like that rarely
ever happens anymore.

26
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,540
He is definitely entrenched in

27
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,480
the terrible twos phase of life.

28
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,190
I feel like he has been crying and whining

29
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,040
for like the past two weeks
straight, every single day.

30
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,630
But not this morning!

31
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,210
This morning he woke up with
a big old smile on your face.

32
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,120
Let me see that smile!

33
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,664
There it is!

34
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:04,379
(laughing)

35
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,810
The boys had so much fun at the circus,

36
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,410
if you guys haven't seen the vlog,

37
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,720
I'll have it linked
above, but they passed out

38
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,646
and they slept so good.

39
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:14,770
- I loved it.

40
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,740
- [Bryan] Oh, really?

41
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,573
- Yeah.

42
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:18,123
- [Bryan] Yeah, what
was your favorite part?

43
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:19,110
- That one.

44
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,180
- [Bryan] That one?

45
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,170
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,180
(laughs) he's so cute.

47
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,500
It's lunchtime!

48
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,281
So we're eating some lunch, right?

49
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:26,114
- Yeah!

50
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:27,240
Daddy made you a peanut butter and jelly!

51
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,570
Can you try it?

52
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,403
- No.

53
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:30,971
- [Bryan] Please?

54
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:31,904
- No.

55
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,455
- [Bryan] Please?

56
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:34,288
- Yeah!

57
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:35,316
- [Bryan] Alright, take a bite.

58
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:37,630
(chuckles) Quit monkeying
around, my monkey.

59
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,540
My little Finn monkey.

60
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,628
Is it yummy?

61
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:41,860
- Yeah.
- Okay.

62
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,590
Good morning fishies!

63
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,210
Fishies are doing so good.

64
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,290
Our blue tang.

65
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,550
I don't know if we
officially named her yet.

66
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,000
I think we're calling her Dory.

67
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,710
- Good morning, guys!

68
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,210
I am actually now with Finn,

69
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,650
who I guess Bryan was just
vlogging about how happy he is.

70
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,185
Are you happy?

71
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:01,780
- No.
- Oh. (laughs)

72
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,430
Honestly I don't know
if you guys have noticed

73
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,270
over the past few vlogs,
he has just been like

74
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,250
not feeling his best and
for a while it was like,

75
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,530
is it that he doesn't feel good?

76
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,390
Or is he like literally just
kicked into like terrible twos?

77
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,870
And is like blah!

78
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,703
Like that.

79
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:14,810
He's being so good!

80
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,700
So, obviously he's feeling
better and he's not

81
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,470
just like terrible two-ing me, huh?

82
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,540
But he actually was just
saying our groundskeeper's name

83
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,553
and he like loves that he can say it.

84
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:24,386
(excited cooing)

85
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:25,450
Hey, what's his name up there?

86
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,283
Who's that?

87
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:27,373
- Bobby.
- Yeah!

88
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,443
Good job!

89
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,070
Did you hear him say that?

90
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,903
Bobby.

91
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,330
He changed my name just like
maybe three days ago to mommy.

92
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,660
Ollie's never called me mommy,
which I love mommy or momma.

93
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,700
I don't like mom.

94
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,533
I don't think that,

95
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:43,480
I'm like you're too young to call me mom.

96
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,693
What's my name?

97
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:45,560
- Mommy.

98
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,780
- [Missy] Mommy.

99
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
Say momma!

100
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,710
- Mommy.

101
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,246
(Missy laughs)

102
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:51,990
- Is that so cute?

103
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,870
Ollie calls me momma and
he's like calling me mommy,

104
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,703
like all the time.

105
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:59,200
He even like at night, if he
needs me, he's like mommy.

106
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,540
Anyways I've actually
been at the barn all day,

107
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,030
just working and just
like writing and stuff.

108
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,710
So, I am like so tired.

109
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,660
My brain is tired more than anything.

110
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,493
It's just like, I don't know what it is.

111
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:11,890
It's just like a lot of
movement and a lot of thinking.

112
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,140
But I am definitely ready
to go get my baby boy.

113
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,320
- We gotta go get Ollie okay?
- Yeah.

114
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,350
- Let's go get him, we can come home

115
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,530
and relax and have a good day as a fam.

116
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,440
Alright we are headed in and
I decided to take my hat off

117
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,090
'cause like I just don't want to look

118
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,330
like such a cowboy right now.

119
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,030
It's windy today huh?
- Yeah.

120
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,604
- You excited to see your brother?

121
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,437
- Yeah.

122
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:31,990
- Say Ollie.
- Ollie.

123
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,773
- Say, Ollie, where are you?

124
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:34,854
(excited cooing)

125
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:36,266
(laughs) What?

126
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,099
Let's go!

127
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,400
Finn has such a hard
time walking through here

128
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,290
'cause he just wants to play, huh?

129
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,123
You can play!

130
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,847
Let's get Ollie and you can
play for a minute, okay?

131
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:46,722
- Okay.
- Come on!

132
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:47,633
- I just wanna play.

133
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,010
- I just wanna play.

134
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,110
Okay, you go play!

135
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,920
I never let him play, I
think he's gonna be so cute

136
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,840
when he does get into preschool

137
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,360
'cause I think he's gonna love it.

138
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,650
Ollie!

139
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,470
Finn's here, he wants to play with you!

140
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,243
Ollie's gonna show him
the basketball hoop.

141
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:02,888
Are you guys so excited to play?

142
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:05,550
- I'm gonna put it in
this really high one.

143
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,414
- [Missy] Okay, ready?

144
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,477
- Let's see if I can do it.

145
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:08,310
- Okay.

146
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:10,868
Oh, you did it!

147
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:12,942
Good job!

148
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,999
Woo!

149
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:16,976
You did it!

150
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:17,809
Yay!

151
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,418
(upbeat music)

152
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,835
(laughs) Aw.

153
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,850
He want's to get on one too.

154
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,683
Go Ollie!

155
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:26,983
Go, go Ollie, go!

156
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,233
You're so good at that.

157
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:32,760
Alright we've got Ollie
and look what he's wearing!

158
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,315
Did you make that, Ollie?

159
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,148
- M-hm.

160
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:37,004
- [Missy] Do you have a
sticker on your mouth?

161
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:38,140
- M-hm.

162
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,360
- Oh yeah he says, look
momma I'm a praying mantis!

163
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,193
(Finn laughs)

164
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:44,040
Aw, Finn thinks that's so funny.

165
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,080
But yeah, so the boys just
played a ton in the playground.

166
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,740
It was so cute and I actually learned

167
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,410
that Finn can actually come next year.

168
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,170
So, I may start him 'cause
he just loves being there

169
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,640
and then they can be at
the same school together

170
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,540
and it might be really fun.

171
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,610
So we'll see though, we'll
talk and see how it goes.

172
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,870
You guys ready to go see daddy?

173
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

174
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,474
- Hey guys, look!

175
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:07,380
Luna's been a stuck in here!

176
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,682
- [Bryan] They're stuck in the pantry?

177
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:09,515
- Yeah!

178
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:10,648
- [Bryan] Well how did
they get stuck in there?

179
00:05:10,648 --> 00:05:12,690
- (giggles) Luna!

180
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,800
- [Bryan] Luna!

181
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,633
Finn!

182
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,670
Oh, Finn's got the
biggest smile on his face,

183
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,410
he's totally the culprit.

184
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,557
Are you finding all the candy?

185
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:21,390
- No.

186
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,280
- [Bryan] No, how did you get in there.

187
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,790
- No.

188
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,205
- [Bryan] No, you're not gonna tell me?

189
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:27,205
- [Finn] No.

190
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,880
- Okay I think it's time we
let them out of the pantry.

191
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,403
Have freedom, my children!

192
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,830
Finn, you!

193
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,830
What are you doing?

194
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,780
Okay.

195
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,100
We have this handy dandy child proof lock

196
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,390
on our pantry and it
makes it so that the kids

197
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,130
can basically barricade
themselves in the pantry.

198
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,580
Of course the kids have found a way

199
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,493
to use child locks against us.

200
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:51,740
- [Ollie] They found the bread!

201
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,910
- [Bryan] Finn, get out of the pantry!

202
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,810
Alright Finn, Mommy and I
have a little test for you.

203
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,130
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

204
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,963
- [Bryan] Okay.

205
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,130
I'm just gonna give you the phone.

206
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,645
I'm just gonna see what happens.

207
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,174
(Finn laughs)

208
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,411
- Do it, get it.
- Go ahead.

209
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:07,053
- [Missy] No Finn, here!

210
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:09,000
- [Bryan] Well we didn't
expect these results.

211
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,860
- No.

212
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,023
- [Bryan] Round two.

213
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,983
Round three.

214
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,195
(phone crashing)

215
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,224
(Ollie excitedly exclaiming)

216
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:23,770
And it's shattered.

217
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,980
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

218
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,472
- [Bryan] I'm sorry babe.

219
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:27,610
- I'm leaving.

220
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,610
- [Bryan] Oh, well, to be fair,

221
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,900
that was just the result of that test.

222
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,594
- Okay well, at least show us what you do.

223
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:37,803
- [Bryan] Show us what you do, Finn!

224
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:41,506
- [Missy] How do you get to it?

225
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:42,923
Oh, there you go.

226
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:47,262
- He found it!
(upbeat music)

227
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:49,230
- [Missy] Oh my gosh!

228
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,754
That's how you do it?

229
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,770
- [Bryan] So he swipes over to the search

230
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,021
and he sees the logo there.

231
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,006
- Yeah, I had no idea
how he was doing that.

232
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:58,720
I thought he was like
finding, I was like what?

233
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,310
- Finn may be a genius, but also like

234
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,781
he broke Missy's phone today.

235
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:08,427
- He broke it and I'm going
on a trip and it's broken now.

236
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,350
- Aw.

237
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,499
It's okay.

238
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:11,590
I'm sure you can get it fixed.

239
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,330
(Missy sighs)

240
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,161
I think we're used to this,
our kids breaking our things.

241
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:16,994
- Yeah.

242
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,940
- Remember when Ollie
threw my Apple watch?

243
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,240
- Yeah, but Ollie was being really naughty

244
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,580
and I don't feel like Finn
did it in a malicious way.

245
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,602
He was trying to be
funny and so it's like--

246
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:26,435
- Yeah.

247
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:27,790
- He doesn't deserve to be in trouble.

248
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,623
- [Bryan] Yeah.

249
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:31,280
(laughs) Now look, he's
like watching Ryan.

250
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,699
Shout out to Ryan
ToysReviews, my kids love you.

251
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:35,602
(laughs)

252
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,310
- [Missy] Alright, boys,
lets go play outside.

253
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,820
- [Bryan] Time to play outside, okay boys?

254
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,710
- Come on.

255
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,450
- This day is so beautiful, you guys.

256
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:49,450
Look at these blue skies,
green grass, big smiles.

257
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Show me your big smile (laughs).

258
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,220
Finn's going on an
adventure already over here.

259
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,950
Look at our little monkey, you guys.

260
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,165
What are you doing, silly?

261
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:59,410
(uplifting music)

262
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,580
And it's time!

263
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,108
Missy's gonna go get some eggs.

264
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,660
- I think I've got a
quite a few down there,

265
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,220
so I'm definitely gonna need this.

266
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm actually scared of how
many are down there right now.

267
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,954
It's been a few days.
(Bryan laughs)

268
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:15,121
(joyful upbeat music)

269
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,070
- [Bryan] We've got eggs!

270
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,341
- [Missy] How many eggs is that, Ollie?

271
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,869
(Finn exclaims)
- One.

272
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:27,702
Two.

273
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,693
Three.
- Three!

274
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:31,526
- There's three.

275
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:32,783
- Alright we gotta check the rest.

276
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:36,948
- [Bryan] Ooh, there's a chicken.

277
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,696
- [Missy] It's Moana!

278
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:41,450
Hi Moana, are you broody?

279
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,169
- [Bryan] Uh-oh, really?

280
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,310
- She's totally sitting here
like a little protective

281
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,960
of her eggs.
- Is she warm?

282
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,370
- This is actually around the
time Pam got broody, remember?

283
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,670
They were born in, like, May.

284
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,613
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's right.

285
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:57,280
- There was like 21 days,
so it's about the time.

286
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,890
Let's just see if she's
got any eggs under here.

287
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,783
Yup.
- Oh wow, she does.

288
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,070
Oh she's sittin' on a
lot of eggs right now.

289
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,070
- [Missy] Oh my God, well these
aren't fertile, dude, girl,

290
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,903
whatever you are.

291
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,189
- [Bryan] These aren't gonna do anything.

292
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:14,380
- [Missy] Aw, I feel bad taking them.

293
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,070
- [Bryan] (laughs) That's crazy.

294
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,436
So, we have another broody chicken?

295
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:19,000
- They're like really
hot, I'm actually worried.

296
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,570
It's possible.
- Oh, wow.

297
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,970
- It's definitely possible,
she's like the only one

298
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,770
I thought might actually get broody.

299
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,637
- [Bryan] Yeah?

300
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:26,470
- [Missy] Look at her!

301
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,160
She's like you're taking my eggs.

302
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,151
- [Bryan] Aw.

303
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:29,984
- You're cute.

304
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:31,650
- [Bryan] If you take them
will she stop being broody?

305
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,483
- I don't think so.

306
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:33,510
I have to keep an eye on her

307
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,700
because if she's like
this, she'll go crazy.

308
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,065
She just, she'll do it
forever, because she's waiting

309
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:39,233
for her baby to be hatched.

310
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,660
So I might have to look up
ways to make her not broody,

311
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,880
but maybe she's not,
maybe she's just resting.

312
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,713
- Yeah.

313
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:46,370
If you guys haven't seen on this channel,

314
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,520
we actually had another hen go broody

315
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,470
and we hatched eggs.

316
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,143
We had little baby chicks and
it was the cutest thing ever.

317
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:54,337
- Moana was the first one born!

318
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:56,270
- Yeah, Moana was the
first born from that.

319
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,820
I'll have that playlist up in the iCard

320
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,880
if you guys wanna watch.

321
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,940
That was super fun for the boys to see.

322
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,881
And now were actually getting
a little sprinkle of rain!

323
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,370
- Yeah, it's actually a little.

324
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,790
- [Bryan] Which I think
your plant needs it, babe.

325
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,880
- [Missy] Ha, I got that so long ago.

326
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,470
- [Bryan] Can you catch the raindrops

327
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,870
with your tongue, Ollie?

328
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,940
Try to catch with your
orange tongue! (laughs)

329
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,840
And we even have eggs over
here in the corner, you guys.

330
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,660
- Moana, do you want some?

331
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,517
She's totally broody, look at her,

332
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:23,690
she's not even getting down.
- Yeah.

333
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,650
- Aw, I have to check the camera

334
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,680
to see how long she's been sitting there.

335
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,540
Hopefully it hasn't been that long.

336
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,010
- Hey Ollie, so Moana, she's broody,

337
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,440
which means that she wants
to sit on chicken eggs

338
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,641
and hatch them into little babies.

339
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,474
- Really?

340
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:37,307
- [Bryan] Remember when we did that?

341
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:38,140
- M-hm.

342
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,960
- Should we do that again?
- Yeah!

343
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,793
- [Bryan] That'd be cute?

344
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:43,145
- I should see if Maria wants some babies.

345
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:43,978
- [Bryan] Oh yeah.

346
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:44,811
- Look at how many chickens,

347
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,640
I'm down so many chickens.
- Yeah.

348
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,980
- I'm down to like five.

349
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,270
- [Bryan] We really do need some.

350
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,690
- Yeah and I think one of
them also is eating the eggs

351
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,510
'cause I was actually supposed
to have more than this.

352
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,343
- [Bryan] Oh, really?

353
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:55,550
- [Missy] Yeah and I keep seeing egg yolks

354
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,858
so I think they're eating it.

355
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:57,850
- Aw.
- One of them.

356
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,188
- [Bryan] Finn are you feeding 'em?

357
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:00,399
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

358
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,470
Aw.

359
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,930
He's throwing out food.

360
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,640
And, Luna, you're being so good!

361
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,630
You're not chasin' 'em or
trying to get in. (laughs)

362
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,490
Let us know down below in the comments

363
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,470
if you think we should hatch more chickens

364
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,990
and how many we should do this time.

365
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,460
I'll also have a little
poll in the card above

366
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,240
so you can cast your vote
if you think we should

367
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,215
or not also.

368
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:23,382
(upbeat techno music)

369
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,243
Alright, give me the goods.

370
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:40,990
(laughs) she's runnin'
around with the boys

371
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,843
so I'm protecting the precious cargo.

372
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:46,010
(upbeat techno music)

373
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,663
- It's time for bed.

374
00:11:57,596 --> 00:11:58,429
Aw.

375
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:00,270
Are we reading stories?

376
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,700
- Yeah.
- Where'd he go?

377
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,530
Finley Jay!

378
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,460
Come back here.

379
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,130
We are sitting in our little cabin,

380
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,510
we're getting ready to read some stories.

381
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,880
We've got Oliver, Who
Was Small and Mighty.

382
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,310
We've got Yeti Turn Out The Light,

383
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,670
and God Bless You and Goodnight.

384
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,960
These are like all some
of our classics huh?

385
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,030
- Yeah.
- Some of our favorites.

386
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,570
I think Ollie knows all
the words to this one

387
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,087
and this one, huh?
- Yeah.

388
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:19,920
(Missy laughs)

389
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,190
- It is definitely time for bed.

390
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,350
It is getting late.

391
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,230
But I gotta get some
last minute cuddles in

392
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,220
'cause momma's goin'
on a little trip, huh?

393
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,040
You're gonna have so much
fun with daddy though, huh?

394
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,230
- M-hm.
- Yeah.

395
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,500
Alright, I got my little Finny back, huh?

396
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,902
Are you gonna miss momma while I'm gone?

397
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,140
- No.
- No?

398
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,515
Are you gonna have fun with daddy?

399
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:36,383
- Yeah.

400
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:37,630
(Missy scoffs and laughs)

401
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,980
- Alright well anyways,
we're gonna end the vlog

402
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,542
and you guys are gonna have so
much fun while I'm gone okay?

403
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:43,375
- Okay.

404
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,277
- [Missy] I love you guys.

405
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:45,480
- Okay.

406
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,850
- So give this video a big thumbs up

407
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,824
if you enjoyed our fun day!

408
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:49,710
Oh!

409
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,543
It's a toe thumb up.

410
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:51,585
Toe thumb up!

411
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,638
(Missy and Finn joyfully exclaim)

412
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,867
We will see you guys tomorrow.

413
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,784
What do you say?
- Bye.

414
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:02,025
- Bye.

415
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,837
- [Missy] Bye!

416
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:07,338
(laughing)

417
00:13:07,338 --> 00:00:00,000
