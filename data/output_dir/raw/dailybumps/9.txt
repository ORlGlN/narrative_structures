1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:01,956
- [All] Good morning!

2
00:00:02,927 --> 00:00:04,557
♪ This is our life ♪

3
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:08,707
♪ Let's live it, live it forever ♪

4
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:10,532
- How are you guys this morning?

5
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:11,900
- [Ollie] Good.
- [Missy] Good?

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,569
It is such a nice day
today, and we are so excited

7
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:18,188
because Ollie got his little STEM toy

8
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:20,280
in the mail today, and so we are gonna

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,690
be opening this a little bit later.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,523
Does that sound fun?

11
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,356
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,124
- Yeah, I'm so excited
to see what they build.

13
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:26,720
I think it's gonna be really cool,

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,380
and I love just really fun,
educational games, huh?

15
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,213
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:31,210
- So we're gonna do
that a little bit later.

17
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,636
But first, I actually
have a few errands to run,

18
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:37,010
one of them being, did you
guys hear that Nacho's hurt?

19
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,843
- Yeah.

20
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:40,636
- Oh, did you know Nacho got hurt?

21
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:41,680
- Yeah.

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,637
- Yeah, Nacho has a couple
owies, so I'm headed up

23
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:45,948
to go check on him and see how he's doing.

24
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:48,760
So I'm actually off to the barn right now,

25
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,900
but if you guys don't know
what happened with Nacho,

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,662
I give a lot more information
in a previous vlog,

27
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:54,430
so go check it out right here,

28
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,292
then you kinda can get
some more information.

29
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:58,350
Poor guy, let's go check on him.

30
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,539
So I am back at the barn today.

31
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,120
And I am just checking on Mr.
Nacho, how you doin', bud?

32
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,380
And I really wanna take
a look at his foot,

33
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,090
it is all bandaged up.

34
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,130
So I'm really looking forward
to checking on his foot,

35
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,626
seeing if the abscess
has come through yet,

36
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,644
it actually has been a couple days.

37
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:19,261
I'm hoping that everything
will be looking good now,

38
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:22,690
or at least starting to look
different, I guess I can say.

39
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,300
I thought the other day it
had kind of come through,

40
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,740
it looked like it was
a little pusy, but he,

41
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,000
I've lunged him and he was
definitely a little still off,

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,460
but I'm gonna show you his nose,

43
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,916
he's got a little owie on his nose.

44
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,080
There's his owie.

45
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,492
He must've scratched it on a fence post

46
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:39,182
or some kind of exposed wire of some sort,

47
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,706
so I gotta take a look at that

48
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,517
and hopefully it's not a big deal either.

49
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:44,828
Having a horse is hard, guys! (chuckles)

50
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:46,725
Um no, it's honestly awesome to like,

51
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:48,088
kind of come in and just know,

52
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:51,764
oh something's wrong, or
how can I fix him up today,

53
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:53,810
or make sure it doesn't get worse?

54
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,950
When do you need to call a vet,

55
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,356
when can you take care of it yourself?

56
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:58,410
But other than that,
he's doing really good.

57
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,346
You're a happy horse, huh?

58
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:01,840
So I've got this little
doctor kit that my dad,

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,300
my dad made this, and I love it.

60
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,317
It literally fits all my
stuff, and I've got my wraps,

61
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:09,852
I've got like some of my
medicines, gauze, gloves,

62
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:11,885
and a couple extras, scissors,

63
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:15,130
we're gonna get that cleaned
up and get that fixed up, 'kay?

64
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,865
So I'm actually just gonna
use some Nu-Stock topical,

65
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:24,937
which is something that
we use a lot in this farm,

66
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,352
it seems to really
promote like hair growth

67
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:29,882
and it kind of like helps with lacerations

68
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:32,452
and bleeding, and all that, so we're gonna

69
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,740
go ahead and put this on.

70
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:42,220
All right, looks pretty good.

71
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,602
So next, we got to unbandage this,

72
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:47,510
and take it apart and see how it's doing.

73
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:06,280
All right, so I finally got
the bandage off of his foot

74
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,760
which was on there pretty dang good,

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,761
which I think is a good thing, I mean,

76
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:10,652
it means I did a really
good job of wrapping it up.

77
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:12,741
Took it off, and it
basically looks the same.

78
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,634
The stuff that I put on it tends to look

79
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:17,337
very gooey and ooky, and
it can even kind of look

80
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:20,120
like blood, but it's not
blood, it's just really dark.

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,241
But there's really been
no change since yesterday.

82
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,303
So kind of a bummer, we
definitely want to see change,

83
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:25,900
we definitely want to start seeing

84
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,152
like something come through.

85
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:28,860
(sighs) And it's still not happening,

86
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,753
so I'm just gonna clean it up,

87
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:31,303
and then wrap it back up.

88
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,153
We're gonna get you all better, 'kay?

89
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,370
Nothing in his foot is even tender still.

90
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,627
(sighs) 'Cause when it's
tender, you know it's

91
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,598
like starting to, like, come through.

92
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:48,110
He really can't be ridden until
the abscess comes through.

93
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,333
I'm gonna go ahead and
bandage it up again,

94
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,160
and then put him back in his stall.

95
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,730
All right, so what I do
now is I'm basically going

96
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,461
to put on a poultice, and
this is supposed to help

97
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,824
kind of draw it out, and
then what I've been doing

98
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:03,237
is a salve that is I guess
supposed to draw it out,

99
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:04,391
this is what the lady told me,

100
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,970
but she also said she hadn't tried this,

101
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,060
and that it might work really good,

102
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,441
it's got like antiseptic
in it, antifungal,

103
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,038
'cause he does have a little thrush on it,

104
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:14,850
and a few other things, so I
kinda think I want to try this

105
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,370
and then maybe like these two together.

106
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,270
I guess we'll see.

107
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,584
(slow relaxed music)

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,928
And now I'm going to duct tape
it so that it is waterproof

109
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:32,140
and it doesn't fall off.

110
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:38,270
All right, so it's got,
it's all the medicine on it,

111
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,230
it's wrapped up in the
wrap, and then it's got

112
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,982
the duct tape on it to help it stay.

113
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,367
I will say, the lady that
usually is helping me,

114
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,263
she actually wraps it in
a diaper and the diaper

115
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:50,399
will also help it be waterproof.

116
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,599
I think I might actually
start doing that again,

117
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,350
just to kind of hopefully help
it stay a little bit clean.

118
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,041
But hopefully that'll
stay on just for today.

119
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,580
He's actually gonna go out to pasture

120
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,460
and so I'm hoping it won't fall,

121
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,130
I don't think it'll fall
off, but I might come back

122
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,050
later to kind of fix it up.

123
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,310
Sound good?

124
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,340
And all of it goes back in
and I just love this thing!

125
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,070
It's like my little doctor kit.

126
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,330
Let's get back in here.

127
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,130
There, he's like I know you got a treat,

128
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,700
mom, hand it over.

129
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,640
I got these little muffins for him.

130
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,900
I'm sorry you're not feeling good.

131
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,261
So hopefully his nose
is looking good soon,

132
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:24,979
and hopefully that is looking good soon.

133
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,016
I wish I had time to give
him a full, like, grooming,

134
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,180
I usually come down here
and do that, and brush him,

135
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,578
and clean him, and just
kind of make him feel

136
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:37,227
pampered a little, but I am
actually running super late now.

137
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:38,853
Actually, I'm supposed to pick up Kelsey

138
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,372
and be at a hair
appointment in 35 minutes.

139
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:43,200
I don't think that's enough time.

140
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,950
But I'll probably come back
down a little bit later

141
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,920
after he goes out to pasture.

142
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,747
He's looking good, his personality
is different right now,

143
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:52,700
like, he's just a little
more agitated, nervous.

144
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,863
If I'm not seeing change
within the next day or so,

145
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:57,703
I'll probably end up
calling either his farrier

146
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,603
or his vet to kind of look him over

147
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:02,760
and make sure it's nothing
that could be any more serious.

148
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,270
But I've got a few different eyes on him,

149
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,390
it's not just me. (chuckles)

150
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,790
He has no temperature,
his hoof is just warm,

151
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,143
so that's why we're pretty
sure it's an abscess,

152
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:10,715
and he's limping on
that foot, so it's like,

153
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:13,471
it's pretty self-explanatory,
but if it doesn't

154
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,920
look better pretty soon,
I'll probably, you know,

155
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,303
start to get a better look at him

156
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:20,144
and make sure it's nothing else, too.

157
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:22,727
(upbeat music)

158
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,850
All right, I am home!

159
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,278
And I'm hanging out with the boys now,

160
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:36,140
and they are so excited about
something special we got.

161
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,330
This is a subscription box for kids,

162
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,228
I think it's like
Ollie's age for like STEM

163
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:44,925
educational toys, and so
this came, and now of course

164
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:47,659
Finn is so excited, which is awesome,

165
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,057
'cause it's educational, huh?

166
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:49,890
- [Ollie] Yeah.

167
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,760
- [Missy] It's all these little gears

168
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,460
that you can build
together and they all can,

169
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,423
like, run by itself, isn't that neat?

170
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:55,290
- [Finn, Ollie] Yeah.

171
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,270
- [Missy] All right,
let's go ahead and see

172
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,650
if we can make it work, 'kay?

173
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,483
- Okay.

174
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:00,440
- [Missy] All right,
so I think you actually

175
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,800
just twist this open.

176
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,984
Or you can turn this
little gear to open it.

177
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:05,868
There you go, see if you can lift it up.

178
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:08,307
See if you can (gasps) you did it!

179
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:11,026
(Finn vocalizes)

180
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:12,822
- [Finn] Wow!

181
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:15,660
- [Missy] (chuckles) Is that cool?!

182
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,823
Look at all these, so many gears.

183
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:21,466
Oh, and we got the instructions.

184
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,716
(energetic beat music)

185
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,152
'Kay, Finn, your turn, go ahead.

186
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:49,069
Whoa, look what you're doing there.

187
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:55,609
(energetic beat music)

188
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,490
Woo-hoo! Good job, guys!

189
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,511
You did so good.

190
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,189
We actually did it, it's so cool!

191
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,931
How cool is that, all
those gears go together

192
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:44,073
and then they make
something really fun, huh?

193
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:44,907
- Yeah.

194
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:45,740
- [Missy] That's so neat.

195
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,130
Yeah, oh goodness gracious.

196
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,059
- So I just heard the
boys having so much fun

197
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,121
in the living room.

198
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:54,714
What?! Did you really build that?!

199
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:55,547
- [Ollie] Yeah.

200
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:56,420
(Missy chuckles)

201
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,425
- [Bryan] Ollie, wait, did
you seriously build this?

202
00:08:58,425 --> 00:08:59,258
- Yeah.

203
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:01,010
- [Bryan] That's incredible! What is this?

204
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,060
- It's a city with gears.

205
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,875
- [Missy] Yeah!
- [Bryan] A city of gears?

206
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,290
That is so cool!

207
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,600
Can you show Dada how it works?

208
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,860
That's crazy! (Missy chuckles)

209
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,716
So the whole thing spins together?

210
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:16,900
- Yeah.
- [Bryan] That's awesome dude.

211
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,778
That is seriously amazing,
I love all these new

212
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:22,240
little STEM toys we get for Ollie.

213
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,350
We need to start getting
them for Finn's age I think.

214
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,183
- [Missy] Yeah.

215
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:26,670
- But Finn also really enjoys these ones.

216
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,780
- He's honestly, I love the fact

217
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,890
that he loves the older kids STEM toys,

218
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,180
but I'm sure his age is really fun, too.

219
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,013
- [Bryan] By the way, you wanna see

220
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:33,963
what's happening below the camera--

221
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,310
- [Missy] Yeah, you don't even. (laughs)

222
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,050
- [Bryan] (laughs) It's
all Luna, all the time.

223
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,852
She's like, oh hey, you're
sitting on the floor,

224
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:42,691
you can pet me, you can pet me.

225
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:43,666
(Ollie and Bryan laugh)

226
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,920
Good job, boys, on the gear city.

227
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,310
Did you do that too, Finn?

228
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,223
Or is Finn like the monster destroying it?

229
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,860
- You know, he actually did a lot,

230
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,550
but now he's kind of like bah!

231
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:56,617
- Yeah!

232
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:57,450
(suspenseful music)

233
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,617
- [Bryan] Wow! Finn's being a monster!

234
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,461
- No!

235
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:08,326
- [Bryan] (chuckles) Well,
Missy, I think we spoke too soon.

236
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:09,822
(laughs)

237
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,576
We literally spoke too soon.

238
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,878
- Now we're gonna have to
rebuild it, right, Ollie?

239
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,230
- Yeah!

240
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,063
- That is crazy.

241
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:18,406
Um, he did miss his nap, so. (chuckles)

242
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:19,942
- [Bryan] Yeah, this is what happens when,

243
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:21,721
when little kids miss their nap.

244
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,411
Finn, say I'm sorry, Ollie.

245
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,118
- Sorry, Ollie.

246
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:27,384
- It's okay, Finn.

247
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,967
(upbeat music)

248
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,398
- I am actually headed out now
to go check on my chickens.

249
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,741
So if you guys don't know, I ended up

250
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,954
having another rooster.

251
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:46,620
I talked about it one of my vlogs,

252
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,670
I'm gonna go ahead and link it up here,

253
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,021
if you can watch it,
you'll get a little bit

254
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,793
more information, but I actually had

255
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:53,750
six chicks hatch back in May.

256
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,389
Four ended up being
roosters, so I gave them

257
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,297
back to the person who
gave me the fertile eggs

258
00:10:57,297 --> 00:10:59,153
and she, like, takes care
of them it's really cool.

259
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:02,315
I had two hens and then
one turned into a rooster.

260
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:04,185
And I was like, is this for real?

261
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,419
Yeah, he was legit a
rooster, and then he ended up

262
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,225
attacking his mom, honestly.

263
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:12,539
I ended up giving him back also,

264
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,310
'cause I just can't have roosters, like,

265
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,640
beating up my hens, not to mention,

266
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,570
they're gonna end up
beating up me or my kids,

267
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,340
so we ended up giving him back,

268
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,840
and so now they're all together,

269
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,353
and they're all hens, all the ladies.

270
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:26,525
And you're making me eggs, oh, we might've

271
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,190
already grabbed the eggs today.

272
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,290
Did the kids already come down
here and get eggs from ya?

273
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,642
And there's Pam right there,
and she's looking so good.

274
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,460
Her head definitely healed
up nicely, and it is still

275
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,175
healing, but it's looking
good, no bleeding.

276
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:41,500
And yeah, she got back
into the group pretty well,

277
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,460
so I'm glad about that.

278
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,160
At first, all the girls
actually started beating her up,

279
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,807
and I think they wanted
to put her to the bottom

280
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,646
of the pecking order, but
she was having none of that,

281
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:53,501
and she put herself back up
on top of the pecking order.

282
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:55,695
But that's just how Pam
is, 'cause she's a mom,

283
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:58,664
and she knows how to get things done.

284
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:02,360
All right, boys, it's almost bedtime!

285
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,020
You guys ready for bed? (chuckles)

286
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,598
I am ready for bed, I am so tired!

287
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:10,750
(Finn singing)

288
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,926
Are you singing me happy birthday?

289
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:12,759
- Yeah.

290
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,718
- [Missy] Did you make me a cake?

291
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:14,951
- Yeah.
- [Missy] Wow!

292
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:19,951
♪ Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you ♪

293
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:24,953
♪ Happy birthday dear Jesus ♪

294
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:28,267
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

295
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:29,480
(Missy chuckles)

296
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,591
- You're so cute.

297
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,790
Anyways, we have had a long, fun day.

298
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,035
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

299
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:38,845
I'm excited to check on Nacho and see

300
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:42,396
how he's doing tomorrow,
and hoping that things

301
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,227
start to progress and look better,

302
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:46,520
and he starts to feel better soon.

303
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,953
But anyways, we're gonna go
ahead and end this video,

304
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:50,110
'cause it's bedtime, so give this video

305
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,429
a big thumb's up, huh?

306
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:55,395
Thumb's up! And we'll
see you guys tomorrow.

307
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:57,525
What do you say?

308
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,157
- Bye!

309
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:00,180
- [Missy] Boop.

310
00:13:01,344 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
