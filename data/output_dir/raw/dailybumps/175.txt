1
00:00:00,457 --> 00:00:02,312
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02,312 --> 00:00:05,779
Hashtag Ollie meditating.
I'm not sure he's ever.

3
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:07,103
Does he know what he's doing? (laughing)

4
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:08,077
- I don't know.

5
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:11,082
- [Bryan] What's wrong
with him? (laughing)

6
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:13,665
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:19,743
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be

8
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:24,030
♫ All it took was was a
laugh in that soft sunset

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,952
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

10
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:31,974
♫ This is home

11
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:34,730
♫ Just running around,
you've never looked so cute

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,561
♫ Hugging you tight.
Cuddling all I could saying

13
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:42,640
♫ I am home

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,723
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

15
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:53,599
- Good morning! (laughing)

16
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,429
You were just sitting
there smiling, weren't you?

17
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,506
Today we are gonna show you
our Starbucks of the day

18
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:01,573
because, instead of getting
dressed today, we got Starbucks.

19
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:05,925
(laughing)
(baby mumbling)

20
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:08,266
- Like hot chocolate.

21
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,755
- That was like hot chocolate?

22
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:11,659
So he got a Tuxedo Hot Chocolate.

23
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,975
Same as mommmy, and Finn
got a Spicy Milk, huh?

24
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,457
It's got, like, all kinds of spices in it.

25
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:18,486
- Yeah!
- [Missy] Yeah.

26
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:19,952
So today is Sunday.

27
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:21,697
We were all planning to go to church

28
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,833
but then a few people woke up sick,

29
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,952
and it's like a different
sickness than mine

30
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,755
'cause I've been sick
the last couple of days,

31
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,398
and it's been kinda
just, like, a head-cold,

32
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:30,706
which has not been fun at all,

33
00:01:30,706 --> 00:01:34,761
but Luke, from Carl and Ginger,
woke up, and he was sick.

34
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,011
He actually threw up, but he
thinks it might've just been,

35
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,742
like, junk food that they ate,

36
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:41,487
but then Bryan woke up sick, too.

37
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,336
Like, his stomach hurts,
and he hasn't thrown up,

38
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:45,974
but he's not feeling very well either.

39
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:48,315
It seems to be different than what I have,

40
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:49,921
which is a bummer because I'm like, great.

41
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:53,455
Now I'm gonna get what Bryan
got, but I guess we'll see.

42
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,028
So, we ended up calling off church,

43
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:58,074
and we're just gonna rest at home today,

44
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:01,153
and everyone's just gonna
hopefully get better.

45
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:02,850
So, I actually just ran
and got some Starbucks

46
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,454
and got a few essentials,
some medicine, and some food,

47
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:09,235
so that we don't have to
leave the house again.

48
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:10,562
Just make dinner at home tonight.

49
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:13,283
So, we're just buckling in
today, and we're gonna just rest

50
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:15,908
and hang out as a family, and
I might even jump in the pool

51
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:18,907
a little bit and swim and
have some fun, so, yay!

52
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:22,942
- Good morning guys, and
check out my wall plant.

53
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,723
I put this up last night.

54
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:27,057
I got all these plants from Home Depot.

55
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:28,247
I wrapped the roots.

56
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:30,783
I put them in the little
wall-hanger thing.

57
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,697
Now, they're just in my office,
in my little sitting area.

58
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:35,666
I think it looks so cool,

59
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,770
but anyway, it is a beautiful day,

60
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,715
and we are all kinda not feeling so well.

61
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:41,551
So, we are just hanging
out at home and relaxing,

62
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,827
and I'm getting some work done
in my office, actually, too.

63
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:48,264
(knocking)
- Come in! What's up dude?

64
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,514
- There's a grasshopper in,

65
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,195
in Finn's bathroom!

66
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:54,400
- [Bryan] There is?
- Yeah!

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,603
- [Bryan] Let's go see!

68
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:58,404
Alright Ollie, we are in the
bathroom. What is in here?

69
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:02,256
- A grasshopper right
next to the trash can.

70
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:04,264
- [Bryan] Seriously?
- Yeah!

71
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:05,604
- [Bryan] Okay, let's go see.

72
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:09,104
- It's right there. Look at.
- [Bryan] Wow!

73
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:12,005
- [Ollie] Yeah (mumbles).

74
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:14,812
- [Bryan] That is a grasshopper, isn't it?

75
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:17,074
- Yeah, let's get a towel.

76
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:18,541
- [Bryan] Why?
- Because.

77
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,348
- [Bryan] You wanna get it?
- Yeah.

78
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:21,229
(laughing)
- I wanna get it.

79
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:22,968
- [Bryan] I don't know if a
towel's the best thing, Ollie.

80
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,970
How about a cup?
- Oh, yeah!

81
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,419
- [Bryan] We have acquired a plastic cup.

82
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,776
- [Ollie] I see it move. Did you get it?

83
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,532
- [Bryan] Yeah, it's moving, huh?

84
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,427
- [Ollie] Ooh.
- [Bryan] Got it!

85
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,594
- Oh my gosh! It's moving! Oh my gosh!

86
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:40,868
- [Bryan] We got him Ollie.
- [Ollie] Yes!

87
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,732
- [Bryan] Let's get the lid on.

88
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:45,083
- [Ollie] Oh yeah, that, that, come on!

89
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,370
Get him in there. He
go in there (mumbles).

90
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,147
- [Bryan] Oh, oh, oh, oh! There we go.

91
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,970
- [Ollie] Ha! We got him!

92
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,832
- [Bryan] We got him.
- Yes.

93
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:57,889
- He actually looks like he may be hurt,

94
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,162
so we are going to set him free

95
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:01,794
and see if that makes him better.

96
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:02,914
Alright Ollie, I think we should put him

97
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:04,613
on this big rock up here.

98
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:07,086
We've got a good rock right here.

99
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:09,331
I bet he would like it
here. What do you think?

100
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,799
Good!
- [Bryan] Okay.

101
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,132
Alright buddy.
- [Ollie] Bye!

102
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,846
- [Bryan] Say bye!
- Bye!

103
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:19,929
(soft country music)

104
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,205
- Giving our air plants
a bath 'cause I was just

105
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:39,474
doing some reading that they actually need

106
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:43,967
a good 20 to 30 minute
soak, once a week in water.

107
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:47,113
So, they've been soaking here
for a good amount of time.

108
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:50,209
I'm gonna pull 'em out and
let 'em dry up in the sun,

109
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,471
which is also what you're
supposed to do, I guess.

110
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:55,554
(soft country music)

111
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:59,959
While, I put my air
plants over here to dry,

112
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,705
check out these flowers that
are coming in right now.

113
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:04,010
This is so cool.

114
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,189
I love how there's always,
like, a different plant

115
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,041
or flower in bloom at our place.

116
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,226
These ones are really cool.

117
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,038
They're, like, bright yellow.

118
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:13,723
Ooh, they're really strong, too.

119
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:16,806
(soft country music)

120
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:22,426
If you guys watched yesterday's video,

121
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:24,550
you saw that we have

122
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,860
a plethora of Wubble Bubble Balls.

123
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,797
Be sure to go watch yesterday's
video link in the I-Card.

124
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,432
What should we do with them today, Ollie?

125
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,799
- Put them in the pool!

126
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,786
- [Bryan] We should?
- [Ollie] Yeah!

127
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:38,471
- [Bryan] What do you
think, Finn? In the pool?

128
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,590
- Yeah! (laughing)
- [Bryan] Look at all these.

129
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,186
- It's actually a little
freaky waking up next to them.

130
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:47,241
- [Bryan] Yeah, it was a little weird.

131
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:49,293
Alright, let's put 'em in the pool!

132
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:54,001
Alright, we are carrying
them to the pool area.

133
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,789
This is gonna be cool.

134
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,039
(upbeat country music)

135
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,951
- And there you have it, guys!

136
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:26,790
A pool full of Wubble
Bubble Balls (laughing).

137
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,344
- It's so fun!

138
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,670
- [Bryan] They seriously are so fun.

139
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,278
They hover for a little bit.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:35,445
(upbeat techno music)

141
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,055
(laughing)
- I love it!

142
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:58,222
(upbeat techno music)

143
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,664
- Swimming pool Wubble Bubble!

144
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:03,581
- Let's go!

145
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,807
- Yes.

146
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:09,250
(upbeat techno music)

147
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,880
- Whoa, hoo, hoo, hoo!

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,047
(upbeat techno music)

149
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:20,119
- This is so cool, Ollie!
- [Ollie] I know!

150
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:23,939
- Our whole pool is full
of Wubble Bubbles! What?

151
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:25,188
- Get down!
- Get down!

152
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:26,021
- Yeah!

153
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,742
- Is this so cool dude?
- Yeah!

154
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,651
(laughing)
- [Ollie] Whoa! Catch it!

155
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:37,144
- [Bryan] Ah! They're launching 'em at us!

156
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,870
- [Ollie] Yeah, I know.
- [Bryan] Ah!

157
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,343
- Let's go under.
- [Ollie] Yeah.

158
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:45,510
(upbeat techno music)

159
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:54,226
- [Bryan] Come on, Finn! Who hoo!

160
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:58,406
Look at all these Wubbles dude! (laughing)

161
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:00,947
Isn't that so cool?
- Yeah!

162
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,114
(upbeat techno music)

163
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,958
- [Bryan] Finn, what are you doing?

164
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,390
- Nothing.
- [Bryan] Is that a banana?

165
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,496
- Yeah.

166
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:03,005
- [Bryan] That was so good of you!

167
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:05,967
So this is, what is this one?
- Nana.

168
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,150
- [Bryan] Banana. And what's this one?

169
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,634
- Mama.
- [Bryan] Mama? (laughs)

170
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,712
That would be milk. Do you know this one?

171
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:14,482
- Box.
- [Bryan] Mailbox.

172
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:17,065
What are we doing in here, babe?

173
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,986
- Well, you asked for something pumpkiny.

174
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:20,364
- [Bryan] I.
- So, I went in the kitchen,

175
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,475
and I was like, oh, I'm gonna
make him something pumpkiny.

176
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,831
- [Bryan] I definitely needed
something pumpkiny you guys.

177
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,737
(laughing)
So what are you making?

178
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:29,969
- I'm making chocolate
chip pumpkin cookies.

179
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,678
- [Bryan] Yes!

180
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:32,931
- You really wanted, like, a pie,

181
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,823
but I don't have any evaporated milk, so.

182
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:37,841
- Yeah I really wanted, I
actually wanted Pumpkin Pasties,

183
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:39,200
which are, like, what
they have in Harry Potter.

184
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,697
They're like little hand-pies.

185
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:41,870
- I've made 'em before.

186
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,770
- [Bryan] Yeah, they're super good.

187
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,108
- But I just didn't have
the right ingredients,

188
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,566
and no one wants to go to the store.

189
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:46,991
- [Bryan] Yeah.
(laughing)

190
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:50,514
- So, yeah. I'm just gonna
make up some cookies.

191
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:51,347
- [Bryan] Well, it looks good.

192
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:54,602
- I've always got pumpkin in
the pantry. I don't know why.

193
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:57,185
(upbeat music)

194
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:25,949
- The Wubbles are going crazy!

195
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,259
- [Bryan] They are, huh?

196
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,298
- I wanna go, too!

197
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:32,243
- [Bryan] So, all the Wubble Bubble Balls

198
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:34,668
have come out of the pool.

199
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,643
There are none in the pool anymore.

200
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,746
You wanna see?
- Yeah! Yes!

201
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:39,940
- [Bryan] Come on, Finn! Come on!

202
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,287
We gotta save the Wubbles!

203
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:45,061
Check this out you guys,
on the air conditioner.

204
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,385
(laughing)
- I'm going to punch it.

205
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:51,052
- Punch it! Oh, whoa!
Look at it spin, dude!

206
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:53,303
(laughing)

207
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:55,966
Yes, the Wubbles are all just
trying to escape right now.

208
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:58,312
Look at that one's trying to
get a boost over the fence.

209
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:00,333
There's already a couple over there.

210
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,271
It's a crazy life with
these Wubble Bubble Balls.

211
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,886
It's so funny though, they
seriously do act like,

212
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:07,085
but like a ball, too.

213
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,308
Oh, that one bounced
- [Ollie] Oh no!

214
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:12,059
- Oops! Sorry! Aw, no!
- [Ollie] It's in jail!

215
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,583
- [Bryan] (laughing) I think
these ones are in jail.

216
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,593
That's why they're trying to escape.

217
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:18,127
Look at that pink ones about to escape!

218
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,900
- Got you! Ah!
(laughing)

219
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,189
- Seriously, this is so cool. Boing!

220
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:29,173
- [Ollie] Boing!
- [Bryan] Boing! (laughing)

221
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,006
These look incredible!

222
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,025
- [Missy] They're kinda tiny.
- [Ollie] What is it?

223
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,132
- [Bryan] They're what?
- They're kinda tiny.

224
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:37,380
- I kinda love them.
- [Missy] Well, good.

225
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,567
- [Ollie] Could I try one?

226
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,678
- [Missy] After you eat your dinner.

227
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:44,028
(kids yelling)
- [Bryan] Whoa!

228
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:46,844
Someone's got the moves, and
you ate your whole dinner, huh?

229
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:47,677
- Yeah.

230
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:50,164
- [Bryan] That means you get a cookie!

231
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:52,340
- You tried to sneak a bite!

232
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,277
- [Bryan] What?
- (laughing) I don't know.

233
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:55,818
- [Bryan] Sometimes he says
random things like that.

234
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:57,202
(baby yelling)
- [Missy] How is it, Ollie?

235
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:59,476
- Good!
- [Missy] Good? You promise?

236
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:02,998
You like it? Yay, I'm so glad you like it!

237
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:05,880
- [Bryan] Finn, you had
to eat your dinner, okay?

238
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,486
- (crying) Cookie.
- He's like, cookie, now!

239
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:11,365
- You are wonderful!
- Oh, thank you!

240
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:15,364
You're the cutest!
(laughing)

241
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:17,193
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, what are you doing?

242
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:20,623
Hashtag Ollie mediating.
I'm not sure he's ever.

243
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,015
Does he know what he's doing? (laughing)

244
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:23,089
- I don't know.

245
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,050
Ollie, what are you doing bud?

246
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,827
Did you watch this in a movie?

247
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,201
- [Bryan] Do you do this at school?

248
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:31,100
What's wrong with him? (laughing)

249
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,976
- [Missy] Do you feel better now?

250
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:36,111
(laughing)
- Are you a superhero now?

251
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:38,666
- I think it's something
from Ninjago. (laughing)

252
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,264
- [Missy] Oh that makes sense.
- Yeah.

253
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:43,597
