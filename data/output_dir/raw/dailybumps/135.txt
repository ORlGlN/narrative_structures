1
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,358
- No, she can't hold you!

2
00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:04,968
She's too little.

3
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:06,727
He's like, "Maybe she can hold me."

4
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:09,633
Ahh, Finn really wanted
to hold June (laughs).

5
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:12,194
He tried sitting in her lap
but that didn't really work.

6
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:13,027
♫ This is our life

7
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:14,364
♫ This is our fun

8
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:16,862
♫ This is who we are

9
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:17,722
♫ This is our dream

10
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:18,974
♫ This is our team

11
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:21,685
♫ Shot among the stars

12
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:23,237
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

13
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:26,798
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

14
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:28,084
♫ This is our life

15
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:29,955
♫ Let's live it

16
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:32,411
♫ Live it forever

17
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:34,492
- [Together] Good morning!

18
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,268
- Look who's here!

19
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:39,020
Pay and Liv are helping us start the vlog.

20
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,977
- [Oliver] Good morning!

21
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:41,301
- It is school today.

22
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:42,134
He's acting like...

23
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:42,967
- [Bryan] Like an old man.

24
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:43,800
- Yeah.

25
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,460
He actually, I woke him up this morning,

26
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,781
he was like, "Can I just stay
in bed a few more minutes."

27
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,606
Which is unusual for him.

28
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:50,606
I think he's tired this morning.

29
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:51,936
Are you tired this morning?

30
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:53,333
You're never tired in the morning.

31
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,011
Are you tired in the morning?

32
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:55,844
- No!

33
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:56,677
- No?

34
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:57,510
(laughs)

35
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,343
These kids are excited for school.

36
00:00:58,343 --> 00:00:59,485
I don't know why.

37
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:00,659
Alright, go have fun at school, okay?

38
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:01,492
- Okay!

39
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:03,748
- Mwah!

40
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:04,581
Be good!

41
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:05,621
- Okay.

42
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:07,546
- Alright, I just dropped off Ollie

43
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:10,053
and he was so excited for school!

44
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,268
I think he really missed his
teacher and all his friends.

45
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:13,912
I'm off to the gym.

46
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:15,584
Me and Kelsey always go to the gym,

47
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:18,062
especially on days where I drop off Ollie.

48
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:19,338
I'm really super excited
because today we're going

49
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:21,729
to The Rock Gym, but today we're bringing

50
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,482
a couple extra people with
us and we're super excited.

51
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:27,025
Natalia and Hannah are coming with us

52
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:28,907
and we're going to do some rock climbing

53
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:31,038
and I think it's gonna be a ton of fun.

54
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:33,165
We did rock climbing last
week for the first time

55
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:35,903
and it was so hard but so fun

56
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:39,207
and surprisingly I was not in
that much pain the next day.

57
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,246
So, it's not something that
you're like, "Oh gosh, I'm

58
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:44,597
gonna be like, in pain, for
a week after I rock climb."

59
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:45,869
So, I'm really looking forward

60
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,683
to some rock climbing time and all that.

61
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:49,905
Let's do it!

62
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,339
Alright we're all here and we're

63
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:52,386
getting ready to rock climb.

64
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:53,219
(cheers)

65
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,797
It's their first time so
(laughs) it should be fun!

66
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:57,757
It's really hard, our arms...

67
00:01:57,757 --> 00:01:59,774
We already did one run.
- I'm like already tired.

68
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:00,647
- And we're like cramped up already.

69
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:01,480
- I am too.

70
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,730
(laughter)

71
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:06,405
That one's a hard one Hannah.

72
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:07,596
I can't believe you did that one (laughs).

73
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:08,804
- I know!

74
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:11,823
Alright, we're gonna
go for this one again.

75
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:14,990
(inspirational music)

76
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:23,421
Oh, that was hard!

77
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:24,363
I did only the greens.

78
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:26,366
I touched one black one.

79
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,720
My arms are shaking now.

80
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,008
Tal, that one's a hard one!

81
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,776
(both laugh)

82
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,069
It's like, it's like impossible.

83
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,976
You can do it!

84
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:38,447
Hannah has to jump now (laughs)!

85
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:40,297
Kelsey you can do it!

86
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:42,669
They're all struggling!

87
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,564
(laughing)

88
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,731
- That's it, now I'm down!

89
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:55,238
- [Missy] It's hard (laughs).

90
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:57,821
(upbeat music)

91
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,756
Alright, I am home now and we had

92
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,801
so much fun at The Rock Gym.

93
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,879
I am so sore, I feel like my arm muscles

94
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,027
are like completely cramped
and just like, stuck,

95
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:20,746
like they just hurt so bad.

96
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:23,566
Um but, I found that last time we climbed,

97
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:26,114
the next day I was really not that sore.

98
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:27,923
And I definitely felt like we were,

99
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:30,134
for sure, stronger this time, even though

100
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:31,768
we'd only done it one time before.

101
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,127
So yeah, it's just really cool to know

102
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:34,864
that next time we go, we're just

103
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:36,277
gonna get better and
better, and I already felt

104
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,453
like I was able to do a couple of climbs

105
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,743
that I would've not been
able to done the first time.

106
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,462
So, I don't know of it
was just my confidence

107
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:45,073
or if it is muscle, but it feels good.

108
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:47,734
Anyways, I'm home now
hanging out with Finn

109
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:48,758
while Bryan gets some work done.

110
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,555
I still gotta get ready for the day.

111
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:53,966
Yeah, I think it's gonna be a fun day!

112
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,466
(happy music)

113
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:04,233
- Hello guys, I am headed
in to get a hair cut today.

114
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,408
Um, I have an event in LA
the next couple of days

115
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:10,435
and it has been a little
nuts to take care of.

116
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:11,663
So that's on the agenda today.

117
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:12,896
And then I get to pick
up Ollie from school

118
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:13,800
which I'm really excited about.

119
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,271
Maybe I don't have to go
in and get a hair cut.

120
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:16,334
You know, maybe I could save some time

121
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,333
and just snap my fingers
and see what happens.

122
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,315
(snap)

123
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:20,461
Boom, there we go!

124
00:04:20,462 --> 00:04:21,483
Check it out you guys.

125
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:23,000
Sure saved me a lot of time.

126
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,920
Now I can just go pick
up Ollie from school

127
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,026
and not have to worry about it.

128
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:28,074
Everyone needs a little
YouTube magic in their life.

129
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,270
If you guys had YouTube magic,
what would you use it for?

130
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,157
Leave a comment down below and let me know

131
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:35,408
cause I think that'd be
super funny to read through.

132
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,431
Hey Ollie!

133
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,264
- Hey.

134
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:38,097
- [Bryan] How was school?

135
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:38,930
- Good.

136
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,763
- [Bryan] Hey, you know what I saw?

137
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:40,596
- What?

138
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:41,969
- [Bryan] You guys have a very

139
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:43,978
good looking garden over here.

140
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:45,998
This is so neat, huh?

141
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:46,831
- Yeah!

142
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:47,840
- [Bryan] Do you know what you're growing?

143
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,035
- What?

144
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,018
- [Bryan] It looks like you're

145
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,573
growing Lemon Balm and Snapdragon.

146
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:54,685
- Look there's flowers for Mama!

147
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:55,518
- [Bryan] Yeah!

148
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:56,693
Yellow Bell Peppers even.

149
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,201
That's so cute.

150
00:04:58,201 --> 00:04:59,034
- Yeah.

151
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:00,118
- So did you have a good day at school?

152
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:00,951
- Yeah!

153
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:01,784
- Yeah?

154
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:02,617
Are you ready to go home?

155
00:05:02,617 --> 00:05:05,155
- Mmhmm, look at my shirt I have Goofy on!

156
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:07,200
- Goofy, that's Pluto! (laughs)

157
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,715
- Oh yeah!

158
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:09,941
- Goofy's also a dog though.

159
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:11,332
Alright, let's go kiddo.

160
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:12,165
I missed you!

161
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:13,579
- I missed you too!

162
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,568
- Hey Ollie?

163
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:15,401
- What?

164
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,110
- Remember when we did
the pumpkin spice thing?

165
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,076
And we tried all that
weird pumpkin spice stuff?

166
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:22,469
Well, get ready cause
we're doing it again!

167
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:25,726
Daddy found some cool
pumpkin spice things.

168
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,090
(laughs)

169
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,123
Someone's excited!

170
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:30,239
Check these out, Babe!

171
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,781
Pumpkin pie flavored chips!

172
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:33,849
- I actually really want to try these.

173
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:34,682
- [Bryan] Corbin you
have to try these too.

174
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,520
- Yeah, I'm really intrigued with, what?

175
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,526
- [Bryan] Pumpkin spice chips!

176
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:40,081
- Like a pumpkin pie!
- That is insane.

177
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:41,801
- [Bryan] What is the world coming to?

178
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,137
I've also got pumpkin spice...

179
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:44,970
What is this, cider?

180
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,803
- Sparkling cider?

181
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,636
- [Bryan] Yeah.

182
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,153
- That I'm excited about!
- [Bryan] That looks good.

183
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:49,349
- That looks really good.

184
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,682
- [Bryan] Boys, I got pumpkin Pop Tarts!

185
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:55,249
How cool is that?

186
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:56,353
You like Pop Tarts, huh?

187
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,522
- I don't like those ones anymore.

188
00:05:58,522 --> 00:05:59,420
- [Bryan] You don't want to try the...

189
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,078
He's like, "I'm done trying
pumpkin spice things Dad."

190
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:05,023
And then I also found pumpkin spice OREOs.

191
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:05,856
- [Corbin] Oh!
- [Missy] Hey!

192
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:06,689
- [Ollie] I don't wanna try those!

193
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,522
- [Bryan] There the golden
OREOs, so they have the golden

194
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:08,362
cookies and the cream.

195
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:09,704
- [Missy] You want to try the OREOs?

196
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,537
Oh no?

197
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,420
- [Bryan] You want to try the cookie?

198
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,253
- No!

199
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:13,161
- [Bryan] No?

200
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:13,994
(laughter)

201
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:15,344
- [Missy] He just copies his brother.

202
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:16,252
- [Bryan] Finn just copies

203
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,393
whatever Ollie says it's so funny.

204
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:18,318
- He's like, "What are we doing today?"

205
00:06:18,318 --> 00:06:19,201
"Nope, we're not doing that."

206
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:20,034
(laugh)

207
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:21,150
- Alright, open these pumpkin pie chips.

208
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,983
I have to try these.

209
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,827
This is the weirdest pumpkin spice thing

210
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:26,377
I think I've ever found or encountered.

211
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:27,210
- Can you get it?

212
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,726
- Okay, I'm really weak.

213
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:29,559
- Strength!

214
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,392
Muscles!

215
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:33,193
- From today I can't really
like, even close my hands.

216
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,010
- Missy went rock climbing.

217
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,613
Oh, there we go!

218
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:37,446
- Oh!

219
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:42,708
- Hmm, interesting.

220
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,483
It just smells like potato.
- Yeah.

221
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:45,724
- [Missy] I can smell the potato

222
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:46,975
but I can definitely smell the...

223
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:48,680
- [Bryan] Yeah, it kind
of smells barbecue-y.

224
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,400
- [Missy] Oh wow, that's weird.

225
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,124
- Pumpkin spice chips.

226
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:52,957
- Here we go.

227
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:55,708
(crunching)

228
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,941
- [Missy] Hmm.

229
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:57,902
- [Bryan] Why?

230
00:06:57,902 --> 00:07:00,597
- I'm not really a fan, uh-uh.

231
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,592
- I'm not a fan of chips.

232
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,599
- It's just, it's weird
cause you're eating a chip

233
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,767
and it's not salty, it's sweet.

234
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,938
- It's sweet, it's like a
sweet chip, but it's not...

235
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:09,998
- I don't know, I kind of like it.

236
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:11,109
- [Bryan] You're so weird.

237
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:12,505
Missy hates chips, you guys.
- [Corbin] Weirdo!

238
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:14,950
- She's eating pumpkin
spice flavored chips.

239
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,962
- I don't think I would eat them normally,

240
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:18,531
but I don't really eat chips normally,

241
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:20,092
but it's an interesting flavor.

242
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:20,925
- [Bryan] Yeah.

243
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:21,863
- It's not disgusting.

244
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:23,595
- It's weird, it's too weird.

245
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,569
Alright, how about a pumpkin spice OREO.

246
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:26,402
- Yeah.
- [Missy] Oh!

247
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,619
- Let's do this, this looks good.

248
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,337
- This one I'm not gonna
like, it's too fall.

249
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:32,381
- [Bryan] Honestly,
they kind of look weird.

250
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:34,383
- [Missy] You take an OREO and you make it

251
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:35,939
blonde and that's just not cool.

252
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,494
- Missy's not a fan of the golden.

253
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:38,952
Pumpkin spice OREOs!

254
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:41,893
(crunching)

255
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,049
- I like that!

256
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:44,896
I would sit and eat like
a whole box of these.

257
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:49,320
- Oh, um, I wouldn't eat them,
but they're not disgusting.

258
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,346
- [Bryan] There not horrible!

259
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:51,179
There definitely not horrible.

260
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,765
I think they'd be good
with a chocolate cookie.

261
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:53,598
- I need milk.

262
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,431
- Mm, yeah.

263
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,097
- [Bryan] And milk.

264
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:57,131
Hey Finn, you want a cookie?

265
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,071
- Yeah!

266
00:07:58,071 --> 00:07:59,057
(chuckles)

267
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:01,348
- [Bryan] Try that cookie
and tell me what you think.

268
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,167
Well, what do you think?

269
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,109
- Good.

270
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:04,942
- [Bryan] Good?

271
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,440
(little kid talk)
- You wanna try it Ollie?

272
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,341
- No!

273
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,200
(laugh)

274
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,831
- I was like, "If it's a taste test video,

275
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:11,753
I'm gonna check out now."

276
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:14,421
Now we're gonna try pumpkin spice

277
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,872
flavored apple and pumpkin juice blend.

278
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,977
- [Corbin] Oh, yum.

279
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:18,999
- I don't know if I can try this one

280
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,348
because it's carbonated.

281
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:21,181
- [Corbin] No.

282
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:22,014
- It might be sparkling.

283
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:23,358
Let's see how it fizzes.

284
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:24,685
- [Corbin] Nice and bubbly.
- [Missy] Oh wow!

285
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:25,907
That's a lot of fizz.

286
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,216
- [Bryan] Oh!

287
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,480
- Wait, I'm gonna smell it.

288
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,905
- [Corbin] Good?

289
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:35,099
- Um, it smells like
pumpkin, it's kind of weird.

290
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,292
- Oh, that's weird!

291
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:40,400
Yeah, like it smells like raw pumpkin...

292
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,266
- [Missy] Yeah.
- [Corbin] Ew.

293
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:42,100
- Filling.

294
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:46,584
- It's not bad.

295
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:47,417
- [Corbin] No?

296
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:48,250
- It's not good.
- [Missy] Does it have apple?

297
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,856
- Yeah the apple's good.

298
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:52,393
- Probably with it cold,
it might be better.

299
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:53,498
- This is like really
disheartening, you think

300
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,949
that everything pumpkin spice
would be good, but it's weird!

301
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:57,835
Sometimes it's weird.

302
00:08:57,835 --> 00:09:00,752
You try it.
- Yeah I want to try it.

303
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:02,748
I don't like that.

304
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:03,950
It's like a spice cider.

305
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,783
- [Bryan] Yeah!

306
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:07,022
- I think if it was just
pumpkin it would be fine.

307
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:11,686
- Now we have Pop Tarts,
pumpkin spice Pop Tarts.

308
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:12,886
- [Corbin] I don't think it can go wrong.

309
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,735
- Look at that glorious
orange food coloring.

310
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:15,568
(laughter)

311
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:16,401
It's pretty good right?

312
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:17,234
(laughter)

313
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,588
- [Ollie] Strawberry is them?

314
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:20,658
- No strawberry!

315
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:21,774
- Um, it's pretty good!

316
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:22,607
- This is pretty good!

317
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:23,440
- [Corbin] Yeah?

318
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,273
- This is probably the best pumpkin spice

319
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,078
thing that I've had.

320
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:27,511
You want to try it Finn?

321
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,901
- Yeah, I don't think you
can go wrong with a Pop Tart.

322
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,734
- No.

323
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:31,641
- Finn's got a chocolate chip cookie,

324
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,522
pumpkin OREO, and a pumpkin Pop Tart.

325
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:34,461
- [Missy] He's like, "Dang!"

326
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:37,000
- He's like, "I love taste test videos!"

327
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,583
(happy and peaceful music)

328
00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:44,960
I think it's safe to say Finn
loves taste test challenges.

329
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,259
But if you guys want to
see the first time we did

330
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,281
this challenge where we tried a bunch

331
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:49,549
of weird pumpkin spice things,

332
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:50,856
I'll have linked in the add card.

333
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,207
These ones are definitely weirder

334
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,939
like OREOs and chips, that's just weird.

335
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:58,413
- Alright guys, so yesterday
Bryan asked the question,

336
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:01,194
where everyone was from
that watches our vlogs

337
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:03,578
and we got so many comments, huh?

338
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:06,054
Tons of people telling
us where they're from

339
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:09,696
in the world and I was looking
at this map and I thought

340
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,535
it would be really fun to
read some of those comments

341
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:14,522
and show Ollie where some people are from.

342
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:16,525
Like there's just people from
all over the world watching us

343
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:17,799
and I think it's really cool to be able

344
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,904
to connect to you guys like that.

345
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:21,051
Alright, I've recruited
my dad so we can read them

346
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:22,851
together, cause I'm like,
I don't have enough hands.

347
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:23,684
Okay, let's see, so we've
got Jason in Colorado.

348
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:26,517
Which is right there, and you know

349
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:30,764
you live right here, right?

350
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,831
- [Missy's Dad] There's Colorado.

351
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,667
- Yep.

352
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:37,025
We've got Georgia Gellar
from the Philippines.

353
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,943
So where's the Philippines at?

354
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,030
Oh, there's the Philippines!

355
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,288
That is so far away!

356
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,275
- [Missy's Dad] You live over here.

357
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:47,200
- [Missy] How cool is that?
- They live over here.

358
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,385
- Or you can go the other way.
- They live on the

359
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:49,735
other side of the world!

360
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:52,891
Alright, the next one is from Smiley Alice

361
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:54,936
and she is from Norway!

362
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:55,769
Know where Norway is?

363
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,270
Oh yeah, there it is!

364
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,395
Oh!
- [Missy's Dad] Right there.

365
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,673
- [Missy] They live next to Sweden.

366
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:01,621
- [Missy's Dad] So you live over here a

367
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,591
and they're way over there.

368
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:04,941
That's so far away!

369
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:07,189
- Ollie's like, "I am so tired."

370
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:09,673
He's like, "I do not, I don't
have the energy for this."

371
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:12,509
- We've got Ashna from New Zealand!

372
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:16,918
Oh, New Zealand is all the
way in this little tiny area.

373
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,314
That is so far!

374
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:19,500
- Can you point to your place?

375
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,483
You're way over there.
- [Missy] Yeah!

376
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:21,618
You're over there!

377
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:22,651
- [Missy's Dad] They love way over here!

378
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:23,789
- In New Zealand!

379
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:27,429
And then, I'm gonna do one
more, and its from Cool Girl

380
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,593
and she lives in the Cayman Islands.

381
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:30,580
- Can you show where Cayman Islands is?

382
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,522
- Which is really neat.

383
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,121
That's not the Cayman Islands.

384
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:33,954
- [Missy's Dad] It's right here.

385
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,654
- [Missy] The Cayman Islands
is over they live near

386
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:39,010
like Jamaica and basically
the, what is that,

387
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,463
that's the, uh, Caribbean Sea.

388
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,555
So neat!
- Close to Florida.

389
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:44,388
- I love reading.

390
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:45,221
- That's your favorite place.

391
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:46,119
- Yeah (laughs).

392
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,888
I just love reading all the different

393
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:49,199
areas that people are from.

394
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:52,185
But anyways, this kid is so ready for bed.

395
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:54,554
Look who's over tonight!

396
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,271
We got baby June, huh?

397
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:57,659
We're babysitting.

398
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,890
Are you being a good helper babysitter?

399
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,943
(laughs)

400
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:03,254
We have June tonight because
it is Kelsey and Corbin's

401
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:06,253
anniversary and I thought
that it would be really cool

402
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:09,563
if they got to actually
go out on a real date

403
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,144
and I get to have baby June!

404
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:13,745
Are you hanging out with Aunty Missy?

405
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:14,769
It's been going pretty good so far.

406
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,744
(screams)

407
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:19,185
She's um, discovering life with brothers.

408
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:21,723
Keep that away from her face.

409
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:25,231
And I'm discovering life
with three children.

410
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:26,648
Which is crazy...

411
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:30,156
Definitely not ready yet.

412
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:30,989
- Why?

413
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:31,822
(laughs)

414
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:34,288
These boys, there a
little crazy still huh?

415
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,842
Huh, aww!

416
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,230
She loves giving kisses.

417
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,350
Bryan is headed out of town, so we

418
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,945
are gonna really really miss him.

419
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,745
But tomorrow we have a fun day planned,

420
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:46,279
but for now these boys
have to get some sleep.

421
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,474
Aww, are you holding hands
with June, petting her?

422
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:52,520
These boys are like infatuated with her.

423
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,594
Are you gonna give her a kiss?

424
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:59,473
Oh no, she can't hold
you, she's too little!

425
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,151
He's like, "Maybe she can hold me."

426
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,163
Hey Finn, do you want to
hold June for a minute?

427
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:04,974
Aww (laughs)!

428
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:06,239
Finn really wanted to hold June.

429
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,072
(chuckles)

430
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:09,758
He tried sitting in her lap
but that didn't really work.

431
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:10,591
So now he's holding her.

432
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:12,136
Alright, Ollie, and Finn, and June,

433
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:13,857
you guys ready to end the vlog?

434
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:14,690
- Yeah!

435
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,523
- Yeah?

436
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:17,912
Give the video a big thumbs up!

437
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:20,854
Yeah, say, "we'll see you tomorrow!"

438
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,289
(laughs)

439
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:23,122
- Bye!

440
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:27,281
- [Missy] Say, "Boop!"

441
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:28,727
Boop!

442
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:29,560
Boop.

443
00:13:31,250 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
