00:00:00,221 --> 00:00:01,971
- Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

2
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:03,260
The door is open you guys.

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,551
- [Missy] Why, yeah, we didn't-

4
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,691
- [Bryan] Why is the door open?

5
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:08,706
Did someone break in our house?

6
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:12,123
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)

7
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,053
Morning!

8
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:18,182
Good morning guys!

9
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:19,118
- Guys, guys.

10
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,398
Did you know Luna was just being sad,

11
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:24,030
and she did this (whimpers)

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,317
- [Bryan] Oh I see, but now she's happy.

13
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,077
Look, huh, because she just needs love.

14
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:29,609
Can you guys pet her?

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:30,442
Pet Luna!

16
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:31,889
Luna needs love!

17
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:34,862
She did so good on this
cabin trip, didn't she?

18
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:35,695
- Yeah.

19
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:38,025
- Yes, the boys and Luna
have been having so much fun

20
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:38,995
at our cabin trip.

21
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:43,057
We are packing up though,
and getting ready to go home!

22
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:44,185
Are you ready to go home?

23
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:45,160
Oh, did she get you?

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,304
- Yeah.

25
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:48,167
- [Bryan] She's just playing with you.

26
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,466
- We are off to home!

27
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:52,746
We're so excited to see Karma, huh?

28
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:54,423
- Yeah I miss Karma.

29
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:56,649
- [Missy] Yeah, and Luna misses Karma,

30
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,073
and we're hoping she doesn't
get carsick this time.

31
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:00,408
I'll keep an eye on her.

32
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:03,425
Anyways, that concludes
our iWorld vacation!

33
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:04,471
We had such a fun time.

34
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,986
It was so nice to just relax,

35
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:08,898
and hang out with the fam and everything.

36
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:11,449
And it's morning time, we're headed home!

37
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:14,032
(upbeat music)

38
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:21,440
- Home!

39
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,712
- [Bryan] We're home,
what's up sleepyhead?

40
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,329
Did you get a good
little nap in the truck?

41
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,162
- Yeah.

42
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:28,829
- [Bryan] Hey Karma, we're home!

43
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:31,799
Aw.

44
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,189
- That's so cool!

45
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:35,247
- [Bryan] What is above our door?

46
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:37,038
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

47
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:38,572
The door is open you guys.

48
00:01:38,572 --> 00:01:40,178
- [Missy] Why, yeah, we didn't-

49
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:41,736
- [Bryan] Why is the door open?

50
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,443
Did someone break in our house?

51
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:44,505
- I dunno.

52
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,298
- [Oliver] Wait, open it.

53
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:48,679
Fred!

54
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:49,929
- [Bryan] What?

55
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:51,881
Whoa!

56
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:55,499
- Christmas tree!

57
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:56,905
- [Bryan] What?

58
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:59,491
- [Missy] What is going on?

59
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,729
What's it say dude?

60
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,594
Don't touch, don't touch him!

61
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:05,200
- If you touch him he will home.

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,729
- Yeah, you can't touch him, oh my gosh.

63
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,481
- [Bryan] Wow, I was not
expecting to see Fred already.

64
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,412
- I did not think it was time to see Fred.

65
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:14,587
(Oliver gasps)

66
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:17,029
- [Bryan] What, whoa!

67
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,867
The whole house is
decorated for Christmas?

68
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,278
- [Oliver] Look, stockings!

69
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:24,554
- [Bryan] We have our stockings up?

70
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:26,116
Ollie, who did all this?

71
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,716
- Ugh, maybe Fred?

72
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:30,044
- [Bryan] Maybe, let's
go look at his note!

73
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:33,395
There's Fred just hanging
around like he always does.

74
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:34,515
- Okay it says

75
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:35,781
" Hi Ollie and Finn,

76
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,058
"I'm so excited to be back,

77
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:39,107
"and can't wait to see what kinda fun

78
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:41,058
"we get into this month.

79
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,571
"Christmas is just around the corner,

80
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:46,738
"and I'm excited to tell Santa
that you have been good boys.

81
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,356
"Love, Fred."

82
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:50,189
And it says

83
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,428
"PS I was a little too impatient for you

84
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:53,771
"to get into the Christmas spirit

85
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:57,074
"so I had to decorate the house for you"

86
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:58,908
- [Bryan] That's so cool!

87
00:02:58,908 --> 00:02:59,952
- [Oliver] Yeah, but I didn't-

88
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,226
- [Bryan] That's his little door.

89
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,042
- And then Fred shows up!

90
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,184
- [Bryan] Yeah, look at this tree.

91
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:08,619
He decorated this whole tree?

92
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:09,859
- I didn't see.

93
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,874
- [Bryan] Wow, it's so pretty!

94
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:15,689
Look at the frosted flowers babe.

95
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:16,883
- [Missy] Wow, it's so pretty.

96
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:18,058
- [Bryan] That is so cool,

97
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:19,989
and look at the little owl up there!

98
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,204
That's so cool.

99
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:23,944
- [Missy] I wonder what
we can do with this wand.

100
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:26,184
- [Bryan] Whoa!
- [Missy] Oh my gosh!

101
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:28,087
- [Bryan] Did you just turn on
the Christmas tree with that?

102
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,145
- Yeah.

103
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,899
- [Bryan] You can do that?

104
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:31,732
Ah, whoa!

105
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:35,380
- [Missy] It's the
magic of the magic wand!

106
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,004
- [Bryan] You can turn on the
Christmas tree with the wand!

107
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:40,612
Fred must have brought that
from the North Pole for us, huh?

108
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:41,445
- Yeah.

109
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:43,672
- [Bryan] Wow, what you
guys, this is crazy!

110
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,569
Our whole house is decorated!

111
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,537
What a cool magic wand!

112
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:49,744
Let's look around the house
and see what else he did, okay?

113
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,352
Ollie, look it, there's snow and frost

114
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:53,224
all over our Christmas tree this year.

115
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:54,701
- [Missy] Pretty!

116
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,324
- It's not real ones.

117
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:58,151
- [Bryan] No, it just looks like it.

118
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:00,757
That is an amazing tree.

119
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,319
Check that out you guys.

120
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,069
- Oo!
- [Bryan] Whoa!

121
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:07,621
- Look it!

122
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:09,642
- [Bryan] Yeah, your guys'
playroom is all decorated

123
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,221
for Christmas too?

124
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,243
- [Finn] Yeah!
- [Oliver] Yeah!

125
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,913
- [Bryan] Look at this!

126
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:16,707
- [Finn] Yeah, Halloween!

127
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:20,468
- [Bryan] No, not Halloween,
Finn, it's Christmas.

128
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,419
Oh look at that!

129
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,995
We got Woody, and Jessie.

130
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:26,297
And look at this you guys.

131
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:27,957
You guys have your own
little Christmas tree in here

132
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:29,059
you can help set up!

133
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:30,250
We got a cute little Christmas tree

134
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,844
that the boys can put together.

135
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:33,913
And this is an advent calendar.

136
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:34,746
And, look it, here's all your stuff

137
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:36,877
for the Christmas tree, boys.

138
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,962
So you can start sticking all
your stuff right on the tree,

139
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:40,931
and it'll stick.

140
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,498
So where do the presents go, Ollie?

141
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,018
No, presents go on the
bottom of the tree, silly.

142
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,763
Put it on the tree, Finn!

143
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:48,065
There you go!

144
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:49,075
- [Oliver] Candy cane.

145
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:50,434
- [Bryan] Yeah, put a candy cane on.

146
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:51,267
- Yeah.

147
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,100
- [Missy] You gotta put the-

148
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,092
- Nom, nom, nom.

149
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,315
- [Bryan] Here, put it on there.

150
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:56,993
(laughter)

151
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,826
(Christmas music)

152
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:12,545
You guys are doing such a good job

153
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,233
decorating this Christmas
tree in your playroom.

154
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,368
You wanna put the hat on?

155
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:17,410
- Yeah.

156
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,905
- [Bryan] Go ahead!

157
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:20,283
Oh, on your head?

158
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:22,225
You silly, it goes on the tree!

159
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:23,137
- It's our tree!

160
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:24,177
- [Bryan] It looks so good, boys!

161
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:25,697
Let's go explore the rest of the house!

162
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:26,609
- Okay.

163
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,799
- [Bryan] Let's go see what else Fred did!

164
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,632
(Christmas music)

165
00:05:44,484 --> 00:05:49,244
Whoa, we got a plate especially
for cookies for Santa?

166
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:50,253
And milk?

167
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:51,595
- There's candy cane!

168
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:53,052
- [Bryan] Whoa!

169
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,608
Fred left us candy canes?

170
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:55,454
- Yeah.

171
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,661
- [Bryan] You want one, Finn?

172
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:00,494
(Christmas music)

173
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:06,926
Look at how pretty of a job Fred did.

174
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:08,997
- This was very magical.

175
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:10,345
- [Bryan] It's so good!

176
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:13,012
It looks so furry and snowy and-

177
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:14,800
- [Missy] Magical?

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,761
- [Bryan] Magical.

179
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:18,165
Um, babe, I think he did our room too.

180
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:21,362
- [Missy] Oh my gosh,
he decorated our room!

181
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:23,439
- [Bryan] What do you think?

182
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,483
- [Missy] It's so Christmasy in here!

183
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,418
- [Bryan] Ollie, look
at our Christmas tree!

184
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:28,251
- [Oliver] Yeah!

185
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,274
- [Bryan] It's so pretty!

186
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:32,827
Fred really went all out
decorating, you guys.

187
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,244
He even decorated our bed.

188
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:35,841
We've got mistletoe.

189
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:38,011
- Look how pretty this is!

190
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:40,344
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh, Missy.

191
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:44,635
Fred must know that you love Outlander,

192
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:48,403
and he made an Outlander Christmas tree.

193
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,301
- [Oliver] Look at that
sword, look at that sword!

194
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,134
- It's a sword.

195
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,442
- [Bryan] There's a sword in there?

196
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:55,564
And the plaid ribbon,

197
00:06:55,564 --> 00:06:59,381
the feathers, the leather, the pictures.

198
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,534
Look at these ornaments, babe.

199
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,629
This is so Claire and Jaime.

200
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,379
(Scottish music)

201
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:19,912
That is so awesome.

202
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:21,239
If you guys didn't know,

203
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,143
Missy and I love Outlander.

204
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,135
It's a show that's on right now,

205
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:27,231
and it's about time travel and love,

206
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,864
and it's one of Missy's favorite things.

207
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,975
- So romantic.

208
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:32,260
- [Bryan] Fred, you outdid yourself.

209
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,046
I can't believe he decorated
this Christmas tree,

210
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:34,879
it looks so cool.

211
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,267
- He definitely made
Christmas magical in our room.

212
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,854
- [Bryan] And look, even our bed.

213
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,588
Okay boys, you wanna go see your rooms?

214
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:41,507
- [Boys] Yeah!

215
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:42,637
- [Missy] Let's go see your rooms!

216
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:43,892
- [Bryan] Let's go see your rooms.

217
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:45,019
- [Missy] Let's do Finn's room.

218
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:45,852
- [Oliver] Okay.

219
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:47,656
- [Bryan] Whoa!

220
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,564
- Look at Finn's Christmas tree!

221
00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:53,650
- [Bryan] Whoa, it's all
decorated in here too?

222
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,658
Finn, you have your own Christmas tree

223
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:58,561
with all your own woodland critters on it.

224
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,894
That is so cool!

225
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,561
And a little Santa.

226
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:03,809
Whoa!

227
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,081
Finn do you like your room?

228
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,097
- Yeah!

229
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:07,082
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie,

230
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:08,401
do you think he did
something in your room?

231
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:09,234
- Yeah.

232
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,067
- [Bryan] Let's go check.

233
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:10,903
- [Missy] Let's go Finn!

234
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:12,777
- [Bryan] Ollie, I think
he decorated your room.

235
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:13,874
Come look!

236
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,689
(Oliver gasps)

237
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,689
- [Bryan] Whoa, look it,

238
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:21,517
you have your own Christmas
tree up too, Ollie!

239
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:22,605
- [Oliver] Yeah!

240
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:23,731
- [Bryan] What's all over it?

241
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,898
You've got Jack Skellington and Belle.

242
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:30,192
Look at all the fun characters.

243
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:31,829
- [Missy] This is so cute!

244
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:32,874
- [Bryan] I love the elf.

245
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:33,707
Look it, Ollie.

246
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:35,299
There's little elf legs
sticking out of your tree.

247
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,042
- Look at this.

248
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,619
- [Bryan] Whoa, is that Woody?

249
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,996
- [Finn] Woody and Batman!

250
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:42,241
- [Bryan] And who else do you see?

251
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:44,971
Ollie, do you see this one, Jack?

252
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,713
- My favorite!

253
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:47,954
- [Bryan] I know, and look it,

254
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,289
you have all your new Christmas books out!

255
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:52,034
That's so neat!

256
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,202
We can start reading
Christmas books at night.

257
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:55,908
- Look over here, it's so pretty!

258
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,515
- [Bryan] Oh wow, I didn't even see this.

259
00:08:57,515 --> 00:08:58,348
This is so cool.

260
00:08:58,348 --> 00:08:59,455
- [Oliver] Wait, I want that!

261
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,665
- [Missy] Cinnamon sticks, smell it.

262
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:04,551
- [Bryan] Can you smell it?

263
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:06,511
This is so cute.

264
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,024
Wow, Fred.

265
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:10,328
So if you guys didn't
see last years video,

266
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:12,471
our house got magically decorated as well.

267
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:14,638
I'll have it linked in the
icard so you can check it out.

268
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,616
This was a huge surprise.

269
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,328
Ollie, do you wanna say thank you to Fred?

270
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:19,639
- Thank you, Fred!

271
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,110
- [Bryan] That's right, thank you Fred.

272
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,341
Oh we should go see your chicken coop!

273
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:23,270
- Yes!

274
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,413
- [Bryan] I saw there was stuff on it.

275
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:25,927
Let's go check out the chicken coop, boys.

276
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:28,213
- Alright, I'm so excited
to see my chicken coop!

277
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:31,679
I always wanted to decorate
it like super cute,

278
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,463
and look at it.

279
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:35,831
It looks like Santa's workshop!

280
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:38,498
Wow, oh my gosh, it's so pretty!

281
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:41,799
The North Pole.

282
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,908
- [Bryan] That's cool.

283
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:45,741
(Christmas music)

284
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,302
- [Missy] And little flowers.

285
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,624
Are they real?

286
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:53,703
They're real!

287
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:55,255
- You have poinsettias in here!

288
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:56,503
Are they planted in here?

289
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:57,583
- [Missy] Yeah!

290
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,818
- Fred planted poinsettias,
that is so cool.

291
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:00,985
- [Finn] Papa?

292
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:04,938
- [Missy] Did you just call Santa "Papa"?

293
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,214
- [Bryan] Say "Hi Santa!"

294
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,397
- [Finn] Hi Santa!

295
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,470
- Ho, ho, ho.

296
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,087
You better be good this year boys.

297
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:13,187
I'll be watching you,
I'll be watching you.

298
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:14,853
- [Missy] Ew, he's scared.

299
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:16,623
- Happy Christmas chickens!

300
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:19,716
- [Bryan] That's right,
happy Christmas ladies!

301
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:20,844
- How ya'll doing?

302
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:22,364
- [Bryan] You got your coop all set up.

303
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,437
Do you have any Christmas presents for us?

304
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:25,549
In the form of eggs?

305
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:26,579
- I got one.

306
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:27,444
- [Bryan] We got an egg?

307
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:28,324
- Yeah.

308
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:29,822
- [Bryan] I love these
poinsettias in here.

309
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:30,700
That's so cool.

310
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,580
- I know, it's so pretty.

311
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,413
(Christmas music)

312
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,834
- Boys, look at what I just saw.

313
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:56,667
- [Oliver] What?

314
00:10:56,667 --> 00:11:00,167
- I just saw that we have a Santa mailbox.

315
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:02,388
Do you know what that means?

316
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:03,221
- What?

317
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:05,291
- [Missy] We can put letters in here,

318
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,371
and then I bet Fred will take
them to Santa every night.

319
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:11,531
So we can write Santa letters,

320
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,628
and tell him what we want for Christmas.

321
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,131
- Well I want a toy.

322
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:16,507
- [Missy] You want a toy?
- Yeah.

323
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:17,907
- [Missy] Do you know what
you want for Christmas?

324
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,091
- I don't remember.

325
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,124
- You don't remember?

326
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:22,165
Well we're gonna figure out
what they want for Christmas,

327
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,932
and we're gonna write letters to Santa.

328
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,939
Have Fred deliver them every night.

329
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:29,044
This is just such a cute little like,

330
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:33,196
just a cute little
mailbox for Santa Clause.

331
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:34,444
You just put them right in there.

332
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,667
The boys are super excited

333
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:39,726
because they found the
Christmas Lego houses!

334
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:41,759
- And this is really cool!

335
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,332
- [Missy] This is really cool.

336
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:46,037
This one has reindeer, and a sleigh,

337
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,110
and Santa Clause, and Mrs. Clause,

338
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,124
and a big house.

339
00:11:50,124 --> 00:11:51,813
Choo-choo train with elves.

340
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:54,461
And this one's cool because
it's got a little house,

341
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,317
and a big Christmas tree.

342
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,941
- I mean, this one
comes with a teddy bear,

343
00:11:58,941 --> 00:12:00,428
and a baby kitty cat.

344
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,740
- [Missy] Oh, nice.

345
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,667
Oh yeah, there's a teddy bear
and a kitty cat, you're right.

346
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,289
So I think we're gonna put these together,

347
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,687
and then maybe display
them in their playroom.

348
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:08,620
Wouldn't that be cool?

349
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,453
- Yeah.

350
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:10,937
- [Missy] Okay, let's
start working on it, okay?

351
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:11,770
- Okay.

352
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,219
- [Bryan] Finn just came
in to show me his pajamas.

353
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:15,645
Look how cute he is.

354
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,108
You are dressed like elf on the shelf.

355
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:18,235
You even got the hat.

356
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:19,348
- [Finn] Yeah!

357
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:22,147
- [Bryan] Oh my goodness, Ollie.

358
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:24,434
Look at you, you look so good

359
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,692
in your elf on the shelf jammies,

360
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:28,021
since Fred is back.

361
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:28,854
- [Missy] You gotta put your hat on.

362
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:30,028
- [Bryan] Oh, you gotta have the hat on.

363
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,226
Finn, what are you doing?

364
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:32,804
- [Missy] Watch the tree!

365
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:34,402
- [Bryan] Oh, wait, wait, wait.

366
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:35,731
He's looking at the peas in the pod.

367
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:38,172
You guys remember when Finn
was the peas in the pod

368
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,980
for Toy Story Halloween special?

369
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,356
I'll have it linked in the icard above.

370
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:42,430
That's what you wore.

371
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,694
That was your very
first Halloween costume.

372
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:45,527
Did you know that?

373
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:46,360
- Yeah.

374
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,193
- [Bryan] Yeah.

375
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:49,593
The boys are both wearing
their elf on the shelf jammies

376
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:51,124
and they look so cute.

377
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:52,885
What do you think of your tree?

378
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:56,153
- Good, but there's a
minion on the hiding,

379
00:12:56,153 --> 00:12:59,142
and he has to put the banana up.

380
00:12:59,142 --> 00:13:00,263
- [Bryan] No way,

381
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:02,329
I know there's lots of cool
characters on there, huh?

382
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:03,162
- [Oliver] Yeah.

383
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:05,046
Fred we're dressed just like you!

384
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:08,040
- [Missy] You're dressed
just like him, ha!

385
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,382
Finn's pretty excited.

386
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:11,890
Hey, let's take a picture

387
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,057

390
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:21,890
a little nightly breakdancing

391
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,976
in their elf on the shelf jammies.

392
00:13:23,976 --> 00:13:25,681
You guys, speaking of elf on the shelf,

393
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,047

we gotta clean up all these pillows.

399
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:36,574
You guys made a huge
mess in this living room.

400
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:37,407
- [Missy] Come on, we gotta clean up.

throwing pillows everywhere.

403
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,820
Put the pillows away, come on guys.

404
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,545
Put these pillows back on this couch.

00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:47,653
You can do it, there you go.

00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:49,942
Put them back on, oh, nice!
