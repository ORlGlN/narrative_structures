1
00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:04,189
Hey guys, so, we have
something to tell you.

2
00:00:04,189 --> 00:00:05,070
I messed up.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,811
♪ This is our life ♪

4
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:09,968
♪ Let's live it ♪

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,856
♪ Live it forever ♪

6
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:13,343
- [Missy] Good morning Ollie.

7
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:14,712
Good morning.

8
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:16,530
- [Missy] Are you ready for school?

9
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,363
Yeah.

10
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:20,457
Yeah, good morning, we are so tired, huh?

11
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:21,290
Yeah.

12
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,214
Yeah, we are headed to school.

13
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,833
I'm hoping it goes good.

14
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,675
All right, gotta take your picture, huh?

15
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,444
Look here and smile, say cheese!

16
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:29,277
Cheese.

17
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:33,465
Good job, all right you ready for school?

18
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,315
I'm so excited.

19
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:37,732
(calm music)

20
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:46,571
All right drop off
actually went pretty good.

21
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,748
Better than it has the past
like, I'd say like three weeks.

22
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,670
He didn't cry so that's good.

23
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,524
It sounded like he was actually
having like a lot of fun

24
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:55,132
when I like peeked through the window

25
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:57,799
I saw him playing, so yay, success!

26
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,558
And then I did show
you guys some pictures.

27
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,350
His teacher said that they were
trying pumpkin pie ice cream

28
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,599
and all the kids were trying it.

29
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,726
And she said that he did try
it, and he did not like it

30
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:11,095
at all but he was
willing to take a picture

31
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:12,959
and he told her that "I don't like it

32
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,190
"but here's my happy
face smile" and he's like

33
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,603
(laughing) it looked kinda funny.

34
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,321
I'm gonna go home, and get ready

35
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:20,468
for my day a little bit more.

36
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:22,058
I haven't actually done my hair today.

37
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:24,009
Yeah, and go hang out with my other boys.

38
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,144
What's up guys, I am just
hanging out in my office today

39
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:30,255
because I have a ton of work
to do, but before I do that,

40
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:32,744
I actually get to do something very fun.

41
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:35,156
Special thanks to HP for
sponsoring this video.

42
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:38,200
As you guys know I got this
new wall console cabinet

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,325
for my office but that's
not all that's new.

44
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:46,021
Check out my brand new
HP Envy photo printer.

45
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,055
I actually picked up this
printer a couple weeks ago,

46
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:50,273
and it is hands down the best printer

47
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:51,665
that I have ever owned.

48
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:55,296
It is one of the most high
quality printers on the market.

49
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:57,502
This thing is perfect
for crafts, documents,

50
00:01:57,502 --> 00:02:00,114
and printing full color
photos from my phone

51
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:01,907
of moments that really matter.

52
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:04,058
As you guys know, Finn
just turned two years old.

53
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:07,772
Ollie is four now, and
to me that is just crazy.

54
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:09,838
These boys are growing up so fast.

55
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,323
We need more pictures of them,
and the HP Envy photo printer

56
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:15,156
helps us do just that.

57
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:18,240
The colors look amazing
and the photos just pop.

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,206
Plus it's awesome being able
to do it all from your phone

59
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,143
with the HP Smart Remote app.

60
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,187
And as you guys know we
live a pretty busy life.

61
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,837
And with HP Instant Ink we
never have to worry about

62
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:30,759
running out of ink when
we go to print a photo.

63
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,937
Which is really cool, too.

64
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:34,156
I have to say one of the worst
things about owning a printer

65
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:37,301
is going to print some thing
and have it be out of ink.

66
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,835
Right, I think everyone has been there.

67
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:41,568
With HP Instant Ink,
you never have to worry

68
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:42,835
about running out of ink again.

69
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:44,469
This is seriously so cool, you guys.

70
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:47,656
The printer lets HP know
when it's low on ink

71
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:51,195
and it orders it before
I'm about to run out so

72
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:54,002
I always have ink available
when this runs out.

73
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:56,879
It's like my own personal
ink buying assistant.

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,014
It's amazing.

75
00:02:58,014 --> 00:02:59,588
Check out these photos of our boys from

76
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:01,065
our Oregon trip back in August.

77
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,391
With the new HP Envy photo
printer we can display these

78
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,816
in our home and look back and
remember all the fun we had.

79
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:08,399
(upbeat music)

80
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,926
I love this photo so much
of Missy carrying Finn

81
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:21,831
while we were hiking in
Oregon, it's so cool.

82
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:24,463
But honestly if you guys are
in the market for a printer

83
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:26,629
be sure to check out the
HP Envy photo printer

84
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,884
and a huge thanks to HP again
for sponsoring this video.

85
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,333
This little boy is being carried

86
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,847
into his doctors
appointment, he's so tired.

87
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,975
It's so early still, why is he asleep?

88
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:38,926
Well, he woke up at like 6 a.m.

89
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,020
Oh that's true, he did
wake up super early today.

90
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,889
Good morning guys, yes, we are headed

91
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,504
into Finn's doctors appointment.

92
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:46,825
Oh, good morning, Finn.

93
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:49,372
Hey dude, are you going to the doctors?

94
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:50,699
Yeah.

95
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,586
He's actually at the age
where he's still excited

96
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:54,417
about the doctors.

97
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:57,056
He might not be excited about
the doctor when we leave.

98
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,639
(upbeat music)

99
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:06,766
- [Missy] Finn you're
being such a good boy.

100
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,383
Yeah, he is.

101
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:09,936
- [Missy] I don't think
even think Ollie would want

102
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:12,368
to stand on that scale.

103
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:13,779
Finn's being so good.

104
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:16,362
(upbeat music)

105
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:21,279
Say grapes.

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,112
Gapes.

107
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:23,889
Say apple.

108
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,722
Bapoo.

109
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,350
- [Missy] Say banana.

110
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,262
Nana.

111
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:30,155
- [Missy] Poor baby.

112
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:32,958
Finn, how did your appointment go?

113
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:33,875
Say good.

114
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:37,228
Are you a little sad, he's
a little sad right now.

115
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:39,520
He got one shot, but you did so good.

116
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,579
Yeah you did.

117
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,902
Yeah he did better than
your brother. (laughing)

118
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:46,727
I actually think I really
need to do a two year update

119
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,924
on him because I haven't done that yet.

120
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:50,663
And I haven't done a video
on my channel in so long.

121
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:52,872
So I think I might try
and do that really soon.

122
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:54,369
Let me know in the comments
if you guys want to see

123
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:57,010
a two year update on my
channel and maybe I'll start

124
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,960
up my channel again, let me know.

125
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,937
Finn and Bryan are in the car right now.

126
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,452
Actually gonna go pick up Ollie.

127
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,557
He, I would say it's not super
early but I think he'll be

128
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:06,660
really excited to see me.

129
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,028
But yeah, then we have some
more shopping to get done.

130
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,452
We have a few fun things
happening this week, so.

131
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,326
Yeah we gotta get stuff done.

132
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:14,159
Hi, Ollie.

133
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:15,908
Hi.

134
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:16,948
- [Missy] How was school?

135
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:17,781
Good.

136
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:18,955
- [Missy] Were you so excited to see Mama?

137
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,562
Yeah.

138
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:23,231
- [Missy] And did you
learn about the number 13?

139
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:27,682
Yeah but here's where I'm
going to plant my flowers.

140
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:30,661
- [Missy] Oh this is such
a cool little garden, huh?

141
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:31,494
Yeah.

142
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:32,405
- [Bryan] Hey dude how was school?

143
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:33,696
Good.

144
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:34,800
- [Bryan] It was good?

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,809
Yeah.

146
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:37,134
- [Bryan] You know Finn
went to the doctors while

147
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:38,220
you were at school.

148
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,053
Really?

149
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,805
- [Bryan] And he had to get a shot, yeah.

150
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:42,810
Did he cry at anything?

151
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,183
- [Bryan] He cried a little
bit you'll have to give him

152
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:46,077
a big hug, okay?

153
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:50,244
Whoa, Ollie there's aliens
in the back of your car!

154
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:54,034
Better speed away, go go go go go!

155
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:54,870
(laughing)

156
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,703
The boys are getting
some time in the arcade.

157
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,405
Sounds like Ghostbusters, huh?

158
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:00,238
Yeah!

159
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:01,744
Oh no there's aliens!

160
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:04,629
Boogie Patrol, Alien Boogie
Patrol is what they call it.

161
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,039
I guess it's because they look
like, are they alien boogers?

162
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,872
Yeah.

163
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:09,973
- [Bryan] Ohh, that's so funny, huh?

164
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,973
They're alien boogers.

165
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:14,062
- [Bryan] Yeah.

166
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:16,479
(calm music)

167
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:21,017
We're at Christmas Tree Lane.

168
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:25,120
- [Bryan] That's right we are
here at Christmas Tree Lane.

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,021
Look at all these amazing Christmas trees.

170
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,219
Look, candy.

171
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:29,806
Oh that's so cool, that one's decorated

172
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,639
in all candy, huh?

173
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,235
So we are at the Christmas
Tree Lane and what that is

174
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:36,867
is basically people decorate
a bunch of different trees.

175
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,315
We have twenty trees all decorated.

176
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,436
You donate, and you get
tickets and then you.

177
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,042
Yeah, we're donating
to a really cool cause.

178
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:46,558
Because they help build homes
for people who don't have

179
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:47,410
anywhere to live.

180
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,455
- [Bryan] Got a bunch of tickets.

181
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,242
We have all of our tickets,
and we're gonna stick them

182
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,438
in all the trees that we like,
and we might win one I guess.

183
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:54,765
- [Bryan] Yeah, we might
actually win one of these trees.

184
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:57,515
(cheerful music)

185
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:15,232
Look at that one it's
Beauty and the Beast.

186
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:17,871
And it's got Beast hanging on it even.

187
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,704
That one's so cute, yeah, Cogsworth.

188
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:20,748
Should we put some in here?

189
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:21,581
- [Bryan] Yeah we gotta
donate to this one.

190
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,290
So, this one right here?

191
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,123
Yep.

192
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:26,333
- [Bryan] I can feel it, this
is gonna be our lucky one.

193
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,957
- [Missy] This one is
going in your room, Ollie.

194
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:31,334
- [Bryan] If we win it,
it's going in Ollie's room?

195
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,228
There's a Star Wars one.

196
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:34,061
- [Bryan] There is?

197
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:34,894
Look it!

198
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,627
- [Bryan] Whoa!

199
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:37,818
I would go with that one.

200
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:39,561
- [Bryan] That one is really cool, huh?

201
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:40,466
- [Missy] Should we put a few in here?

202
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,467
- [Bryan] Definitely.

203
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:42,403
Here you go.

204
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:45,153
(cheerful music)

205
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:51,557
- [Bryan] Look at this Star
Wars tree, that is so cool.

206
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:55,303
And very like simple, and
impressive, I like it.

207
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:58,041
Look at the mask is all lit up too.

208
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,409
I like the space ship.

209
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,810
(yelling)

210
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,560
(cheerful music)

211
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,391
All right Ollie, we put
all of our tickets in, huh?

212
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:17,380
Yeah, I hope we won.

213
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,683
I hope we win one too, that
would be so cool huh Finn?

214
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,390
- [Missy] You wanna win one, Finn?

215
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,223
Yeah.

216
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:32,173
All right, I am living it
up with the boys in style.

217
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:36,893
Missy and I hunted for this
double cart, oh, it's turning.

218
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:37,881
- [Missy] Oh, shoot.

219
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:39,798
Okay, Missy has completely
lost control of the cart now.

220
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,049
We're just gonna go like this now.

221
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,835
I was like "oh is this
a seat for me, too?"

222
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:45,302
No, Daddy can't sit there.

223
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:46,254
No.

224
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:47,618
- [Bryan] He's silly huh?

225
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,451
Yeah.

226
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,327
Last stop of the day and I am exhausted.

227
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:53,285
I'm seriously about to fall
asleep, but we need things.

228
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,894
Me too, and Ollie, he's like
"Mama, I'm just so tired."

229
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:58,784
- [Bryan] Join the club bro.

230
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:01,367
(upbeat music)

231
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:06,386
How's the chocolate milk boys?

232
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:07,219
Good.

233
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:08,101
You drink it.

234
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:08,993
- [Bryan] You want me to try?

235
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:09,962
- [Missy] It looks really good.

236
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:11,371
I will happily try your chocolate milk.

237
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,583
No.

238
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,517
Mmm it's so yummy, I got

239
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:16,965
a peppermint hot chocolate, cheers!

240
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:17,966
- [Missy] Cheers.

241
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:18,799
Cheers.

242
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,632
- [Bryan] Cheers Finn.

243
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:21,215
Cheers, too slow.

244
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:26,363
Hey guys, so we have something
to tell you, I messed up.

245
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:28,364
We messed up.

246
00:09:28,364 --> 00:09:29,197
Yeah.

247
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:33,806
We just got back from a
very busy crazy fun day.

248
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,727
We had a really a really
cool day, and we had to

249
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,591
go shopping at Target cause
we had to get a ton of things

250
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,834
for a little dinner party
we're throwing tomorrow night.

251
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:44,242
I got home, asked where
the camera was, and.

252
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,393
And I was like "Where is the camera?"

253
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:50,345
Yeah, so if you guys don't
know, I'm vlogging on an old

254
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:53,839
camera right now that I had in my office.

255
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,207
All the footage that
we shot today is gone.

256
00:09:57,207 --> 00:10:00,660
It's gone and I'm, I don't,
I don't have hopes that

257
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,572
we're gonna get it back.

258
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,769
Um, that's kind of just who I am.

259
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,949
I know the world we live in today.

260
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:06,931
Well, and I'm always.

261
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:10,533
I thought I would just let
Missy explain what happened.

262
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,905
I'm gonna let you explain.

263
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,634
Okay, well, we went shopping,
and like I, I think I had

264
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:16,842
even talked about, we
used that double cart like

265
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:17,811
stroller thing.

266
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:19,866
The camera was just like
sitting right there, and when

267
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,908
we left, the kids were
being kind of crazy.

268
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:23,914
So I was like "Hey Bryan,
I'm just gonna take the kids

269
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,279
"and go put them in the car".

270
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,134
- [Bryan] While I was checking out.

271
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:27,200
While he was checking out, yeah.

272
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,142
So I was like bagging groceries
and checking out, putting

273
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:30,975
them in the cart.

274
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:31,929
Yeah, so I put the kids
in the car and I was just

275
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,781
waiting in the car while
Bryan got to the car.

276
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:37,518
He finally got to the
car, unloaded the cart,

277
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:40,800
and then put the cart away
and then um, got in the car

278
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,384
and we drove home, so.

279
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:44,295
- [Bryan] The camera is still in the cart.

280
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,358
The camera's gotta be
still in the cart unless.

281
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:48,469
Or someone saw it and grabbed
it and and picked it up.

282
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,563
Someone took it, but the
problem is that I've called.

283
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,086
- [Bryan] Yeah so we called
Target and what did they say?

284
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,104
Well I've waited like on the phone forever

285
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:57,753
like tossing us back and forth

286
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:58,905
and they're like "it
hasn't been turned in yet."

287
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:01,201
I was like "I know it's in a
cart, could you just go look?"

288
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,158
And they went and looked, and basically

289
00:11:03,158 --> 00:11:05,585
they were like "it's not there."

290
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:07,041
And so now I'm starting to feel

291
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,246
like maybe someone did take it.

292
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:09,079
- [Bryan] Yeah.

293
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,453
Like if they checked and it's
not there I don't know what

294
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:14,922
else to do but luckily my
dad is in the area right now

295
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:16,330
so he's gonna go look for us.

296
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,653
So there's still a little
tiny bit of hope that maybe.

297
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:19,613
- [Bryan] Yeah.

298
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,426
They're gonna find it but
I don't know for sure.

299
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:22,726
- [Bryan] 'Cause you lost it!

300
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:23,639
I didn't lose.

301
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,472
(Bryan laughing)

302
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:27,470
I took the kids, you
unloaded the cart, I mean.

303
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,332
Why didn't you tell me you that

304
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:30,906
you had the camera hidden the cart?

305
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:31,739
I didn't know it was there.

306
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:33,428
It wasn't hidden in the
cart, it was right where your

307
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,083
hands go, it was right there.

308
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,616
Come on, it was totally your fault babe.

309
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:37,605
Just own up to this one.

310
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:38,778
Is that, okay I.

311
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:39,912
Do you remember the last time we left a.

312
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:40,833
It is always my fault.

313
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,128
Do you remember the last
time we left a camera in the

314
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:44,009
cart, who's fault was that?

315
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:48,176
Um, that was mine, but this
one, you should have looked.

316
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:51,328
It was in there and you're
just always in charge of

317
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,711
the camera you just gotta make sure.

318
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:57,022
Okay but I will say this, we
have vlogged for five years.

319
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:57,855
Five years, now.

320
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,307
Almost five years now and we've

321
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:02,079
never lost a camera like officially.

322
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,912
Yeah.

323
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:06,147
I don't know if this is going
to be the official time but

324
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:08,063
like I can't believe how good we have.

325
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,148
It hasn't happened yet.

326
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:12,240
There was the worst time, was
when I left it at the beach.

327
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,073
And you had to head back.

328
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:13,956
Yeah, and I had to drive like an hour

329
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:14,986
and a half to go get it.

330
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,380
You had to drive an hour and
a half to go back and get it.

331
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,030
And that was my fault too.

332
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,911
Okay, after hearing that
who's fault do you guys think

333
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,708
it is, let us know in
the comments down below.

334
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,464
And we'll have a fun little
fight about that later.

335
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:25,662
I will say I should have told

336
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,800
you where it was in the cart.

337
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,633
He didn't know where it was.

338
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:32,259
Yes, and I should have told you to.

339
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,401
Make sure I had the camera?

340
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,362
Make sure you had the camera.

341
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:36,945
(upbeat music)

342
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,314
Hey, is that Missy's camera?

343
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:49,722
Missy, is this your camera,
I don't wanna take somebody

344
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:52,529
else's camera that they left
here in a shopping cart.

345
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:53,748
I'm pretty sure it's yours.

346
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:57,145
Okay, I'm just gonna
assume it's yours, okay?

347
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:58,848
Sorry little buddy, I know you wanna

348
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,832
live here at Target but you can't.

349
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:02,435
- [Missy] Dad!

350
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:03,751
- [Bryan] Hey nice camera you got there.

351
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:04,584
Yeah, just got it.

352
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,624
- [Missy] Did you steal our camera?

353
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:09,136
They had a sale at Target,
a big parking lot sale.

354
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,914
Wow, I got my own camera.

355
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:12,186
- [Missy] It was there?

356
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:13,019
Yeah.

357
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:13,852
- [Bryan] It was in the cart?

358
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:15,683
It was just sitting there.

359
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:17,084
Right where we, right where you left it!

360
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:20,003
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, you left it there!

361
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:21,546
I'd have done the same thing.

362
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:23,841
We all know you would have
done the same thing because

363
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,960
you and this young lady
are the same person.

364
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,613
We put 100 percent into
each thing we're doing.

365
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:29,492
- [Missy] Yes!

366
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:30,617
Like we're putting the
kids in the car, I'd have.

367
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:32,792
- [Missy] That's what I'm doing.

368
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,567
Oh my gosh, I'm honestly
surprised no one took it.

369
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,985
There is a two minute clip
of my big toe in there, so.

370
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,289
I don't know if you wanna
put that on the vlog.

371
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,334
- [Missy] Why is your big toe?

372
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,950
A close up shot of my big toe.

373
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,802
I'll make it the title and thumbnail.

374
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:47,260
And since I found the camera
I would like that to be on

375
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,603
the vlog, it's a good looking big toe.

376
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:50,452
I'm actually a little upset

377
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:52,178
that Target said they looked for it.

378
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,474
It was right there when you walked by.

379
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:54,307
- [Missy] It was right there?

380
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,368
'Cause the other carts can't push

381
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,440
into it so it kinda sits there by itself.

382
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,758
I don't get why they
said like they looked.

383
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:02,302
We found it, okay we still
are on a good streak.

384
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:03,678
Still haven't lost any cameras officially.

385
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:04,511
I can't believe we haven't.

386
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,412
That could have been the whole
vlog this last two minutes.

387
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,120
- [Missy] I know.

388
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,136
Ollie, guess what?

389
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:09,969
What?

390
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:11,182
Papa found the camera!

391
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:12,015
Wow.

392
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:12,848
- [Missy] Did you know it was lost?

393
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:13,681
Yeah.

394
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:14,945
Did you know that Mommy and
Daddy were stressed out of

395
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,989
their minds for like an hour and a half?

396
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,198
Say thank you Papa.

397
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:20,017
Thank you Papa.

398
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:21,013
- [Missy] Thanks Dad.

399
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:24,043
Thumbs up for getting
our camera back you guys.

400
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:27,427
I'm so relieved that we did not lose

401
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:31,174
this footage because it is so cute.

402
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:34,948
All right, let's just show
you what we were up to today.

403
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,706
- [Missy] Good morning Ollie.

404
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:37,956
Morning.

405
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:40,047
- [Missy] Are you ready for school?

406
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,296
Yeah.

407
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,879
(upbeat music)

408
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,021
And then we're back at the start.

409
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,178
How cool is that you guys?

410
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:58,126
Um, today was a crazy day.

411
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,922
It was a fun day but honestly all

412
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:02,553
our days are crazy and
fun I absolutely love it.

413
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,964
