1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,213
- I thought, as a
family, we would sit down

2
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:05,553
with all our pumpkin
spice-flavored things,

3
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:09,022
and we would do a little
pumpkin spice challenge.

4
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:10,064
- What is this?

5
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:11,726
- That tastes like-
- Cardboard again?

6
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:13,964
- Paper? (Missy laughs)

7
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,245
Not good.
- Like, maybe-

8
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:17,104
- You can't pumpkin spice
everything, you guys.

9
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,414
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

10
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:21,706
♫ This is who we are

11
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:24,190
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,502
♫ Shot among the stars

13
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:28,773
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

14
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:31,153
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

15
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:33,395
♫ This is our life

16
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:37,364
♫ Let's live it, live it forever

17
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:39,447
- Good Morning!
- Morning!

18
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,369
- [Missy] Is it morning time, boys?

19
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:43,233
- Yeah!

20
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:46,673
- No, it's lunch time! (laughs)

21
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:49,457
Me and the boys are on
a little lunch date.

22
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:50,543
Daddy's still not feeling good today,

23
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:52,117
so I am taking the boys out.

24
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:53,873
We have to go do a little
bit of grocery shopping,

25
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:56,217
but other than that, we
might go somewhere fun.

26
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:58,681
- We are going to the bouncy park today!

27
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,506
- He really wants to
go to the bouncy park.

28
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,825
I think he's trying to solidify it by

29
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:04,852
putting it in the vlog because he thinks

30
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:07,072
if we say it, then it's
definitely happening,

31
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,704
but that's not necessarily true.

32
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,808
We'll see, we might go to the park, okay?

33
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:12,555
- Aghh!
- Aghh!

34
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:13,697
As planned, it worked.

35
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:16,634
These boys, they're so cute.

36
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:18,711
- We're at the fun playground!

37
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,444
- [Missy] Whoo, have you
ever been here before?

38
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:22,976
- No.
- No, are you excited?

39
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:24,930
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and what's Fin doing?

40
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,973
- Hm, Fin's just looking at me.

41
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:29,732
- He's awake! (laughs)

42
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:31,226
And guess who's with us?

43
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:32,633
Uncle!

44
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,890
Since Brian is sick today, I thought

45
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,200
let's go have some fun at the playground,

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,496
and I thought I'd drag
along my brother. (laughs)

47
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,295
Fun little time to hang out, and the

48
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,964
extra help is always nice, 'cause places

49
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:46,112
like this, your kids just
tend to go in opposite

50
00:01:46,112 --> 00:01:48,388
directions, and you're only one person.

51
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:49,477
We're just gonna run out, run around

52
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,908
for a little bit, and then, we gotta

53
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:52,954
actually get home pretty soon.

54
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:55,704
So, let's go have some fun, 'kay?

55
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:59,790
So yeah, this brand new place opened up,

56
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,270
and this is the first time we're going in.

57
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,574
I don't think it's been open very long.

58
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:04,738
So, we're excited to check it out, huh?

59
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:05,905
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

60
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,913
(upbeat pop music)

61
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,002
Oh my goodness, this is the coolest thing.

62
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:20,009
We've never had anything like this

63
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,798
where we live in our area.

64
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:23,131
This is so neat!

65
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,962
(upbeat pop music)

66
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,461
Oh my goodness, they're so cute!

67
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:36,688
Oh my gosh, you're so strong, Ollie!

68
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:37,521
- Yeah!

69
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:41,217
- [Missy] Whoo! (laughs)

70
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:42,300
And he's off.

71
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:44,649
Whoo!

72
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:49,443
- [Jimmy] You're really going fast.

73
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:53,265
- [Missy] Oh my gosh! (laughs)

74
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:54,098
Ah!

75
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:05,110
(upbeat pop music)

76
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,926
And they're off again.

77
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:17,759
Whoo!

78
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,022
Whoo hoo hoo!

79
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:23,913
Are you having fun?

80
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,327
Whoa, whoa!

82
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,959
This place is so cool, but I cannot even

83
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,368
keep up with Ollie, I can
only keep up with Fin,

84
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:38,880
and there he goes again,
and it is warm up here.

85
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,059
I can't even see Ollie,
I better go find him.

86
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,741
Oh my gosh, that place
was so fun, huh, Ollie?

87
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:45,705
- Yeah!
- Yeah, um, I feel like

88
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,241
we barely scratched the surface.

89
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:50,310
There was so much to do, we just, like,

90
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,711
were there for, like, maybe 30 minutes.

91
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,978
- 45.
- 40, maybe 40 minutes.

92
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,701
But it was really fun, I'm actually

93
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,792
really excited to go
there, like, more often.

94
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,022
I think the kids are
gonna love playing there.

95
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:04,467
So much fun activities,
like learning things,

96
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:05,983
like, oh, I just loved it.

97
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,159
So, we're off now, though.

98
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,539
We'll definitely hang out
there more often though.

99
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,208
'Kay, Ollie?
- Yeah.

100
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,231
- Well, hello, guys.

101
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:15,620
I have been a little MIA for a while.

102
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,939
Definitely feeling just under the weather,

103
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,017
which definitely sucks,
but I wanted to show you

104
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:24,231
guys that our fish tank
is all clear, finally!

105
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,961
Check that out, it did a really good job.

106
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:29,298
He'd said it would take a
couple of days, possibly.

107
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:33,042
So, got all our live rock
in there, our live sand.

108
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,781
So far, everything is
running really smooth.

109
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,130
So, the tank is basically, like,

110
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,310
acclimating itself right now.

111
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,260
And then, in a couple
days, we'll be able to add

112
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,206
our first fish, and
then, in a couple weeks,

113
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:45,051
we'll be able to, like, start adding

114
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,829
our own coral and anemone and stuff,

115
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,213
which is gonna be really, really cool.

116
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:50,137
And possibly, like, we'll post things

117
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:51,952
on Twitter, like, with pictures as we're

118
00:04:51,952 --> 00:04:53,360
shopping, like, which ones you guys

119
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,730
think we should have in the tank.

120
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,050
'Cause there's a lot of different, like,

121
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,750
colors and variations
you can play around with,

122
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,266
but I'm really excited that we finally

123
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,450
got a fish tank, a real fish tank set up.

124
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,997
I've been wanting one of these forever.

125
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:06,114
So, it's just really cool that we

126
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:07,618
get to do this as a family now.

127
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:08,500
And for those of you who don't

128
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,237
follow me on Instagram,
this is the kind of

129
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,336
magic that you're missing out on.

130
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:15,363
Using emojis, little mermaid music.

131
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,542
I like to post on my Instagram

132
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,871
how things are going, kind of like

133
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:19,182
behind the scenes and stuff.

134
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:20,658
So, make sure you guys
follow me on Instagram

135
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:23,741
so you don't miss out on all the fun.

136
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:29,064
(folksy music)

137
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:34,482
- All right, kiddos.
(drum rolls with hands)

138
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:35,831
Over the past couple of days,

139
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,595
we have acquired a very large amount

140
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:41,012
of pumpkin spice items.
- Ooh!

141
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,778
- There's lots and lots of crazy

142
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,466
pumpkin-y treasures this time of year.

143
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,311
Look at that! (Missy laughs)

144
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:50,702
I thought-
- That looks good!

145
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:52,403
- As a family, we would sit down

146
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:55,464
with all our pumpkin
spice-flavored things,

147
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,827
and we would do a little
pumpkin spice challenge.

148
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:59,411
What do you boys say,
does that sound good?

149
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:00,559
- Yeah!
- Halloween!

150
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,834
- Halloween!
- I put my Pumpkin Spice

151
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,252
Everything shirt on-
- Oh yeah!

152
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:06,748
- For this video.
- Nice!

153
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:08,403
By the end of this video,
we'll probably all be

154
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:11,415
like little round, orange
pumpkins bopping along.

155
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:13,963
Okay, let's see what we
got in our bag of tricks.

156
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,202
So, the first thing we're gonna start

157
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,859
is actually one for Fin.

158
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:19,522
This is Happy Baby Organics, and it's

159
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:21,515
apples, pumpkin, and carrots, and it's

160
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,886
a baby food, obviously,
we're starting easy.

161
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:24,993
- He picked it out first, so let's

162
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:25,972
see what he thinks.
- Yeah!

163
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:26,805
Ooh.

164
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,804
Take a bite.

165
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,643
- How is it?
- Buh.

166
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:31,992
- Buh! (Missy laughs)

167
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,165
Buh, that is his reaction.
- Does buh mean good?

168
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,471
I think he liked it.

169
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:37,093
- We'll put a little on here.

170
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:41,075
It's very orange, it's
all very orange, you guys.

171
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:42,990
- Yummy?
- Yeah, it's a little weird.

172
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,992
Definitely a little weird.

173
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,217
- What's the next one?

174
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:49,666
- For the next one, how
about pumpkin spice Cheerios?

175
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,965
- These actually sound pretty good.

176
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:52,806
- I know, I love Cheerios, it's

177
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:55,029
such a good, classic breakfast.

178
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,992
The whole pumpkin spice thing

179
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:56,825
might be screwing it up.

180
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,597
Ooh, it's very ...
- Is it very?

181
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:00,692
- It's like super spicy,
smell it, you guys.

182
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:02,397
(Cheerios rattle) Smell
it, you smell that?

183
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:03,230
Smell it.
- I'll smell it.

184
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,063
- [Oliver] I wanna smell, I wanna smell.

185
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:05,531
Ooh, that actually smells really good.

186
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:06,980
- Smells yummy, 'kay, try it.

187
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,147
Here, try some, boys, mmm.

188
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,258
- Mmm.

189
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:13,017
- Mmm.
- I like it!

190
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,701
- Fin likes it, too!
- Mmm!

191
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,592
- Do you like it, Ollie?

192
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:18,405
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, Ollie likes it, too!

193
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,733
Fin likes it.
- That was a good one.

194
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,308
Okay, pumpkin pie, that's what

195
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,996
you eat in the morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

196
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:25,375
(Fin babbles) What's next, you say?

197
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:29,542
Well, how about some pumpkin
spice-flavored ice cream?

198
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,024
That's right, nothing is safe

199
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:34,789
this holiday season, you guys.

200
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,343
They are going to pumpkin
spice everything, and

201
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,055
you kind of just have to
accept it at this point.

202
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,363
So, let's open this up,
see what it looks like.

203
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,968
Yeah, it's actually pumpkin
pie-flavored ice cream,

204
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:45,674
and it's not as, like, dark orange.

205
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,075
It's actually, like, a little white.

206
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,537
- It's got whipped cream,
like, swirls in it, I believe.

207
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:50,913
- All right, you want to try it, boys?

208
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:53,460
Take a bite, Fin, mmm.

209
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,535
- How is it, Fin?

210
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:55,764
It's like vanilla ice cream.

211
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:57,312
- It does taste like pumpkin pie.

212
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:59,062
You can actually taste the whipped cream.

213
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,885
- Mmm!
- It's not bad, huh?

214
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,440
- It's actually pretty
good. (Bryan laughs)

215
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,540
- Pumpkin spice ice cream, you guys-

216
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,525
- It doesn't have as-
- That's crazy.

217
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,430
- Much of a spicy flavor, I feel like.

218
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,339
- What's next?

219
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,998
- What's next, you ask?

220
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,706
How about pumpkin cookies?

221
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:14,539
- Yum!

222
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,321
- Who wants to try a pumpkin cookie?

223
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:20,237
It's pumpkin chocolate chip cookies.

224
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:21,509
- You want a chocolate chip cookie?

225
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:22,945
- Yes.
- All right.

226
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:26,452
There's one for you, there's one for you.

227
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:27,956
There's one for you.

228
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:30,480
Pumpkin cookie, this actually kind of

229
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,464
makes sense 'cause pumpkin and

230
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:35,241
chocolate chip is, like, really good.

231
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,274
That is not good.
- Ew!

232
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,754
Why does it taste like cardboard?

233
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:40,701
- It is not good. (Missy laughs)

234
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:41,996
I like pumpkin cookies, but those are-

235
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,783
- No, you eat it, do you like it?

236
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,184
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but

237
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:46,556
you don't want to eat it?

238
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:48,254
- Do you like it, Ollie?
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:51,470
- Ollie likes it.
- Ollie likes it. (laughs)

240
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,141
- Okay, so the pumpkin
cookies were a bust.

241
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,485
I was actually kind of betting on those.

242
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:55,953
Um, but up next, I think something that's

243
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,786
gonna be really delicious, donuts!

244
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:03,467
These are old-fashioned glazed donuts,

245
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,896
pumpkin spice-flavored.

246
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:07,555
- I think these are gonna be good!

247
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:09,304
- Are they just regular donuts?

248
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:11,023
- Yes, they are regular donuts.

249
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:12,726
All right, have a regular donut!

250
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,048
They're like a really
cool shade of orange, too.

251
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:15,939
Here you go, Fin.

252
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:16,980
- Me and Fin can share.
- Look at how

253
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,596
orange they are. (laughs)

254
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,014
- I'm not a huge donut fan.

255
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:21,268
- I like them!
- Oh my goodness!

256
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,634
You like it?
- Mm-hmm. (Fin babbles)

257
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,130
- That is really good, you guys.

258
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,595
- These are really good.
- Yeah!

259
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:28,403
- I don't really taste much
of the pumpkin, do you?

260
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,576
- Yeah, it's a little spicy, not too much.

261
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:31,926
- Yeah, it's really good.

262
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:33,392
- Those are a win.
- We got a good one!

263
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:35,146
- Yay!
- All right, Fin,

264
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:37,512
next up, I have another one for you.

265
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:40,417
Like I said, no food is
safe, even baby food.

266
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:43,229
They're gonna pumpkin
spice all the baby food.

267
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:44,989
They're gonna pumpkin spice the milk.

268
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,845
They're gonna pumpkin spice the eggs.

269
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,906
They're just gonna put pumpkin
spice in everything, huh?

270
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,816
- There is pumpkin spice
milk, I did see that.

271
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:51,649
- Are you serious?

272
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:52,594
- Yeah, I didn't buy
it, 'cause I was like-

273
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,449
- Oh my gosh.
- Ewww.

274
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,866
- All right, these are Mighty Snack Bars,

275
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,960
and they're actually pumpkin banana.

276
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,972
What do you think, Fin?

277
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:00,805
- Gah!

278
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:01,882
- Good?
- Good?

279
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:02,715
- Gah!

280
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,406
- Yay!
- Yay!

281
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,443
- Awesome, so the plum pumpkin

282
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:07,976
snack bars, that's a win.

283
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:12,297
All right, next up, I have pumpkin butter-

284
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:13,172
- Ooh!
- Which I'm actually

285
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,013
really excited about this.

286
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,095
My mom used to make this every fall,

287
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,389
and she would jar it all up, and we'd

288
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:18,981
eat it for, like, the whole season.

289
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:21,605
And it's basically,
like, a pumpkin spread.

290
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:24,214
You put it on, like,
bagels or, like, toast

291
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:25,942
with butter and pumpkin butter.

292
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:28,034
So, it really looks quite appetizing,

293
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,898
as you can tell. (laughs)

294
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:31,315
It's interesting.

295
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,223
Ooh.

296
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:35,400
- Spicy?

297
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,003
- It's really spicy, does it have-

298
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,010
- I feel like I can-
- The apples in it?

299
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,993
- Smell it from here.

300
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:39,895
- Doesn't have apple.
- Is it like a

301
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:41,055
weird texture, too?

302
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:42,816
- Yeah, it's a really weird texture.

303
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,764
That's a weird one, for sure.

304
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:45,743
- Smell, it kind of-
- It might be good on,

305
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:47,052
uh, like, toast.

306
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:48,826
- It kind of has a baby food texture.

307
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,181
- Yeah, it really does.

308
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:53,102
- I'm sure there's better
pumpkin butters out there.

309
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:54,400
- Yeah, the kind my mom used to

310
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,003
make is a lot better than that.

311
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:58,145
All right, next up, we have belVita

312
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,677
pumpkin spice crackers.
- I'm interested.

313
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:02,178
- Are these sweet, are they spicy?

314
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,559
I'm so confused, so let's
open these up and try them.

315
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,678
Oh, look at that, they
look like harvest crackers.

316
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:09,794
That's interesting.

317
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,421
Fin's our little taste-tester.

318
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,382
Ollie, you wanna try a cracker, no?

319
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,383
- They're like a graham cracker.

320
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:18,329
- He's still eating that nasty cookie.

321
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,579
- What is this?

322
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,430
- That tastes like-
- Cardboard again?

323
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,652
- Paper? (Missy laughs)

324
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:25,529
- Not good.

325
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:26,592
- You can't pumpkin spice-
- Like, maybe-

326
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:27,498
- Everything, you guys. (Oliver coughs)

327
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:28,562
- Maybe if you were, like, drinking,

328
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,036
like, a pumpkin spice
coffee. (Oliver coughs)

329
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:30,869
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:31,702
- Like, this would be good.

331
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:35,439
- Which leaves us pumpkin
spice biscotti, which,

332
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:37,487
um, I bet is actually
really good in coffee.

333
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:39,965
I like biscotti in my coffee-
- But you can have it.

334
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,940
- But I might try this
one just plain on its own.

335
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,435
It looks like a normal
biscotti, but it has,

336
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,906
like, a pumpkin glaze on it.

337
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,225
Mm, that's really good.

338
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:49,024
That's, like, a better pumpkin cookie

339
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,047
than the actual pumpkin cookie.

340
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:53,144
- Yeah, the top stuff is good.

341
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:53,977
- Yeah.

342
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:56,174
All right, Missy is going to try

343
00:11:56,174 --> 00:12:00,181
the Reese's pumpkin peanut butter candy.

344
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:01,110
- I originally thought this was

345
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,471
peanut butter pumpkin
flavor, but it's not.

346
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:04,404
- Oh, it's not?

347
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,485
- I don't know.
- Just try it, let's see.

348
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:08,159
- At first, I thought
it was, but let's see.

349
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,242
It's white?

350
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:10,811
This isn't a Reese's!

351
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:11,867
So, it's a pumpkin.

352
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:14,428
- Oh, it's pumpkin-shaped,
that's cheating.

353
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:16,984
(Missy laughs) Okay, take a bite.

354
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,307
Is it even orange inside?

355
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:21,046
Well, I guess it's
peanut butter-y. (laughs)

356
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:22,639
- It's definitely not pumpkin flavor,

357
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,193
but the white is not as good as the dark.

358
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,857
- Yeah, of Reese's?
- Yeah.

359
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:29,683
- So that was our, uh, pumpkin
spice taste test challenge.

360
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,760
We did pretty good, there
was some cool products on it.

361
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,697
- I know, the ice cream-
- Some weird ones.

362
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:34,089
- Was pretty good.
- Yeah, some

363
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,026
other weird ones, too, though. (laughs)

364
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,658
Let us down below, though, the craziest

365
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,590
thing that you have ever seen

366
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,332
with a pumpkin spice flavor, or what

367
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:44,727
pumpkin spice thing you
think we should try next.

368
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:45,818
Good job, boys!

369
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,133
- Yeah, that was fun, huh?

370
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,056
Did you like trying all the pumpkin stuff?

371
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,896
- Yeah, I do like the donuts.

372
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,116
- [Bryan] You do like the donuts?

373
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:55,386
(laughs) He's sneaking donuts.

374
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:59,440
Oh my gosh, you guys, look at
my cute little package-getter.

375
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,742
Thanks, buddy!

376
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:01,859
- You're welcome.

377
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:04,501
- You're such a good
boy, I love you. (laughs)

378
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:05,567
It's actually quite convenient

379
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,338
that a lot of my equipment, when it comes,

380
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,782
they drop it off right
here, near my office door,

381
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:12,529
but the boys are always so excited

382
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,131
to bring in packages and stuff.

383
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,268
It's been really cute.

384
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:18,468
It's seriously such a
beautiful day, you guys.

385
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:19,385
Oh my gosh.

386
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:27,020
(peaceful acoustic guitar music)

387
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,066
(record scratch)

388
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:36,399
(epic orchestral music)

389
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,125
We got a couple of Batmans.

390
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,863
- [Missy] Fin, say, "I'm Batman!"

391
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:46,568
- No, I'm Batman!

392
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:49,064
- I think you're both Batman. (laughs)

393
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:50,786
Cool pajamas, bro.

394
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,245
It's calendar time.

395
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,295
We gotta grab some candy from

396
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,218
our local skeleton.
- Me, me, me, me!

397
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:57,565
- Gotta get it from the number two.

398
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:58,783
You know where the number two is?

399
00:13:58,783 --> 00:13:59,944
- Is this one right?

400
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:01,146
- Nope, it's up at the top.

401
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:02,534
- That is a two, but that's 12.

402
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:04,512
There you go!
- Good job!

403
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:06,592
- Now you guys get yo candy.

404
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:09,746
- Ooh ah!
- Happy Halloween, boys!

405
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:10,804
Almost.

406
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:13,483
- Ooh, oh, we got double red.

407
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:14,920
- Double red!

408
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,276
That's good luck, that's good luck.

409
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:17,109
- Yeah.

410
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:24,572
(peaceful acoustic music)

411
00:14:35,970 --> 00:00:00,000
(electropop music)
