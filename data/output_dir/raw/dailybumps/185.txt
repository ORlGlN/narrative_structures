1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:03,113
- There was one thing though (laughs)

2
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:05,918
that kind of stopped our photo shoot,

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,798
which was, the fire department showed up.

4
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:11,423
(sirens wailing)

5
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:12,699
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:13,532
♫ This is our life

7
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:14,519
♫ This is our fun

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,934
♫ This is who we are

9
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,086
♫ This is our dream

10
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:19,340
♫ This is our team

11
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,811
♫ Shot among the stars

12
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,122
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

13
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:27,092
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

14
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,779
♫ This is our life

15
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,700
♫ Let's live it

16
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,703
♫ Live it forever.

17
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:33,585
- Good morning

18
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:35,335
- Good morning, guys.

19
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,547
- What happened to your face?

20
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:39,650
- My face?

21
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,316
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

22
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:42,348
Doesn't seem different to me.

23
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:43,336
- Black.

24
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:46,511
- (laughs) Daddy has a mask on.

25
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:47,853
Hello, guys.

26
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:50,278
So, this morning we are actually doing

27
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:52,253
an all-day family photo shoot,

28
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,316
'cause we have a special project

29
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:54,744
that we really need photos for.

30
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:56,811
Are you excited, take
some cool photos today?

31
00:00:56,811 --> 00:00:58,470
Yeah.

32
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,509
So, yeah I decided to put on

33
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:01,884
this intense purifying mud mask,

34
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:04,560
and it's like really freaking me out.

35
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,829
Missy said she did a
mask this morning, too.

36
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:08,936
- Yep, I did a really cool one.

37
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,526
It almost felt like I was
putting glue on my face.

38
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:11,613
- [Bryan] Oh, interesting.

39
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,981
Hopefully, this will help a little bit.

40
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,788
I don't know, we'll see.
- (laughs) It's like yeah,

41
00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:16,741
it's pretty cool.

42
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,574
(Finn hollering)

43
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:19,345
(Bryan hollering)

44
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,778
- Finn, what do you think of daddy's face?

45
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:21,644
(Finn babbles)

46
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:22,477
Is it weird?

47
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:24,143
- Yeah.
(laughs)

48
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,859
- [Bryan] What are you eatin'?

49
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:26,828
Cereal?

50
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:28,494
Awesome, you're such a good eater.

51
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:29,968
- Mommy.

52
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:32,142
- [Bryan] What are you boys doing?

53
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,127
You playing in ball pit balls?

54
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,845
This is always a fun time.

55
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:40,060
We have Brooke and Sean
over shooting some photos.

56
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,573
This is gonna be one of them,

57
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:44,268
the boys covered in ball pit balls.

58
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:45,215
Ollie, wait, wait!

59
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:46,444
Ollie!

60
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:47,834
(laughing)

61
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,809
That's counter productive.

62
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,021
(laughing)

63
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,046
Working with kids, right?

64
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,213
(upbeat techno music)

65
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:07,460
The boys are loving this.

66
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,293
They get to play

67
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:09,425
in ball pit balls
- One, two.

68
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,391
- [Bryan] Glam squad

69
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:12,224
for Missy.

70
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:13,057
- Yeah.

71
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,250
- [Bryan] Getting her face on.

72
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,401
- Pretty much excited

73
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,759
because I had no one this morning

74
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,681
to do my hair.

75
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,514
- And now look!

76
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,909
She's got two girls!

77
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:21,794
You girls are awesome.

78
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:24,337
Thanks for showing up.

79
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:25,450
- I'm actually a lot happy.

80
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,328
I'm really happy

81
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:28,330
'cause I was, like, kind of stressing.

82
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,974
I'm not like that good at doing make-up

83
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:30,807
- Yeah.
- Or my hair.

84
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:31,682
(laughs)

85
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:32,515
- [Bryan] Well, the pictures so far

86
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:34,076
are turning out good, but
we're almost ready for you.

87
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:34,909
- And this just gives me

88
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,022
like a little more confidence look.

89
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:36,855
- Yeah.

90
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:37,989
- You're looking good, baby.

91
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,503
We have so much decor

92
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:41,764
and fun stuff out

93
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:44,387
for the shoot we're doing
for our top-secret project.

94
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:46,001
Shhh! We can't tell you guys yet.

95
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,893
But I do need popsicles for the boys,

96
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,802
because they've been
working so hard today.

97
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,032
I have too, that's why I'm sweating.

98
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:52,391
I've done my hair three
times for the shoot,

99
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,779
and I still haven't even
taken pictures of myself yet.

100
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:57,165
But they boys need some popsicles.

101
00:02:57,165 --> 00:03:00,332
(upbeat techno music)

102
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,643
- [Bryan] Alright, Finn is...

103
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,794
Finn's quite messy (laughs)

104
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:25,958
Because he ate that popsicle,

105
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,831
and Ollie's ready to-- (yells)

106
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:30,014
I just redid my hair for the fourth time.

107
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:33,181
(upbeat techno music)

108
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,965
High five, dude, you did good.

109
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:45,548
Was that fun? Yeah?

110
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,618
We are currently in bed.

111
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:50,896
You know, it's always funny because

112
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,165
we used to film on our bed.

113
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,140
And people would always be like,

114
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,211
"Why do you have a camera
pointed at your bed?"

115
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:59,378
(upbeat techno music)

116
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,365
- Christmas time!

117
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:11,318
- [Bryan] Yes it is!

118
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,463
Or at least we're pretending it is.

119
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,499
(Missy laughs)

120
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,076
Look it, Missy's even got
her reindeer antlers on.

121
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:18,572
The boys are all dressed up.

122
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:20,036
We're shooting some fun photos.

123
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:21,202
Top secret project.

124
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:22,260
We haven't told them yet, have we?

125
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,512
- You haven't told them?
I feel like (mumbles)

126
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:26,646
- Top secret project,
you're never gonna know!

127
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,471
Yeah, so I have to wear
a Christmas sweater.

128
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:30,741
It's summer time in California.

129
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:34,641
So I put it in the freezer
so that it wasn't super hot.

130
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,553
Now it feels amazing.

131
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:38,720
(upbeat techno music)

132
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:52,571
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

133
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,526
- It's not Christmas time,
we're just pretending, huh?

134
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,326
- Hey, it's Christmas
time always in this house.

135
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:58,278
(laughs)

136
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,328
- This is so cool, Missy.

137
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,553
We're like covered in...

138
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:01,418
- I know, I'm like so excited.

139
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,612
- They're like holding
lights (laughs) behind us.

140
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:04,465
- I'm just gonna start
decorating the house

141
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:06,148
for Christmas now.

142
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:07,023
- So beautiful.

143
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:07,870
(Bryan laughs)

144
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,729
Isn't this her jam?

145
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,221
- [Bryan] (laughs) Brooke...

146
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:12,537
Brooke is very excited about this year.

147
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,844
Look how cute she is!

148
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:17,842
Aww. She's got her straw hat.

149
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:18,675
- [Brooke] It's so cute.

150
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:21,225
- [Bryan] Make-up on point. (laughs)

151
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:22,255
- [Brooke] Hair on point.

152
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,340
- [Bryan] We're gonna go
play with some chickens,

153
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,173
and take some photos?

154
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:25,043
- Yep. Ready.

155
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:25,881
- [Bryan] Okay.

156
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:29,224
Yes, our front door is
decorated with fall decorations.

157
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:30,863
Don't judge us though, okay?

158
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,326
We're doing something cool.

159
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:33,555
We're doing something
really cool, you guys.

160
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:35,319
We've been having the funnest day,

161
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,346
the most productive day
we've probably ever had

162
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:41,481
doing these photo shoots, and
now we're doing the last one,

163
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:43,994
which is quite possibly the coolest.

164
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,334
I think you guys are gonna
really enjoy what you see,

165
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:47,669
what comes out of this.

166
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,513
So now, we are walking down the courtyard,

167
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:53,826
and to this pasture
little area, for the dirt.

168
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:55,880
And we're all in white. Kinda ironic.

169
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,046
We're all in white, and we're
hanging out in the dirt.

170
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:01,206
♫ We stand together

171
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:03,963
♫ We protect the keys

172
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,043
♫ This is our life

173
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,266
♫ This is our fun

174
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,677
♫ This is who we are

175
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,510
♫ This is our--

176
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,354
They already listened to that, Missy,

177
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:11,399
because they've seen the intro.

178
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,443
- I know. We love that song.

179
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:15,883
Ollie loves that song, huh?

180
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:17,335
- [Bryan] What's your
favorite part of the song?

181
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,797
- "We have shields"!

182
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:20,469
- Yeah, that is his favorite song.

183
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:22,803
You guys, we're finally done. (laughs)

184
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:25,436
That was the longest day,
but it was so much fun.

185
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:26,440
- It was like a seven-hour shoot.

186
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,273
(Missy exclaims)

187
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,305
- The kids are done.

188
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,380
Finn's probably passed out (laughs).

189
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,376
- He's like, super dead.
- (yawns)

190
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,148
They're probably so confused
why they changed their outfit

191
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,539
like a dozen times.

192
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,932
- Look it, I still have
all of my extensions.

193
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:37,969
My make-up is done.

194
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:40,285
We're starving, we have no food (laughs).

195
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:43,550
The house is a disaster.
- Such a disaster.

196
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,570
- (laughs) So I was like, we're
getting out of this house,

197
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,027
we're gonna go get some food.

198
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,281
We're gonna come back,
put the kids to bed,

199
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,493
and clean up and go to bed.

200
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,871
(laughs) So anyways, yeah,
we're heading to go get food.

201
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,210
But it was a really,
really fun, fun shoot.

202
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,297
We love Brooke.

203
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:59,241
We have a few different
photographers that we use,

204
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,957
and we love Brooke.

205
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:02,687
She's such a cool friend,

206
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:05,244
and she's a really good photographer.

207
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:07,984
There was one thing, though (laughs)

208
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:10,753
that kind of stopped our photo shoot,

209
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:14,038
which was, the fire department showed up.

210
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:16,538
(sirens wail)

211
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:26,577
- You will know why they
were called very soon.

212
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:27,492
- We didn't get in trouble.

213
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:28,661
Everything was totally fine,

214
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,215
and it wasn't a big deal.
- It was really funny.

215
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:32,092
- But it was really funny. (laughs)

216
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,419
We were like, oh no, this is so weird.

217
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,525
And yeah, everything was fine,
but that definitely happened.

218
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,358
(laughs)

219
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,775
Anyways, let's go get dinner.

220
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,084
So we have ended up at Denny's.

221
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:47,033
I don't know why, it just
sounded like good comfort food

222
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,455
after a long day.

223
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:51,072
And look at Finn, he is out.

224
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:52,339
I mean like, so out.

225
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,172
I feel so bad.

226
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,653
We skipped his nap because actually

227
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:57,560
when he naps...
- We actually skipped naps

228
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,800
and we skipped lunch today.

229
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,633
- Yeah, we're starving.

230
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,966
- We worked through lunch.

231
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:02,641
- The kids ate, but we didn't eat.

232
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:05,883
But actually, naps are
great, but Finn does wake up

233
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:07,926
in a worse mood usually, so I was like,

234
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:08,759
let's just skip.

235
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,752
He did really, really good.

236
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:11,485
He's just so out.

237
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:12,547
Look at that face.

238
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:15,939
He never is just still
asleep when you pick him up.

239
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,244
(laughs)

240
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,827
Go give that bacon a high-five.

241
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:24,595
(laughs)

242
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,204
High-five.

243
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:27,924
High-five, bacon, high-five.

244
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,757
(slaps cardboard)

245
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:29,813
Yeah.

246
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:32,239
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, I
got chocolate milk too.

247
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,072
Wanna cheers Daddy?

248
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:35,090
- After I get this rope on here.

249
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,778
- Okay, I mean, priorities, yeah.

250
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:39,152
Okay, cheers? Cheers.

251
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,751
Cheers. Cheers.

252
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,151
To a long, hard day of
work, you guys. (laughs)

253
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:46,050
You earned that chocolate milk, buddy.

254
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,160
- [Missy] (laughs) Boys are getting some

255
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,601
last-minute play time in
before it's bed time. (laughs)

256
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:55,707
(boys chattering, making shooting sounds)

257
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:58,323
Aww, I love you.

258
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:01,655
(Ollie making shooting sounds)

259
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:04,860
(laughs) Oh, hug.

260
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,426
Finn's so cute, he has to
do everything Ollie does.

261
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,303
What's that?

262
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:11,824
- That's my laser eyes.

263
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:13,304
- [Missy] Oooh.

264
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,645
(Finn babbles)

265
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:18,385
(laughs) You got some secret power?

266
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:21,385
(Finn babbles)
(Ollie makes shooting sounds)

267
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:23,881
- They're so cute, I've just
been watching them play.

268
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,420
Oh, they're both on the ground now.

269
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,486
(laughs)

270
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:27,835
They are all ready for bed.

271
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,257
I'm just letting them
play a little bit longer.

272
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:31,219
It's a beautiful night out right now.

273
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:33,852
It's kinda chilly but yet
not too chilly, you know?

274
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:34,840
It's so nice.

275
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,316
We had so much fun today,

276
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:41,329
despite the fire department
showing up at our house.

277
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,595
That was a little weird.

278
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:44,881
But we had a ton of fun.

279
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:46,958
It was a long, long day.

280
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,082
You know, our life is
different and it's kinda crazy,

281
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:52,851
but it's fun, and the kids love it,

282
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,726
and we have fun family time.

283
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:55,559
I did want to tell you guys,

284
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,608
that if you don't know,

285
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:00,197
our new single is out.

286
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:02,302
You can buy it now on iTunes.

287
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,465
And we love it.

288
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:06,095
We literally listen to it
every time we are in the car,

289
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,978
because these boys think it
is the coolest song ever.

290
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:10,157
So if you guys want to check it out,

291
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:11,331
I'll have a link down below.

292
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:13,701
But for now, we're gonna
go ahead and end the video.

293
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:16,220
Time for these boys to go to bed.

294
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,457
These little boys. My little baby boys.

295
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:19,294
And it's time for me to go to bed.

296
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:21,394
I need to wash my face
and get this hair off me.

297
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:22,614
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

298
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:24,367
Make sure you give it a big thumbs up.

299
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,812
Hey boys, thumbs up this video!

300
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:28,377
Yeah!

301
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,974
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

302
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,058
What do you say?

303
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:32,058
- Bye! Boop.

304
00:10:34,107 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat techno music)
