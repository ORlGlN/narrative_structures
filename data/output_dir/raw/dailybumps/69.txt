14
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,650
- Good morning guys,

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,580
apparently I didn't get
the memo this morning,

16
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,747
there was family outfits for
church coordinated prior,

17
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,934
I wasn't able to be involved.

18
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:37,767
- Okay.

19
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,206
- [Bryan] Look at my cute family.

20
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,510
- I looked to see if
there was one your size

21
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,485
and it's just mom.

22
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:43,450
- Aww.

23
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,750
- I think this technically,
I think it's for mom

24
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,450
and daughter, so I was like
these are kind of boyish.

25
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,283
- [Bryan] Yeah.

26
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:50,390
All right, we're at the blue pig,

27
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,270
we're gonna go get
breakfast before church.

28
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,070
You guys are so cute in
your matching sweaters.

29
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,011
You excited to eat some food?

30
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,350
- Yeah.

31
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,474
- Finn what are you going to order?

32
00:00:58,474 --> 00:00:59,830
(babbles)

33
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,190
He's like uhh, this giant pig,

34
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,690
okay let's go buddy, let's go.

35
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,550
You're so cute.

36
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,440
All right we are taking
a seat at our table.

37
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,052
Look Finn, we get to sit on
a couch, isn't that cool?

38
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:13,188
(laughing)

39
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:14,271
- Guys, look.

40
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,230
- [Bryan] Is someone
out there doing stuff?

41
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,920
We have this amazing view
of a beautiful golf course,

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,757
it's like such a beautiful day.

43
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:21,920
- [Ollie] I know how to do that.

44
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
- [Bryan] Oh you do?

45
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,930
What Finn? (laughing)

46
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,310
Finn's just always copying
everything Ollie does.

47
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,420
We've got people golfing over here,

48
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,560
and the boys are loving it.

49
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,210
They are like, why are
they hitting that ball?

50
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,970
Should we go golfing someday Ollie?

51
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,803
- Yeah.

52
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:39,661
- Me and you?

53
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,244
(upbeat music)

54
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,630
Babe our kids are so funny.

55
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,190
- I know, they like do
everything that they pick up.

56
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,865
- Yeah, Finn has to copy
everything Ollie does,

57
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:53,640
it's so hilarious.
- I literally tell Ollie,

58
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,680
don't do that and then he'll
do something else don't do that

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,210
and then Ollie, the same
thing, he'll do the two things.

60
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,500
- [Bryan] Finn the same thing, yeah.

61
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,474
Are you drinking chocolate
milk and water together?

62
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:04,970
(laughing)

63
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,024
Finn's like, this is kind of weird.

64
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:09,607
(upbeat music)

65
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,480
So we just got done eating breakfast,

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,430
and I think it's so cool,

67
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,680
because outside of the restaurant

68
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,420
they have these huge troughs,

69
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,540
and they're growing herbs

70
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,950
that they use in the actual kitchen,

71
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,330
which I think is so cool!

72
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,936
Look at all these greens
and herbs they use.

73
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:26,800
Look you guys,

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,470
over here they're growing
oregano and rosemary.

75
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,953
That is cool.

76
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:33,786
(babbling)

77
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,670
You want to see?

78
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,220
- Yeah.
- Yeah look.

79
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,930
They're growing stuff for
the kitchen, it's cool!

80
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,850
All right we're all done with church

81
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,260
and we're hanging out with our friends,

82
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,190
Jude and Joelle, and they have a kitty!

83
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,610
- And we also have a PlayStation VR,

84
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,160
if you've never heard of
this, make sure to buy one,

85
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,260
because they're sick.

86
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,480
- [Bryan] So we are
checking out their cats,

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,770
this one is peacing
out, it's like okay bye.

88
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,700
- Maymay, she's a rescue,
her mommy abandoned her,

89
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,923
so we've had her since
she was nine days old.

90
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:12,110
- Is this the one that I met
when it was super little.

91
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,453
- Yes.
- Oh, okay, aww.

92
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:18,120
- So she survived, but
she's a little funny.

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,953
- [Bryan] She's still young.

94
00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:21,570
- She's really young., I
think around six months old.

95
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,624
- [Bryan] Whoa, who is this one?

96
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:24,616
- Tudder.

97
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:27,640
- Tudder? (laughing)

98
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,900
Hi, what do you think
Ollie, are they sweet?

99
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:34,051
- [Girl] This is a girl
and that's the boy.

100
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:35,134
- [Bryan] Hi.

101
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,940
Hi kitty.

102
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,221
Finn's like, I'm gonna come
in for the hug. (laughing)

103
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,443
- He's the sweet one.

104
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:53,700
- You look like a cat I had when

105
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,175
I was younger named Bubba.

106
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,008
- Aww.
- Remember Bubba?

107
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:59,800
- [Bryan] No, or Claire, aww, Clarence.

108
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,260
- If you want to know something,

109
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,890
this cat actually lost fur

110
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,310
and we thought he couldn't
make it, but he made it,

111
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,230
because he got super sick,

112
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,010
and then he got scabs all over his face.

113
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,120
- [Bryan] Now he's good and cured?

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
- [Woman] He was a mess.

115
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,110
- [Bryan] What did we just find?

116
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,650
- Oh, the cutest cat in the world.

117
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,300
- [Bryan] This is
Cupcake, and what is she?

118
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,200
- She's a ragdoll.

119
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:34,600
It just means she's floppy and
likes to be held like a baby,

120
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,347
and she'll just kind of hang out.

121
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:38,170
She's getting to be kind
of a teenager though,

122
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,909
so she's getting kind of sassy.

123
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,147
- [Bryan] She's so cute.

124
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,540
- One second, we're going
to let Ollie hold her.

125
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,355
Yeah, she's a sweetie face.

126
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,920
- She's my own kitty.

127
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,520
- [Bryan] She is so soft.

128
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,970
Did you name her Cupcake?

129
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,330
- Yeah.
- What's her middle name?

130
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,948
- Moon.
- Cupcake Moon.

131
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:56,574
- [Bryan] Cupcake Moon.

132
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:58,390
- She wants her tummy rubbed.

133
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,315
- She looks like frosting.

134
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:02,820
- And look at her face.

135
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,478
- [Bryan] She's so cute.

136
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,380
- Couple of lines.

137
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,790
- [Bryan] Did Santa bring her to you?

138
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,330
- Did Santa bring her?

139
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,900
Kind of, Santa was involved.

140
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:16,300
- Can I tell why I named her cupcake

141
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,967
because she looks like frosting,

142
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:22,730
and these look like chocolate chips,

143
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,020
and her eyes are blueberries.

144
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,758
- She does look like frosting, yeah,

145
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:28,935
I can see those reasons,
those are good reasons.

146
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:32,000
- Let's give Missy a time okay.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
- This is like holding the new baby,

148
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:38,060
everyone's like I want
to hold the new baby.

149
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,530
- Oh my gosh.

150
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,190
- [Bryan] What do you think Ollie?

151
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,980
- [Missy] Do you like her?

152
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,800
- [Bryan] Ollie has always
just loved cats, it's so funny.

153
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,633
- [Woman] She's a good one too,

154
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,270
this is a really good breed for kids,

155
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,630
because they're really, really mellow.

156
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,535
She gets crazy too, but
she's really friendly.

157
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:05,535
And they get huge, like, main coons.

158
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,120
- [Bryan] Ollie's so in love.

159
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,370
(laughing)

160
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,411
How is this real?
- You are so cute.

161
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:16,110
- [Bryan] You are so cute.

162
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,650
Look at those eyeballs.

163
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,730
- [Missy] She is so
cute, how old is she now?

164
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,610
- She is just about five months,

165
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,822
so she is starting to
be a bit of a teenager.

166
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:30,072
(talking and laughing)

167
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,293
- [Woman] I think she looks
really good on you Missy.

168
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:33,126
- I know.

169
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,940
This is like, a chill cat,
we had like a crazy cat.

170
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:48,010
- [Bryan] I know, I miss
our main coon, Clarence.

171
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,177
- Ya, we had a Clare, I
thought it was a girl,

172
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:54,820
but he ended up being a boy.

173
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,775
- [Bryan] So we just changed
the name to Clarence.

174
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,360
- Can still be Clare.

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,080
- [Bryan] Yeah, Clare and Clarence.

176
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,210
Ollie is playing with the laser.

177
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,131
You've got to point the
laser at the ground okay?

178
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:07,660
And then they'll get it.

179
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,500
Say, come get it Cupcake.

180
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,060
- [Ollie] Come get it Cupcake.

181
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,063
- [Bryan] Hey cupcake!

182
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:15,463
She's so cute.

183
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:18,050
(soft music)

184
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,460
All right so we just
left our friends house,

185
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,150
the boys had so much fun playing.

186
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,440
Then we saw strawberries,

187
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,550
like a strawberry stand
on the side of the road.

188
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,610
Right now in California,

189
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,440
there are no strawberries
in the grocery stores,

190
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,273
they just disappeared.

191
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:31,845
- They are all like white and gross.

192
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,180
- Yeah, so they're not even

193
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,950
putting them out in the produce sections.

194
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,980
But, we just got a half
a flat of strawberries.

195
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,840
Look at this.

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,750
- [Missy] Our whole car smells
like fresh strawberries.

197
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,610
- This is my hand, and
look at that, that's huge.

198
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,020
Crazy, they look so good.

199
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,580
One of the perks about
living in California,

200
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,690
is you can get strawberries like this

201
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,733
on the side of the road.

202
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:57,683
Alrighty, we've been slowly
putting things back together.

203
00:07:57,683 --> 00:07:59,720
- I know, it looks good.

204
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,120
- Yeah so we've put up some
of our entertainment stuff.

205
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,310
If you guys didn't see our vlog yesterday,

206
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,260
we saw our new entertainment
system we had built.

207
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,010
- And like I said, it's not done,

208
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,240
a lot of the finishing stuff

209
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,470
will be done hopefully tomorrow.

210
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,350
So, but this is kind of
fun, to get to decorating.

211
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,310
- [Bryan] Totally, so we
have our pictures up here,

212
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,990
more pictures over here,

213
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,772
we might do like little baskets down here.

214
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,610
- I think baskets will
kind of break up the white

215
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,200
and just like basic decor.

216
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,570
I think like cool wood, or
wicker basket or something.

217
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,440
- It's starting to look good though,

218
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,559
we still have a lot of stuff
to bring in from the garage,

219
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,449
there's like furniture that
needs to be brought in too.

220
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,121
Our house is just like empty
now that Christmas is over.

221
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:42,519
- Yeah I know, I mean its
hard when it's all bare,

222
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,745
and it feels like you just moved in,

223
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,290
you like really want to get stuff back up.

224
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,800
- [Bryan] I know. (laughing)

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,696
Whoa, is that a picture of Ollie?

226
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,529
- [Finn] Yeah.

227
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,056
- [Bryan] That's his
first day of school, huh?

228
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:56,810
- And mine, when I was born
I used to be like that.

229
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,770
- [Bryan] Yeah is that you?

230
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,603
- Yeah.

231
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:01,948
(upbeat music)

232
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,080
- All right, these boys are
going to brush their teeth.

233
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,820
It's toothirty, right?

234
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,660
Real good time to brush your teeth.

235
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,300
- Time for bed.

236
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,840
- We had such a fun day, you guys,

237
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,890
and we were so productive.

238
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,410
We got up early and we went
to breakfast before church.

239
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,360
That's pretty good for us,

240
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,740
so I think that counts as a good day.

241
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,400
But yeah, I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.

242
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,320
If you did be sure to
give it a big thumbs up.

243
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,153
We'll see you manana,

244
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:36,270
we've got some fun stuff happening,

245
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,600
Missy and I are traveling
somewhere super fun,

246
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,560
so it's gonna be a cool
week, so don't miss out.

247
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,610
Okay, bye, boop.

248
00:09:42,517 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
