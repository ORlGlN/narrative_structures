19
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,458
How's it going?

20
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,720
- Good
- Good

21
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,250
- If you guys didn't
watch yesterday's vlog,

22
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,690
I started the vlog (ding)
with Finn in my office

23
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,500
and I was talking about
how when Ollie's at school,

24
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,460
Finn is usually super bummed
so he's always hangin'

25
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,990
out with me, but now
Ollie is home today, huh?

26
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,140
- Yeah.

27
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,310
- Yeah, I dunno how Finn
is going to handle having

28
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,210
Ollie gone everyday when
he goes to kindergarten.

29
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,790
That'll be so sad, huh?

30
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,655
- Yeah.

31
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,740
- [Bryan] Yeah, I love you.

32
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,711
I love when you guys
hang out in my office.

33
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,283
(laugh) Sorry, go ahead, buddy.

34
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:03,660
- Um, I'm gonna build a (mumbling).

35
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,492
- Okay.

36
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:08,367
So, Ollie's buildin'
Legos and Finn is stacking

37
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,810
and ordering the tic-tac-toe blocks.

38
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,806
That's pretty cool.

39
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,639
- Yeah.

40
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:15,930
- Can you stack them really
tall and make them really high?

41
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,530
Here, stack them on top
of each other like this.

42
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,363
Can you do that?

43
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:20,196
- Yeah.

44
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:21,158
- [Bryan] 'Kay, go.

45
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:22,537
Aw, you're really good
at knockin' them down.

46
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:23,869
- Yeah (giggle)

47
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:26,452
(upbeat music)

48
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:32,460
- They are so cute, you guys.

49
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,870
I love them. (laughing)

50
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,930
Welcome to today's vlog.

51
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,530
We are halfway through the week, you guys.

52
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,460
That's awesome.

53
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,248
Whoa, you built a big ol' brick?

54
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:41,081
- Yeah.

55
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,199
- [Bryan] Oh, and you just need one more?

56
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,210
There we go.

57
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,842
So you created, Ollie, a
giant Lego brick out of Legos.

58
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,675
- Yeah.

59
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:50,508
- [Bryan] That's pretty cool.

60
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:52,530
- Alright guys, I am actually out.

61
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm gonna get a pedicure with Kelsey.

62
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,680
And I'm getting a little fill.

63
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,419
I'm actually eating bread
right now because I am so

64
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,252
sick.

65
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,420
I've been on a, I've been
on a antibiotic for a

66
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,960
few days now and like whenever
I take it, I just get so

67
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,170
sick.

68
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,660
Like so sick, even if I take
it on a full belly, like

69
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,170
just ate dinner or breakfast
or whatever, I like am

70
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,003
so sick.

71
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,736
The other day I was taking
Ollie to school and I was like

72
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,280
(gag) (gag), like I literally
felt like I was pregnant.

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,780
Like I've felt that before
like while driving and it's so

74
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,390
uncomfortable and so like
before I got in the car to come

75
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,905
here, I just need to bring some bread.

76
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:30,370
Which I hate eating bread,
but like I was like so sick

77
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,250
and I'm startin' to feel
a little bit better but

78
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,550
I'm excited to go have some
little girl time with Kelsey

79
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,383
and hang out.

80
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:39,900
I am definitely in dire
need of a pedicure, but I am

81
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,503
doing something different
with my nails lately.

82
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:45,070
If you guys don't know I have
like super duper thin nails.

83
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,050
They're like flaky.

84
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,883
They break.

85
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:47,716
They're terrible.

86
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,007
They have been since I was a child.

87
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:52,470
So, I started doing like
acrylics like a few years ago

88
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,030
and they just break so much.

89
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,500
Like and I'm a mom, like I
can't go get my nails fixed

90
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,680
like that often.

91
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,380
The last time I was here this
girl was like, oh you should

92
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,210
just not put the tips on,
you should just do like the

93
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,840
hard acrylic but no tip.

94
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,310
And it worked amazing.

95
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,000
Nothing broke, they just grew out.

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,050
My nail's hard so it's not
breaking or flaking but I don't

97
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,883
have to have.

98
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:16,750
And I even when I was doing
the tip I was like cutting them

99
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,823
so short that like there
was no point to have a tip.

100
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,500
So, anyways I feel so happy
that I was able to figure

101
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,333
that out.

102
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,166
Alright, I'm gonna head in now.

103
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,610
Alright, I am home and my toes are done.

104
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,060
Aren't they pretty? (giggling)

105
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,191
But they are done, and my nails are done.

106
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,130
Yay.

107
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,432
And now guess who's here?

108
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,687
♪ The family. ♪

109
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:38,910
Cassie actually hasn't met my horse.

110
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,637
- I know, Mr Nacho.

111
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,021
I haven't even got to see him yet.

112
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:42,854
(laughing)
So I'm excited.

113
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:45,491
- She actually hasn't probably
rode in ever, have you?

114
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,010
- No, like and like ten years probably.

115
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,720
- [Missy] Ten years, when's
the last time you rode a horse?

116
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,747
- When you took me at Bryan's mom's house.

117
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:55,210
- Oh yeah, that was a long time ago.

118
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,431
- [Cassie] That was when I had brown hair.

119
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,730
- Phew.
- That was a long time ago.

120
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,410
- Yeah, I think we do
have pictures of that.

121
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,940
But anyways, yeah so I'm
gonna take her and give her

122
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,059
a little ride and probably like
show her the ropes a little.

123
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,750
She prolly doesn't remember much.

124
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,402
Ollie, do you wanna go see Nacho?

125
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:10,590
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

126
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,650
Is that his name?

127
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,780
Do I just have to like
come to terms with it?

128
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,613
Is that his name?

129
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:17,029
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughing)

130
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,259
I keep saying I'm gonna
change it, but I don't think

131
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,220
it's gonna happen guys.

132
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,543
Like I really want to, but
I think I just announced it

133
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,620
so everyone just calls
him it and it's just,

134
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,059
I can't change his name.

135
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:30,730
- The sun is starting to set
so the boys are kinda savoring

136
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,510
the last couple of minutes of
daylight and playing outside.

137
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,450
And it's beautiful out here, you guys.

138
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,960
It feels so good.

139
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,130
It's like a really nice cool day.

140
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,870
You guys got Rex out here?

141
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,552
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

142
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:44,540
- Hi.

143
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,210
- [Bryan] Hi, are you guys
having fun playing together?

144
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,928
- Yeah, I'm really
really like my surprise.

145
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,260
- [Bryan] I know, I know,
it's not just yours though.

146
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,140
It's Finn's too.

147
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,200
Okay?
- Okay.

148
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,540
- The kids seriously love this.

149
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,420
Do you guys remember the vlog?

150
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,330
I'll have it in the icard if
you missed it, but this is

151
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,440
like one of their favorite
presents. (giggle)

152
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,580
They play on it all the time.

153
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,515
- Um, um, um, um.
- What?

154
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,348
Okay.

155
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:10,530
- I got daddy, da.

156
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,912
- [Bryan] Oh really?

157
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,580
- If you get all the way up and down.

158
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,640
- Nice dude, you wanna slide?

159
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,146
Finn has the funniest reactions on slides.

160
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,209
Go, go, go!

161
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,500
Whoa. (laughing)

162
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,510
That was awesome dude.

163
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,720
You went head first.

164
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,553
- Yeah.

165
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:25,400
- [Bryan] I can't believe you did that.

166
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,280
That was amazing.

167
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,545
High five.

168
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,610
(clap) Yeah.

169
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,443
You wanna do it, Ollie?

170
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:31,411
Oh backwards and head first?

171
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:34,607
(yelling) (giggling)

172
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:35,440
- That cool?

173
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,933
- [Bryan] That was so cool. (giggling)

174
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:41,100
- Go.
- Wow! (laughing)

175
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:44,235
- I want daddy.

176
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:46,360
- These kids are so funny. (sigh)

177
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,890
I love when you guys use your imagination.

178
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,939
You guys are awesome.

179
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,522
(upbeat music)

180
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,090
- [Missy] Alright, Auntie's
givin' Nacho a try.

181
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,923
What'dya think?

182
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:58,756
- He's scared.

183
00:05:58,756 --> 00:05:59,589
- [Missy] He's scared?

184
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,030
- That's okay though, he's a good horse.

185
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,990
- [Missy] He's really good.

186
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,130
- Let's go.

187
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,822
He's like wait, that
man's takin' my picture.

188
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:08,050
(giggling) Gotta get my good side.

189
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,930
- So I forgot my camera at
the house, so I'm super bummed

190
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,470
but I've got my sister
out here riding him.

191
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,303
I really trust him.

192
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:17,920
He's a really, really awesome
horse, but I will say that

193
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,520
he actually is more of
an english saddled horse.

194
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,130
So, I'm trying to get him used to western.

195
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,320
So far he doesn't mind the western saddle.

196
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,400
He definitely I don't think
likes the whole western

197
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,380
style bridle.

198
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,350
He's used to an english bridle.

199
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,023
So, I'm gonna switch up
somethings and then probably get

200
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:38,240
a trainer to train him
a little more western.

201
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,780
Which I don't think he'll
have a problem with and he's

202
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,030
super awesome and good, but
I do, I can tell that he

203
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,210
doesn't love that bit.

204
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,560
Cassie's doin' good.

205
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,431
- Woo.

206
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,740
- [Missy] Whattaya think?

207
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,573
- I like him.

208
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:49,406
- [Missy] Is he good?

209
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:50,670
He's being good for you?

210
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,129
- Yeah, he's doin' really good.

211
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,879
(soothing music)

212
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,262
- [Bryan] Oh, hello wife.

213
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,095
- Hey.

214
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:11,128
- [Bryan] How's the horse doin'?

215
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:12,422
- Good.

216
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:15,840
- Missy has done to see Nacho
I think every single day

217
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,730
since she got him so far.

218
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,563
- Yeah.

219
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,510
- Sometimes two or three times a day.

220
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,950
- Kinda obsessive.
- She's obsessed with

221
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,783
her horse, you guys.

222
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:21,890
- But I love it.

223
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,760
Actually, I'm definitely
have to get him into some

224
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,593
training though.

225
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:29,300
Today he was a little more
defiant, I guess you could say.

226
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,535
- Well, probably 'cause
you're workin' him every day.

227
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,368
- [Missy] No.

228
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,766
- He went from like not
riding at all, to being--

229
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,000
- I think it's 'cause
he's like wait a second,

230
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,490
I don't have english on.

231
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,750
I can do whatever I want.

232
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,950
She don't know what she's doin'.

233
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,219
I'm just gonna flip my head up.

234
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:41,600
- [Bryan] Oh, is that it?

235
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,330
- Yeah, I have to get
him a different bridle.

236
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,741
At least add a little extra
components to it so that

237
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,716
I can let him know that ya can't do that.

238
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:49,549
- [Bryan] Yeah. (giggle)

239
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:50,382
- So yeah.

240
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,036
- And he's gonna need a
little bit of training.

241
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:53,180
- Yeah
- Which is okay.

242
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,830
- It's not even necessarily
training because, because he's

243
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,663
not a good horse.

244
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:58,615
It's just training 'cause
I'm changing his style.

245
00:07:58,615 --> 00:07:59,680
- Yeah.
- A little bit, so.

246
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,340
'Cause ya I know a lotta
people been confused at

247
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,110
why like I'm holdin' the
reins like this with two hands

248
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,440
instead of one hand, but
he's an english rider, like

249
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,500
that's just how he is so

250
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,477
- Yeah.
- It's not a big deal.

251
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,557
(laughing)

252
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,670
but, I am getting so strong.

253
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,670
Like my trot, I feel good.

254
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,434
Like, I did like three loops

255
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:18,250
- That's awesome.
- And I was like I feel great.

256
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,718
Like I wasn't like ow, I was
like yeah, it's only been

257
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:22,080
one week

258
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,246
- Gettin' used to it?
- and I'm like stronger.

259
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:25,953
- That's awesome.
- It's so cool.

260
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:30,120
(giggle) (upbeat music)

261
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:37,630
- Oh, up.

262
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,885
- Is that cool?

263
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:39,738
- That is very cool.

264
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:42,679
Wow, Luna (laughing).

265
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,409
- [Bryan] She's jumpin' all over you, huh?

266
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:45,242
- Yeah.

267
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,577
- And go.
- Go.

268
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:48,230
(laughing)

269
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,180
- It is such a nice night.

270
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,950
I actually went riding
around too and I was like why

271
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,330
am I wearing this long sleeve.

272
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,160
I'm roasting, but as soon
as I was leaving the barn

273
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,462
it got so chilly.

274
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:01,810
I mean it's not cold or
anything, but it feels so good.

275
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,740
How are my chickens doin'?

276
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,430
They're like it's bedtime.

277
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,670
Sun's goin' down.

278
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,100
Hi Susan, Hi Kelly, Hi
Ursulo 'cause you're a boy.

279
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,670
Hi Brie, Hi Pam, Hi Moana. (giggle)

280
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,350
And one more down here.

281
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,760
I think it's Angela.

282
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,070
I always forget.

283
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,060
Angela and Meredith look very similar.

284
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,350
Let's grab these eggs.

285
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,721
Oh, look at that.

286
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,180
Four good eggs.

287
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,013
Oops.

288
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:27,846
Where's my apron?

289
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:28,679
I left it in the house.

290
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,850
Hey, Ollie?
- What?

291
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,570
- [Missy] Didn't I give
you an egg just now?

292
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,403
- Yeah.

293
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:33,319
- [Missy] Where is it?

294
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:34,220
- It's in my pocket.

295
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,435
- [Missy] It's in your pocket? (giggling)

296
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:37,467
Show me.
- Babe, where's your apron?

297
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,410
Your (talked over)
- I know

298
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,243
You're gonna drop them.
- I know.

299
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:42,200
I need to get a little hook out here.

300
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,210
'Cause I'm holdin' them like this.

301
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,234
I'm gonna drop them.

302
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:45,290
- You got a egg too?
- I always do.

303
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,123
- [Bryan] Here, I'll take this one, 'kay?

304
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:46,956
No, I'll take it.

305
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,000
I got it. (giggling)

306
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,990
Look at these little eggs.

307
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,880
- [Missy] Yeah, they're really
fun to cook with, right?

308
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,713
- [Ollie] Here, I--

309
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,510
- We made french toast the
other morning and I had to

310
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,840
literally do eight of those
because they're so tiny.

311
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,747
- 'kay, careful.
- I want eyes.

312
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,580
(giggling)

313
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,582
- Oh, do you see their eyes.

314
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:02,420
Oh, he's got egg eyes.

315
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,560
Look at those egg eyes.

316
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,296
(silly talking)

317
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:07,220
- Okay.
- What?

318
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Alright, dinner is done
and oh, they have cookies

319
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,610
and Luna was like I get cookies,
those are mine. (giggling)

320
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,380
We gotta get ready for bed, huh boys?

321
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:21,510
Yeah, but, before bed,
tomorrow is actually school.

322
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,900
What is the letter that you're
learning this week, bud?

323
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,536
- Um, P.

324
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,400
- The letter P.

325
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,810
- And starts with it's a papa.

326
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,987
- And papa starts with P, huh?

327
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:33,820
- Uh huh.

328
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,050
- So anyways, tomorrow is share day.

329
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,080
The letter is P.

330
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,160
So we have to find something
in the house that starts

331
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,993
with P.

332
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:41,118
- Um hum.

333
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,940
- What does, what starts
with P in the house boys?

334
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,310
- Papa,
- How 'bout?

335
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,370
- Papa, papa's actually not here.

336
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,490
Um, oh, paws.

337
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,820
You could share Luna's paw.

338
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,700
Would that be a good idea?

339
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,139
- But, but--

340
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,050
- [Missy] Should we just
take Luna's paw with us?

341
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,810
- No
- (giggle) I'm just kidding.

342
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,256
Let's go look in your playroom
and see what we got, 'kay?

343
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:03,553
(pop) (kid silly noises)

344
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:06,303
(soothing music)

345
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,892
- Mickey doesn't start with a P.

346
00:11:10,892 --> 00:11:12,067
- [Missy] Nope.

347
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:15,484
- P, p, p, Batman doesn't start with a P.

348
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:18,737
- [Missy] Nope.

349
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:21,350
- Sword doesn't start with a P.

350
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,183
- Nope. (giggle)

351
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:25,170
So we are having a little
trouble finding something

352
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,620
in this very messy playroom
that starts with a P.

353
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,460
I just don't see anything huh?

354
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,627
That snowman and snakes and
dinosaurs and a fireman,

355
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,917
firetruck, camera, buzz,
like there's nothing that

356
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,990
starts with a P dude.

357
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,816
Ollie, I've got a really good idea though.

358
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:48,649

359
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:49,482

- 'Kay.

361
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,310
- Come out of the very messy playroom.

362
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,240
Oh, can we share your playroom?

363
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,073
- No.

364
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:58,010
- Say you invite everyone
over for share day to

00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,140

369
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,167
