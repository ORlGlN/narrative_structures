00:00:00,671 --> 00:00:04,421
(playful, mischievous music)

2
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:15,581
- I love you!

3
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:18,638
Welcome to the wall!

4
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:21,766
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

5
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:24,146
♫ This is who we are

6
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:26,445
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

7
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,011
♫ Shot among the stars

8
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:31,077
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

9
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:34,060
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,837
♫ This is our life, let's live it

11
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,135
♫ Live it forever

12
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:42,718
(island music)

13
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:49,666
- Good morning, guys.

14
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,640
Missy and I are just wakin' up.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,091
We're not too far from the boys.

16
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,251
We're just in Costa Mesa
because we were here

17
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:56,815
for the Jon Bellion concert,

18
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:57,648
so if you guys didn't see

19
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:59,195
all that fun stuff on
our Instagram stories,

20
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:02,288
definitely be sure to go check
that out as quick as you can.

21
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:05,691
Right now, we are just
looking out of our window,

22
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,594
and it's right on the bay where
all these huge yachts are.

23
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:10,644
These people are scrubbing
'em, getting 'em clean.

24
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:12,466
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.
- It's like, so annoying

25
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:14,672
washing our car, can you
imagine having to wash a yacht?

26
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:17,134
- I know, they're all
literally washing their boats.

27
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:18,794
- [Bryan] They're washing a small house.

28
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:21,035
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's so cool.

29
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:22,532
- It's actually kind of cool to see

30
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:26,549
a different side of life
that these people do.

31
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,325
- Maybe one day we'll be able to rent one,

32
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:29,521
and go a trip with the whole family

33
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:30,775
or something.
- That would be crazy.

34
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:32,734
- That'd be cool, or a
cruise would be cool, too.

35
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:35,264
But, yeah, it's so beautiful right now.

36
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:37,873
It's so foggy, isn't that crazy?

37
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:39,944
Yesterday was beautiful and hot and sunny,

38
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:41,384
and today it's foggy.

39
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:42,858
So, we're gonna go grab some breakfast

40
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:44,461
and then we're meetin' up with the boys.

41
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:46,365
It's a pretty windy road.

42
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,032
We had to pull over.

43
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:50,739
Aww, I feel bad.

44
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:54,096
Usually, I'm the one getting car sick

45
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:56,929
but because I'm driving,
I feel like I'm not.

46
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:58,581
And she is, and I feel so bad.

47
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:00,949
We're so close to being home, too.

48
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:02,816
Probably 30 more minutes.

49
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:05,985
(slow guitar music)

50
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:08,592
You okay, babe?
(coughing)

51
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,286
- Uhh, I'm okay.

52
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:12,439
I'm just (mumbles).
(sorrowful laughing)

53
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,424
- [Bryan] Are you car sick

54
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,044
or are you having morning sickness?

55
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:17,038
Is there something you're
not telling me? (laughs)

56
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:19,430
- Nope, just car sick. (clears throat)

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,970
So gross.

58
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,470
- Awww, usually it's me, babe.

59
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,891
Seriously, usually it's
me getting car sick,

60
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:29,747
but I think it's 'cause
I'm driving, you know?

61
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:31,372
(laughing)
- Ugh.

62
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:32,731
- [Bryan] I used to get car
sick all the time in Idaho

63
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,275
when we had to drive those mountains.

64
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,552
This isn't that bad, it's just like

65
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:37,177
a little windy road, but--

66
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:39,340
- (clears throat) Don't love that.

67
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,340
Sorry, babe.

68
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,729
- [Missy] Ahhhh, hi!

69
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,706
- [Bryan] Hey kiddos!

70
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:50,215
- [Missy] Did you have
fun with Meme and Papa?

71
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,777
- [Bryan] Hi, Finn!

72
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:54,470
- [Missy] Finn's, like, shy.
- Hi.

73
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,041
- I missed you.
- Can you bring me a snack?

74
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,887
- [Bryan] Aww, we just got
home and you're already askin'

75
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,554
for snacks?
- Mwah, I missed you.

76
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,374
- [Bryan] Mom?

77
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:06,479
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,151
- [Bryan] I know, you missed her.

79
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:08,984
- Mwah.

80
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,238
I missed you, too.

81
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:13,976
- [Bryan] He missed your glasses, too.

82
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,730
- Thank you.
(laughing)

83
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,250
- He was just wanderin'
around going, "Where's Mom?"

84
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,179
All morning long.
- His mama. Mama.

85
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:23,596
Mwah, I love you.

86
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,563
- [Bryan] What are you doing, Ollie?

87
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:29,922
- Playing this game.

88
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:31,199
- [Bryan] Playing with magnets?

89
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,032
- Yeah.

90
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:33,683
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

91
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,518
- We're making a little story.

92
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:37,896
That's the little boy, and that's--

93
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:39,320
- [Bryan] Who's that?

94
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,968
- [Missy] We made that the mom.

95
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:43,000
- Yeah, and this is dad.

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,532
- That's the dad?
- Yeah.

97
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:47,296
- And they have a unicorn pet,

98
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:48,963
and a rubber duckie.

99
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,799
And the boy is a giant yo-yo enthusiast.

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,494
- [Missy] The mom needs her prince...

101
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:56,398
Her little wand.
- Oh, she's a...

102
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:59,068
- Like a princess.
- Cool.

103
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,548
- We need another toy.

104
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:02,214
(laughing)
- Okay yeah,

105
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:03,310
we need more toys.

106
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,633
- [Bryan] Do you know
why it's sticking, Ollie?

107
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:05,466
- Why?

108
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,662
- [Bryan] Because of magnets,

109
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,238
and watch when you push this button.

110
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:09,999
Boop! They all fall off!

111
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,356
- Ohhh, I don't want them--

112
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:14,841
- Oh, sorry. (laughs)

113
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:15,967
Yeah, you can do another story.

114
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,627
Oh, you can change the scenes even.

115
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:18,695
That is so cool.

116
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:20,935
The board demagnetizes
when he pushes the button,

117
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,178
so you can start over.

118
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,407
Now, you got like a little park.

119
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:25,824
- I think the rubber duckie should be

120
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:28,065
in the little--
(laughing)

121
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:31,232
(gentle guitar music)

122
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:43,576
(playful, mischievous music)

123
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,150
- Na na na na na na na na Batman!

124
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:05,437
- Ba ba ba
- Batman!

125
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:10,573
(playful, mischievous music)

126
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,958
- Oh, ma ma ma, oh eh.

127
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:21,214
- Huh, huh, huh.

128
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:22,131
I love you!

129
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,299
You're beautiful mama!

130
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,060
(playful, mischievous music)

131
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:38,692
(laughing)

132
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:40,805
- [Bryan] What were you kiddos doing?

133
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:43,150
(laughing)
Were you playing with

134
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,008
the camera in your room?

135
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:46,390
That was funny.

136
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,679
(laughing)
(children yelling)

137
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,031
- What are you doin'?

138
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:51,819
- [Bryan] They were playing
on the camera in his room.

139
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,433
It was so cute.

140
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,035
- You playin', you playin'?

141
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:58,114
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

142
00:05:58,114 --> 00:05:59,114
- Oh.
- Ohhh.

143
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,456
- [Missy] What are you boys doin'?

144
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:04,082
- We were pickin' fruit.

145
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:06,647
- [Missy] Oh, blueberries! (laughs)

146
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:07,959
- [Ollie] Might be your food.

147
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,734
- [Missy] Oh, thank you. (laughs)

148
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,169
- Mama, you can't eat them.
- Well, just so you know.

149
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,720
Yes, you cannot eat them,
they are not blueberries.

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,534
- I'm hungry, I want some.
(Missy laughing)

151
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:18,893
- You can't eat them.

152
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:20,939
(gobbling)
No, no, no!

153
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,854
- I'm just kidding.
(Missy laughing)

154
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:25,748
Pranked you! (laughs)

155
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,698
- Yeah, the boys are just playin' outside.

156
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:29,765
It is a beautiful night.

157
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,121
It's so good just to
be back with the boys.

158
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:33,538
I miss my boys.

159
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,626
They're such boys, all
they do is run around

160
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:39,320
and climb things. (laughs)

161
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,705
Pick things. (laughs)

162
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,414
Ah, it's so nice, I think
we're actually gonna go out

163
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:44,689
with the boys--
- Here!

164
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:45,602
- Oh, what?

165
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:48,110
Did you get me a flower?

166
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,767
And they always are pickin'
mama flowers, and I love it.

167
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:54,045
Finn's like, "I'm gonna
get you one, too, mom.

168
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:55,488
"I'm gonna get you one, too."

169
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,905
Ahhh, wow, look at that rose.

170
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,972
That is a beautiful rose. (laughs)

171
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:03,130
- Here's another one!

172
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,163
- [Missy] Oh, another bush?

173
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:05,890
- Yeah, another one, another bush!

174
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,789
- Oh, wow, yeah these
bushes have these little

175
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:09,622
things on them.

176
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:11,564
I don't think they're poisonous at all,

177
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,421
but they're obviously
not blueberries either.

178
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:15,151
So, don't eat 'em, okay boys?

179
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:18,112
Oh, oh, he's like, "Here mom,
I got you a better flower."

180
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:19,540
Thanks, baby.

181
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,782
I have the sweetest boys.

182
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:22,860
They literally love picking me flowers.

183
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,683
The thing I can't say to them though

184
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:27,179
is that these flowers stick.
(child yelling)

185
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,366
They smell so bad.

186
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,787
What? Oh, hug, awww.

187
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:32,204
I love you. Mwah.

188
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,567
Oh, Finn's gotta give me a hug, too.

189
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:41,166
(laughs) Finn does everything Ollie does,

190
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,292
and it's so cute.

191
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:45,659
I do wanna show you guys
somethin' that Bryan got us

192
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,691
from Pottery Barn, and I was
so excited when I saw it,

193
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,153
'cause I didn't know he was getting it.

194
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:49,986
It' says...

195
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:53,187
It's a little place mat that
says, "Enter if you dare.

196
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:54,136
"Lanning."

197
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:56,531
(laughs) I just thought that was so cute!

198
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,272
It has our name on it.

199
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:00,676
We are getting all sorts
of festive over here.

200
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,800
It's definitely the fall time,

201
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,296
and definitely starting to
become more like Halloween.

202
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,860
These flowers smell so bad.
- Mama?

203
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,996
- (clears throat) Hi.

204
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:12,453
- When it's Halloween,

205
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,485
we get to get that candy.

206
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:17,828
- Yeah, once it's October
1st, we get to start doing

207
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:20,487
the Halloween calendar.

208
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:22,217
But yeah, look at the trees.

209
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,471
I don't know if you can tell,

210
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:28,451
but you can see the top of the
tree is like changing colors

211
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:31,040
and I think they're
starting to die and fall.

212
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,317
So exciting!

213
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:34,860
Oh, my gosh, my little tree-huggers.

214
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,298
(laughs) And then, what does Finn do?

215
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:40,653
Hug the tree. (laughs)

216
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,881
And kiss the tree. (laughs)

217
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,332
He's like, "I'm not kissing it."

218
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:47,363
- Ahhhh!
- Ahhhh!

219
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:51,067
Check out that huge yellow
flower all by itself.

220
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:53,935
I don't even know what it is

221
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:56,602
and we don't have any
others anywhere else.

222
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,801
What'd you get?

223
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:59,542
- Special delivery!

224
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,914
- Deliveries?
- Yeah.

225
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,081
- [Missy] Woo-hoo!

226
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:03,914
- Mama.

227
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,178
- Did you pick me a bouquet of flowers?

228
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:12,288
That is the cutest thing ever.

229
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:14,460
- [Bryan] Finn's workin'
on one, too. (laughs)

230
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,700
How's your bouquet coming?

231
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,314
Oh, it's just a stick?

232
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:19,603
It happens.

233
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:21,565
I know it, I feel like it's a weed.

234
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:23,701
Wait, is that the same
flower that's up there

235
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,104
in the courtyard, near the door?

236
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:26,937
- No, no.

237
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,214
This is not the same.
- Wow.

238
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:31,840
Wonder where it came from?

239
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,691
It's cool, anything can grow out here.

240
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:34,620
- The inside of it is

241
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,930
so cool looking.
- Really?

242
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,801
It seriously is so beautiful tonight.

243
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:43,037
Yeah, definitely different
flowers than these ones.

244
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:46,830
That's so weird, that random flower.

245
00:09:46,830 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
