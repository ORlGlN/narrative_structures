1
00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:02,252
- You wanna see something
you've never seen before?

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,085
Hey, Finn!

3
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:05,109
Do you want to show them the secret room?

4
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:06,105
- Yeah!

5
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:09,105
(suspenseful music)

6
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:13,033
♫ This is our life

7
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,247
♫ This is our fun

8
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,592
♫ This is who we are

9
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:17,638
♫ This is our dream

10
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:18,845
♫ This is our team

11
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:21,545
♫ Shot among the stars

12
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:22,630
♫ Take this shield

13
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,722
♫ And we'll be fine

14
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:24,719
♫ Take this hand

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,864
♫ And watch us shine

16
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:28,363
♫ This is our life

17
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:30,338
♫ Let's it

18
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:32,150
♫ Live it forever

19
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,535
- Good morning!

20
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:34,596
- Good morning.

21
00:00:34,596 --> 00:00:36,237
- What are you doing today?

22
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,110
- I'm going to school.

23
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,406
- Yeah, are you excited?

24
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,239
- Mm-hmm.

25
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,086
- Dropping off now,

26
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,909
and then I'm headed to the gym.

27
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:43,898
You ready for school?

28
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:44,803
(ding)

29
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:45,743
Okay, let's go.

30
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:50,027
- [Bryan] Shades are going
up, cause it's morning time!

31
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:50,989
You wanna jump on the bed?

32
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:51,953
- Yeah!

33
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:52,786
- [Bryan] Jump, jump!

34
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,619
(Bryan laughing)

35
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,244
I'm not sure what he's doing.

36
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:57,972
Oh, you wanna jump on the beanbag.

37
00:00:57,972 --> 00:00:59,276
All right, you ready?

38
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,109
- Yeah!

39
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:00,942
- Jump!

40
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:03,319
(slow motion suspenseful music)

41
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,552
(crowd cheering)

42
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:05,385
Nice!

43
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,267
One, two, three!

44
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:13,897
(slow motion suspenseful music)

45
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:16,152
You wanna do helicopter?

46
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:17,485
Three, two, one!

47
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:23,268
(slow motion suspenseful music)

48
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:25,372
Say that was fun!

49
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:26,804
- Uh-huh!

50
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:27,637
- Close enough.

51
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:29,850
All righty, guys, it is now lunchtime,

52
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,429
and we are cooking up some Hello Fresh.

53
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:33,966

00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:45,615
I am the main cook in the house.

60
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:48,400
I love to cook yummy, fresh food

61
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,235
and I love to try new things all the time,

62
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,372
which is super easy to
do with Hello Fresh.

63
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:55,955
(bright music)

64
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,680
Hello Fresh is a meal kit delivery service

65
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,838

66
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:04,509
so that you can focus
on the whole experience

67
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,461
and not worry about the final plate.

68
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,883
So today we are making honey
sesame chicken tenders,

69
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:11,520
which sounds amazing,

70
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,715
and I have everything I
need right here in this box,

71
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:14,927
so let's get started.

72
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,510
(bright music)

73
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,474
Look at this awesome soy sauce bottle.

74
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:25,121
It's shaped like a fish.

75
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,636
(crowd aww'ing)

76
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:29,219
(bright music)

77
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,067
(upbeat music)

78
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:39,714
So with Hello Fresh,

79
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:42,660

80
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,738
they're offering light fall meals,

81
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:46,906
and they even have breakfast options now.

82
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:47,739
It's pretty cool.

83
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:50,322
(upbeat music)

84
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,546
Each week, Hello Fresh

85
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,458

00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,426

87
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:08,670
So it's perfect if you're a novice,

88
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,006
or if you're a seasoned cook.

89
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:12,589
(upbeat music)

90
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:23,779
Check that out, you guys.

91
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,228
It smells so good.

92
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:26,958

93
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,387

by visiting HelloFresh.com,

95
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,332
and using code DAILYBUMPS30

96
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,576
Special thanks again to Hello Fresh

97
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,015
for sponsoring today's video.

98
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,435
I'm gonna go grub on this now.

99
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,268
Ahhh.

100
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,187
- So I just got home from the gym,

101
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:43,141
and oh my gosh,

102
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:45,367
we worked mainly arms,

103
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,471
my whole body is in so
much pain right now,

104
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,908
I'm like, shaking.

105
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:50,277
But --
- Hi.

106
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,110
- I did it.

107
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,062
And I actually like, I think
I would have convinced myself

108
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:56,831
not to go if it wasn't for
someone who's coming with me,

109
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,457
which is Kelsey.

110
00:03:58,457 --> 00:04:00,376
So I'm glad I went, cause
I feel good about it.

111
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:01,882
I did wanna show you this, though.

112
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:03,307
When we went to Alabama,

113
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:04,913
Katie had these for the kids,

114
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,238
and I thought they were so cute,

115
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:09,695
and so convenient that I
had to buy one for Finn,

116
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:10,761
and look at him.

117
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:14,054
It's basically like
this little water brush,

118
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,030
and you brush it on here,

119
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,815
and it starts to bring
life to the picture,

120
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:19,545
and like color, and it
shows little flowers

121
00:04:19,546 --> 00:04:20,391
that you didn't see before.

122
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:21,577
Isn't that cute?

123
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:22,538
(gasp)

124
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:23,445
- [Bryan] Pretty.

125
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:25,101
- [Missy] Wow!

126
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,160
Isn't that cool?

127
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,177
- Yeah.

128
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:28,393
(Missy laughing)

129
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,976
(upbeat music)

130
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:40,657
- [Bryan] We've got
ourselves a little visitor!

131
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:41,756
Hi June.

132
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:42,589
- Me and June are catching up.

133
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:45,274
She's been super busy, so.

134
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:46,574
- Look at these faces she makes.

135
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:47,442
(Missy laughing)

136
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:48,506
Yeah, Corsey and Kel --

137
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:49,656
Kelsey and Corbin are over

138
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,564
and we're all just getting work done

139
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:52,397
and hanging out.

140
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:53,554
- Did you say his name Corsey?

141
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:54,811
- Corsey?
- Corsey.

142
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:57,049
- Hey, there you go.

143
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,357
(upbeat music)

144
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:01,357
(suspenseful music)

145
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,606
- [Missy] Ollie, welcome back from school!

146
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,698
You had a fun day at school, right?

147
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:12,490
Daddy told you that you had a
prize when you get home, huh?

148
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,323
What is it?

149
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:15,432
(suspenseful music)

150
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:16,886
- A robot!

151
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:19,699
- [Missy] It's Kai's robot!

152
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:20,667
Is that pretty cool?

153
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,443
(Finn babbling)

154
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:24,777
Isn't that so neat?

155
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:26,290
- Yeah!

156
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,622
- Even Finn's excited.

157
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:28,783
I think Ollie's really excited.

158
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:30,176
Yeah, Bryan's been working on it

159
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:31,009
for a few days.

160
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:31,842
I ended up finishing it,

161
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:34,515
or helping him finish it last night,

162
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,384
so me and Bryan had our
fun putting it together,

163
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:38,914
and now Ollie gets to have his fun.

164
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:40,635
So you gonna take it apart, Ollie?

165
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:41,468
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:42,487
- [Missy] Yes?

167
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:44,330
I thought you were gonna try
and keep it all together.

168
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,437
Watch this, go stand like right there.

169
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:48,289
Okay, ready?

170
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:49,122
Nah --

171
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:49,965
(shooting sound effect)

172
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:50,882
Ah, gotcha.

173
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:52,616
- Oh no.

174
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:53,449
Oh no,

175
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:54,282
oh no,

176
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:55,213
oh no!

177
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:56,046
Ah!

178
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:59,337
(laughing)

179
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:02,218
Did you see your Lego?

180
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,391
Yeah, Mama finished it,

181
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:04,601
wasn't that so nice of her?

182
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:05,434
- Yeah.

183
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:06,496
- Yeah.

184
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,069
Why are you climbing on top of me?

185
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,860
This is like a real life Hop on Pop book

186
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,111
right here, huh?

187
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:12,944
(Ollie blows raspberry)

188
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:13,972
Ah!

189
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:15,398
This is what happens
when the kids get home.

190
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:16,550
(laughing)

191
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,029
So if you guys have been
watching our channel,

192
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,934
you know a lot about our house.

193
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,792
You've seen a lot of it.

194
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,919
Missy has done a house
tour on her channel,

195
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,759
which I'll have linked
above in the description.

196
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,736
It's very thorough.

197
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:30,629
But a lot of things have
changed since then as well.

198
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,849
So there's some things that have changed,

199
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:35,560
and there are some things
that you also haven't seen

200
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,746
about our house that we
have yet to tell you about.

201
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,595
And I think today might be a good day

202
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:41,568
to show you guys.

203
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,149
You wanna see something
you've never seen before?

204
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,725
Let's go.

205
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:45,558
Hey, Finn!

206
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:46,916
Do you want to show them the secret room?

207
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:47,749
- Yeah!

208
00:06:48,627 --> 00:06:49,460
- Yeah?

209
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,293
What are you doing?

210
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:51,204
You putting your hand in?

211
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,620
I see the boys come out here all the time

212
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,116
and put their hands and feet in.

213
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:54,949
(Bryan laughing)

214
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:55,782
Can you climb it?

215
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,615
Let's see if you can climb it.

216
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:57,448
Go ahead.

217
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:58,951
I don't know if he can.

218
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,784
Oh my gosh.

219
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:00,929
(Bryan laughing)

220
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:03,352
Hey, let's go inside and show
them the secret room, okay?

221
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,175
(Finn babbling)

222
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,175
(suspenseful music)

223
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,388
Hey Ollie?

224
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,221
- What?

225
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:13,281
- You know how we have this secret room?

226
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,734
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,245
- What do you think lives in there?

228
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:17,437
- I don't know.

229
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,183
- [Bryan] Well what do you
think lives in the basement?

230
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:20,016
- Vampires.

231
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:20,933
- Vampires?

232
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,673
Vampires don't live in there.

233
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:25,261
So we have a secret room,

234
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,215
and I think we're gonna
show it to you guys.

235
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:28,468
You wanna see what's inside?

236
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:29,301
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,276
- [Bryan] Should we show you too?

238
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:31,109
- Yeah.

239
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,330
- The kids aren't really
even allowed down here

240
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,924
very often, huh?

241
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:35,731
All right, so we thought
it was finally time

242
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:38,628
to show you guys what's behind this door.

243
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:40,045
We haven't really shown it a lot.

244
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,644
We don't really let the
kids down there a a lot,

245
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:42,477
to be honest,

246
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,587
there's stairs going down,

247
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,276
and they're pretty steep stairs, so.

248
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:47,280
You guys ready to see?

249
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,113
- I'm so afraid.

250
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:49,292
- [Bryan] You don't need to be afraid.

251
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,863
- I think it's all good, okay?

252
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,613
No vampires, promise.

253
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,215
- [Bryan] So we also keep this door locked

254
00:07:57,215 --> 00:08:01,408
because we don't want the
kids climbing down there.

255
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:02,741
What do you see?

256
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,036
What do you see?

257
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:06,135
- Um.

258
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,128
- [Bryan] Is it dark?

259
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,208
- No.

260
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,179
- [Bryan] Is it spooky?

261
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:11,846
(clock ticking)

262
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:16,100
All righty, come on down.

263
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:17,825
- Hello.

264
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:20,565
Ooh, see these stairs are so steep.

265
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,848
- [Bryan] So this is our top secret room.

266
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:23,681
(Bryan laughing)

267
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,057
- There it is.

268
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:26,389
Is it so big?

269
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,222
- [Ollie] Yeah.

270
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:30,407
- So yeah, we have a
basement in California, guys.

271
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:31,292
- Which is very rare.

272
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:32,626
- Very, very rare.

273
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:33,746
I don't know if we've ever even,

274
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,219
have we vlogged down here?

275
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,052
- No.

276
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:36,885
- Shown them anything?

277
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:37,868
I don't think we ever have.

278
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:38,865
So this is a treat.

279
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:41,282
Welcome to our huge basement.

280
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,969
(Missy laughing)

281
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:47,172
It's not that big.

282
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:48,526
It's really not that big.

283
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,391
- I wish it was bigger.

284
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:53,472
This would be so cool if it
was like, like a theater room.

285
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:54,819
- [Bryan] Totally.

286
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:56,814
- Or workout room.

287
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:57,700
- Tell me what you guys think

288
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,780
is actually realistic.

289
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,613
Cause I was thinking,

290
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:00,660
how interesting would it be

291
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,473
to have a contractor come in here,

292
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:04,192
tear out all these walls,

293
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:05,435
and just dig,

294
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:06,470
and make it bigger?

295
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,303
- I don't know, like,

296
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:08,970
how to build on foundations,

297
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,033
I don't know.

298
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:10,929
- I don't know how any of it works.

299
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,837
All I know is it's pretty
cool we found a house

300
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:14,177
that actually has a basement.

301
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:15,854
- Yeah, we've had a lot of people come in,

302
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,427
who were like looking
to do work or something,

303
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:18,766
and they'll like come to the basement,

304
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,600
and like, you have a basement?

305
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,410
I've been to hundreds
of homes in this area

306
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,222
and they've never seen a basement.

307
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:25,055
- [Bryan] Yeah.

308
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,240
- So though it's small,
but it's still a basement.

309
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,073
- [Bryan] Totally.

310
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:27,906
So what've we got?

311
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:28,830
What's going on down here, babe?

312
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,890
- So this is kind of our secret room,

313
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,394
where a lot of our props are,

314
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:34,894
things for videos,

315
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,240
- We have lots of costumes,

316
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,042
masks, these are all just --

317
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,175
- Even lighting stuff to make videos,

318
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:43,608
a lot of like our video production --

319
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:44,652
- [Bryan] We have like holiday stuff,

320
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,036
like wrapping.

321
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,789
What did you find?

322
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,467
- [Missy] Oh goodness.

323
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,286
- [Bryan] So we also
have a little toy stash.

324
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,362
- Our toy stash.

325
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:53,529
(Missy laughing)

326
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,377
- [Bryan] Just little toys
that we've never opened

327
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,508
and have acquired.

328
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,067
- Little trinkets that
we've kind of collected

329
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,259
through the years.

330
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,574
- [Bryan] And this closet.

331
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:04,084
- Oh my gosh, this is kind of a mess.

332
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,740
Like every single costume that you can --

333
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,642
- Yeah.

334
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,121
If you guys have watched us for awhile,

335
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:10,559
you've seen all these.

336
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,233
We have acquired so
many different costumes

337
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,211
and props, it's crazy.

338
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,643
Oh my gosh, what have we got?

339
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:19,435
We've got Christmas, we've got --

340
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:20,268
- [Missy] Oh, there's Belle.

341
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:21,504
- [Bryan] There's Belle.

342
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,831
We've got dinosaurs.

343
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,664
- [Missy] Captain Hook.

344
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:26,677

- [Missy] Oh here's Tinkerbell.

349
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:34,104
- Tinkerbell's costume.

350
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,832
Cause you know, we like to
do lots of different things

351
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,958
on this channel, so we've like,

352
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,681
we've put up vlogs, we've put up skits,

353
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,529
we've put up fun family things.

354
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:42,404
- And kids have lots of costumes

355
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:43,896

- [Bryan] Experiments.

356
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:44,729
- Yeah, the kids have lots of costumes

357
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,430
that they like to dress up in,

358
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,076
and sometimes we like to dress up too.

359
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:49,383
- [Bryan] Totally.

360
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,278
(Finn babbling)

361
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:51,111
So like in here we have storage bins

362
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:54,203

363
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:55,248

00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:58,294

366
00:10:58,294 --> 00:10:59,419
Yeah.

369
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,836
- Oh, you guys remember this?

370
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,410
This one we just recently did.

371
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,502
- [Bryan] Yeah, all our cool masks.

372
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,531
- Lots of party stuff in
here, so if you guys know --

373
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:10,695
- [Bryan] Like chalkboards.

374
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:13,093
- Lots of empty stuff too.

375
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:17,260
- So here in this cabinet
is actually some roosters.

376
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:18,984
(laughing)

377
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,568
My grandma collected roosters for so long,

378
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,820
and I have acquired a couple,

379
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,767
and they're not really a
part of like, our, decor?

380
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,814
So we keep them down here.

381
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:32,235
- [Missy] We keep them around.

382
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,169
- [Bryan] That's a good rooster.

383
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,122
- We still have party
favors from when was this?

384
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,345
Let's see.

385
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:38,477
- [Bryan] Oh is that the --

386
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:40,279
- This is Finn's, Finn's party favors.

387
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,112
- No way!

388
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,253
That's so cool!

389
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,014
So we had like, look at, dude!

390
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:45,934
Here, you want a bag?

391
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:48,113
You can have a bag,
you've been a good boy.

392
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,481
- [Missy] There you go, bud.

393
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:54,196
- [Bryan] We've got balloons,
confetti, streamers --

394
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:55,936
- More party stuff.

395
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:57,169
- All kinds of stuff.

396
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:58,636
- Look, here's all the pirate party stuff.

397
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,020
- Oh, pirate stuff.

398
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,304
If we ever want to be pirates.

399
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,184
- Yep.

400
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:03,029
We even have some decor things,

401
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,538
and actually a lot of decor things

402
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:05,560
that went with parties,

403
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,324
so this was like for
Kelsey and Corbin's party.

404
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:08,157
- [Bryan] Oh yeah.

405
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:09,473
- So many things.

406
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:10,307
- [Bryan] Yes.

407
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,140
- But you know what?

408
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,973
I like putting on parties,

409
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:12,957
so you never know when we're
gonna throw another one.

410
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,823
- And a lot of times, if
we have people coming over,

411
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:15,757
we'll just come down here

412
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:17,562
and grab some balloons --

413
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:18,395
- [Missy] Yeah.

414
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:19,866
- Or something and just
throw something together.

415
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,639
- Yeah, I've (mumbles) for so many parties

416
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,609
by just getting the
stuff that's down here.

417
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,442
- [Bryan] Yeah.

418
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,025
- Instead of having to go to the store.

419
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:26,887
- Yeah.

420
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:29,598
And that is our top secret room, you guys.

421
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,227
Basement tour, room tour,

422
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:32,916
top secret house tour, I don't know.

423
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,354
There you go.

424
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,187
Now you've seen it.

425
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,020
Seen it all.

426
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,875
Have they seen it all?

427
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,623
- They haven't seen it all.

428
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:41,364
- There may be a couple
of other surprise rooms.

429
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:42,884
So just stay subscribed to this channel,

430
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:44,509
keep watching our videos every single day,

431
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:45,759
maybe you'll see them, I don't know.

432
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,165
(door closing)

433
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,038
(lock jingling)

434
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:48,907
And keep it locked.

435
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,088
- And this is why the kids
aren't allowed down there.

436
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:51,921
- [Bryan] Yeah.

437
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,114
(laughing)

438
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:55,405
Random party chocolate from a year ago.

439
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:56,258
(laughing)

440
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:57,091
- [Missy] I know, is this even good?

441
00:12:57,091 --> 00:13:00,099
(Finn babbling)

442
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:01,701
- [Bryan] It's like a chocolate coin!

443
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:02,534
You want it?

444
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:03,367
- [Missy] Karma, no, you can't have it.

445
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,309
- [Bryan] You can have it, Finn.

446
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,241
You've been such a good boy today.

447
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:09,862
- He's trying to close his eyes.

448
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,351
- [Bryan] Why is he closing his eyes?

449
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:14,097
- Because he wants to go to bed.

450
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,029
- [Bryan] He's tired?

451
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:15,862
- Mm-hmm.

452
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,080
- [Bryan] Are you tired, Karma?

453
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,778
Karma got a little owie on his nose.

454
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,278
- Aww, that's his,

455
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,178
Karma, don't move away.

456
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,895
- [Bryan] Karma, show him your owie.

457
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:29,938
- He lose a tooth.

458
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:31,261
- [Bryan] He what?

459
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:32,272
- He lose a tooth.

460
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:33,298
- He lost a tooth.

461
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:35,504
- [Bryan] Aw, he did?

462
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,014
Poor guy.

463
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:37,847
- [Missy] Yeah.

464
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:38,790
- [Bryan] Karma.

465
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,165
You love Karma.

466
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:41,003
- Yeah.

467
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,043
- [Bryan] Yeah.

468
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:43,298
- [Missy] You wanna see his nose?

469
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:44,760
He got a little owie on his nose.

470
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,869
- Aw.

471
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:46,702
- He says, don't touch it.

472
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,210
I don't want a band-aid.

473
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,604
(mellow music)

474
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:54,382
- [Bryan] Check out that cool Fire Mech,

475
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:55,599
isn't that so neat?

476
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,432
It is really cool.

477
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,849
It actually shoots these disks

478
00:13:57,849 --> 00:13:59,594
from the top up here

479
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:01,404
and it's got the Ninjago flags,

480
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:02,237
and fire!

481
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,387
Isn't that neat?

482
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,220
- Let's try you do it.

483
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,053
(disk releasing)

484
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:07,886
(Bryan laughing)

485
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:09,226
- [Bryan] That's awesome.

486
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:12,940
All right, should we let the
Fire Mech end the vlog, Ollie?

487
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,815
- Mm-hmm.

00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:15,264
