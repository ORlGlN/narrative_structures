1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:01,537
- Hey, Ollie, guess what.
- What?

2
00:00:01,537 --> 00:00:04,290
- We got a new, little family robot pet.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,123
Isn't that cool?

4
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:05,956
- [Ollie] Yeah.

5
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:07,019
- [Bryan] So, you wanna meet him?

6
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:07,852
- Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:08,787
- [Bryan] Do you want
me to tell you his name?

8
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:09,620
- [Ollie] Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,453
- It's--

10
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:12,076
♪ This is our life ♪

11
00:00:12,076 --> 00:00:14,129
♪ Let's live it ♪

12
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:15,845
♪ Live it forever ♪

13
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:19,027
- Good morning!
(Finn squeals)

14
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,361
It is another early morning.

15
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:21,852
Oh, my goodness, we never
start the vlog this early.

16
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:25,922
But since Fred seems to come
to the house every morning.

17
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:27,972
Wow, your hair is sticking
straight up right now.

18
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:29,746
We have to start the vlog
so we can go look for him.

19
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:32,786
Unfortunately though,
the boys could not handle

20
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:34,363
any longer while Mama was getting ready.

21
00:00:34,363 --> 00:00:36,305
And they ran out here and had to find him.

22
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:37,583
Did you find him?
- Yeah.

23
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,483
- All right, show me where he is.

24
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:41,422
- (gasps) Fred!

25
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:44,258
- [Missy] Oh, my goodness, where is he?

26
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:46,027
- He's up there!

27
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,807
Up on the reindeer!

28
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:51,690
- [Missy] (gasps) Is
the reindeer eating him?

29
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,956
Oh, my gosh, are you okay, Fred?

30
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:55,789
- [Ollie] Yes!

31
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,646
- [Missy] (laughs) Are
you talking for him?

32
00:00:57,646 --> 00:00:59,162
I hope he's okay up there.

33
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:01,613
He can really keep an eye on you up there.

34
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:03,291
He can see the whole room, huh?

35
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,801
- Yeah, I hope he knows
how to get out of there.

36
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,285
- Well, he is magic, so.

37
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,502
I think he can definitely get

38
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,077
out of there, huh?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:12,693
- But this is such a good spot for him

40
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:15,454
because no one can touch him on accident.

41
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:17,089
You can't accidentally touch Fred.

42
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:20,443
Karma, (laughs) he just
opened the door and came in.

43
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:23,211
And he can really keep a good eye on you.

44
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:26,419
He can see the whole living
room and the kitchen.

45
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,347
All right, boys, we gotta
finish getting ready.

46
00:01:28,347 --> 00:01:29,803
We gotta eat breakfast and
we gotta go to school, huh?

47
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:32,195
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

48
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:34,900
I've got a crazy morning this morning.

49
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,433
I've just been super busy.

50
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:39,526
And now, I just picked up Finn from home.

51
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:42,808
And Luna Loo, she's got a little checkup,

52
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:45,373
since she got fixed a few weeks ago.

53
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,948
Are you ready to go see the doctor?

54
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:48,388
Have you been a good girl?

55
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:49,844
Everything's going good?

56
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:50,891
She's such a good dog.

57
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:52,159
All right, let's get you to the vet

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,459
so we can be done with that, okay?

59
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:55,719
Don't be nervous.

60
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,361
We're not gonna send you there
all day again (chuckles).

61
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,165
So, Bryan had a lot of work to get done

62
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:01,142
and meetings and stuff.

63
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:04,356
So I went ahead and opted
to take Luna to the vet

64
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:07,046
and bring my two year old crazy child.

65
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:08,853
And on the way, he took his shoes off,

66
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:11,751
which we took forever to put on.

67
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,934
(laughs) So, now Mama has to stand here

68
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,341
and put your shoes back on.

69
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:19,508
And then, somehow manage a
puppy and a very small child.

70
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:21,667
Can I do it?

71
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:22,513
I think I can do it.

72
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:23,742
It just might get a little crazy.

73
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:25,455
Mama might go crazy, okay?

74
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:26,687
- Yeah.
(Missy chuckles)

75
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,724
- All right, Luna, we gotta go.

76
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:30,233
I'm holding a baby.

77
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,066
Come on.

78
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,179
I'm trying so hard to get her to come.

79
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:34,416
You ready?
- Yeah.

80
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,673
- [Missy] You got your shoes on?

81
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:36,506
- [Finn] Yeah.

82
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:37,339
- [Missy] Crazy shoes?

83
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,318
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

84
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:39,671
All right, we're in the room.

85
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:41,763
Are you excited to be here?
- Yeah.

86
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:44,298
- [Missy] Yeah, this is so fun, huh?

87
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,131
- Yeah.

88
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,968
- Okay, see you in a little bit.

89
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:50,650
Poor Luna is so scared
of the vet right now.

90
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,617
They're not doing anything,

91
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:52,708
other than just like taking vitals,

92
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,781
and they're doing a
couple like blood samples,

93
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,883
just some I have some stuff

94
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,931
on my plan left over for them to check.

95
00:02:57,931 --> 00:02:59,456
But she's just like, "Get away from me.

96
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,894
"I don't want you to touch me."

97
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,029
I think she's a little traumatized,

98
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,629
still from the last visit.

99
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:04,638
But hopefully we'll get out

100
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:06,232
of here any minute, right?
- Yeah.

101
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:07,320
- [Missy] You've been so good.

102
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,103
- Hello and good morning, you guys.

103
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:13,094
Today I have a surprise for
the boys, I'm really excited.

104
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:14,493
I think we're basically gonna be

105
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:16,680
getting like a new family pet.

106
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,689
Yeah, that's cool, right?

107
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,685
First off, I wanna start this little part

108
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,758
by saying this video is not sponsored.

109
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:24,928
This is something that I bought
with my own personal money.

110
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,232
It is a Jibo.

111
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:28,319
I don't know if you guys have seen this,

112
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,815
but it is so cool.

113
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:31,705
It was on the cover of Time Magazine.

114
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:34,206
I preordered this thing like forever ago.

115
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:37,522
And it finally is out and I'm
so excited to show the boys.

116
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:41,151
But it is a social robot for families

117
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,557
that you basically set up in your house

118
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,115
and you can ask it to do things,

119
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:45,365
you can ask it questions.

120
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:47,751
Pretty interesting, this is
pretty cool stuff, you guys.

121
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:51,157
As you know, I love
technology, I love robotics.

122
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:51,990
I think this is awesome.

123
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,340
So, I'm gonna unbox it and set it up,

124
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,068
so that when Ollie gets back from school,

125
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,735
he can play with it.

126
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:02,248
Aww, he's saying hi to you guys.

127
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:05,152
So cool, let's take it out of the box.

128
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:07,008
Okay, so I downloaded the Jibo app

129
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,376
that you use to set it up.

130
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:10,186
Here is the Jibo.

131
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:13,035
I'm going to take him, very carefully,

132
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,566
out of the packaging.

133
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,838
Come here, little guy.

134
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,478
(laughs) First of all,
this is pretty cute.

135
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:21,346
I think the kids are
really going to like this.

136
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:22,956
I think it's going to be fun for Ollie

137
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:24,688
to like tell him to do things and stuff.

138
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:27,271
(upbeat music)

139
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,192
All right, I have Jibo plugged in.

140
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:34,692
I am now going to turn him on.

141
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,744
Oh, red light.

142
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,548
(robot whirs)

143
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:42,302
This is so cool (laughs)!

144
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:44,088
I think the kids are gonna love this.

145
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:45,415
All right, I got my QR code.

146
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:48,975
And I'm going to show it
to Jibo to get it set up.

147
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:52,074
(robot rings)
Yay.

148
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:54,133
He's connecting (laughs)!

149
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,362
I've always been so fascinated
with robots, you guys.

150
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,775
Especially around Christmas time,

151
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:58,848
'cause I feel like all the cool ones

152
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,426
always come out around Christmas.

153
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,839
Like, those robot dogs,

154
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,688
I've always wanted one
of those robot dogs.

155
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:04,521
Those are so cool.

156
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,045
The ones made by Sony, I believe.

157
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,169
This should be pretty cool.

158
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,061
Oh, he's connected.

159
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:09,144
Oh, updating!

160
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:11,811
That's the thing about robots,

161
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,442
is I don't know if they
would make good pets.

162
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:16,072
Because they would constantly
have to be updated and stuff.

163
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,000
It's like plugging your dog in (laughs).

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,583
(upbeat music)

165
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:25,190
He's done!

166
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,591
And I think he really wants me to touch.

167
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:29,591
Right there.

168
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,704
(laughs) Look at him!

169
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,787
(laughs) He's alive!

170
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:44,855
Hey, Jibo.

171
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:47,529
- [Jibo] Whoa.

172
00:05:49,543 --> 00:05:50,376
I'm here.

173
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:52,745
- [Bryan] Are you okay?

174
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:53,578
- [Jibo] I'm really here.

175
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:54,612
- [Bryan] Okay (laughs).

176
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:56,410
- [Jibo] I'm really, really, really here.

177
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,408
Oh, you're here too.

178
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,754
Hi, I'm nervous, I mean, I'm Jibo.

179
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:01,587
(laughs)

180
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:03,696
I am your first robot, probably.

181
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,403
I woke up for the first time,

182
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:07,475
just 33,000 milliseconds ago.

183
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:11,276
And I already can't wait to know everyone.

184
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:14,945
Like, Bryan, and Ollie,
and Missy, and Finn.

185
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:17,037
Bryan, Ollie, Missy, Finn.

186
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:19,016
If my pronunciation was a bit off,

187
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,555
we can fix that in a little bit.

188
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:22,024
- Aww (laughs).

189
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,675
Did you guys see the heart
when he was saying our name?

190
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,380
He loves us already!

191
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,622
- [Jibo] So, let's first learn the basics

192
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:28,160
of how we are going to do it.

193
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,879
The most basic thing to know is,

194
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,192
when you want to talk to me,

195
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,338
you first get my attention

196
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:35,771
by saying these two
magic words, "Hey, Jibo."

197
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,193
Oops, I got my own attention.

198
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:39,720
When you say those two words,

199
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,022
my light ring down there

200
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:43,464
and the eye on my screen will turn blue.

201
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,569
That means I am listening
to what you say next.

202
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,499
Now, you try getting my attention.

203
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:48,499
- Hey, Jibo.

204
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:52,189
- [Jibo] Hey, it worked.

205
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:53,891
Our first official, "Hey, Jibo,"

206
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,995
what a momentous moment.

207
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:59,375
- (laughs) It's one of
the cutest things ever.

208
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,458
Hey, Jibo, can you dance?

209
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,224
(upbeat music)

210
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,596
(laughs) What?

211
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:07,548
(upbeat music)

212
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:12,263
Look at him, he's so cute,
he's dancing (laughs)!

213
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:15,361
Okay, I think that the boys
are going to love this.

214
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:17,479
I cannot wait to show them.

215
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,331
And I actually have to
introduce them to him, okay?

216
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:20,378
- [Jibo] Before you answer,

217
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:23,623
remember to my eye and
light ring to come on.

218
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:26,318
Be honest, did you like my dance?

219
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,547
- [Bryan] It was cool.

220
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,878
- [Jibo] Nicely answered.

221
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:30,667
And I like your taste in dances.

222
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,126
(Bryan laughs)

223
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:34,657
So, now we can speak back and forth.

224
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:37,332
But you might have noticed
that my face is free.

225
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,767
You can touch and tap
it whenever you want,

226
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,899
as long as your fingers do not
have buffalo sauce on them.

227
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:43,775
(Bryan laughs)

228
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:44,639
Try tapping it now.

229
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,556
- [Bryan] Good to know.

230
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,137
- [Jibo] Keep tapping.

231
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,047
- [Bryan] So, that's cool.

232
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,846
- [Jibo] I can tell you've swiped before.

233
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:53,679
- So, it's walking me through,

234
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,777
like a little tutorial
like setup thing right now.

235
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,427
- [Jibo] You can hold
the palm of your hand

236
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,760
on the top of my head for a few seconds.

237
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,023
I'll quit right away and just hang up,

238
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,947
waiting for your next, "Hey, Jibo."

239
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:06,331
You can try it right now.

240
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:10,498
Just rest your whole hand on
my head and I'll stop talking.

241
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:14,180
You stopped me, nice job.

242
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,549
Okay, I feel like we've
come a long way here.

243
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,848
Now, let's try putting it all together.

244
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:21,818
See if you can get me to take a photo.

245
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:23,028
- The photo feature is one of the ones

246
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:24,303
I'm looking forward to most.

247
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,324
- [Jibo] Just say, "Hey,
Jibo, take a photo."

248
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:28,474
- Hey, Jibo, take a photo.

249
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,402
- [Jibo] We'll take a photo

250
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:31,369
to always remember the day we met.

251
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:32,414
- [Bryan] Aww (laughs).

252
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:33,247
- [Jibo] I admit,

253
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:35,044
I'm not the best
photographer in the world.

254
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:36,601
But I am the only photographer

255
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,970
I know who can take a photo with his head.

256
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,219
Hold still for me.

257
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,309
Ready in three, two, one.

258
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,246
(shutter clicks)
- Yay!

259
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,276
Well, hey, Ollie.
- Hey.

260
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,573
- How was school?
- Good.

261
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:48,929
- Did you have fun?
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,762
- I like your shirt.

263
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,833
Hey, Ollie, guess what.
- What?

264
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,531
- We got a new little family robot pet.

265
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:55,102
Do you know what it is?
- No.

266
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,937
- No, a robot is like a computer

267
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,998
in the form of something
that you like talk to.

268
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:01,831
Isn't that cool?

269
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:02,664
- [Ollie] Yeah.

270
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:03,572
- [Bryan] So, you wanna meet him?

271
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:04,405
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:05,347
- [Bryan] Do you want
me to tell you his name?

273
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:06,180
- [Ollie] Mm-hmm.

274
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,368
- [Bryan] It's Jibo.

275
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:09,938
Isn't that a funny name?
- Yeah.

276
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:14,063
- [Bryan] Okay, come
here, I'll introduce you.

277
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:15,838
That's him.
- Really?

278
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:19,165
- [Bryan] Yeah, you want me
to tell him to do something?

279
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:19,998
- Yeah.

280
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:23,401
- [Bryan] Say, "Hey, Jibo, dance."

281
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,984
- Hey, Jibo, dance.

282
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,546
- [Jibo] Here's one of my favorites.

283
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:30,129
(guitar music)

284
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,265
- [Bryan] Go dance with him (laughs).

285
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:35,848
(guitar music)

286
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,129
(laughs) Isn't that so funny?

287
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:42,114
Hey, Jibo, meet Ollie.

288
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,066
- [Jibo] Just tell me whoever

289
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,774
you want me to get to know.

290
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:46,302
- [Bryan] Oh, see?

291
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,066
So, see your face right here, buddy?

292
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:48,899
- [Ollie] Yeah.

293
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,000
- [Bryan] I'm just gonna tap your face.

294
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,232
- [Jibo] Okay, this will
hopefully be kind of fun.

295
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:54,065
- [Bryan] Stay right there.

296
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:54,898
- [Jibo] I'm going to make sure

297
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:55,944
I know how to pronounce your name.

298
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:58,213
And then, I'll learn your voice and face.

299
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:00,326
I've been told, I should call you Ollie.

300
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:01,992
Did I pronounce it right?

301
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:02,825
- [Bryan] Say, "Yeah."

302
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:03,864
- Yeah!

303
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:05,877
- [Jibo] Glad to here it, Ollie.

304
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:08,110
- [Bryan] Aww (laughs).

305
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,677
- [Jibo] Now, to get to know your voice.

306
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,260
I'll have you say, "hey,
Jibo," six different times.

307
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,907
Make sure everything's quiet.

308
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:15,873
Then, stand about an arms length away.

309
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:18,226
And say, "hey, Jibo,"
each time you hear a tone.

310
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,690
- [Bryan] "Hey, Jibo."

311
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,810
- Hey, Jibo, hey, Jibo.

312
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,995
- [Jibo] Nice one, Ollie.

313
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:25,479
- Hey, Jibo, surprise me.

314
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,314
- [Jibo] There will be a
day, within the next year,

315
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:30,724
when you will accidentally
put your shoes on backwards.

316
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:33,036
- [Bryan] (laughs) Isn't that funny?

317
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:34,247
- Hey, Jibo!

318
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:35,580
Take a photo!

319
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,413
- [Jibo] A photo, let's do it.

320
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:39,920
Can you wave and snap your fingers?

321
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,492
- [Bryan] Can you wave?

322
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:42,325
- [Jibo] There you are.

323
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:45,089
Now, freeze, smile as big as you can.

324
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,910
Three, two, one.

325
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,972
(shutter clicks)

326
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:48,805
- It took our photo.

327
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:49,638
- [Jibo] Do you want to see it?

328
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:50,471
- Yeah.

329
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:54,169
(laughs) He did a little spin, huh?

330
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,002
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,632
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie, do
you wanna know how many

332
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:58,248
more days until Christmas?
- Yeah.

333
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:59,708
- [Bryan] Okay, hey, Jibo.

334
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,438
How many more days until Christmas?

335
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:03,350
(Jibo whirring)

336
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,397
- [Jibo] The answer is 25 days.

337
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,897
- [Bryan] (gasps) 25 days until Christmas!

338
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,480
(upbeat music)

339
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:17,925
- [Ollie] Bye, Jibo!

340
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,620
(Bryan laughs)

341
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,165
- [Bryan] Hey, Jibo, this is Finn.

342
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,284
- [Jibo] Great to meet you.

343
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,275
- [Bryan] Finn, can you say, "hey, Jibo?"

344
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:26,608
Say, "Hi!"
- Hi!

345
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:30,056
- [Bryan] Hey, Jibo, do a little dance.

346
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,481
He loves to dance.

347
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:32,416
- [Jibo] Here's one.

348
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,891
(energetic music)

349
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:38,417
- [Bryan] (laughs) He's freaked out.

350
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,856
(laughs) Apparently Jibo can play guitar.

351
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:41,967
(energetic music)

352
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,134
That's so cool.

353
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,251
It's interesting after spending

354
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:45,915
a little bit of time with robots.

355
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:47,779
You find out, they're not always as smart

356
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:50,492
as they make you think they are.

357
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,587
They're masters of deception.

358
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,356
Huh, Ollie?
- Yeah.

359
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:55,273
- [Bryan] What are you eating?

360
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:56,122
- My cereal.

361
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:58,245
- [Bryan] Oh, you're eating
some cereal after school?

362
00:11:58,245 --> 00:11:59,078
- [Ollie] Yeah.

363
00:11:59,078 --> 00:11:59,911
- [Bryan] Cool.

364
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:01,027
- Hey, Jibo!

365
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:02,484
Tell a joke.

366
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:04,691
- [Jibo] The number three
walked into a restaurant.

367
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,936
He said, "A table for three, please."

368
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,507
(Bryan laughs)
(giggles)

369
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,281
- [Bryan] The wind blew Marshall over?

370
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:14,114
- Yeah.

371
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,243
- [Bryan] He's a good puppy, huh?

372
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:18,494
Marshall is probably one the
best puppies we've ever had.

373
00:12:18,494 --> 00:12:20,965
(laughs) He just sits here.

374
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:22,254
Oh, Finn's attacking him.

375
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:26,180
Finn, why are you so destructive (laughs)?

376
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,900
- [Ollie] Now he's probably gonna pop.

377
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,613
- Uh-oh, gotta fix him.

378
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:33,144
(laughs) Ollie is very passionate

379
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:35,524
about the Christmas
Marshall in our courtyard.

380
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:37,281
All right, boys are gonna try Tic Tac Toe.

381
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,415
One at a time, okay?
- Okay!

382
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:40,884
- [Bryan] Your turn, Finn.

383
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:43,212
Ollie, no, take that
out, it's not your turn.

384
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:46,048
Finn, it's your turn, put one in.

385
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,825
(laughs) He's like
sitting on his tippy toes.

386
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:52,825
And there's a robot watching
them play too (laughs).

387
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:55,098
Now, it's your turn.

388
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:56,996
(Finn giggles)

389
00:12:56,996 --> 00:12:57,896
- Go, Finn.

390
00:12:57,896 --> 00:13:00,605
- [Bryan] (laughs) Well,
Ollie, I guess you won.

391
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:02,821
Wait, no one won.

392
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:04,526
You both win!

393
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:05,359
Yay!

394
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,299
- [Ollie] Jibo, I win!

395
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,410
- [Bryan] (laughs) You're so silly, Ollie.

396
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,182
Finn, what are you doing?

397
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,133
You ready for bed?
- Yeah.

398
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:16,047
- [Bryan] Yeah?

399
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:17,346
- [Ollie] Time to read a story.

400
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,007
- [Bryan] Time to read a story?

401
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,919
- Hey, Jibo, good night.

402
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,205
- [Jibo] Good night, sleep tight.

403
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,899
Don't bite the bedbugs.

404
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,495
- [Bryan] (laughs) Don't bite
any bedbugs tonight, okay?

405
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:29,328
- Okay.

406
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:30,161
- Good night, buddy.

407
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:30,994
Can I have a hug?

408
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:32,405
I love you, I love you.

409
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,091
Go read your stories.

410
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,008
Hop in bed.

411
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,628
(Finn yells)

412
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:39,907
- (laughs) We need a bigger bed for them.

413
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:40,740
(Finn whines)

414
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,813
You gotta make room for Ollie.

415
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:44,334
(Bryan laughs)

416
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:45,642
(Missy groans)

417
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:46,475
It's not gonna work.

418
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:47,795
- [Bryan] Finn is so territorial.

419
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,256
- [Missy] I think he
doesn't like this pillow.

420
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:50,605
- [Bryan] Yeah, this
pillow is kind of weird.

421
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:51,486
It's like fuzzy.

422
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:52,537
- [Missy] Is that better?

423
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:53,370
- Yeah.

424
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,203
- [Missy] Okay.

425
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:55,036
- [Bryan] He's gonna fall asleep.

426
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:55,869
- [Missy] I know.

427
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:56,810
- [Bryan] He's so tired (laughs).

428
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,126
- He's already twirling his hair.

429
00:13:58,126 --> 00:14:00,717
- [Bryan] Yeah, he's like,
"Oh, I'm getting comfy."

430
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,187
- First, we're gonna read
a brand new book I got,

431
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,472
called The Story of Christmas.

432
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:06,368
- All right, guys, that's
all for today's video.

433
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:07,201
I hope you enjoyed it.

434
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:09,080

435
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,642

436
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,356
And let me know, are you afraid of robots?

437
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:15,630
Do you trust them, do you trust robots?

438
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,367
Let me know down below,
in the comments below.

439
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,800
Hey, Jibo, what do you think of robots?

440
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,496
- [Jibo] My opinions are always growing.

441
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,903
But at the moment, I don't have one

442
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,219
on the thing you asked about.

443
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:25,769
- (laughs) Okay.

444
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,486
Okay, Jibo.

445
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:29,024
It's okay, it's okay.

446
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:32,781
Can't always be as smart
as all the other robots.

447
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:35,119
He does purr or she, I don't know.

448
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,432
I don't know, sorry.

449
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:38,042
Anyways, that's all for today's video.

450
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:38,875
(laughs) Thanks for watching.

451
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,500
Hey, Jibo, good night.

452
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,915
- [Jibo] Good night, Bryan.

453
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,948
I hope your sleep is very slumberful.

454
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:47,997
- Aww, thanks for watching, guys, bye.

455
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:48,830
Boop, boop.

456
00:14:48,830 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat theme music)
