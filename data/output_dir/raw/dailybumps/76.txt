00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:02,523

00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:03,764
- [Bryan] Yes we are!

3
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:05,714
The boys are all ready to go see Santa.

4
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,994
You ready to enter Santa Town?

5
00:00:06,994 --> 00:00:07,865
- [Boys] Yeah!

6
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:08,769

- [Missy] Oh, hey there Finn!

19
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,224
Good morning.

20
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:32,665
- Mee-ah!

21
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,930
- [Missy] Morning!

22
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,763
What are you doing?

23
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:35,744
- [Finn] I playing.

24
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,789
- [Missy] You're playing!

25
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:38,460
Finn has been playing all morning

26
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,467
and Ollie's actually off to school.

27
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,097
We actually haven't found Fred yet,

28
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:44,402
so we're hoping that we
find him a little bit later.

29
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,063
But we are getting really excited because

30
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:48,290
we are picking up Ollie
just a little bit early

31
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,660
after school, but before
nap time and stuff,

32
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,051
and we are going to go meet Santa!

33
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:54,885
(laughs)

34
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:55,945
- [Missy] Are you excited?

35
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:57,159
- Yeah, I'm having fun.

36
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,019
- You're like, I'm having
so much fun doing this

37
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,152
I don't want to go anywhere.

38
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:01,546
Uh, yeah, so this is Finn's outfit.

39
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:02,823
Ollie's actually wearing his right now.

40
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:03,952
And we're gonna go pick him up,

41
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:05,358
and we're gonna go meet Santa.

42
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:06,592
Are you gonna tell him what you want?

43
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:07,425
- Yeah!

44
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:08,445
- [Missy] Chocolate face?

45
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:10,637
- Oh, hey, Finny Foo Foo.

46
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,937
He's racing his bike around
the house like always.

47
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:16,159
Good morning guys.

48
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,326
Today's a fun day because we
are going to see Santa Claus.

49
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:24,591
Not just any Santa Claus.

50
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:26,486
I'm just going to clarify at
the beginning of this video,

51
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,215
this is the real Santa Claus.

52
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:31,434
Ollie and the boys have been
going to see him for years now.

53
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:33,273
I don't know why I'm wearing
my sunglasses inside.

54
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:34,645
I'm in front of a very bright window

55
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:35,857
in case you were wondering.

56
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:36,874
And that's how that works.

57
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:37,707
Okay.

58
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:39,082
Yes, we're going to see
Santa, and I'm so excited.

59
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,415
Hey Jibo! Do you like Santa?

60
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,315
- [Jibo] I haven't thought
about that, but I can tell you

61
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:47,100
I really like dancing.

62
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,152
- Oh, cool.

63
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:50,485
Now my pet robot is dancing.

64
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:53,356
You dancing with Jibo?

65
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:54,825
(Bryan laughs)

66
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,365
You're so cute, dude.

67
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:59,131
Uh yeah. We are getting
ready to go pick up Ollie

68
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:01,541
early from school and we
are gonna go see Santa,

69
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,885
and I am so excited.

70
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:06,647
Also, check out this amazing
succulent wreath I got

71
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:08,310
for the door of my office.

72
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,900
I got this from Restoration Hardware.

73
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,934
It was on sale for Black Friday.

74
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,446
And I thought it was so
cool because it's like

75
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:15,749
kind of Christmasy, but
also like, kinda something

76
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,756
I can hang up for a
while until they all die

77
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:18,740
or it falls apart.

78
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,069
I have a pretty cool succulent wreath,

79
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,931
and then per some of your
guys' suggestion on Twitter,

80
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,302
I added a little red bow to it.

81
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:25,961
So I made it a little more Christmasy,

82
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:27,106
but how cool is that?

83
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:27,939
I love that.

84
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,481
- [Finn] Ah Dah!

85
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,492
- [Bryan] Finn, you're crazy!

86
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:33,306
Hey, let's go get Ollie, kay?

87
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:34,210
- [Finn] Kay!

88
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,351
- [Bryan] Let's go get Ollie.

89
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,273
Go, go, go, go, go.

90
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:38,355
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

91
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:39,582
- [Finn] Ollie!

92
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:41,711
- Hey Finn, are you excited to see Santa?

93
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:42,544
- Yeah!

94
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:44,033
- Yeah? What are you gonna ask him for?

95
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,283
- I don't know.

96
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,558
- [Bryan] Oh, one of those?

97
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:49,391
- Yeah.

98
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:50,224
- Okay, cool.

99
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:51,807
(Missy laughs)

100
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:52,845
- No idea.

101
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:56,548
- [Ollie] Hey dad, I look
funny with that face.

102
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:57,381
- [Bryan] Yeah you do.

103
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:58,307
You didn't like the soup?

104
00:02:58,307 --> 00:02:59,344
- [Ollie] Yeah.

105
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,884
Bye!

106
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:02,444
- [Bryan] You saying
"bye" to all your friends?

107
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:03,858
- Going to see Santa!

108
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,140
- Yes we are!

109
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,693
Just picking up Ollie from school.

110
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:08,112
How was your day at school?

111
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:08,945
- Good.

112
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:09,778
- Good?

113
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:10,717
So we're getting him out
of school early today.

114
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:13,768
We're going to go get lunch and
we're going to go see Santa.

115
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:14,601
That's exciting?

116
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:15,596
- Yeah.

117
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,834
- [Bryan] You know what
you're going to ask him?

118
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,576
- A Power Ranger toy!

119
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,155
- [Bryan] Finn is getting
ready to go see Santa!

120
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:22,996
- [Ollie] Hi guys!

121
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:23,829
- [Bryan] What do you think?

122
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,876
Does Finn look good?

123
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,839
- [Missy] Finn looks real good.

124
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,799
- [Ollie] Funny.

125
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,138
- [Bryan] You're looking good, buddy.

126
00:03:29,138 --> 00:03:31,206
(laughs)

127
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:35,836
We have arrived at Santa Town
and we're gonna go see Santa.

128
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,984
Um, you guys, I'm really proud of myself

129
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,475
because they both look adorable,
but they're not matching.

130
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:40,317
- Yeah.

131
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,693
Normally we have the boys
matching, like, all the time.

132
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:43,576
No matter what.

133
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:44,672
- Okay, I'm just saying, though,

134
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:45,757
if they did have two of these,

135
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,093
I'd probably put Ollie in it too.

136
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,276
- [Bryan] Look at that bow tie, dude.

137
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:50,109
- Yeah!

138
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:51,036
- [Bryan] Looking shnazzy.

139
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:53,328
- We're going to see Santa!

140
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:54,548
- [Bryan] Yes we are!

141
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:56,469
The boys are all ready to go see Santa.

142
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,808
Are you ready to enter Santa Town?

143
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:58,867
- Yeah!

144
00:03:58,867 --> 00:03:59,751
- [Bryan] Let's go, boys.

145
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:02,660
(Christmas music)

146
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,002
- [Missy] You writing a note to Santa now?

147
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,374
It says, "Dear Santa,

148
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,897
My name is Oliver.

149
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:09,321
I am a boy.

150
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,251
I would like the following for Christmas:"

151
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,597
And that says "a Power Ranger, games,"

152
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:17,218
so a Power Ranger and then games,

153
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:19,231
and then, do you want to
write a few things you want?

154
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:20,132
A few more things?

155
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:20,964
- No.

156
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:21,797
- [Missy] No?

157
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:22,631
- No.

158
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,464
- [Missy] Just a Power
Ranger, and then some games?

159
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,639
- Do you want to draw him anything, Ollie?

160
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,325
You should draw him a chicken.

161
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,483
Would that be funny?

162
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:29,878
- No.

163
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:30,711
- [Bryan] No.

164
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,544
(Christmas music)

165
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:49,348
- [Bryan] Finn is asking for
some toy cars and a tool set.

166
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:51,876
- I just colored a power tool.

167
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:52,873
- Oh cool!

168
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:54,206
Good job, buddy.

169
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:56,876
So when the boys met Santa,

170
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:59,038
he gave us some very
special signs that say

171
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,011
"Santa stop here."

172
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,476
Ollie, do you know what those are for?

173
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:02,309
- What?

174
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:04,164
- [Bryan] So when you go to
bed on Christmas Eve night,

175
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:05,537
we can put this in the window

176
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:07,039
so Santa knows you guys are asleep,

177
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,637
and then he come come to our house, okay?

178
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,079
- And then he'll stop, because it says

179
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,917
"Santa stop here."

180
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:12,750
Okay?

181
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,583
- Okay.

182
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,416
- Okay.

183
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,494
- [Bryan] It's like a Santa stop sign.

184
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:17,075
- All right, should we go
put these in the mail box

185
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:17,908
and send them?

186
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,186
- [Bryan] Go ahead,
buddy, pop your letter in.

187
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,725
Just put it right in there.

188
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:21,808
There you go.

189
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,789
Sending letters to Santa.

190
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,612
Thanks, Ollie, helping
your little brother.

191
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:31,445
(Christmas music)

192
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:38,120
We are now doing some ornament decorating.

193
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,780
Finn is coloring a little bear.

194
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,550
And Ollie's coloring a
little gingerbread man.

195
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,867
- We have glue and glitter if you want.

196
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,449
- [Bryan] Ooh, cool.

197
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,919
- [Missy] If you want glitter,

198
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,226
you got to add the glue first, okay?

199
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,059
(Christmas music)

200
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:01,874
- [Ollie] Glitter time!

201
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:02,989
- [Bryan] Yeah!

202
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:06,883
- [Missy] Be really careful
when you sprinkle it.

203
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:07,716
Yes.

204
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:09,362
And then watch, you just go like this.

205
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:10,993
- [Bryan] Whoa, it's got glitter!

206
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:11,826
- [Missy] It stuck to it.

207
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:12,659
- [Bryan] Cool, dude.

208
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:14,261
All right, the kids are now gonna

209
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:16,322
put their ornaments on the tree.

210
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:17,765
Go ahead, dude.

211
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:19,207
Ooh, I like that spot.

212
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:21,004
Is that one yours, Ollie?

213
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:21,837
Good job.

214
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:22,843
You hung yours on the tree?

215
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:23,676
- Yeah.

216
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:24,509
- Yeah.

217
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,931
So if you guys come down
here to Santa Town in

218
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,353
Temecula, you can see the boys' ornaments

219
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:29,802
on the tree they have here.

220
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:32,080
Super cute place, the boys had a blast.

221
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,330
That's so cool.

222
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:37,281
(Christmas music)

223
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,399
- Coming to town.

224
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,184
- [Bryan] Finn's so
excited cause Santa Claus

225
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:06,287
is coming to town.

226
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:09,787
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice.

227
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,525
- [Missy and Bryan] Santa
Claus is coming to town.

228
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:14,358
- Oh yeah!

229
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,794
He's so excited.

230
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:18,870
- He like, says "Mama! Ting!"

231
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,695
- [Bryan] Yeah, he like,
demanded that she sing.

232
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:21,536
It's so funny.

233
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:24,119
(upbeat music)

234
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,934
- All right, we just got home,

235
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,995
and the boys are excited to be here.

236
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:40,750
Ollie's been a little
bummed today, though,

237
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,356
because you haven't been
able to find Fred, huh?

238
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:43,189
- Yeah.

239
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:44,022
- What?

240
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,528
Oh, how did you find him that fast?

241
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:48,511
Was he there this morning?

242
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,855
I'll tell you this:

243
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:50,712
he was not here this morning,

244
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:52,948
and he was not here when I left, Ollie.

245
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:53,916
So he must have showed up.

246
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,377
Okay, you want to see what it says?

247
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:56,210
- Yeah.

248
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,651
- [Missy] It says, "I'm
back and I missed you."

249
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,818
He missed you.

250
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:05,333
All right, Fred, what have you been up to?

251
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:09,088
He said, "I hid six candy
canes in the living room.

252
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,729
Can you find them?"

253
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:11,784
(gasp)

254
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:14,254
Can you find the candy cane?

255
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:16,437
Oh, Finn already found one.

256
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,454
What the?

257
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:19,112
How are you so good at that?

258
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:19,945
All right.

259
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:20,778
We got one.

260
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,130
Can you find any more?

261
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,146
Looking on the Christmas tree.

262
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:25,114
Can you see any?

263
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:25,947
- No.

264
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:27,064
- [Missy] We actually
don't have candy canes

265
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:28,251
on the Christmas tree.

266
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:29,185
All right, we're having trouble.

267
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:31,483
Ollie's gonna check the fire place.

268
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:32,361
- [Ollie] (gasp)

269
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,232
- [Missy] Do you see one?

270
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:34,065
- Yeah!

271
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:34,898
- [Missy] Go get it!

272
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:35,851
Yay!

273
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,067
All right, that's two.

274
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:37,900
Right?

275
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,732
- Yeah.

276
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:39,565
- [Missy] Okay.

277
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,703
- Now, let's see if we
can make a mustache.

278
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:44,292
- Ooh.

279
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,542
Watch mama make a mustache.

280
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,066
- [Ollie] I wanna see!

281
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,899
- [Finn] (laughs)

282
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:53,867
- (giggles)

283
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,700
All right.

284
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,533
We still need four more, guys.

285
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:56,644
Where are all these candy canes?

286
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:58,260
I think Fred might have made
it a little too hard to find.

287
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,093
So let's see.

288
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:00,732
Hmm.

289
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:01,880
Do you see anything?

290
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,713
- [Finn] Ooh!

291
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:03,546
- [Ollie] No.

292
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,379
- [Missy] No?

293
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,212
Do you see one?

294
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,045
- Mama!

295
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,878
- [Missy] Oh look!

296
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,860
I think he found one.

297
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,277
Finn, you did it.

298
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,119
- [Ollie] I thought that
was one disappeared.

299
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,196
- Oh my gosh, Finn.

300
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:16,740
You saw that from across
the room, didn't you?

301
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,136
Um, Finn has found two
now, and Ollie's found one.

302
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,300
That is so funny.

303
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,589
Finn, you're getting to be such a big boy.

304
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,602
Okay, we still have three more to find.

305
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:27,065
- [Bryan] Hey you guys, Fred's back!

306
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:30,033
- [Missy] Yeah, he hid six candy canes.

307
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:30,866
- What?

308
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:31,821
That trickster.

309
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,654
- [Missy] We've only been able to find--

310
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:33,487
- [Bryan] Ooh, is this one?

311
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:34,320
- [Missy] (gasp)

312
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,262
We've only been able to find four.

313
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,642
Daddy found one!

314
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:37,792
- [Finn] (laughs)

315
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,176
- [Missy] Yay!

316
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:40,426
Okay, two more.

317
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,556
- [Ollie] I see one!

318
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:45,389
- [Missy] Where?

319
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,477
- [Bryan] Do you see it, buddy?

320
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:47,310
- [Ollie] Right there!

321
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,060
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

322
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:50,888
- [Bryan] Here you go, dude.

323
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:52,161
- [Missy] All right, you got two.

324
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:53,769
Okay, the next person wins.

325
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,345
Who's gonna find it?

326
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,314
Ollie or Finn?

327
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:57,147
- Are they tied?

328
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:57,980
- [Missy] Yeah.

329
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,813
They each found two.

330
00:09:58,813 --> 00:09:59,763
Finn legit found two.

331
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:00,596
- That's awesome.

332
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:02,327
- Like, before Ollie.

333
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:03,602
Are you checking the tree?

334
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,648
Check it again, see if you see anything.

335
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:06,904
There's a lot of stuff on here.

336
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:10,154
It could be easily mistaken, or missed.

337
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:14,378
- [Ollie] There's a young Fred.

338
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:16,834
- [Missy] Oh, there he is. There's Fred.

339
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,993
- Where's the candy cane, guys?

340
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:21,052
I'll check on this side, up here.

341
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,394
Ollie, you check on that side.

342
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:23,477
Look up high.

343
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,259
Is it in there?

344
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,934
Is it inside the middle of the tree?

345
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:28,767
- [Finn] Fa!

346
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,195
- [Bryan] Here Finn, you wanna look?

347
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:31,373
- [Ollie] Hey!

348
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,190
- Oh do you see it?

349
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,023
- [Ollie] Yeah!

350
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:34,856
- All right.

351
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:35,689
- [Missy] Finn, do you see it?

352
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:36,522
- [Finn] Yeah.

353
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:37,355
- [Missy] Where is it?

354
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:38,188
- [Finn] Right there.

355
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:39,571
- [Missy] Right there!

356
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,055
You did it.

357
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:42,941
- [Finn] Yay!

358
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,322
- Yay, you found all the candy canes.

359
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:47,011
- Aw, that was a fun game.

360
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,052
Thanks for playing a game with us, Fred.

361
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:50,375
That was so cool, huh.

362
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,801
How neat.

363
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,439
Fred is the coolest guy.

364
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,238
Now we get these awesome candy canes.
