1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:01,106
- But I was gonna say--

2
00:00:01,106 --> 00:00:02,813
Oh my gosh, there's a ghost!

3
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:04,837
(screaming)

4
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:05,768
A ghost!

5
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:07,272
(screaming)

6
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:08,347
There's a big ghost on me!

7
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:09,406
What am I gonna do?

8
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:10,736
Who am I gonna call?

9
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:11,903
- Ghostbuster.

10
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:13,861
♫ This is our life

11
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:14,694
♫ This is our fun

12
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:17,702
♫ This is who we are

13
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:18,726
♫ This is our dream

14
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,061
♫ This is our team,

15
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,411
♫ Chill out among the stars

16
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:24,837
♫ Take this shield it will be fine

17
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:27,146
♫ Take this hand and we'll just shine

18
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:29,307
♫ This is our life

19
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:31,282
♫ Let's live it

20
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,393
♫ Liver upper

21
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:34,248
- Good mornin'!

22
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:35,935
- Good morning!

23
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,638
Good morning (laughs)

24
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,902
It is a beautiful Sunday morning.

25
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:42,073
Luna is like going crazy right now.

26
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:46,064
She is enjoying this amazing
Sunday morning with us.

27
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:47,732
Actually, it is really nice weather.

28
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:49,730
It's kind of chilly out.

29
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,377
It's not chilly, but
definitely not hot or warm.

30
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:54,923
Me and the boys are all ready for church,

31
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:56,354
but unfortunately,

32
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:58,929
Bryan is just not feeling
good this morning.

33
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,566
The boys have had a little bit of a cough

34
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:02,794
for the past week.

35
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:04,334
And it's pretty much gone,

36
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:08,087
but it looks like Bryan has got it now.

37
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:10,463
He always tends to get
the leftover sickness.

38
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:11,851
Even if, like, I never get it,

39
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,313
Bryan always ends up getting it.

40
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:15,430
He just doesn't have as good
of an immune system, I guess.

41
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,152
But anyways, I think that me and the boys

42
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:19,147
are still going to head to
church, because we are all ready.

43
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:20,702
And Bryan was trying to get ready,

44
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:22,096
and he was like 'I just don't feel good,

45
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:23,929
'I don't think that I'm going to make it.'

46
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:25,212
And I was like all right,
well, we're still going to go.

47
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:26,774
We're going to have a good time, huh?

48
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:28,900
Who do you guys have?

49
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,742
- Papa!

50
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:31,127
- [Missy] Papa!

51
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,516
They were so excited when they saw Papa.

52
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:34,426
- I that Mimi here?

53
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:35,371
- [Missy] Is Mimi here?

54
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:36,204
- Yeah!

55
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:37,877
- [Missy] Yeah, oh my goodness!

56
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:38,925
- You saw one?

57
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:39,758
- Yeah!

58
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:41,893
- [Missy] How did you guys do at church?

59
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,726
Did you have fun?

60
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:43,559
- Good!

61
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,606
- [Missy] What did you do?

62
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:48,343
- I colored and I played at Diego's.

63
00:01:48,343 --> 00:01:49,776
- [Missy] Ollie's Church
and Finn's Church?

64
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,076
You guys go to separate churches?

65
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:52,006
- Yeah!

66
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:53,011
That's Finn's house.

67
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,064
And that's mine.

68
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:55,564
- Oh, interesting!

69
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:59,095
We have now made it to
the furniture store.

70
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:00,144
I'm with my mom and dad,

71
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:02,650
and we're looking at a few
different furniture items

72
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,815
for their house,

73
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:05,536
because their house is definitely lacking

74
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:07,044
in some furniture right now.

75
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,372
But we're looking specifically,

76
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:11,094
for the top loft area, a small couch.

77
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:13,167
Here's a couple of really
cute ones, actually.

78
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,168
Not too big.

79
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,826
- The one with the tape on it.

80
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:16,674
- Oh yeah.

81
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:17,798
See, it's big!

82
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:19,129
It might be too big.

83
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:20,328
But yeah, we're just looking.

84
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:22,627
The boys are kinda going
out of their minds.

85
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:24,645
Like, get me out of here.

86
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,212
- Help me.

87
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,780
- You want out?

88
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,776
Yeah, you need to sit down on your bottom.

89
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,743
So, we are now looking at bunk beds

90
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:34,229
for the boys' room.

91
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,716
And, Mom, I think I found the perfect one.

92
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:39,273
Because the truth is that,
that room is the boys',

93
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:41,067
and Cassie has a downstairs room

94
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,783
that she can stay in
when she comes and stays.

95
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:44,933
But she kind of wants
to stay upstairs too.

96
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,975
So she wants to just
sleep in the boys' room.

97
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,758
And I found,

98
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:52,220
I found the solution!

99
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,448
Three bunk beds!

100
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:54,903
Is this even considered a bunk bed?

101
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:56,403
Is this a tri-bed?

102
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:58,216
I don't know.

103
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:02,345
I say that Cassie has
to sleep on the bottom.

104
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:03,667
Yeah.

105
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,677
And then there's Finn, then there's Ollie.

106
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:09,298
Probably opposite, but it's just so funny.

107
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,435
I would be so scared to be this person.

108
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:14,014
It just looks very
claustrophobic in there.

109
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:16,020
But I didn't even know
those were a real thing.

110
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,277
It's called a triple decker bunk bed.

111
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:21,973
- I mean, I wouldn't put
a ceiling fan in the room.

112
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,730
- [Missy] Yeah, seriously, ouch.

113
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,029
- We forgot our tape measure,

114
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:27,167
so the only way we can
measure how big it is,

115
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,432
we know we have six feet,

116
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:30,621
we have to put Missy on the ground.

117
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:31,621
- I'm 5'2''.

118
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:33,722
- [Papa] Yeah.

119
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:34,555
- [Mimi] You are not 5'2''.

120
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,291
- [Papa] So, that's about a 5.5' couch.

121
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,190
- I've measured myself numerous times.

122
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,766
I'm pretty sure I'm 5'2''.

123
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:43,155
- Unfortunately the kids
are going to dog pile.

124
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:43,988
We gotta get going.

125
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:45,586
We've got a lot of couches to measure.

126
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:47,167
(laughing)

127
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,764
- I am no longer with my parents.

128
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,457
And the boys saw this Halloween store,

129
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:53,454
I don't know if you guys can see it,

130
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:55,743
and they were like, can we please stop?

131
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:58,215
Finn's like 'Halloween, Halloween'!

132
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,404
They're super excited about it.

133
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:01,313
They're just excited for
Halloween altogether.

134
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:02,639
We always have so much fun

135
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,946
throughout the whole month of October.

136
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,957
And I was like, I really
want to go there, too.

137
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:09,694
But I was like, it's so fun
to do these things with Bryan.

138
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:11,014
We just get to experience

139
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:15,098
the boys enjoying
Halloween stuff together.

140
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:17,755
And then, like, we get to
pick out stuff for them.

141
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:19,015
And it's fun to do with him.

142
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,202
But he's not feeling good today.

143
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:22,913
So, I was like, all right,
I will take you guys in,

144
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:24,269
but I'm also a little nervous.

145
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,246
I mean, going into a store
like a Halloween store

146
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:27,817
with two little boys

147
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:31,067
can be extremely hectic and very scary.

148
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:35,070
So I've already given the rules.

149
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,940
We will go in there.

150
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,138
We can look around.

151
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:38,092
He can ask me for things.

152
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:42,820
If I say no, then the answer
is no, right? (laughing)

153
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,147
And we're not going to whine

154
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:46,765
or cry or ask a million times for things.

155
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:48,096
I've got the rules set,

156
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:49,425
so I'm going to go ahead and go in there.

157
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:53,740
But if that happens, we're
leaving immediately, right?

158
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,982
Yeah, so he knows the rules.

159
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:55,815
We're going to go in.

160
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:57,169
I might actually buy a few costumes,

161
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,514
because we are super excited
for the month of October,

162
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,505
and we have a few plans for it.

163
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,847
I think we're going to go
ahead and make this attempt

164
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:09,014
of me going into the Halloween
store alone with two boys.

165
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,478
Here's the skeleton.

166
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,143
All right, boys, boys, don't beat it up.

167
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:18,807
But that is pretty scary looking, huh?

168
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:20,555
What is that Ollie?

169
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,469
(Ollie laughing)

170
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:25,388
They did not like that. (Missy laughing)

171
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,108
Oh goodness.

172
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:28,525
Come on, come on.

173
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:33,957
- Those are spiders,
(lowering voice) spiders!

174
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:34,812
(Missy laughing)

175
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,432
- [Missy] Oh my goodness,
all the superheroes!

176
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:39,986
(Finn cheering)

177
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:41,051
What else do you see?

178
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,269
- Joker!

179
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:43,556
- [Missy] Joker?

180
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:44,743
- Yeah!

181
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,242
This!

182
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:47,915
- [Missy] Is that Thor?

183
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:48,832
Yeah, Thor.

184
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:51,836
- That's me, Thor!

185
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:53,050
I'm Thor!

186
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,657
- [Missy] Captain America!

187
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:57,456
Oh my gosh, what is that?

188
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,539
Is that Hulk?

189
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:03,400
Look at all the baby costumes!

190
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,998
I'm obsessed.

191
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,498
These are so cute!

192
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:08,679
Who's that?

193
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,078
Yeah, that's Olaf!

194
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:14,859
(gasping) What is that?

195
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,942
A Captain America shield?

196
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,206
- Look, a Superman gun!

197
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:23,140
- [Missy] Wow!

198
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,415
Get over here, Finn!

199
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,748
(fun music)

200
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:29,885
- Well, hey guys.

201
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:32,828
It has been just a very
chill day at the house.

202
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:34,277
Missy has been out with the boys

203
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,450
doing some October 1st things.

204
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,420
Happy October 1st!

205
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,610
That's exciting!

206
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,482
But yeah, nothing out of the ordinary

207
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,341
has been happening much here today,

208
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:42,643
but I was going to say that--

209
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,147
Oh my gosh, there's a ghost!

210
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:45,230
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

211
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,369
A ghost!

212
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:50,036
Ahhhhhhhhhhh, it's attacking me!

213
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,543
Ahhhhhhh, there's a big ghost on me!

214
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,350
What am I gonna do?

215
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,697
I've gotta get rid of this ghost!

216
00:06:58,697 --> 00:06:59,530
Ahhhhhhhh!

217
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,785
Who am I gonna call?

218
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:05,035
- Ghostbusters!

219
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,631
(exciting music)

220
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:10,048
(explosions)

221
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:19,171
(booming explosion)

222
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:24,687
(crashing explosion)

223
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:26,088
(cups breaking explosion)

224
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:27,362
(thundering explosion)

225
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:31,529
(terrifying ghost monster screaming)

226
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:36,765
(clacking crashing)

227
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:39,182
(evil laugh)

228
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,591
(multiple rounds of clacking crashing)

229
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:48,250
(audience cheering and applauding)

230
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,746
- Oh, Ollie, thank goodness!

231
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,633
I heard you were a Ghostbuster, right?

232
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:52,466
- Yeah!

233
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,418
- All right, well, I've
got a pretty nasty ghost.

234
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:55,532
He looks just like that,

235
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:58,015
and he's terrorizing the whole house.

236
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,873
And I'm sorry to say, Ollie,
but he got to your room.

237
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,730
(ghost spookily shouting)

238
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,563
Do you hear him?

239
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:04,396
Do you hear that evil ghost?

240
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:05,229
He tore up your room

241
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,818
and he threw all of your toys everywhere!

242
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:09,196
And all our shoes, even!

243
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,549
- This ghost has to go!

244
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:11,486
- But be warned, Ollie:

245
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:14,923
this ghost is very very very strong.

246
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:16,727
Do you think you can handle the case?

247
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:17,560
- Yes.

248
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,963
- [Bryan] All right, well
you need your little backpack

249
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:20,913
and your little gun to
suck up the ghost, right?

250
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:21,746
- Yes!

251
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:22,923
- [Bryan] All right, let's get it on.

252
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,301
- All right.

253
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:25,555
I have it right here!

254
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:26,416
- [Bryan] Well, that's convenient!

255
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,791
Let's put it on.

256
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,035
- Ghostbuster!

257
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,513
- Ghostbuster time!

258
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:32,673
Turn around and I will put your pack on.

259
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:35,049
This is what stores the ghost, right?

260
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:35,881
- Mhmm.

261
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,375
- Okay, there we go.

262
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,525
And then your gun is right here

263
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,960
attached to the backpack.

264
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:42,034
- Okay.

265
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:44,033
- So that you can suck him up, okay?

266
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,372
Just like that.

267
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:46,539
Can you do it?

268
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,946
- Let's get this ghost!

269
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:58,842
(exciting ghostbusting music)

270
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:01,305
Oh no, the ghost got all the shoes!

271
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,805
- [Bryan] I know, the ghost
threw all our shoes everywhere,

272
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:06,890
and look what they did to your pumpkins!

273
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,130
- Oh no!

274
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,107
- What do we do?

275
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,462
If you think that's
bad, Ghostbuster Ollie,

276
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:14,910
wait 'til you see what
happened in your room.

277
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,327
You're not going to be happy.

278
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,796
- That ghost threw my toys everywhere!

279
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,521
- [Bryan] He did, huh?

280
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,849
Made a big mess.

281
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:28,567
Do you see any signs of ghost in the area?

282
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,675
- Well, I do have these signs on.

283
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,201
(audience laughing)

284
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:33,331
- [Bryan] Oh, yeah, that
is a sign of a ghost.

285
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:34,487
All right, let's go outside

286
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:36,430
and see if you can hunt
this guy down, okay?

287
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,491
All right, let's see if we
can find this ghost outside.

288
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,860
I bet he's here somewhere.

289
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,693
- Ghost!

290
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:47,196
- Do you see the ghost, Ollie?

291
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:49,281
I don't see the ghost anywhere.

292
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,718
Ollie, the ghost, he
has made an appearance!

293
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:52,802
Hurry, get him!

294
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:55,135
(whooshing)

295
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:02,770
(whirring)

296
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,103
(whooshing)

297
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:12,469
You're going to jail, marshmallow ghost!

298
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:14,809
(whirring)

299
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:18,714
(ghost pained grunting)

300
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:21,381
(heart beating)

301
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,142
- Welcome, Ghost!

302
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,653
(monster groaning)

303
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:29,429
- [Bryan] Whoa, you got 'em, Ollie!

304
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,233
- I got you, Ghost!

305
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,637
- You got 'em!

306
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:35,549
Look, he's normal Finn again!

307
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:37,211
That was so good!

308
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:39,833
Ghostbuster Ollie saved
the day, and, guess what,

309
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,725
there's marshmallows left over to spare.

310
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,008
Do you want a marshmallow?

311
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,647
Bite into it.

312
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:47,428
That's your reward for battling the ghost.

313
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,428
Is it yummy?

314
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:51,593
Marshmallows are always
a really yummy treat.

315
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:52,676
- I'm sorry.

316
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:53,820
- [Bryan] Yeah!

317
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,247
Hey, Finn, did you have fun
pretending to be a ghost?

318
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:57,112
- Yeah.

319
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:57,945
- Yeah!

320
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,861
He destroyed the whole house, didn't he?

321
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:01,871
Now that mean old ghost, Ollie,

322
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,833
he's stored in your backpack.

323
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,341
And he'll never bother us again, okay?

324
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,980
He's like 'Say whatever you want, Dad.

325
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,660
'These marshmallows are amazing!'

326
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,960
(laughing)

327
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,682
Say 'I'm a chubby bunny.'

328
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,686
(mumbling)

329
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:16,420
(laughing)

330
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,881
Finn, say 'I'm a chubby bunny.'

331
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:19,300
(gurgling)

332
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,625
(laughing)

333
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,365
(Finn exclaiming a really
important discovery)

334
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,365
Oh really?

335
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,650
Finn has so much energy
right now you guys.

336
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,630
I don't even know what we're
going to do with him tonight.

337
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,923
Whoa, kiddo, calm down. (laughing)

338
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:35,857
He's in full on play mode. (laughing)

339
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:38,220
I'm so happy that it is October 1st,

340
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,438
because we get to start
all the fun October things.

341
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:43,063
We get to make yummy fall treats.

342
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:44,446
The boys get to dress up.

343
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:46,094
We have so many cool costumes

344
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:47,486
and fun things planned for this month.

345
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:49,312
I think you guys are going
to really, really enjoy it.

346
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:52,365
But it's just so fun to
get to see them dress up

347
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,264
and play pretend,

348
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,553
and like put on little skits.

349
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:56,929
They love doing that.

350
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:58,912
(groaning menacingly)

351
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:00,116
Zombie ghostbuster, ahh!

352
00:12:00,116 --> 00:12:03,228
Don't eat me zombie! (laughing)

353
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:05,561
(fun music)

354
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:08,795
So, I thought this was funny.

355
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,668
I ordered these trick-or-treat
bags from Pottery Barn,

356
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:14,539
and I got them customized
with all the kids' names.

357
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,041
So, we have them for all these cousins

358
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,469
and friends and stuff.

359
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,428
And this one came with Julia.

360
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:21,483
I do not know Julia, but we
are actually missing Ollie.

361
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:22,527
So now I have to email them

362
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,764
and see if they can send us a new one

363
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:26,301

373
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:45,860

He's like, 'I'm going to climb up.'

384
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:09,978
- All right, we've got an
orange one and a red one.

385
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:11,501

398
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,382

their favorite candy is?
