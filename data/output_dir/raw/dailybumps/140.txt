1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:01,474
- All right, you guys.

2
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:03,295
I think it is time we talk

3
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,895
about something a little bit serious.

4
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:06,728
- We do.

5
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:08,847
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

6
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:11,234
♫ This is who we are

7
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:13,694
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

8
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,103
♫ Shot among the stars

9
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:18,727
♫ Take the shield and we'll be fine

10
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,331
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

11
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,983
♫ This is our life, let's live it

12
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,853
♫ Live it forever

13
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:28,172
- Good morning.

14
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:29,241
- [Ollie] Good morning.

15
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:32,180
- (laughs) What's up, Mister Horse?

16
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,316
Hey, Ollie, something's
different about your face.

17
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:36,149
- [Ollie] What?

18
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,789
- Can't quite put my finger on it.

19
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,355
Looks different though.

20
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:40,600
What's wrong with your face?

21
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,433
(Ollie shouts)

22
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,703
- Ah, there he is, good morning.

23
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:44,562
- [Ollie] Good morning.

24
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:45,395
- How's it going, dude?

25
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,041
So, today's a fun day because we just

26
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,980
have a whole film crew here in our house.

27
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,526
And Missy's filming something
very special this morning.

28
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:52,736
This horse is eating me (yells).

29
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,770
Missy's filming something
really cool all day today.

30
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,252
So, Ollie wanted to put on his horse head

31
00:00:56,252 --> 00:00:57,831
and scare everyone.

32
00:00:57,831 --> 00:00:59,094
- [Ollie] I'll scare them.

33
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:00,273
- [Bryan] Go scare, mama, okay?

34
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:01,749
Scare mama.

35
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,358
(yells)

36
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:05,197
Got a crazy horse.

37
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:06,655
- That's so scary.

38
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:09,466
(Bryan laughs)

39
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,004
- [Bryan] He's like
going around the house,

40
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,221
scaring the whole crew
with his horse head on.

41
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:14,338
It's so funny.

42
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:18,629
- I would say you can't see,
that's what I'm thinking.

43
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:22,062
- [Bryan] (laughs) He just
climbed all over that producer.

44
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,069
You wanna go scare more people?

45
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:24,902
Come on, Ollie.

46
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:27,324
- [Corbin] Ollie, can I have a ride?

47
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:28,443
- [Bryan] Are you a zombie horse?

48
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:29,624
- [Corbin] Getting on my horse.

49
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:30,660
- Zombie horse.

50
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,536
Trying to keep the boys happy

51
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:35,448
while Missy is in there
filming some stuff.

52
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:36,539
I actually lucked out

53
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,564
because it's only gonna be
Missy and the boys on camera.

54
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:41,521
So, I kind of got to take
it easy a little bit today.

55
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,576
But I do feel bad for Missy

56
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:45,044
because she's still sore from the rock gym

57
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:46,989
and she's got a full day

58
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:49,506
of being on set and being filmed all day.

59
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:51,349
Well, it's not like we're not used to it

60
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,955
'cause we film all day every day anyway.

61
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:55,761
The boys were getting a little ancy inside

62
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:56,991
so we're playing.

63
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,187
That's a cool cave, dude.

64
00:01:58,187 --> 00:01:59,020
- Yeah.

65
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,096
- [Bryan] Is there anything neat in there?

66
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:00,929
- No.

67
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:01,762
- [Bryan] Any animals?

68
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:02,595
- No.

69
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:05,374
- [Bryan] No, Finn, here, drive up here.

70
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:07,928
Oh, no, it looks like
Luna got to your car, huh?

71
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,274
- [Papa] We were storing it back there.

72
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:12,060
- [Bryan] Yeah, we asked for it.

73
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,196
- [Finn] Luna.

74
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:14,911
- Luna got it, yeah.

75
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:15,911
That's okay.

76
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,254
(upbeat music)

77
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,525
All right, you guys.

78
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,511
I think it is time we talk

79
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,095
about something a little bit serious.

80
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:28,720
- We do.

81
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,555
- Speaking of, look what
he's doing right now.

82
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:32,213
- I know.

83
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:34,065
- Okay, so, this is
what's going on, you guys.

84
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:36,006
For the past couple of weeks,

85
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:37,274
Finn has been--

86
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:38,392
- He's picked up a new habit.

87
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,544
- [Bryan] A new habit.

88
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:41,871
And he twirls his hair in his finger.

89
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,074
- It is so cute.

90
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,795
- [Bryan] It's seriously so cute.

91
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,441
He does it when he cuddles (laughs).

92
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,419
- When he wants to like
relax, just like cuddle.

93
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,957
Or he's getting tired, it's just twirl.

94
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:53,925
- But it's created a
little bit of a problem.

95
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:56,675
And I'm gonna show you right now.

96
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,606
- Who who ha ha ha.

97
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:00,891
- [Bryan] Are you being a little monkey?

98
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,473
- Show mom how you twirl your hair.

99
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,878
- [Bryan] Can you twirl your hair?

100
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:04,851
Twirl your hair.

101
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,040
- No, he's not gonna do it right now.

102
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,873
- [Bryan] Do you guys see

103
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:08,075
this little chunk of hair right here?

104
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:12,164
He has literally created
a huge knot in his hair.

105
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:13,528
- [Missy] I mean, it's like a dread lock.

106
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,758
- [Bryan] It's like a dread lock.

107
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,199
Oh, and he hates when you touch it.

108
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,457
- I think it's pulling too

109
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:18,627
'cause it's got so many hairs.

110
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,368
- [Bryan] It's bothering him.

111
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,958
- If you like do anything
with it, it pulls.

112
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:23,791
- [Bryan] Yeah.

113
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:24,681
- [Missy] I can't get it out.

114
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:27,360
I think there is actually
like grass in there.

115
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,097
- [Bryan] Stuff in it, yeah.

116
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:31,403
(laughs) It's so weird.

117
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,715
- And he looks for that
one specifically too.

118
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,558
'Cause he feels it and
he just twirls that one.

119
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:36,771
- He likes to twirl it, yeah.

120
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:38,243
So, today,

121
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:39,076
we are

122
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:42,256
going to give Finn his very first haircut.

123
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,089
- [Missy] Yep.

124
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,197
- It's kind of a bitter sweet day

125
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:45,624
because he's almost two.

126
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,437
He still has not had an official haircut.

127
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:49,506
I don't know if this is even gonna count.

128
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:51,107
- I had a pirate birthday!

129
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:55,167
- (laughs) But we are
going to cut the dread lock

130
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,184
from his hair now.

131
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:57,017
- We have to.

132
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,633
- [Bryan] We have to.

133
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,019
It's gotta go, okay?

134
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,498
It's gotta go, okay, Finn?

135
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:04,854
All right, Finn, Mimi's got the scissors.

136
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:05,767
It's got to go.

137
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,847
- [Missy] Gonna give
him his first haircut.

138
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,050
- [Bryan] Ready, dude?

139
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,776
(lighthearted music)

140
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:13,609
Done.

141
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:14,627
- [Missy] Oh, my gosh.

142
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:16,094
- [Bryan] Normal hair again.

143
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:16,980
- [Missy] It's done.

144
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,838
- [Bryan] It's gone, buddy,
it won't bug you anymore.

145
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:19,995
Isn't that nice?

146
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:20,940
- [Mimi] Put that in his baby book?

147
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,773
- [Missy] Yeah.

148
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:22,607
- [Bryan] Oh, my gosh.

149
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,153
Baby's first dread lock.
- Look at that.

150
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:25,296
(Bryan laughs)

151
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,487
This is a big knot, yeah.

152
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:29,594
I mean, it's a thick knot.

153
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:31,410
There is so much hair in there.

154
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,243
That's crazy.

155
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,630
- I know, that is crazy, he's okay.

156
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,582
He's better now that's he's
got that out of his hair.

157
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:38,570
(laughs) Finn is just so funny.

158
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,298
He's like got his own personality.

159
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:43,292
He's got his own little
habits and hobbies.

160
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:44,581
And it's so funny.

161
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,754
- I think of him as just like a baby.

162
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:46,587
- [Bryan] Yeah.

163
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,420
- Like he's still a baby.

164
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,506
- [Bryan] He wants to be babied too.

165
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:50,601
- He just wants to be a baby forever.

166
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:53,215
- [Bryan] (laughs) I think it'll be nicer

167
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,747
without that on his head.

168
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:56,174
- I know, it was actually
really bugging him.

169
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:57,741
Like, every time I like touched his head.

170
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:58,574
He'd be like, "Ow."

171
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:01,657
(lighthearted music)

172
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,158
- Good job, buddy.

173
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:08,082
Ollie, come here.

174
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,740
What did you just do?

175
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,538
Did you just do a shot?

176
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,085
Are you my little actor, buddy?

177
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:14,444
(laughs) I love you.

178
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,417
Hey, I love you.

179
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,201
Thanks for being such a good boy.

180
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,125
This is his new hairspray.

181
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,901
It smells like cotton candy, huh?

182
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,469
Here, smell my hair.

183
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,399
Does it smell like cotton candy?

184
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,617
- Ew!
- No, it smells good.

185
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,398
- No, it doesn't.

186
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:30,981
(upbeat music)

187
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,646
- [Bryan] Hey, Finn, do
you wanna see the fishies?

188
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:36,479
- [Finn] Yeah.

189
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,646
- [Bryan] Yeah, the fishies
are doing so good, you guys.

190
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:44,034
They're just clowning around in there.

191
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,511
(laughs) That's your dad's joke.

192
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,344
- (laughs) I know.

193
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:47,525
- [Bryan] I can't steal it.

194
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:48,358
- Clowning around.

195
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,332
- [Bryan] They're in
such a good mood though.

196
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,165
They're just chilling out.

197
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:50,998
Where's Phoenix?

198
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:51,831
He was just here.

199
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:52,664
- He just came in here.

200
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:54,684
- [Bryan] Oh, he must
be afraid of the kids.

201
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:56,313
- [Missy] I think Ollie
scared him (laughs).

202
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:57,999
- I see my bud.

203
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:58,953
- [Bryan] You see what?

204
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,168
- My bud.

205
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:01,001
- [Missy] Your bud?

206
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,584
- Yeah, my bud.

207
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,816
- [Bryan] The shrimp is your buddy?

208
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:05,649
- Yeah.

209
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:06,747
- [Bryan] Here comes Kai.

210
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:09,480
Oh, he's catching some shrimp (laughs).

211
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,630
- [Missy] Wait, he's eating shrimp?

212
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,856
- [Bryan] Yeah, he likes to eat shrimp.

213
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:12,792
I think he's a shrimp.

214
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,550
(Missy laughs)

215
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,016
There they go.

216
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:18,599
(upbeat music)

217
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,228
Ollie, what did we find?

218
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,917
- A snake, a baby snake!

219
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,222
- [Bryan] We got a baby snake.

220
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:27,238
Kelsey actually found it.

221
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,101
Oh, there he is!

222
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,883
- [Ollie] Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

223
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:30,716
- [Bryan] Get it!

224
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,439
(Bryan yells)

225
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,437
- That is so cool.

226
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,565
- [Bryan] (laughs) Ollie likes snakes,

227
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:37,815
in case you didn't know.

228
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,020
- [Missy] Yeah, I don't know what kind.

229
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,135
- That is a cool looking snake.

230
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:44,479
It is black and it has
a red line at its neck.

231
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
People are probably
Googling while watching this

232
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,848
and they're like, "Oh, yeah.

233
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:50,714
"That's actually the most
poisonous snake in the world."

234
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:51,745
Missy's trying to put it
in a bucket right now.

235
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,298
- It is a very crazy snake.

236
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,146
But I'm excited to figure out what it is.

237
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,375
- [Bryan] You want to see it (laughs)?

238
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,208
- I can't get it.

239
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,449
- Where's Papa when you need him?

240
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,195
(Missy yells)

241
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:03,852
Oh, he went under the concrete (laughs).

242
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:04,731
That was a cool snake though.

243
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,925
Maybe we'll see him again, you guys.

244
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:09,287
(laughs) Missy's so determined.

245
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,242
- [Missy] What, where is it?

246
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:12,963
- (laughs) You gotta be

247
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:15,116
really careful with snakes, right, boys?

248
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,616
- But where is it?

249
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:19,714
I can't see it, you guys.

250
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:22,435
(upbeat music)

251
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:25,511
- So, we Googled it and it's
called Ring-necked snake

252
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,608
and it's slightly venomous.

253
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,018
Although, it's usually like never

254
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,540
like a real threat to humans.

255
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,373
- [Missy] What, really?

256
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:33,134
- [Bryan] Yeah and it
says they're nocturnal.

257
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:34,822
So, it's interesting that
it's out during the day.

258
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,337
- I'm so bummed I didn't get it.

259
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:37,652
- I know, we finally saw a snake

260
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:40,293
like different than a
rattle snake (laughs).

261
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,592
Look at you, dude, you're
ready to catch a snake, huh?

262
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:44,747
You know Missy, she can't let nothing go.

263
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:45,580
- I caught it.

264
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,366
- [Bryan] She caught it (laughs).

265
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,462
Did you literally just drive up here

266
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:50,555
to see the new snake (laughs)?

267
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:51,484
- It's a beauty, look at that.

268
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:52,698
- [Bryan] It's really cool, flip it over.

269
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:53,926
Flip it over.

270
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:54,872
- [Missy] Isn't that crazy?

271
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:56,908
- [Bryan] Red, red belly.

272
00:07:56,908 --> 00:08:00,675
- I've never seen a
snake like that out here.

273
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:01,623
- [Papa] I have never.

274
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:03,450
- [Missy] He grew up here.

275
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,858
- [Bryan] It says they're nocturnal

276
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,410
and they're actually mostly in Florida.

277
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,760
- [Papa] I wonder if there's more.

278
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,920
Like, if this is a baby.

279
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,532
- Where's the nest?

280
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:14,683
- [Bryan] Yeah, it's
pretty cool though, huh?

281
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:15,716
- [Papa] Is he very fast?

282
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:17,216
- Really freaking fast.

283
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:18,522
(laughs) I'm like scared.

284
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:20,026
And he jumped at one point.

285
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:21,002
- [Bryan] Oh, gees.

286
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,167
- [Papa] Look at that dark.

287
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,843
- That's a black snake!

288
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:27,381
Like, if I saw a big one
of that, I'd be scared.

289
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,300
I would be so scared.

290
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,540
- [Bryan] Yeah (laughs).

291
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,677
- At first, I thought
it was a rattle snake

292
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,604
because of the neck went in.

293
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:33,437
Or to me, it looked like it went in.

294
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:34,491
- [Papa] The head don't look--

295
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:35,640
- It's not a rattle snake.

296
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,067
But at first, when I saw it from far away,

297
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,768
it looked like the neck
went in and popped out.

298
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:43,539
- [Bryan] Yeah, we're always
finding snakes here, huh?

299
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,009
- Silver head, gophers, and Garters.

300
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,458
- [Bryan] You caught me.

301
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,875
- [Missy] I've never seen a Ringed snake.

302
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,539
- I have never either,
I have never seen one.

303
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:52,654
- [Missy] We're gonna
have to show mom though.

304
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:55,237
(upbeat music)

305
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:01,805
Hey, boys!

306
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:04,344
- [Ollie] What?

307
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:08,390
- [Missy] It's October six
and you get your candy.

308
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,637
Are you guys excited?

309
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:10,862
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yay.

310
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:11,695
I want the red one.

311
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,271
If there's a red one in here.

312
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:15,429
- Okay, let's find out together, okay?

313
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,129
Looks like we got orange and pink.

314
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:19,326
Which one do you guys want?

315
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,159
- That.

316
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:23,126
- [Missy] You want orange?

317
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,193
Does that sound good?

318
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:25,026
- Yeah.

319
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:26,118
- (laughs) Luna's like,

320
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:28,090
"Hey, can I come in now?"

321
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,406
(laughs) You can come in,
in just a minute, okay?

322
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:32,565
Give me a minute.

323
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:35,657
Anyways, we are getting ready for bed now.

324
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:38,201
It is getting late, I need
to take my eyelashes off.

325
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:40,942
And take my makeup off and all that.

326
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:42,766
Bryan is actually out with the boys.

327
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:46,636
I mean, he's out with my dad,
my brother, Jeffry, Corbin.

328
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,533
So, they're just having
like a fun guys night.

329
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:50,142
So, I think Kelsey's
gonna actually come over

330
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:52,973
and we're gonna hang out
and do some fun stuff.

331
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:55,174
But the boys get the snack on their candy

332
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:57,251
and then it's bedtime, okay?

333
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:58,466
Yep, there it is.

334
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:01,384
(laughs) He's pretty excited.

335
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:02,691
He's pretty happy, huh?

336
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:03,779
And what are you guys watching?

337
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,129
(Finn yells)

338
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,604
- [Ollie] Nightmare before Christmas.

339
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:08,463
- Nightmare before
Christmas, watching it again.

340
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:09,954
They're addicted, you guys.

341
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:11,174
You guys love it, huh?

342
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:12,737
- They made it for Halloween.

343
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,382
- [Missy] Yeah (laughs).

344
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:15,730
- That one's a new one.

345
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,583
- Oh, that one's a new one?

346
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,586
Sounds fun.

347
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:19,757
But anyways, I think I'm just gonna

348
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,456
go ahead and end the vlog.

349
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:24,218
So, make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up.

350
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:26,718
We had so much fun today, huh?

351
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,970
Did you guys have fun?

352
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,792
It was kind of a crazy day (laughs).

353
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:34,497
What are you guys doing?

354
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:35,330
You guys are so cute.

355
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,894
