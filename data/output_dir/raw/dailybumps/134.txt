1
00:00:00,596 --> 00:00:02,021
- Ollie we made it to Disney Land

2
00:00:02,021 --> 00:00:03,391
and who do you see?

3
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,308
Whoa okay, this one's really scary.

4
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:08,532
Oh my gosh.

5
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:09,449
Oh my gosh!

6
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:13,128
You're finally big enough!

7
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:15,628
You can go on this ride Ollie.

8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,519
- That's so cute.

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,857
A baby bear!

10
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:21,880
That's so cute!

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,988
- [Missy] Hello!

12
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:25,627
- Good to see you my friends.

13
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:26,942
♫ This is our life

14
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,011
♫ This is our fun

15
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,224
♫ This is who we are

16
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:31,492
♫ This is our dream

17
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:32,738
♫ This is our team

18
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:35,141
♫ Shine among the stars

19
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:37,554
♫ Take this shield and we'll all be fine

20
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:40,506
♫ Take this hand and we'll all just shine

21
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:42,441
♫ This is our life

22
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:44,528
♫ Let's live it

23
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:46,405
♫ Live it forever

24
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:48,787
- Good morning Finn.

25
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,114
Where are we goin' today?

26
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:51,078
(mumbling)

27
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:52,696
Disney Land!

28
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:54,534
We're goin' to Disney Land.

29
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:55,830
We're so excited huh?

30
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,479
'Cause Mimi and Papa and
uncle are comin' with us.

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,431
- Yeah.

32
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:00,441
- It's gonna be so fun.

33
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:02,219
And Finn has already
started another twirl.

34
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,242
I cut one out a few days ago.

35
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:07,628
I cut one out yesterday, like last night.

36
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:09,968
And I'm gonna have to cut another one out.

37
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:11,366
I think I'm just gonna
have to cut his hair.

38
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:13,354
Because he just keeps making huge knots.

39
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:16,550
We're going to Disney Land
and this guy's so excited too.

40
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,991
- Yeah 'cause the Disney Land. (mumbles)

41
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,067
It's out now!

42
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,361
- [Missy] It's open again huh?

43
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,694
- Open!

44
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:26,243
- Yay, he's so excited.

45
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:28,642
Last time we went to
Disney Land it was closed.

46
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:30,035
And he was so sad.

47
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:31,607
But it's open now huh?

48
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:33,265
And Mimi's comin' with.

49
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:34,744
- Yay.
- Yay.

50
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:35,860
And we're off.

51
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,718
Uncle's ridin' with us.

52
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:39,125
The boys are all ready.

53
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,002
We debated between this and the truck

54
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,108
'cause the truck does have movies

55
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,562
that they can watch but,

56
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,159
the Volvo is just a lot easier
to drive than the truck.

57
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,212
So I went ahead and I'm taking the Volvo,

58
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,854
my parents are taking the truck.

59
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:52,117
And we're all headed to Disney Land,

60
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:53,293
it's gonna be such a fun day!

61
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,126
Yay!

62
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:57,093
Alright so we are on
our way to Disney Land.

63
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,807
Finn is a little upset right now.

64
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:00,092
But I thought I'd tell you guys,

65
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:02,599
if you didn't know, there
are some major fires

66
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,390
down in Southern California.

67
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,325
And there actually is one
pretty close to Disney Land.

68
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:08,508
We checked the air quality,

69
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,011
and it says that it's moderate.

70
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:12,713
So I don't think that's too bad.

71
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:15,088
But just coming down into the valley,

72
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:16,632
Finn's really upset.

73
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,384
You can like literally see
just like a haze of smoke.

74
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:21,982
And it's really kind
of like eerie looking,

75
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:23,247
it's kind of weird.

76
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,379
Alright so we are driving
passed a lot of the

77
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,172
Anaheim Hills fires that
were on the freeway.

78
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:30,794
And this is so scary.

79
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:33,293
Like I can't believe
how close this fire was

80
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:35,366
to where we're driving right now.

81
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,338
And you can see more up
here even close to like

82
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:38,565
houses and stuff.

83
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,244
Ollie we made it to Disney Land,

84
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,476
and who do you see?

85
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,187
- Ariel.
- Ariel.

86
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:46,836
Now she's not in her mermaid outfit,

87
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:47,922
she's in her dress.

88
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:50,755
But she still looks beautiful huh?

89
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,376
- Have a flower.
- She has her legs on.

90
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,919
- Yeah she has her legs on today.

91
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,299
So cool.

92
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,662
We made it!

93
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:00,863
Everyone's so excited.

94
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:03,302
In the park, they haven't gone in a while.

95
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:05,619
- I haven't been like, I feel
like it's been about a year.

96
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,004
- We're gonna have a fun day here.

97
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,879
And we definitely have to meet,

98
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,108
who do we have to meet today?

99
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,384
- Jack Skellington.

100
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:12,228
- Yeah.

101
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:13,271
He really wants to meet Jack Skellington.

102
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:16,548
And I'm making it number
one on my priority.

103
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:18,438
Look at the Storm Troopers!

104
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:19,855
How cool is that?

105
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,529
He seems pretty excited to
meet the Storm Troopers.

106
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:25,091
- Very cool!
- Very cool!

107
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:26,919
Hey Ollie, maybe we should
see if you're tall enough

108
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,625
to go on the Star Wars ride.

109
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,881
Should we see?

110
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,714
Okay.

111
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,754
Oh my gosh.
- Hang on.

112
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:35,969
- [Missy] Oh my gosh!

113
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:37,304
- Oh you're tall enough!

114
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,767
- [Missy] Oh my god!

115
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:41,215
You're finally big enough!

116
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,993
You can go on this ride Ollie.

117
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:45,475
- You're not even standing up straight.

118
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,787
- [Missy] Stand up straight.

119
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,343
- You bumped your head.

120
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:52,258
- [Papa] He's tippy-toeing.

121
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:54,122
- [Missy] I think that counts.

122
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,501
- I think he's in.

123
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,878
- [Papa] Spike his hair up.

124
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,692
- [Missy] Finn, you got a
little bit more ways to go,

125
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:00,883
okay bud?

126
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:02,815
Maybe next year?

127
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:04,862
Maybe in a couple years.

128
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:06,335
Alright we're goin on our first ride.

129
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:08,416
Mimi's got Finn, uncle's got Ollie

130
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,075
and here we go.

131
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,874
We're goin' on the rocket ship.

132
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:15,041
We seem to be going on this one a lot.

133
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:18,894
Okay, okay.

134
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:22,487
Whoa, okay, this one's really scary.

135
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:25,070
(upbeat music)

136
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:40,171
Ollie you finally get to go on Buzz huh?

137
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:42,035
And you're goin' with Papa?

138
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:44,585
Alright you defeat Zerg okay?

139
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,418
Good luck!

140
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:47,660
He's so happy.

141
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,182
Are you ready Finn, sit on your bottom.

142
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:51,352
Here's your gun.

143
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:52,616
Get him.

144
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,475
Shoot him Finn, shoot him.

145
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,833
Man you did so good!

146
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,588
2,000 points?

147
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:00,305
That's so good!

148
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:01,222
I got, 140.

149
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,093
What did you get?

150
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:05,752
(background sound drowning out papa)

151
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:06,979
- I got seven and a half.

152
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,334
- [Missy] Wow, 17 and a half?

153
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:10,515
Did you do good?

154
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:11,995
- I got seven and a half.

155
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,604

00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:17,008
- [Missy] I got 140.

00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:19,387
- [Missy] 78,000.

161
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,070
- I got only like 20,000.

162
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,041
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

163
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,826
- I'm pretty my gun was broken.

164
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:25,920
- Oh okay.

165
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,666
Well I beat all of you.

166
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,165
Me and Jimmy, came in a close second.

167
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:32,499
- Did you get the Zerg, 100,000 points?

168
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,582
- I think so.

169
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,340
Yeah I got 148.

170
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,366
Did you get 138?

171
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:38,544
- Yeah 133.

172
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:40,839
- Yeah, pretty close.

173
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,395
Alright Ollie, who are we in line for?

174
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:45,159
- Jack Skellington.

175
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,171
- You're gonna finally meet him?

176
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,396
And you know who else is there?

177
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:49,229
Sally.

178
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,495
Sally and Jack.

179
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:54,009
You luckily got a spot in line

180
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,349
and it is crazy.

181
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,350
Jack is like everyone's top priority huh?

182
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,324
Look at him,

183
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:02,015
he think he looks so cool.

184
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,834
Are you gonna see Jack Finn?

185
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,834
Are you excited?
- Yeah.

186
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:09,314
- He was scared of Captain
Hook the other day.

187
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:11,601
So I'm not sure how he's
gonna react to Jack.

188
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,321
Ollie do you see him yet?

189
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:15,833
Not yet.

190
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,733
He's over there.

191
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,364
Do you see him Finn?

192
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:20,402
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

193
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:21,874
Does he look scary?

194
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:23,662
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

195
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:25,339
He's like I'm not sure.

196
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,050
It's almost your turn Ollie.

197
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,102
Alright baby, you're turn.

198
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:30,069
Go up there first.

199
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:31,267
Go say hi.

200
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,692
Hello.

201
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,376
- Good to see you my friends.

202
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:36,897
I love the red--
- Go say hi.

203
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,220
- Costumes.

204
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,281
You were out batting today.

205
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:42,958
- [Missy] Finn do you wanna come say hi?

206
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,251
Do you wanna go say hi?

207
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:45,084
- No.
- No.

208
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,228
Wow.

209
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,123
You look so cute.

210
00:06:57,123 --> 00:07:00,290
Alright should we do a family picture?

211
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,222
Do you want to give Jack a high five?

212
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:09,055
No.

213
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:11,645
Do you want to give Sally a high five?

214
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,093
No.

215
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:14,623
- That's okay, my hands might fall off.

216
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,528
You never know.
- It could happen.

217
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,058
- Say bye Jack, bye Sally.

218
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:19,558
- [Boys] Bye Jack.

219
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:23,232
- [Missy] Ollie what
did you think of that?

220
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:25,151
- It was good.

221
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:26,181
- What did you think of that?

222
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,275
You were kind of scared huh?

223
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,663
Bye Jack.

224
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,496
Wow, that was so neat.

225
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:38,028
On my gosh that was the cutest thing ever.

226
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:40,057
Not only does Jack talk.

227
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:43,083
But Ollie got to interact
with him and like,

228
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,897
told him his name and
oh my gosh it was just,

229
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:46,814
so so cool.

230
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,749
I think Ollie loved it.

231
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,453
I think it's something
he will never forget.

232
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:53,626
Because it was so cute.

233
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:54,806
And Finn was so cute.

234
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:56,048
He like knew who Jack was,

235
00:07:56,048 --> 00:07:58,649
but he was like, you're
a little scary in person.

236
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,511
I was like give him a high five,

237
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,734
he's like no, no I'm not doing that.

238
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,354
So cute.

239
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:06,481
Did you guys like meeting Jack?

240
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:07,338
- [Together] Yeah.

241
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:09,234
- Yeah, was that so neat?

242
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,547
That was so cool.

243
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:13,211
Daddy wishes he was here so badly.

244
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:14,561
He wanted to take him.

245
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,599
But he also really wanted
Ollie to meet Jack.

246
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,435
So we did it anyways.

247
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:20,581
But maybe daddy can come next time kay.

248
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:22,481
And you can meet him with daddy.

249
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:23,965
Alright Ollie, guess what?

250
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:24,813
- What?

251
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:28,930
- You get to go on your
very first, big boy ride.

252
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,256
And you know which one it's gonna be?

253
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:32,105
- What?

254
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:34,780
- Soaring Over the World.

255
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,376
You get to fly over the world.

256
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:38,214
Are you excited?

257
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:39,511
Are you scared?

258
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:40,696
- No.
- No.

259
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:42,116
- Oh my gosh we're so excited!

260
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:43,878
- But is it scary?

261
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:45,493
- It's not scary at all.

262
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,909
So as you guys know,

263
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,435
we learned today that he's big enough

264
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:49,968
to go on some of the big kid rides.

265
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:51,361
One of them is soaring.

266
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:54,437
There's Star Tours and he can
even go on Space Mountain.

267
00:08:54,437 --> 00:08:56,621
I think we're gonna save
those ones for next time.

268
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,116
But right now we're gonna go on Soarin'.

269
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,335
And we're so excited!

270
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:02,825
So uncle and Papa and Mama are taking

271
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:05,139
them on Soarin' right now.

272
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,322
Yay!

273
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:07,987
Alright let's just double check it again.

274
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,220
Stand up.

275
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,452
Oh gosh, okay.

276
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:13,393
- That's close
You're right there.

277
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:15,385
We'll see if they let you.

278
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:16,780
I'm like so scared.

279
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,271
Because he's like, he is 40 inches.

280
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:20,680
But he's just like right there

281
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,746
and you never know if
they're gonna be like,

282
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:23,158
no not this time.

283
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:24,860
So we'll see.

284
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,443
(quirky music)

285
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:45,320
Ollie you gotta watch
the safety video okay?

286
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,233
Pay attention.

287
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:54,398
He's like freaking out.

288
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:56,255
Sit next to Papa.

289
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,207
Alright we gotta strap you in.

290
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,028
You're gonna fly really high okay?

291
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,378
You gotta hold on really good.

292
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:05,762
Alright, you ready?

293
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:08,444
It's gonna be fun okay?

294
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:12,611
- [Man] Soarin' to town,
we are ready for takeoff.

295
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,520
- [Missy] What do you think of that?

296
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,701
- Oh boy that was close.

297
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,236
Oh no!
- Look!

298
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,319
Look at that!

299
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:41,652
Isn't that so cool?

300
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,167
- That's so cute!

301
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,185
A baby bear!

302
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,435
That's so cute!

303
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,625
- [Missy] Oh my goodness!

304
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:53,897
Where you at now?

305
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:55,121
- [Ollie] Disney Land.

306
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,954
- [Missy] Disney Land!

307
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,268
Oh my gosh, that ride was so cool.

308
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:14,858
He's actually going on
it again with my mom and

309
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:17,078
Papa again and Kelsey.

310
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:19,053
We had extra fast passes
so they all get to ride.

311
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,071
And so I'm so excited for
them that he gets to go again.

312
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,486
He loved it!

313
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:25,902
I am sitting here entertaining Ms. June!

314
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,621
And Finn's gettin' in there.

315
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,634
Okay, hop on out.

316
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:30,994
Should we do the clappy hands?

317
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:34,111
If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands.

318
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:34,944
Yay!

319
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,993
If you're happy and you
know it clap your hands.

320
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:38,965
Yay!

321
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,235
I pretty much have to sing the
entire time I'm watching her.

322
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:44,131
If you're happy and you
know it and you really

323
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:47,331
wanna show it, if you're
happy and you know it,

324
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,664
clap your hands.

325
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:50,379
Yay!

326
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:53,818
Finn you've been playing
peeka-boo with her?

327
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:55,510
Kay show her your peeka-boo.

328
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,482
Ready?

329
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,681
Where's Finn?

330
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:58,514
Peeka-boo!

331
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:02,185
Ollie you went to go on it two times?

332
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:03,905
You are such a lucky boy.

333
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:05,150
So do you like that ride?

334
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,022
(mumbles)

335
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,107
You can throw poop?

336
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,984
I think he was just throwing dirt.

337
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:12,032
You think it was poop?

338
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,122
- It was poop.

339
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:14,479
- [Missy] Okay it was for sure poop.

340
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,844
And did it smell like poop?

341
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:16,774
- A little bit.

342
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:18,534
- [Missy] A little bit.

343
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:20,224
So is that one your favorite ride now?

344
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:21,057
Yeah.

345
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:23,906
What's your favorite ride?

346
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,239
- Boo.

347
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,383
- [Missy] Boo?

348
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:27,234
The Boo...

349
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:29,044
I think he means the Halloween ride.

350
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:32,282
So is Halloween better than Soarin'

351
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:33,848
or do you like Soarin' better?

352
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:35,038
- I like Soarin' better.

353
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,581
- [Missy] Oh he likes
Soarin' more than Halloween.

354
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:40,415
Haunted mansion.

355
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,864
Alright guys, we have decided
to head out of the park.

356
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:45,044
We had a ton of fun.

357
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,051
We did a ton of stuff.

358
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:47,804
But it actually is a pretty busy day.

359
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:49,806
And if we wanted to stay any longer

360
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:51,768
we'd have to be like in a ton of traffic

361
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:53,350
and we'd get home super late.

362
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,942
My parents are actually
taking the boys home.

363
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,683
Which is super nice of them.

364
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:59,102
They're just the best parents ever.

365
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:01,204
And I'm actually gonna
go meet up with Bryan.

366
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,434
Because he is at a conference right now

367
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:04,962
with a lot of our friends.

368
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:06,719
And it's a pretty cool conference

369
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,176
that is all about YouTube and all that.

370
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:10,318
And so I thought I would meet up with him

371
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:11,719
for the night.

372
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,362
And then I'm gonna be back with the boys,

373
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,232
tomorrow morning,

374
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:15,778
or I may even go home tonight.

375
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:16,984
But we will see.

376
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:18,089
But yeah, I'm gonna head there now.

377
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,142
It's a lot of traffic
already going there so.

378
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:21,816
It's gonna be a long drive.

379
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,107
- Everyone party in the elevator!

380
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:24,967
- Elevator party!

381
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,384
- Elevator party!

382
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:28,185
Carl!

383
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,844
We are with everyone.

384
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,777
The whole crew.

385
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:34,380
We got--
- My dad.

386
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,408
- [Bryan] We got Corbin.

387
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:38,374
We got Carl and Jinger.

388
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:40,318
And Missy is joining us now.

389
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:41,597
Oh we're going out.

390
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:43,992
Oh yeah, we're going to get snacks.

391
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:45,308
We're sneaking up to the club level

392
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,045
to see if we can get some snacks.

393
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:48,849
So we had a full day of education.

394
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,729
Right Darren, right Carl?

395
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,869
We learned a lot.

396
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,328
Now we all get to hang out and have fun.

397
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:55,285
And Missy is coming from Disney Land

398
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,503
to hang out with us,
and I'm really excited.

399
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,829
We have arrived.

400
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:00,306
Ooh pasta, what's in there?

401
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,091
Whoa chicken!
- Oh my gosh,

402
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,151
it's like a legit dinner.

403
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:04,320
- [Bryan] Yeah.

404
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,833
Appetizers.

405
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,810
(laughing)

406
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,442
What are you doing?

407
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,988
- [Missy] Making it so
you can see yourself.

408
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:14,409
- [Bryan] Oh I can see your perspective.

409
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:16,781
Okay, just so you guys are all wondering,

410
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:21,732
this is Missy's perspective of
me walking down the hallway.

411
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,222
(laughing)

412
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:25,305
Missy's here.

413
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:27,375
Hey babe.

414
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:29,603
You ready to party in your Mickey shirt?

415
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,436
- Yeah.

416
00:14:31,711 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
