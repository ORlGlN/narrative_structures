1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,635
- [Bryan] Roar!
- We should make a

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:03,953
chocolate dinosaur.

3
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:04,786
- [Bryan] We should?

4
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:05,619
- Yeah!

5
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:07,232
- Ollie always comes up
with the greatest ideas.

6
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:09,672
Hey dinosaur, do you wanna
be made out of chocolate?

7
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:11,016
Yeah.

8
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:12,832
Who doesn't want to be
made out of chocolate?

9
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:14,875

- [Ollie] Good morning!
(baby talking)

22
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:38,467
- [Missy] What was that?

23
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,146
- Good morning!

24
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:41,933
- [Missy] Good morning boys!

25
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:42,766
(bell dinging)

26
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:43,599
- Ahh!

27
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:44,432
Morning guys.

28
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:45,647
It's actually not quite morning.

29
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,616
We have had a very, very busy morning.

30
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,936
I actually took Ollie to school

31
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:52,101
and totally forgot the camera
and you went to school, huh?

32
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:52,934
- Yeah.

33
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:54,901
- I was like, "I thought it
was kind of early for school".

34
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,381
So I went all the way there and

35
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:00,477
I get to the school and no one's there.

36
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,410
I walk in the classroom,
no kids are there,

37
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,686
no teachers there and finally,

38
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:06,863
right at time that school starts,

39
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:08,253
kids started getting there.

40
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:10,942
The teacher got there, but
it was a sub and I was like,

41
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:12,767
"Are you guys doing
school?" and they were like,

42
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:16,303
"Not really, we'll probably
start school next week",

43
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:18,328
but the school is open.

44
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,704
So I was like, "Oh my gosh".

45
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,871
If I was working a job and
I needed to take him there

46
00:01:24,782 --> 00:01:26,830
for a place to be, I could have done that,

47
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,918
but I'm like, "He doesn't
even have to be here".

48
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:31,374
So I actually let him stay
and play for a little bit,

49
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:34,892
while I got some errands done,
and then I picked him up,

50
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:37,508
pretty early, because they
were just playing, so.

51
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,605
Watch you?

52
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:39,931
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!

53
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,452
- Oh my gosh, you are the silliest.

54
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:43,421
I don't know if you heard that,

55
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:46,763
but he goes, "Watch me",
but he says it kind of like

56
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:47,596
you can barely understand it.

57
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:48,951
We just figured out what he was saying.

58
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:50,034
Say watch me.

59
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:52,614
Say watch me.

60
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:53,875
He does it all the time.

61
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:54,710
He's so cute.

62
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,268
Alright, let's go eat
some lunch, okay boys?

63
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:57,101
- Okay.

64
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:57,934
- Okay.

65
00:01:57,934 --> 00:01:59,839
- [Bryan] Hey Geebo, happy New Year.

66
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,343
- [Geebo] Thanks, you too.

67
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:02,479
(party horns blowing)

68
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,408
Today is National Science Fiction day,

69
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:07,463
one of my favorite holidays.

70
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:08,439
- [Bryan] Did you know that, Ollie?

71
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,271
- Yeah.

72
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,726
- [Bryan] Today is National
Science Fiction day.

73
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:11,840
- Really?

74
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,688
- I think that means we're gonna be

75
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:14,727
watching some Star Wars later, right?

76
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:15,560
- [Ollie] Yeah.

77
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,703
- Yeah!

78
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,951
Hey guys.

79
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:21,231
I cannot believe that
it is already January.

80
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,687
What has happened to December, you guys?

81
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,205
What happened to Christmas?

82
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,973
It all was just like I blinked
and then it was all gone.

83
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:28,879
Is this what happens now as you get older?

84
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,375
Yeah, it's January, New Year's starting,

85
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,678
and we're kind of in this
place where we're like,

86
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:37,117
"what's gonna be our next thing?

87
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:38,677
What is our next project?".

88
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,893
As you know, as a family we're
always working on projects.

89
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,765
We're always doing fun
things with the kids

90
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:46,669
and I think 2018 is gonna
be a fun one, for sure.

91
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,899
We'll see what happens this year.

92
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,545
What do you want to see us do in 2018?

93
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,130
Let us know down below in the comments.

94
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,713
Give us some suggestions
of what you think,

95
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:57,151
what would be fun for you guys
to see us do on this channel.

96
00:02:57,151 --> 00:03:00,104
Some of you may know,
also, that January means

97
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:02,407
it's my birthday month, right Geebo?

98
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:05,224
Hey Geebo, how many
days until January 20th?

99
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:06,951
- [Geebo] The answer is 18 days.

100
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:09,039
- 18 days until my birthday?

101
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,087
18 days until my birthday!

102
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:15,008
We're gonna plan something
fun for Missy and I.

103
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:15,841
Uh-oh.

104
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,969
Hello?

105
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,281
Hi!

106
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,865
Hey, what's up kiddos?

107
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:23,185
Now that the boys room is
right next to my office,

108
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:25,796
it's so cute, because I
will be working in here,

109
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,084
they can play in there.

110
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:29,084
They run in and jump all over everything

111
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,245
and bring all their
toys in my office, huh?

112
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,078
- Yeah.

113
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,491
- That's always fun too, kind
of gives me a little break.

114
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,324
- [Missy] Oh, bye.

115
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:36,835
- [Bryan] (chuckles)
alright Finn, you ready?

116
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:37,668
- Yeah.

117
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:38,587
- [Bryan] Alright, I need you to take

118
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:40,275
a very important meeting.

119
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:41,108
- Okay.

120
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:42,365
- [Bryan] Okay, with Elon Musk.

121
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,389
Can you do that?

122
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,222
- Yeah.

123
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,055
- [Bryan] You ready to sit down?

124
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:45,888
- Yeah.

125
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:46,721
- [Bryan] Have a phone meeting?

126
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:47,554
- Yeah.

127
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:50,013
- [Bryan] Talk about the
future of Youtube and Tesla?

128
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,749
Just kidding, we're not having
a meeting with Elon Musk,

129
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,789
but if we did, obviously
I'd bring in Finn,

130
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,833
because he is the master
negotiator, aren't you? (chuckles)

131
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,889
- Mama is.

132
00:03:58,889 --> 00:03:59,953
- Mama's locked out.

133
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:00,786
- Yeah.

134
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:04,221
- (chuckles) she's coming back in.

135
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:05,054
There she is!

136
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:05,932
- [Missy] Hi!

137
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:09,408
- [Bryan] And it's fall
finally here in California.

138
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,575
We have our trees so bare.

139
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:15,880
That one, that one, that
one is quite a fighter.

140
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,153
Yeah, but for those you saying

141
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:20,435
we don't get fall in
California, we do to an extent.

142
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:24,268
(slow electronic dance music)

143
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:29,433
(dinosaur roaring)

144
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:33,600
- [Bryan] Wow, look at this
scary dinosaur! (laughing)

145
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:35,484
how cool?

146
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,317
- Yeah.

147
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,150
- [Bryan] Did you get this for Christmas?

148
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,983
- Yeah.

149
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:38,816
- [Bryan] That's so neat.

150
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:39,716
- From Aunt Shay-lee.

151
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,067
- [Bryan] Oh that's cool.

152
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:41,907
Roar!

153
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,957
- We should make a chocolate dinosaur.

154
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:44,790
- [Bryan] We should?

155
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,623
- Yeah!

156
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:48,183
- Ollie always comes up
with the greatest ideas.

157
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:51,547
Hey dinosaur, do you want
to be made out of chocolate?

158
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:52,844
- Yeah.
(dinosaur roaring)

159
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,140
who doesn't want to be
made out of chocolate?

160
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,269
(dinosaur roaring)

161
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:00,436
Check out this, Ollie, we got
Chocolate Construction T-Rex

162
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:05,707
so we can actually make
a 3D chocolate T-Rex.

163
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:08,013
- Really?

164
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:08,846
- [Bryan] Should we do it?

165
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:09,679
- Yeah.

166
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,489
- Yeah, this is so cool.

167
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:14,224
I found these on Amazon, I believe,

168
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:16,112
and you basically melt your chocolate,

169
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:19,700
you put it in the mold, and
then it's all the pieces

170
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,657
to basically build on yourself, like that.

171
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,297
You think ours will look that good, babe?

172
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,130
- I'm really hoping to.

173
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,717
I got this little tool that will help us,

174
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,752
basically, suck up the melted chocolate

175
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:31,178
and then poor it into
these little tiny pieces

176
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:33,776
that are probably really hard to get into.

177
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:34,609
- [Bryan] Yeah it's true.

178
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:35,707
It's probably not a
whole love of chocolate.

179
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,374
(playful music)

180
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,354
- [Bryan] We are melting chocolate and,

181
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:45,786
oh no the dinosaurs are gonna

182
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:47,602
eat all our chocolate!
- [Missy] Ahh!

183
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,804
- [Bryan] (laughs) that's funny.

184
00:05:49,804 --> 00:05:52,471
(playful music)

185
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,343
- [Missy] Alright, Bryan's
doing the first couple ones.

186
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:03,176
How is it?

187
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:04,009
- It's hard.

188
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:04,842
- [Missy] It it hard to do?

189
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,915
- So basically sucking
up chocolate in this,

190
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:10,265
and then squeezing it
in. I think this needs

191
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,704
a little bit more, and then look at these.

192
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:13,537
- [Missy] These are so thin.

193
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:14,370
- [Bryan] It's like,

194
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,455
very intricate pieces.
- [Missy] I'll be surprised if

195
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,160
they come out and don't break (laughs).

196
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,993
- I know.

197
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:18,826
- [Missy] I'm really hoping.

198
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:19,794
- It's definitely gonna be a

199
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,229
cool little challenge to see if it works

200
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:22,062
- [Missy] Yeah.
- [Finn] Dada!

201
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:22,895
- [Missy] What do you think of that?

202
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,484
Is that the dinosaur's feet?

203
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,317
- Yeah.

204
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,150
- [Missy] Yeah?

205
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,983
- [Bryan] Nope, rib cage (laughs).

206
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:28,149
- [Missy] Oh, (laughs) rib cage.

207
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,405
- [Bryan] Close though.

208
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:32,072
(playful music)

209
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,303
- [Bryan] I don't know
how it's possible, babe,

210
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:42,803
but you have chocolate all over your face.

211
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:44,928
- All over?

212
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:46,360
- [Bryan] Well, it's basically
on the side of your eye.

213
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,193
- You know what

214
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:48,039
happened is that-
- [Bryan] Look.

215
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,509
- Aww!

216
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,342
I bet what happened-

217
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:52,504
- [Bryan] She got chocolate
tears drops (laughs).

218
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:56,129
- I was running, I had chocolate
in my hands, Finns up here.

219
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,544
All of a sudden he has chocolate on him,

220
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:59,696
I'm like, "ahh" like that.

221
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:01,367
- [Bryan] Yeah, okay.

222
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:04,200
We filled in our molds very nicely

223
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:06,627
and now all we have to do is

224
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,514
wait for the chocolate to harden and then,

225
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,369
we can pop the individual pieces out

226
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:12,002
and create our dinosaur.

227
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,335
I hope it works.

228
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,745
I'm not sure if this is gonna work,

229
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:19,389
but it may be funny if it fails also.

230
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,986
Alright, Ollie is blogging,
just so you guys know.

231
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:26,131
We put all the chocolate in the molds,

232
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,788
(laughs) thanks Ollie.

233
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:31,452
Now we are gonna put our
molds in the freezer.

234
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,964
We just so happen to
have some freezer space.

235
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:35,748
- [Missy] Yeah!

236
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:36,829
- So that's nice.

237
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,557
- [Missy] That is nice, actually.

238
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:40,389
Yeah, it said freezer
to keep it extra hard.

239
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:41,222
- Cool.

240
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:42,717
- [Missy] We'll see.

241
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,884
Yeah that'll work, thanks.

242
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:46,976
- Cool!

243
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:48,117
- [Missy] Yay!

244
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:48,950
Alright, we'll be back.

245
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,021
- Alright, while our chocolate
dinosaurs are in the freezer,

246
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,901
we actually are gonna go to the ranch

247
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,302
and go check out the horses.

248
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:58,416
Ollie really wanted to see the pig.

249
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,414
What was his name?

250
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:00,247
- Wally!

251
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,080
- [Missy] Wally!
- [Bryan] Wally!

252
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,913
You wanna go meet Wally?

253
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:02,746
- Yeah.

254
00:08:02,746 --> 00:08:03,967
- [Bryan] Alright, so the boys
are getting their shoes on

255
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,455
and they're actually getting
some special shoes on today.

256
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:07,566
Missy's so excited.

257
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:08,920
- I know, I went and got them,

258
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,231
well I went and actually
bought a few things today,

259
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,975
which I'm really excited
about and I thought,

260
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:15,407
they have to have some cowboy boots,

261
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,423
because they're gonna be
hanging out down there.

262
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:18,625
- Whoa!

263
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,895
- Yes your own cowboy boots!

264
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,079
- [Bryan] Just like woody!

265
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,112
- [Missy] You guys can kick
up some dirt and the mud.

266
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,735
These ones are Finn's.

267
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:27,872
Aren't they cool?

268
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:28,705
- [Bryan] Oh, that's awesome,

269
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:29,623
they have zippers on the sides.

270
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:30,456
- Yeah.

271
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:32,835
- [Bryan] Whoa!

272
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:34,623
You like 'em Finn?

273
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:35,456
- Yup.

274
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:36,413
- [Bryan] They're pretty neat, huh?

275
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,140
- [Missy] Aw, they're so cute.

276
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,892
- I like it when you zip it up.

277
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,164
- Yeah that's pretty neat, huh?

278
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:45,748
(county guitars strumming)

279
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:01,198
- [Bryan] What do you think
of those cowboy boots?

280
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:02,742
- They light up.

281
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,598
- [Bryan] Yes, apparently, they light up.

282
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:06,183
I thought I saw something Missy.

283
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:07,182
- I didn't do anything.

284
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:08,469
- [Bryan] And I was like, wait.

285
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:10,149
Aw, Finn's don't light up.

286
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,382
- I know, they didn't have the size that

287
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:14,698
I wanted for Finn, yeah.
- [Bryan] Same brand, yeah.

288
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:15,531
That is so cool!

289
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:17,467
Your cowboy boots light up, Ollie.

290
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,395
- I'm gonna have to order
some for Finn in his size.

291
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:20,379
I'll just order 'em.

292
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,867
That's so cute.

293
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:24,771
(country guitars strumming)

294
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:26,604
- [Bryan] Aright boys,
say thank you to mama.

295
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:28,099
- Thank you mama.
- Thank you mama.

296
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,059
- You're welcome.

297
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,019
Muah!

298
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,867
- [Bryan] That was very
nice of her to get you

299
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:34,131
nice cowboy boots.
- Look at me guys.

300
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:35,203
- [Bryan] Whoa!

301
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:36,219
- Whoa!

302
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:37,691
- [Bryan] Look at me (chuckles).

303
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:40,043
I love when he poses like that (chuckles).

304
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:41,123
- I wanna see it.

305
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,022
- [Bryan] You wanna see it?

306
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:42,855
- Yeah!

307
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:43,688
- [Bryan] You wanna see it?

308
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:44,521
- Yeah.

309
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,963
- [Bryan] Alright, let's open it up.

310
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:46,972
Ohh!

311
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:49,251
Wait, where's our dinosaur?

312
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:51,876
Oh, we've got all these dinosaur bones

313
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:53,876
we can put together now.

314
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:55,975
- I wanna see 'em.

315
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,250
- [Missy] No touching, just see.

316
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,115
- Whoa.

317
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,626
- Wow, it looks done.

318
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,647
I think it's ready.

319
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,383
- [Bryan] Alright boys we have a problem.

320
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:04,216
(crying)

321
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:07,270
don't cry, it's okay,
but there is a problem.

322
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,281
We're kind of failing at taking the

323
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:12,177
dinosaur bones out of the molds.

324
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,064
It's very difficult.

325
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:15,704
I was working on getting
these two out, those broke.

326
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:19,313
All of them broke and I
realized that this one is broken

327
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:20,969
in three different places and

328
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:24,240
Missy's having a little
bit more luck than I am.

329
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,385
- I'm gonna melt some chocolate

330
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,577
and try and glue it together.

331
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:28,465
I think it wouldn't be too hard.

332
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:31,048
(upbeat music)

333
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:36,800
- Alright, Missy was able to salvage

334
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,544
enough chocolate bones from her mold,

335
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:41,795
so we're gonna go ahead
and use hers to build them,

336
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:44,992
but now that means we get to eat this one.

337
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,469
Who wants to eat the dinosaur head?

338
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:47,302
- Me!

339
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:48,135
Ahh!

340
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,341
- [Bryan] Take a bit, nom!

341
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,869
You want this piece?

342
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:52,702
Nom!

343
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:55,870
Chocolate.

344
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,953
Alright we have re-frozen the pieces.

345
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,828
Some had to be repaired with

346
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,214
a little bit of chocolate
glue, but that's okay.

347
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:08,112
Missy is a chocolate dinosaur doctor.

348
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:09,664
So now we just have to assemble it.

349
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:11,151
That's not gonna be too hard, right babe?

350
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:14,948
As she's digging instruction
out of the trash (laughs).

351
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:16,448
You go this, babe.

352
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,666
- Okay, so I think-

353
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,958
- [Bryan] A puzzle of epic
chocolatey proportions.

354
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,430
- Our hands have to be super cold,

355
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,942
because if they're not then we'll-

356
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:27,775
- [Bryan] Stick to it.

357
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:29,293
- Yeah.

358
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,876
(upbeat music)

359
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,071
- [Bryan] Does it work?

360
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:39,904
- No.

361
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,666
(upbeat music)

362
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:48,324
- [Bryan] I had a brilliant
idea to grab a jar

363
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:50,548
to use under the head of the dinosaur

364
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:52,908
so we can easily assemble.

365
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:55,764
It's quite difficult
balancing it at the same time.

366
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,740
I see us like a very intense

367
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,476
paleontologist version of Willy Wonka.

368
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:03,059
(upbeat music)

369
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:12,815
- [Bryan] Okay, our dinosaurs
have seen better days.

370
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,648
- Yeah.

371
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:14,481
- [Bryan] This is very difficult.

372
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:15,716
- It is!

373
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,611
- [Bryan] I think this is one
of those things you see on TV

374
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,105
that are suppose to work but don't.

375
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,529
It's just kind of a disaster.
- Okay, here are the arms.

376
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:24,369
- [Bryan] They go on that rib cage.

377
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,987
- Yeah, they're supposed to go one here.

378
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:27,036
Oh gosh, please don't break.

379
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,411
Please don't break.

380
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:29,564
It broke.

381
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:32,953
- [Bryan] (laughs)

382
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,393
Finn do you wanna see
a chocolate dinosaur?

383
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:35,226
- Yeah!

384
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:36,157
- Alright, let's go look.

385
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:39,093
It's real chocolate fossils (gasps).

386
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:39,926
- Whoa.

387
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,294
- Isn't that so cool.

388
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,127
- Yeah.

389
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:43,829
- Mamas putting it together, look.

390
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,162
- Okay, hang on.

391
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:47,493
I think it might be-

392
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:48,654
- [Bryan] Balanced and everything?

393
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:49,510
- No, not balance.

394
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,343
- [Bryan] Oh.

395
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:51,176
(laughing)

396
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:53,431
Okay, I see the arm, it's missing-

397
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:54,264
- [Missy] There's no rib cages,

398
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:55,491
here.
- [Bryan] Missing a couple

399
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:56,324
of those.

400
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:57,251
- [Missy] There's that rib cage there.

401
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,411
Oh shoot, oh shoot.

402
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,339
- [Bryan] It's okay, look at it.

403
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,267
It's amazing!

404
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,668
- Roar!
- [Missy] Wahh!

405
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:02,501
What do you think

406
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:03,576
of that, Finn?
- [Bryan] It's amazing!

407
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:04,409
- Yeah.

408
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,242
- Do you wanna eat its head?

409
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,075
- Yeah.

410
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:06,908
- Eat his head.

411
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:07,741
(growling)

412
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:08,574
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

413
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:11,386
- [Bryan] Ahh! (laughs)

414
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:13,744
- Oh, it crumbled.
- [Bryan] It was a good effort

415
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:17,097
to be fair, fossils aren't found mounted

416
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,456
and put together like that.

417
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:19,289
- Yeah.

418
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:20,623
- [Bryan] They're found flat
- kind of like this.

419
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,136
- [Bryan] Yeah, you find 'em flat.

420
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,200
This is more realistic.

421
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,536
It's basically like
chocolate dinosaur bones.

422
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:26,369
- [Missy] Was that good?

423
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:27,257
- That's cool that it all goes together,

424
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:30,036
but obviously it does not work that easy.

425
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:33,546
- Um, yeah maybe if we tried
something that doesn't melt,

426
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,420
like a jelly
- [Bryan] Like candy?

427
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,458
Or like hard candy?
- Or if we tried candy!

428
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,515
- Oh yeah we could totally melt,

429
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:40,892
uh what are they called?
- That would be so cool.

430
00:13:40,892 --> 00:13:41,725
- Jolly Ranchers.

431
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:42,558
- [Bryan] Jolly Ranchers, yeah.

432
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:43,484
That'd be fun.

433
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:44,742
Let us know down below in the comments

434
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,483
if that's something you wanna see us do.

435
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:49,067
Hey, do you want to eat the tail?

436
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,163
Take a bit, nom!

437
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:51,996
How is it?

438
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:52,829
- Good.

439
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:53,987
- Good?

440
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:54,820
Nom!

441
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,653
History and chocolate.

442
00:13:58,011 --> 00:13:58,844
That's a good combination,

443
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:00,325
I think.
- Alright, all done.

444
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:01,900
I guess we'll leave all the

445
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,991
dinosaur building up to the scientists,

446
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,063
huh?
- Yeah.

447
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:08,242
- He's like, "You put the
dinosaur bones over here dad".

448
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:09,083
You know what, Finn?

449
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,306
You actually ate your dinner so good,

450
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:13,186
I will let you have this
little dinosaur arm.

451
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,082
(laughs)

452
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:15,915
- So funny.

453
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:17,706
- [Bryan] He is so funny.

454
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:18,539
- [Missy] Good job.

455
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:19,372
(laughs)

456
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:20,498
good job, high five.

457
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:21,427
(clap)

458
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,290
- Ollie actually fell
asleep early for the night

459
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,491
and it is now time for
this kiddo to go to bed.

460
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,555
- Your bedtime.

461
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:28,706
- Nope.

462
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:30,738
- Yes it is.
- [Bryan] Nope.

463
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,490
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

464
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,586
If you did be sure to
give it a big thumbs up.

465
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:36,290
Thumbs up Finn!
- Thumbs up!

466
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,123
- [Bryan] He's still pointing.

467
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,410
You can do the thumbs up.
- I know.

468
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,243
Thumbs up, like that.

469
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:40,234
- [Bryan] There you go, thumbs up.

470
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:41,522
Let's see it.
- see?

471
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:43,202
- [Bryan] Good job!

472
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:44,290

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,577
Subscribe and we'll see you manana.

474
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:47,073
What do you say, Finn?

475
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:50,865
- [Missy] Bye! Boop!
- [Bryan] Bye! Boop!

476
00:14:50,865 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
