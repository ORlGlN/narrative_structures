1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,414
- OK, so I'm vlogging right now

2
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:03,446
because I really don't know what to do

3
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:06,878
at this point, and I have
absolutely no service.

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:09,234
I was actually talking
to my mom at the time.

5
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,135
I don't even know what she heard.

6
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:13,195
She might be freaking out right now.

7
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:14,738
But, I don't know what to do.

8
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:15,850
I'm on a really scary hill.

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,278
I've got Ollie in the backseat,

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:18,804
which is really extra scary.

11
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:21,675
The road is not very safe to walk on.

12
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:24,295
I've never been in a situation like this.

13
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:25,336
♫ This is our life ♫

14
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:26,541
♫ This is our fun ♫

15
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,917
♫ This is who we are ♫

16
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,071
♫ This is our dream ♫

17
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,285
♫ This is our team ♫

18
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:33,796
♫ Shout among the stars ♫

19
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,120
♫ Take the shooter, I'll be fine ♫

20
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,718
♫ Take this hand and I'll just shine ♫

21
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:42,611
♫ Let's live it ♫

22
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:44,334
♫ Live forever ♫

23
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:45,350
- Morning!

24
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,850
- Good morning, little Spidey.

25
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,800
How you doin' this morning, huh?

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,633
- Yeah.

27
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:52,576
- Yeah.

28
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:54,631
Hangin' out with Fin this morning.

29
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:56,680
Missy took Ollie and
dropped him off at school,

30
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,211
so I always get to hang out with Fin,

31
00:00:58,211 --> 00:00:59,044
which is awesome,

32
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:01,683
because I feel like he is a lot different

33
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:03,311
when Ollie's not around.

34
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,167
He's a lot different
when Mama's not around.

35
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,349
So, me and you kinda have
our own special thing, huh?

36
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,366
- Mama is the best.

37
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,480
- I know, Mama's the best, right?

38
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,313
- Yeah.

39
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:13,904
- Hey did you have dreams
all about Spideyman,

40
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:15,910
look at, he's all over your pajamas,

41
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,500
he's all over your pajamas!

42
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,986
(Fin and Bryan laughing)

43
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:21,687
This kid is always all smiles and

44
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:24,282
he can always brighten my day whole.

45
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:25,346
(Fin screaming)

46
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,421
(Bryan screaming)

47
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,381
(Bryan laughing)

48
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,430
Alright, Fin I've got
one question for you,

49
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,584
are you ready to spin?

50
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:34,417
- Yeah

51
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:35,766
- Yeah, okay, sit back.

52
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:37,633
We're gonna make this little boy spin.

53
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:39,383
Ready? And blast off.

54
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:47,515
(Fin laughing)

55
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:51,325
He's really going.

56
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,808
Was that fun?

57
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:55,641
- Ahhh.

58
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,317
(Bryan laughing)

59
00:01:58,317 --> 00:01:59,938
- You're so cute, wanna do it again?

60
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:00,771
- Yeah.

61
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,104
- Yeah? Okay, and blast off!

62
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:07,852
(Fin laughing)

63
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:08,685
Whaaaat?

64
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,567
You're so funny dude,
okay here try to walk.

65
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:22,015
Whoa, whoa, ha-ha, you got it, you got it.

66
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,738
- Good morning, guys, this is the

67
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,311
first time I'm vlogging today.

68
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,961
I've been so busy running all the

69
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:30,866
way to school, doing errands, and I've

70
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:33,589
just been like "ugh, I
feel exhausted today,"

71
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:36,615
I'm so exhausted, and it's only 1 o'clock.

72
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,490
I even had to run home for a few minutes,

73
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,152
and I literally took a 15 minute nap,

74
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:42,021
and then I had to get
out of the house again.

75
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,332
But I think I'm starting
to slow down a little bit,

76
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:45,659
I'm gonna go pick up Ollie now,

77
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,759
I think me and him are gonna
do a couple of fun things,

78
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,073
but yeah, it's just
been a crazy, crazy day.

79
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,452
I feel like if I drink
coffee, and literally

80
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:52,468
the only reason I don't drink coffee

81
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:54,072
is because it's just like gross to me,

82
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:57,095
but I could really use a coffee right now.

83
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,473
That would probably be
a really good pickup,

84
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:01,969
but anyways, we're off
to go pick up Ollie.

85
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,469
Ollie, that's you.

86
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,292
- Yeah, I made candy mat man.

87
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:10,255
- You made the mat man?

88
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:11,418
- Mhm.

89
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:13,232
And that's a boy mat man.

90
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:14,982
- That looks so neat.

91
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,260
I missed you.

92
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,847
- I missed you, too.

93
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,453
- Did you have a fun day at school?

94
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:21,370
- Yeah but-

95
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,758
- Oh, where'd your sticker go?

96
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:29,052
Oh no, he was so excited to
show you guys his sticker.

97
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:32,469
We found your sticker! He's so happy now.

98
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:37,472
- I've got a good garden here.

99
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:39,617
- You do have a good garden here.

100
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:40,880
Do you water these?

101
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,789
- Mmm.

102
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,035
- Other people do?

103
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:43,868
- Yeah.

104
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:45,735
- This is a very cool garden, though.

105
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:46,919
You guys are so cute.

106
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,532
Me and Ollie are getting
lunch at Freebirds,

107
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:50,968
it's like my favorite place.

108
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:53,232
- I'm gonna get a quesadilla.

109
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,281
- Yup, he's getting a quesadilla,

110
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,537
I'm getting a burrito,
I haven't eaten all day,

111
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,657
I'm so hungry, so we're
getting lunch together.

112
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,016
You know what we're
doing right now, right?

113
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:01,849
- What?

114
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,346
- We're having a date.

115
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,179
- Date?

116
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:05,012
- Yeah, me and you are going on

117
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,965
a little mommy, son date.

118
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:08,441
You know when you're on a date,

119
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:12,142
you have to pay for my
lunch, is that okay?

120
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:14,440
Can you pay for my lunch?

121
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,812
Do you have money?

122
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:16,644
- No.

123
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:19,385
- Huh, oh no, I'm gonna have
to pay for my own lunch?

124
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:22,834
Well, that's not a deal
breaker, but we'll see how

125
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,777
the rest of the date
goes and if it goes good

126
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:27,693
maybe I'll let you give me a kiss.

127
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,584
(Missy laughs)

128
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:31,172
Alright, you know what you're gonna get?

129
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:32,139
- Quesadilla.

130
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,486
- Okay, let's do it.

131
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:36,069
(bright music)

132
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:48,015
- So mama how was your day today?

133
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:50,182
- It was really good, how was yours?

134
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:51,493
- Um, good.

135
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:52,326
(Missy laughs)

136
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,909
(audience coo)

137
00:04:57,284 --> 00:04:59,904
- This has been a really
special date, bud.

138
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,372
You have been so sweet during

139
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:03,145
this whole date, you know that?

140
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:03,978
(Fin smooching)

141
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:06,353
Huh, oh, you were supposed to ask!

142
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,468
(Fin laughs)

143
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:10,945
I love you, you're such a sweet boy.

144
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,618
Thanks for taking me on a little date.

145
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:13,862
- You're welcome.

146
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:16,574
I just wanna keep you forever, mama.

147
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:18,818
- You can keep me forever and ever okay?

148
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,917
(Missy laughs)

149
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,500
(bright music)

150
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:33,701
Okay, so I'm vlogging right now because

151
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,831
I really don't know what
to do at this point.

152
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:39,304
I'm so dumb, my brain has just been

153
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,054
like on overdrive all day, I've been

154
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,985
like really stressed out.

155
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,713
I knew I was getting low on gas

156
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:47,693
and I totally forgot and I ran out of gas,

157
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,559
and I ran out of gas on a really, really

158
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:53,101
scary hill on a really, really close

159
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:55,999
area and I have absolutely no service.

160
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,755
I was actually talking to my mom

161
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:58,966
at the time and I surprisingly

162
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:01,857
had service for longer than I usually do.

163
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:04,001
As I heard the phone
cutting out I was like:

164
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,746
"Oh my god, oh my god, mom, mom, mom

165
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:07,110
I ran out of gas, I ran out of gas,"

166
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,247
and I don't know what she

167
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:09,489
heard other than possibly,

168
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:12,093
"oh my god, oh my god, oh
my god, mom, mom, mom."

169
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:13,660
I don't even know what she heard.

170
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,211
She might be freaking out right now.

171
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:18,382
But I don't know what
to do, I'm on a really

172
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:20,505
scary hill, I've got Ollie in the backseat

173
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,118
which is really extra scary.

174
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:23,538
I don't really wanna get out of the car

175
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:26,016
and like walk, the road is not very

176
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:27,595
safe to walk on.

177
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,421
But I have no service, and I'm just hoping

178
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,309
that maybe she did hear me enough

179
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,146
to like send my dad to come get me,

180
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:36,187
but I don't know, no one even knows

181
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,951
where I am or what's going on,

182
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:39,689
I've never been like in a situation

183
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:40,919
like this and I'm so stressed.

184
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,327
I feel bad, Ollie's a little stressed out.

185
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:43,694
It's okay, baby, we're gonna figure

186
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,694
it out, okay?

187
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:45,527
- Okay.

188
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:47,348
- Don't worry, I feel so bad,

189
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:48,731
I probably should talk a little quieter.

190
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:52,226
Car is literally on a hill, on a scary

191
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:54,966
steep incline, and I'm completely out

192
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,346
of gas, and it is all my fault,

193
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,838
I feel so dumb, I'm so dumb.

194
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:00,609
I'm just kind of hoping like my dad

195
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:02,775
might have heard that I ran out of gas

196
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,108
but I don't know, we'll see.

197
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,591
(bright music)

198
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,599
Well, I just made it home.

199
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:17,961
That was really, really scary.

200
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,581
Someone actually ended up pulling over,

201
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,154
and knowing, like, we're on a road

202
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:24,360
where there's no service
and if I broke down

203
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,527
then I'd probably have
no way to contact anyone.

204
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,471
So, he drove me home, so my car's

205
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:31,681
still parked over there,
and I feel so silly.

206
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:34,788
Oh, I feel so dumb,
alright, I gotta tell Bryan.

207
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,955
Hey Bryan, um, our car's
parked on the side of the road.

208
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:42,591
- Umm, how'd that happen?

209
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,061
- I forgot that we ran out of gas.

210
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,144
- Hey, Ollie, did you run out of gas?

211
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,302
- Mhm.

212
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,011
- He's like "mama, what are you doing?"

213
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:53,145
- You couldn't give mama 5 bucks

214
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,517
to put in the gas tank?

215
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,373
(Missy laughing)

216
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:59,109
- Yeah this date really turned
out pretty crappy, Ollie.

217
00:07:59,109 --> 00:07:59,989
(Missy laughing)

218
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:01,402
- It's alright, buddy.

219
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:02,360
So you guys had to walk here?

220
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,796
- No, we got a ride from someone.

221
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:06,193
- From who?

222
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:07,324
- Some person.

223
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:08,157
- Are you serious?

224
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:10,792
- Yeah, it was so scary.

225
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:11,625
- Wait really?

226
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,178
- Yes!

227
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:14,865
(Missy laughing)

228
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:17,914
Yeah, we gotta go get my car.

229
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,416
So, I actually ended up calling my mom,

230
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,950
and she said all she heard was:

231
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,808
"oh my god, I forgot the-"

232
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,392
and so she thought I was saying like

233
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:28,886
"I forgot the-" like something silly.

234
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:32,793
But it's like "no, I forgot
the gas, I'm out of gas, mom!"

235
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,500
So she was just sitting there like:

236
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,957
"hmm, I wonder what she forgot,"

237
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,356
and I'm sitting on the
side of the road like:

238
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:39,409
"mom, come get me!"

239
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,900
But anyways, I'm gonna get this gas tank

240
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,975
and go fill it up and get my car.

241
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:47,058
We have lots of gas, too.

242
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,211
I don't know how I ran out, I'm so

243
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,568
absent minded, I guess.

244
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,319
- Alright, we are headed back to

245
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,632
see where Missy parked the car.

246
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:58,520
Papa to the rescue, he
was borrowing our truck,

247
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,755
and so he came and picked us up so we can

248
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,996
roll down and get the Volvo.

249
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:03,100
- Yeah.

250
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,865
- Crazy girl!

251
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:08,122
- It was so scary because
not having service,

252
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:09,389
like not having gas and no service

253
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,085
is like almost a nightmare.

254
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:14,836
- There's the car, stranded
on the side of the road.

255
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:17,653
- So, I couldn't decide like, what was the

256
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:20,249
safer route, walking home-

257
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:21,161
- Up the hill.

258
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,028
- Up the hill with my toddler on

259
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,584
a kind of scary road, or having someone

260
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,084
like pick us up.

261
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:29,277
- Trusting in someone, basically,

262
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,168
like what a nice guy, who just knew

263
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,940
you needed help and could kind of tell

264
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,041
like you have no service and stuff.

265
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:34,874
- And you can kind of tell,

266
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,707
like you have to get like a vibe from

267
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:37,750
someone like is this a good person

268
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,801
or is this a bad person?

269
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,380
- Alright, so let me know, what would

270
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,919
you guys do if you were
in a situation like this?

271
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,595
Let us know in the comments, would you

272
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:48,460
walk home on a scary
road with your toddler

273
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,082
or trust a stranger for help?

274
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:51,392
We live in one of those worlds where

275
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,769
it's hard to trust strangers, you know?

276
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,466
You definitely got lucky with the

277
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,437
stranger that you trusted today.

278
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:57,492
- I know. I was like:

279
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:58,804
"I'm gonna sit in the back with him,

280
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:00,129
and if I need to jump out of this car

281
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:00,962
I'm going to do it!"

282
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:01,986
(Missy laughing)

283
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,236
- Poor car, just needed a little juice!

284
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:09,730
(bright music)

285
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:13,114
What are we doing Ollie?

286
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:15,580
- Um, feeding the fish some bloodworms.

287
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,403
- You just fed them for the first time.

288
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:18,280
The loid is out.

289
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,346
- The loid's like, "what's up, dude!"

290
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:22,183
- No, no! You can't touch the glass.

291
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,048
(Missy and Bryan laugh)

292
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:26,359
- Yeah, you can't touch the glass, Fin.

293
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,192
I think we might be getting some

294
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,699
new fish tomorrow, boys.

295
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:29,649
- Really?

296
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,218
- Yeah they're coming by to maintenance

297
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:32,748
the tank, and they're gonna bring

298
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,165
us some new fish.

299
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:38,084
- Look at him, he's the coolest guy.

300
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,877
(electronic music)

301
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:52,995
- I'm gonna read this one because

302
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,013
the new Star Wars is coming out.

303
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:56,400
- Yeah it is!

304
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,577
- And you're a storm trooper.

305
00:10:57,577 --> 00:10:59,831
- And you wanna read
'5-Minute Star Wars Stories,'

306
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:03,005
you're dressed as a storm trooper, right?

307
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:03,904
(Fin screaming)

308
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:05,516
- I wanna be that guy!

309
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:06,502
- You're gonna be Darth Vader when

310
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:07,660
we go see the movie?

311
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,493
- Yes!

312
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,383
- Yeah.

313
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:11,797
- And I'm gonna have a lightsaber.

314
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:12,630
- You are?

315
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,463
- Yeah.

316
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:14,296
- Nice.

317
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:15,528
Mama getting you boys ready for bed?

318
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,130
I love his hair all slicked back

319
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,053
like that, it's so cute.

320
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,691
- I like Finn the Star Wars guy.

321
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:24,830
- Finn? Yeah, Finn and BB-8, yeah.

322
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,663
- Yeah.

323
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:26,545
- Who's what?

324
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:27,378
- That.

325
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:29,565
- That is Obi-Wan Kenobi, I believe.

326
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,199
- I thought it was Ollie.

327
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,593
- No, I don't know if there is an Ollie.

328
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,602
- If that's Finn, where's Ollie?

329
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:35,435
(Bryan laughs)

330
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,382
- There should be an Ollie in the

331
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:37,418
Star Wars universe, huh?

332
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:38,551
- Alright, you ready to put some

333
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:40,903
lavender on your ears?

334
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:42,146
- Ooh.

335
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:43,347
- Oh, it tickles.

336
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:44,180
- And some-

337
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,759
- Some on your feeties!

338
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,401
(Fin screaming)

339
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,027
- On your other feet, don't touch it Fin.

340
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:51,640
- You want some on your feet Ollie?

341
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,079
Ollie loves the way it smells.

342
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,919
(Ollie laughing)

343
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,399
Smell your feet, now smell your feet!

344
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,736
What's it smell like?

345
00:11:57,736 --> 00:11:59,025
Lavender, it smells like.

346
00:11:59,025 --> 00:11:59,931
(Fin laughing)

347
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:01,202
- Aw.

348
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:03,664
Today was crazy, that was so funny.

349
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,904
Missy forgot to put gas in the car,

350
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:09,321
broke down, she had to get driven to home

351
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:12,234
by a stranger, and then we had to

352
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:13,368
go back and get the car.

353
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:15,199
It's always a good time with Missy,

354
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:17,086
she keeps life interesting,
that's for sure.

355
