00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,433
- [Bryan] So I thought
I would let Missy share

00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:05,617

Halloween, tradition is.

00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:20,850
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,362

♫ Live forever

15
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,512
- Good morning guys.

16
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:31,686
Oh no, where's Olie.

17
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:32,519
We lost Ollie.

18
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:33,818
Ollie, where are you?

19
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:35,513
(laughs) Are you under the blanket?

20
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:36,450
(bell chime)
- [Olie] Yeah.

21
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,478
(laughing)

22
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:39,588
- [Bryan] Did you hear
Finn's little laugh?

23
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:40,484
- [Missy] Yeah.

24
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:41,378
- Waaah.

25
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:42,828
Say good morning.

26
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:44,153
- Good morning.

27
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:45,065
- [Bryan] How's it going dude?

28
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:45,898
- Good.

29
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:47,149
- Hey Olie, where are
we headed this morning?

30
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,807
- Farmer's Market.

31
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:50,365
- That's right it's Saturday morning,

32
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:53,077
so we are headed to the Farmer's Market.

33
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:54,418
Finn say hi.

34
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:55,639
- Hi.

35
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,705
- [Bryan] He's hiding.

36
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:57,890
(laughing)

37
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,855
Hey dude.

38
00:00:58,855 --> 00:00:59,903
- More.

39
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:02,439
- Yes Finn is excited, Ollie's
excited, we're all excited.

40
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,556
We are headed to the Farmer's
Market, this weekend,

41
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:06,201
and we're gonna meet
Kelsie and Corbin there.

42
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,501
And we're just gonna shop
around for some plants,

43
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,999
or food, or all types of things.

44
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:11,832
- Um, it's officially Fall,

45
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:13,498
so we're gonna decorate
- Yes.

46
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:15,040
- [Missy] our house with fall things.

47
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,606
- So we need like pumpkins

48
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:20,048
and lots of cool stuff like that, so.

49
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:23,475
Check out Buzz Lightyear
on my wrist you guys.

50
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:24,930
(laughing) Sometimes he disappears too.

51
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,763
(relaxing country folk music)

52
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:37,352
(bubble pops)

53
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:42,927
- Strawberries

54
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:44,618
- That's right.

55
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:47,274
These boys always have to
stop by the strawberry stand.

56
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,049
- [Missy] Let mommy buy them, k.

57
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,764
- [Bryan] Sometimes they
sneak them from the baskets

58
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:54,308
and we're forced to buy
the whole thing (laughs).

59
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:57,641
Look at these good looking strawberries.

60
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:01,487
Kids love 'em.

61
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:02,361
What is this?

62
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,516
- I don't know, they look fake.

63
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:04,790
Oh my gosh, they're real.

64
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,623
- [Bryan] I know.

65
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:06,630
- That's so cool.

66
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,651
- [Bryan] I've never seen this before.

67
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:10,133
- Are they tomatoes, like what?

68
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,348
- [Bryan] Or some type of pepper?

69
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:12,911
They look like little pumpkins.

70
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:13,905
- That's cool.

71
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:15,267
- [Bryan] Ollie what
do you think these are?

72
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,254
- Pumpkins, pumpkins, pumpkins.

73
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:18,482
- [Bryan] They look like pumpkins?

74
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,886
- Yes.

75
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:21,299
- [Bryan] (laughs) It's
interesting thing to have

76
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,942
at the flower place.

77
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,034
I've never seen those before.

78
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,474
Ollie look at this apron.

79
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:28,122
It's got Mickey Mouse on it (laughs).

80
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:29,547
Isn't that cool (laughs)?

81
00:02:29,547 --> 00:02:31,287
They have like all types
of handmade aprons,

82
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:32,888
and clothes, and stuff here.

83
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:36,835
The boys got rubber band guns.

84
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:37,668
Wow.

85
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:38,979
Oh, is that one Finn's?

86
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:39,812
- Yeah.

87
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:40,645
- That's pretty cool though, huh?

88
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,540
- I wanted a boat.

89
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,460
- Are you Mr. Grumpy Gills right now?

90
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,212
(laughing) This ones happy.

91
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:48,395
(babbles)

92
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:51,753
- Yeah, I got this new plant

93
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:54,136
for my wall section in my office

94
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:55,580
because one of 'em is dying.

95
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,678
And I think it's so unique

96
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,293
cuz it's got like a
little bit of purple in it

97
00:02:58,293 --> 00:02:59,554
and a little bit of green
- Mama, Dada.

98
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,453
- [Bryan] Whoa, dude.

99
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,153
What are you doing?

100
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:04,882
You're gonna tip the stroller silly.

101
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:08,715
(relaxing country folk music)

102
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:12,677
Mexican food time.

103
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:15,289
I am so excited for this.

104
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,601
Boys, you got a quesadilla?

105
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,860
And look at this tiny, little burrito.

106
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,693
- Mama.

107
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:21,526
- [Bryan] Is he eating it?

108
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:22,359
- Yeah.

109
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,242
- [Bryan] He's been
loving those lately, huh?

110
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:24,113
- He likes beans.

111
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:25,496
- Yeah, that's awesome.

112
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,610
We are all nestled in the shade

113
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,834
and it feels so good out here.

114
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,953
Eating some good Mexican food.

115
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:33,786
(relaxing country folk music)

116
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:51,813
- Fall time.

117
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:52,795
- Yes it is.

118
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:54,655
It is officially Fall time in our house.

119
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,220
We've got Nightmare Before Christmas on

120
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,353
and we are decorating the house

121
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:01,509
for Fall.

122
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:04,370
So excited we get to bring
out all our old decorations,

123
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,996
to put in different places.

124
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,530
Check out this pumpkin planter we got

125
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,702
from the Farmer's Market today, you guys.

126
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:12,951
This is a real pumpkin.

127
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,046
These are real succulents inside of it.

128
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,349
Basically when this pumpkin starts rotting

129
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:20,582
you bury it, bury the
pumpkin under ground,

130
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:21,709
and it acts as a compost.

131
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,106
And then you get, like a little,

132
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,081
mini succulent garden outside.

133
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:25,612
Think that is so cool.

134
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:26,683
How we doing babe?

135
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,516
- Good.

136
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:28,638
That is like my favorite thing.

137
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,304
- I'm lovin' it.
- [Bryan] It's so cool.

138
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,497
We have a lot of Fall decor.

139
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:32,714
I didn't' know we had that much.

140
00:04:32,714 --> 00:04:34,883
- Oh yeah, we got like six buckets of it.

141
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:38,131
- [Bryan] Yeah we've got
leaves, we've got scarecrows,

142
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:40,570
we've got acorn wreaths.

143
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,480
- Yeah this was on the
chicken coop last year.

144
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,742
- [Bryan] Oh yeah.

145
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,153
- We have something
else up there right now,

146
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,493
so I might use this somewhere else.

147
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:48,673
But, it's really pretty.

148
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:49,506
- [Bryan] Yeah.

149
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,020
Oh, and we also do have
this big wreath Babe.

150
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,885
- [Missy] Yeah, you wanna
put that on the front door?

151
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:53,960
- [Bryan] And another scarecrow.

152
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,793
Yeah, that's a good front door one.

153
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,344
Alright Ollie, what do you wanna show 'em?

154
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:58,375
- Um, a gun.

155
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:02,322
- [Bryan] Look at this gun he
got from the Farmer's Market.

156
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:04,741
It's a handmade gun
powered by rubber bands

157
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:05,641
and what does it shoot?

158
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:06,618
- Bullets.

159
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,771
- [Bryan] It shoots like those
little white balls, right?

160
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,604
- Yeah.

161
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:10,437
- [Bryan] Can you get 'em and show me?

162
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:11,288
- Can't find some.

163
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:12,138
- [Bryan] We'll find 'em.

164
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:13,514
Hey Finn, do you know where the balls are?

165
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,650
- (babbles)

166
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,077
- In here?

167
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,182
He pointed in here.

168
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,816
Gotta be some in here.

169
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,880
Finn, what did you do with the balls

170
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,196
for Ollie's new gun?

171
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,063
Do you know where they are?

172
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:25,248
- (babbles)

173
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,354
- Go find 'em.

174
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:28,351
What (laughs)?

175
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:30,254
I think he might think we're
posing for a thumbnail.

176
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:33,112
K, go ahh.

177
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:34,270
- Ahh.

178
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,502
- He's basically a YouTube pro.

179
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,335
See.

180
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,872
Go, whoa.

181
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:39,210
- Ahh.

182
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,332
- Go, ahh.

183
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:42,585
- Ahhh.

184
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,483
- (laughing) He has one expression

185
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:47,193
for all our thumbnails, don't you?

186
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:48,338
Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:51,921
(cheerful xylophone music)

188
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,196
So Sunday has usually become our day

189
00:05:58,196 --> 00:06:01,856
to go to the Farmer's
Market, stock up on veggies,

190
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:03,700
and fruits, and flowers, and plants,

191
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,856
and then also take care of all of 'em.

192
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:08,437
So I've been like, watering the plants.

193
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:09,965
This my day I water all the succulents

194
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,939
and I've been showing you guys that I have

195
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,648
a little star flower cactus in my room.

196
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:19,031
And it has begun opening.

197
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:19,864
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

198
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,090
- [Bryan] Look at that.

199
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,923
Isn't that cool?

200
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,837
- Wow.

201
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,244
- I put it in the sun when we left.

202
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:25,302
Check this out you guys.

203
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,765
We have four more that are gonna pop open

204
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:30,624
really soon cuz this one was actually

205
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:31,957
connected still.

206
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:36,126
So that one kinda just opened up

207
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:40,744
but I heard that these flowers
smell really, really gross.

208
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:43,918
Because they want to
attract flies, and bugs.

209
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:46,113
Cuz they want the bugs
to land on the plant

210
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,320
and fertilize it.

211
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,300
So I was like really worried.

212
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,378
I was like, oh no.

213
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,751
Cuz I'm pretty sure when I bought this

214
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:51,825
that flower was there for awhile.

215
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,244
So it didn't have any smell.

216
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:54,579
- No, I mean..

217
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,520
- You saying this one doesn't right now?

218
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,975
- I definitely don't smell anything bad.

219
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,411
- [Bryan] Alright, well maybe
it's when it fully opens

220
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:00,849
and matures.

221
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:01,736
I don't know.

222
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:02,569
- It's really cool.

223
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,819
It'll be fun to, I bet it's
gonna get brighter too in color.

224
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:07,411
- [Bryan] Yeah, the other one
was like bright red or purple.

225
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:08,859
- Yeah, it was really cool.

226
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,102
- [Bryan] Yeah, I'm excited to
see what this one looks like

227
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:12,368
but I'm gonna give it some sunlight.

228
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:15,357
It doesn't need sunlight, but
I feel like it's gonna help it

229
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:16,190
push is a little more.

230
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,856
You know?

231
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:20,606
(cheerful music)

232
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,248
- [Missy] If you're
wondering why all the boys

233
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,362
are hovered together right here.

234
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:40,792
- Do you see that boys?

235
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,092
What is that?

236
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,422
- [Ollie] A caterpillar.

237
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,367
- [Bryan] That is the
very hungry caterpillar.

238
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,571
Isn't that so cool?

239
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:49,654
- [Missy] That is crazy

240
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:51,379
so is it doing augmentation?

241
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,129
- Its called augmented reality.

242
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,786
- [Missy] He was crawling on you.

243
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:58,928
- [Bryan] And I just hit an
apple and now he's eating eat.

244
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,923
Do you think he's gonna get big?

245
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:01,808
- [Ollie] I think so.

246
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:04,000
- Ooh, okay touch the
apple on the tree Ollie.

247
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,674
(gasps) It fell.

248
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:08,008
He's getting another one.

249
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:10,008
Alright, touch an apple.

250
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,280
Whoa.

251
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:15,950
- So he got two apples.

252
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,961
- Let's touch this
treasure chest over here.

253
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,633
(gasps) Look at all those fun toys.

254
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,770
- Aww.

255
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,459
- [Bryan] He's gonna play with 'em.

256
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,564
- [Missy] Is that so cool?

257
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:25,786
And it's, like, in our house?

258
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:27,245
- It's like, on our carpet.

259
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:28,606
Where's the caterpillar?

260
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:29,459
Oh there he is.

261
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,141
He's gettin' big you guys.

262
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:31,974
- [Missy] Gosh.

263
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:32,940
- [Bryan] Look at that dude.

264
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,773
- [Missy] That's so cool.

265
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,414
That's such a fun game
to play with the boys.

266
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,247
- I know.

267
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,184
He's getting so big.

268
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,087
And look at all these toys
he's playing with now.

269
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,096
- [Missy] Finn is like so confused.

270
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:42,589
He's like, I don't really get it.

271
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,525
- This is so cool Babe.

272
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:44,700
There's like a little toy box.

273
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,576
Look.

274
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:47,200
And you can select a toy to play with.

275
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,096
And he plays with it.

276
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,605
- [Missy] That's so cute.

277
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:51,438
- Oh my gosh.

278
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:52,567
- [Missy] What a fun little game.

279
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,026
Is this only on the new iPhone?

280
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:57,838
- So I think this is like the new AR thing

281
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,005
on the IOS 11.

282
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:02,301
I think it runs really
well on the new iPhone.

283
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:05,838
- It's so crazy to think about
the different technologies

284
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:09,903
that are going to be available
for the kids vs what we had.

285
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,894
They're going to be playing games

286
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:15,548
with things in the house (laughs).

287
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,511
Hydrate (laughs).

288
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:18,806
- It's actually right there on your knee.

289
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:19,639
- Oh.

290
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,472
- [Bryan] Caterpillar.

291
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,305
Does it tickle?

292
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:22,138
- That's so cool.

293
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:22,971
Yup.

294
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,967
Oh my gosh, my knee is tickling.

295
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,201
- Let's get another toy.

296
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,840
Oh look it, we can blow him bubbles.

297
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,166
Alright, we're blowing bubbles.

298
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,277
(coughing)

299
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:33,360
Blow bubbles.

300
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:37,921
(laughing)

301
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:40,838
That is so cool.

302
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,870
(cheerful music)

303
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,624
So I think we are done
setting up the house for Fall.

304
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,868
A couple of things, we don't
really do the full house

305
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:02,719
for Fall.

306
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,900
We just kind of do the main areas.

307
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,357
Whereas for Christmas, we go all out.

308
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:06,539
There's Christmas trees everywhere.

309
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,422
For Fall and Halloween time,

310
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:10,311
there are pumpkins everywhere you guys.

311
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:13,680
But a lot of pumpkins, we
actually got from Pottery Barn.

312
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,488
I did not know Pottery Barn had

313
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:17,754
like a lot of Halloween
decor, but they actually do.

314
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:20,106
So, we got a lot of really
cool pumpkins from there

315
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,944
and something else we got there

316
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:25,429
is gonna start a brand
new family tradition.

317
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,997
So I thought, I would let Missy share

318
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:30,740
what our brand new Halloween tradition is.

319
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,847
You guys wanna hear?

320
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,667
- Okay so, Bryan found this really cute

321
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,917
Halloween Advent calendar.

322
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,394
So usually you have
like a Christmas Advent.

323
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:41,063
- [Bryan] I don't know if
you can call it an Advent,

324
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:42,398
but it's a countdown calendar.

325
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,766
- Yeah, you're right.

326
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:45,921
But I'm really excited about it.

327
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:47,104
So, look how cute it is.

328
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,667
First of all, it's got
this cute, little skeleton

329
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,540
and the words are so cute.

330
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,373
And then it's got..

331
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:52,638
- [Bryan] Ollie's like
why are there balls on it?

332
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:54,281
(laughing)

333
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,871
- That's what he asked me earlier.

334
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,740
Do you like that skeleton?

335
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,592
- Yeah.

336
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:58,425
It's cool looking?

337
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,258
- [Finn] No.

338
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,792
- So it's got all these little pockets

339
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,625
with numbers on it counting down

340
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,496
all the way to 31.

341
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,780
And then everyday during
the month of October,

342
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,706
there'll be a little piece of candy

343
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:09,789
for each kid.

344
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:12,877
And they can take one out all the way

345
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,565
until we get to Halloween.

346
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,133
- That's gonna be such a cool tradition

347
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,858
because we're gonna be able
to countdown to Halloween.

348
00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:20,433
Which is one of Ollie's
favorite holidays, right?

349
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,506
You're so excited for Halloween (laughs).

350
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:26,130
He asked us today, he's
like, is it Halloween today?

351
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,758
Not yet.

352
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:28,893
You were so excited though, huh?

353
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:31,136
- He was so afraid that
he missed Halloween

354
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:32,147
- [Bryan] Yeah.

355
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:33,432
- I'm like trust me, you'll
know when Halloween's here.

356
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:35,191
Yeah, I love this though.

357
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,423
I think this is super cute.

358
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:38,374
It's just something I wanna keep around.

359
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:40,722
- [Bryan] We should scare them everyday,

360
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:42,602
before they pick one.

361
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,077
- Scare them.

362
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:46,578
- [Bryan] Or wear a Halloween
costume everyday (laughs).

363
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:47,610
- [Finn] Mama (crying).

364
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,498
- [Bryan] Do something cool.

365
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:49,962
- Or just tell them everyday,
no candy in this one.

366
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:50,827
- (laughs) Yeah.

367
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:54,205
Oops, Jack Skellington forgot
to put a candy in that one.

368
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:55,417
- Oh, that's so cute.

369
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,708
- [Bryan] Yeah.

370
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,458
(cheerful music)

371
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,012
- Mama.

372
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:11,904
- I love you.

373
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:13,179
Sleep good, k?

374
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,380
I'm gonna put Finn to bed.

375
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,593
- Night Finn.

376
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:16,962
- No.

377
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:18,696
He's so tired.

378
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,520
- He missed his nap today, so.

379
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,038
- [Bryan] Oh, good
night buddy, I love you.

380
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:24,317
Aww, he really is so tired.

381
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:26,843
It's time for bed.

382
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:29,117
One thing that we have
been doing for awhile now,

383
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:31,543
is having Karma lay with Ollie.

384
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,391
Hey Ollie, do you like
sleeping with Karma?

385
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:34,318
- Yeah.

386
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,187
- [Bryan] Yeah, why do you
like sleeping with him?

387
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,604
- He protects me.

388
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:39,697
- [Bryan] He protects you?

389
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:40,530
- Yeah.

390
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,196
- [Bryan] Aww, Karma c'mon.

391
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,611
He's such a good boy about it too.

392
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:44,994
C'mon, up on the bed.

393
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:46,157
Alright, hop in bed boys.

394
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:46,990

395
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,238
Karma, Olie, hop in bed.

396
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,511
Good night Karma boy.

397
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:51,470
You're a good puppy.

398
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,701

Can I have a kiss?
