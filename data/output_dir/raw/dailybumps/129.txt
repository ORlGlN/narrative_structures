1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,739
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie.

2
00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:02,572
- What?

3
00:00:02,572 --> 00:00:03,707
- [Bryan] You've been drinking my soda?

4
00:00:03,707 --> 00:00:04,615
- No, what?

5
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:05,629
- [Bryan] Yes, you have.

6
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:06,462
- No.

7
00:00:06,462 --> 00:00:07,295
- [Bryan] Where'd it all go then?

8
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:08,204
- You drinked it!

9
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:09,204
- [Bryan] No, I didn't!

10
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:10,328
- Just drinked it!

11
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:13,367
- [Bryan] I saw you over here drinking it.

12
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,258
(Bryan laughs)

13
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:17,129
♫ This is our life

14
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,912
♫ Let's live it, live it forever

15
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:23,495
(gentle music)

16
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:29,794
- [Missy] Good morning, boys!

17
00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:30,841
(Finn laughing)

18
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:31,756
- Don't bite me!

19
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:33,628
- [Missy] I think he's
trying to give you kisses.

20
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:36,258
- No, I think he's trying to bite me.

21
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:37,091
- Oh, yeah?

22
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,346
Finley, you two are just a bunch of boys.

23
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:41,679
Good morning!
- Good morning!

24
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:43,895
- [Missy] These boys are giving me loves.

25
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:45,749
- These boys are crazy!

26
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:49,398
(Bryan yells)
(Missy laughs)

27
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,538
What's up, dude?

28
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:52,635
What's up my little dinosaurs?

29
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,860
- [Missy] Look at the cute outfits!

30
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,279
Here Ollie, lets show off your outfit.

31
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,666
- Look at their super cute new Rags.

32
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,499
- [Missy] I love them!

33
00:00:58,499 --> 00:00:59,332
- These are from Rags to Raches,

34
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:00,843
they just did a dino drop.

35
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:01,833
- [Missy] I love it.

36
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,183
- I wasn't able to get the
same design for both of them

37
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:04,986
but I was like, "I'll just
get it different then."

38
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:06,027
- [Missy] I actually love the fact

39
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:07,248
that they're wearing
basically the same thing

40
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:08,833
but they're not exactly matching.

41
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,064
- We dress them as if they're twins

42
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:12,174
almost every single day.

43
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:13,550
- Yeah, it is.

44
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,731
If you don't know I have a
little bit of an obsession

45
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:17,203
when it comes to them matching.

46
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,163
I get really stressed out.

47
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:19,403
- I think she just wanted twins.

48
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:21,458
- I know, I get stressed out
when they're not matching,

49
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,321
but actually this is super
cute cause they're like,

50
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:28,068
matching but not identical.
- Look at those dino-booties!

51
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:30,664
- I literally love Rags to Ratches.

52
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,379
They're just the cutest outfits,

53
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,373
and they're easy, and they're fun,

54
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:37,409
and the boys love them
'cause they're comfortable.

55
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,964
- Three, two,

56
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:40,495
one, go!

57
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:44,691
(Ollie and Finn giggling)

58
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:46,714
- I win!
(Missy laughs)

59
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:49,381
(playful music)

60
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:56,299
- It is another beautiful day, huh?

61
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:59,747
We're wearing our long sleeves!

62
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:03,299
I mean, it's not freezing,
but it feels nice out, huh?

63
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,965
Okay, crazy boys, why are you guys

64
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:07,204
just daredevils all the time?

65
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:10,485
Life with boys is (sighs) so much!

66
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:12,582
I have to go get some chicken food today

67
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:13,415
and I have to figure out

68
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:14,608
what I'm gonna do with these roosters.

69
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:16,941
I have three roosters
that cock-a-doodle-doo

70
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:21,105
all morning long, all day
long, and it's just a lot.

71
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:23,940
But I actually have a lady,
the lady who gave me the egg.

72
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,536
She said if any of them
end up being roosters

73
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:27,049
that she would actually take them

74
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,539
because she is constantly
breeding and stuff.

75
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:33,374
And so she loves, especially
her rooster Silkies,

76
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:35,480
so she can continue making more Silkies.

77
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,999
I think I may end up
calling her eventually,

78
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,395
maybe not right away, but
maybe just come pick them up

79
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:42,306
because they're gonna have a great home.

80
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,656
They have a great farm and I love her,

81
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:47,395
she just seems like such
a good chicken owner.

82
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:49,044
They'll be a lot happier in a place

83
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,909
where I'm not going,
"shut up," all the time.

84
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,421
Whoa, what happened to your hulk hand?

85
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:55,413
(rooster crows)

86
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:56,960
Oh, there goes one right now.

87
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,775
Those Silkies, plus they're
fertilizing my eggs.

88
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,169
Does that make sense, they're fert--

89
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:02,747
They're making them fertile.

90
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,864
(rooster crows)

91
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:07,332
And that's so hard, every
time I crack open an egg

92
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:10,500
I'm so scared that a
chicken's gonna pop out,

93
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,069
because maybe I left
it out there too long,

94
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,780
maybe I thought I got all the eggs

95
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,597
and it sat out there for longer

96
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:17,305
and I'm gonna be honest,
it's happened before.

97
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:20,067
So, it's always now my fear
because I have roosters.

98
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,200
- All right, I have my two best boys

99
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,184
loaded up in the car and
we're gonna go eat some lunch.

100
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,762
(boys cheer)
You ready?

101
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:28,538
Doing a little lunch
date with the boys today

102
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:30,248
while Missy has a doctor's appointment.

103
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:31,532
Oh, look there she is!

104
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:32,374
What are you doing?

105
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:33,604
- I forgot my purse!

106
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,352
- [Bryan] Oh, my gosh (laughs).

107
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,213
You drove all the way

108
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,796
where we were going to
lunch to get your purse?

109
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:38,759
- Well, it's on the way.

110
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,769
- [Bryan] Oh, that's so funny.

111
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,818
Say bye to mama.

112
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,599
- Bye!
- Bye!

113
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,944
- I love you!

114
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:45,483
- [Bryan] Love you, babe (laughs).

115
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,359
That was so funny, that was
not even planned at all.

116
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,855
(laughs) All right, let's go eat!

117
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,005
- Whoa!

118
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:50,838
- [Bryan] What?

119
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:53,185
- That place has got
Christmas stuff in it.

120
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:54,220
- [Bryan] Really?

121
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,073
- Look!

122
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,227
- [Bryan] We're going to
Mexican food for lunch

123
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:58,758
and they're all decorated for Christmas.

124
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:00,698
Yes, they are, huh?
- Yes!

125
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,450
- [Bryan] Are you excited
for Christmas, boys?

126
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,283
- [Ollie] Yes!

127
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:04,923
- See these boys are just like us,

128
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,774
once Halloween's done,
they're ready for Christmas.

129
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:08,207
- Cheers, too slow!

130
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,591
- [Bryan] Aw.

131
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,807
Cheers, too slow!

132
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:13,538
Cheers, too slow!

133
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:15,304
Cheers (laughs).

134
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:16,999
We always have to cheers our chips.

135
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,276
Cheers!

136
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:19,853
Hey, Ollie.
- What?

137
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,520
- [Bryan] You've been drinking my soda?

138
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,455
- No.

139
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:23,502
- [Bryan] Yes, you have.

140
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:24,335
- No.

141
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:25,168
- [Bryan] Where'd it all go then?

142
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:26,099
- You drinked it!

143
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,079
- [Bryan] No, I didn't!

144
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,147
- Just drink it!

145
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:31,506
- [Bryan] I saw you over here drinking it.

146
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:35,458
(laughs) You drank all my
soda, Ollie, didn't you?

147
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,545
Ollie, tell the truth,
did you drink all my soda?

148
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,700
Are you sure?

149
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,925
- Just drink it!

150
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:44,463
- [Bryan] (laughs) Who
drank all my soda, then?

151
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:45,910
Was it Finn?
- Yeah.

152
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,716
- [Bryan] Finn, did you drink all my soda?

153
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:48,549
- No.

154
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,322
- I think Finn drank all my soda.

155
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:54,307
- You guys, it is slowly turning into

156
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:55,727
Christmas!
- Christmas!

157
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:58,113
We have a Christmas bed, our bed.

158
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,799
- I don't think we've
ever actually done this.

159
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,128
- Yeah, I think we have.

160
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:01,961
- [Missy] Really, like a Christmas bed?

161
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,320
- I feel like we really
needed something red.

162
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,340
But look at this, this
is velvet, you guys.

163
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,806
- [Missy] I love it.

164
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:11,334
- All we had to do was
change our shams and quilt.

165
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:12,734
- It was so easy!

166
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,671
So, we have a big white duvet under it

167
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,154
with white sheets and white pillowcases.

168
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:19,224
So literally, this is just like a quilt.

169
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:20,293
I love it.
- It literally feels

170
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:21,367
like you're sleeping with Santa.

171
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,668
- Yeah, it is so soft!

172
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:24,784
I love it!

173
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,328
Look, we still have fall in here too.

174
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,727
We are slowly doing Christmas

175
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,023
throughout this month.
- Look at these pillows.

176
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:32,390
- And for those of you who are like,

177
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,446
"whoa, whoa, whoa, you
can't skip Thanksgiving."

178
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,319
We're not, right?

179
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,794
- Yeah, I'm not gonna get
a comforter that has a--

180
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:40,849
- Turkey on it?
- Turkey on it.

181
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:43,670
- We're not skipping Thanksgiving,
we love Thanksgiving.

182
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,551
We can't wait to celebrate Thanksgiving.

183
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:49,394
But I like to do it with
Christmas decor around, too.

184
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:50,953
All right, boys, where we at?

185
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:52,805
- Jumping play place!

186
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:55,388
- Yay, they're so excited I'm
gonna take them in to play.

187
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,688
Who are we gonna hang out with?

188
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,819
- CJ and Bailey!

189
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,585
- Yeah, so we're gonna go
hang out with CJ and Bailey

190
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:04,255
for a little bit and let em
play and run off some energy.

191
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:05,153
And then, we'll head home.

192
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:06,559
Daddy's at home getting some work done,

193
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:09,080
so we'll see you in a little bit, okay?

194
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,479
- Okay.
- Let's go.

195
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,874
Look what I've acquired,
a little baby girl!

196
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,153
Say hi, Emma.

197
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:17,371
This is Roses' baby.

198
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:21,047
She is almost 6 months
old and she's so sweet.

199
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,556
Yeah, we're here with my
Aunt Linda and CJ and Bailey.

200
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:25,642
I don't know where they all are.

201
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:28,199
Olivia's back there,
the kids are so happy.

202
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,144
I can't even get a picture of them

203
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,875
'cause they're just running like crazy.

204
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,458
(upbeat music)

205
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,651
- What's up dude, how was playing?

206
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,572
- I'm good.

207
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,268
- [Bryan] Good, are we
feeding the fish now?

208
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:45,101
- Yup.

209
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:46,616
- [Bryan] Yep, and I thought it would be

210
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:47,469
a good opportunity for you

211
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,202
to show people our new fish.
- Yeah.

212
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,731
- [Bryan] I don't think we've
shown him on YouTube yet.

213
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:52,564
- Yeah.

214
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:53,797
- [Bryan] Which one is it?

215
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:56,674
- The yellow one is named OJ.

216
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,803
- [Bryan] Yeah, because he
looks like orange juice.

217
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:01,163
You know your initials are OJ too?

218
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:05,852
- Really?
- Yeah, OJL, yeah (laughs).

219
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:07,784
Papa and the boys actually picked up

220
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:09,528
a yellow tang a week ago

221
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,841
and it's kinda starting to
come out into the front.

222
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:13,817
You can see it right there.

223
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:14,650
He's getting a little shy

224
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,998
'cause we're getting ready to feed it

225
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,555
but it's a cool little tang, huh?

226
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,400
Of course, Dude's still doing alright.

227
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,388
You all right, dude?

228
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:22,139
Yes.
(crying)

229
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,978
Finn's like, "Why aren't
we feeding them yet?"

230
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,305
(gentle music)

231
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:31,519
All right, Finn's feeding the fishies.

232
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,130
So for those of you who are
wondering how we feed our fish,

233
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,250
we feed them three times a day.

234
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,581
Mostly all at the same time

235
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:39,986
but it's three different things a day.

236
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:41,999
So we feed these pellets.

237
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,705
And then we also feed
them the blood worms.

238
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:47,276
And then, we also do seaweed.

239
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:49,076
Certain fish need certain things

240
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,052
so putting all of these
in there just makes sure

241
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:53,982
that everyone gets what
they need to thrive.

242
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:56,397
Look at them eating the pellets though.

243
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:57,938
They do love to eat (laughs).

244
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,021
- [Missy] This one especially.

245
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,166
He gets so excited for dinner.

246
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,433
- Kai's coming out!

247
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,424
- [Bryan] Whoa he is, huh?

248
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:07,685
He's peeking in and out of
his little hole (laughs).

249
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,841
Even now, just trying
to vlog him is so hard.

250
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:11,468
Look, there he is, there he is!

251
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:14,044
- [Ollie] He's trying
to get away from that.

252
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:15,846
- [Bryan] Say hi, Kai!

253
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:17,088
- Hi, Kai!

254
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:19,897
Now it's time to give them blood worms.

255
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:20,952
- [Bryan] That's right!

256
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:21,785
You're gonna do it?

257
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,722
- [Missy] You gotta mix it up really good.

258
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:25,235
All right, just give it a little squeeze.

259
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:28,620
- [Bryan] Squeeze just
a tiny bit (chuckles).

260
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,125
There you go!

261
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,274
- [Missy] Good job!

262
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:33,489
Look at little Lloyd.

263
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:36,072
(gentle music)

264
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,438
Hey Ollie, I know you like

265
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:41,121
to fall in fountains but lets be careful

266
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,329
and not have you fall
in the fish tank, okay?

267
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,910
(laughs) Wouldn't that be funny though?

268
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,501
Can you imagine falling
into this fish tank, Ollie?

269
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,300
You could probably swim
in it, you're big enough.

270
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,733
(Missy laughs)

271
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,530
He's like, "I do not wanna do that."

272
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,304
- There's fish in there,
they will sting you.

273
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:56,142
- [Bryan] Yeah.

274
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,682
And now, it is time for seaweed.

275
00:08:58,682 --> 00:09:00,672
Which we put on these little clips

276
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:03,380
and then we move them down into the tank.

277
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,721
- [Missy] We have like
the little magnetic--

278
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:06,474
- Yeah, all right, guys,

279
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:11,406
it is now time to do the
Soggy Doggy bath challenge.

280
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,779
We are gonna play Soggy Doggy.

281
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,324
And Ollie is so excited,
his finger dancing.

282
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:16,739
(Missy and Bryan laugh)

283
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,429
Are you so excited, Finn?
- Yeah!

284
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,128
- [Bryan] Do you see this cute puppy dog?

285
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:22,231
- Oh, it's so cute.

286
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,448
Look at his treat.

287
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:24,882
- [Bryan] Aw, it's his treat?

288
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:25,715
- Yeah.

289
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,072
- [Bryan] All right, so
we have the board game.

290
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:28,950
We have all the pieces.

291
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,246
And Missy is putting this together now.

292
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:32,991
Wait until you see this
cute, little doggy.

293
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:37,081
Look at this cute, little
doggy sitting in a bath tub

294
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:38,347
'cause he's ready for his bath.

295
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:39,965
Oh, is he kind of bouncy?

296
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:41,157
That's cool, huh?

297
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,674
And then, it has like little levers here.

298
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:46,505
And apparently it shakes when he's wet

299
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:48,342
and he gets you guys all wet, huh?

300
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:49,678
Are you guys excited to play?

301
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:51,032
- Yeah!
- All right.

302
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:53,726
We cannot play the Soggy Doggy game

303
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,585
until you name this puppy.

304
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,668
'Cause this like our
new little puppy, right?

305
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:59,569
Oops, broke it.

306
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:00,756
What should we name it?

307
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:03,905
- I want to name it Charlie.
- Charlie?

308
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:06,000
- That is such a cute, normal name.

309
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,903
How come you never come up

310
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:09,226
with cute names like
that for our real pets?

311
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:10,352
(Missy laughs)

312
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:11,547
(laughs) I love it.

313
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:13,174
Let's call him Charlie, okay?

314
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:15,166
You guys ready to play Soggy Doggy?

315
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:15,999
- Yeah!

316
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:16,832
- [Bryan] All right, boys,

317
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,246
pick which character you wanna be.

318
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:20,436
- [Ollie] I wanna be the soap.

319
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:22,565
- [Missy] I'm gonna be the ducky.

320
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,200
- [Bryan] And I will be the paw print.

321
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,064
- So, the youngest
player gets to go first.

322
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:26,962
That's you, Finn.

323
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,371
- [Bryan] Are you sure that's not Ollie?

324
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:29,604
(Missy laughs)

325
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:30,577
Just kidding.

326
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:32,319
- [Missy] All right, Finn,
you get to roll your dice.

327
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,757
Can you throw it?

328
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:34,939
Oh, gosh (laughs).

329
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:37,280
- [Bryan] Careful, brace yourself!

330
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,562
(Bryan laughs)

331
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:41,652
- Just throw it onto the
thing, like this, baby.

332
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,176
- [Bryan] Can you do that, Finn?

333
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,698
- [Ollie] Yep, do you want me to show you?

334
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:46,676
- Okay, you can show him.

335
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:47,509
Good job.

336
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:49,071
- [Bryan] Perfect, can you do it, Finn?

337
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:49,904
Roll the dice.

338
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:51,918
- [Missy] Roll the
dice, put it right here.

339
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:52,763
(Missy laughs)

340
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:54,038
- [Bryan] No, oh, there you go.

341
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:55,360
He rolled a blue!

342
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,893
- Press down the faucet
with the bone one time.

343
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:01,014
- [Bryan] All right,
we're turning it once.

344
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:02,066
(Missy gasps)
Nothing.

345
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,889
- [Missy] Made it, okay.

346
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:04,955
- [Bryan] What did you roll?

347
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,561
- Yellow!
- Yellow.

348
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:08,278
All right, so take your little guy.

349
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:10,523
And you get to all the way to the yellow.

350
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:11,915
And that means you can turn

351
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:14,665
the little bone faucet two times.

352
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:16,449
One, two.

353
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,562
Yeah, so I get to go
right where you're at.

354
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,004
I'm gonna turn the faucet twice.

355
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,986
Do you wanna turn it for
me since I did it for you?

356
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:26,376
- [Bryan] Turn it twice, buddy.

357
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,844
Good job, one more time.

358
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:31,721
- [Missy] Yay, all
right, it's Daddy's turn.

359
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:34,804
(lighthearted music)

360
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,283
Okay, what are you doing?

361
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,450
- I gotta push this twice.

362
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:41,626
(Missy gasps)

363
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:43,105
Sprayed the water on the puppy dog.

364
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:44,722
- That's so cute!

365
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:46,555
Okay, can you turn it?

366
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,516
- [Bryan] Oh!

367
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:51,397
- Oh, my goodness.

368
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:52,726
- [Bryan] He's shaking off.

369
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:55,212
(laughs)

370
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:56,505
That's so cute.

371
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:58,139
He's really wet.

372
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,911
Guess that's what happens when
you try to wash a dog, huh?

373
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:04,279
(Missy laughs)
(toy whirs)

374
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,346
He's getting everything so wet.

375
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:07,469
- [Missy] Good job, good job.

376
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:10,552
(lighthearted music)

377
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:35,512
- Are you ready?
- Yep.

378
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:38,446
(toy whirs)
(Bryan yells)

379
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:41,767
- He's getting us all wet (laughs).

380
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,834
- Down boy.
- Down boy.

381
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,706
- [Missy] He doesn't
stop 'til you turn it.

382
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:48,090
(laughs) Wow!

383
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,019
- [Bryan] Getting me all wet.

384
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,439
- [Missy] What a fun game.

385
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,572
Do you like this game, Ollie?
- Yeah.

386
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,446
- It's pretty fun.

387
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:56,261
(Bryan yells)

388
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,243
(Missy yells)

389
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,326
(lighthearted music)

390
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:04,788
- All right, is it
storytime and then bedtime?

391
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,399
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

392
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,560
They just finished their shower.

393
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,559
And they brushed their teeth.

394
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,934
And now, it is story time.

395
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,425
We just read, "The Best Pirate".

396
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:16,484
Then, we're gonna read,
"How to Catch a Monster".

397
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:17,508
That's a good one, huh?

398
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:20,780
And then, we just got this
brand new book called,

399
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,550
"The Rabbit Who Wants To Fall Asleep."

400
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,578
And this one is a really, really cool book

401
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:28,325
that Mommy is especially excited about.

402
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,544
Yeah, if you haven't heard of this book,

403
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:31,610
definitely look it up.

404
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,970
It's called, "A new way of
getting children to sleep."

405
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,252
And I think it uses a
little bit of hypnotism

406
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,439
and you have to read it a very special way

407
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:41,853
in order to help them fall asleep.

408
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,776
My kids don't have too hard
of a time going to bed.

409
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,978
They're pretty much exhausted (laughs).

410
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:48,988
But I'm excited to read this
book and see if it works.

411
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:51,112
But anyways, I do wanna tell you guys.

412
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:51,945
Hey, Ollie.

413
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:52,778
- [Ollie] What?

414
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:56,128
- [Missy] Have you seen our
new music video, "Tribe"?

415
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:56,961
- Yeah.

416
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,185
- [Missy] Yes, and did you love it?

417
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:01,485
Is your favorite part seeing
Auntie dress up as a witch?

418
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:03,803
- Yeah.
- And Papa as a dinosaur?

419
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:04,694
- Yeah.
- Anyways,

420
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:05,787
I just wanted to let you guys know

421
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:07,156
that we have a new music video up.

422
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,185
If you haven't seen it,

423
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:10,392
it'll be linked up here in the iCard.

424
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,415
And we are just so excited about it.

425
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:13,387
We absolutely love it.

426
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,164
It turned out really super cute.

427
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:18,901
It was very like family
oriented and really fun.

428
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,312
So make sure you guys go check it out.

429
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:21,554
And I also wanted to let you guys know

430
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,507
that we actually have merch available.

431
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:25,189
I'll have it linked
down in the description.

432
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:28,532
You can buy merch for our music
video or the song "Tribe".

433
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:31,123
And obviously, just all of
our regular Daily Bumps merch.

434
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:32,223
So if you guys wanna check that out,

435
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:33,264
I'll have it linked down below.

436
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:35,895
But for now, it's time for
me to put these kids to bed.

437
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,900
Can you say, "Give the video a thumbs up?"

438
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,767
Thumbs up, oh, look at him.

439
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,284
He's still participating.

440
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:43,345
Say, "We'll see you tomorrow."

441
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:44,860
- [Ollie] See you tomorrow.

442
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,276
- [Missy] All right, what do you say?

443
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,284
(Finn babbles)

444
00:14:48,284 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat theme music)
