13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,353
- Good morning, guys.

14
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:26,440
It is just us this morning, huh?

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,812
Daddy's in San Francisco

16
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:30,400
at a YouTube meeting

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,964
and he will be back, actually tonight,

18
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:34,140
but really, really late.

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,660
So you guys probably won't see him today.

20
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,250
I'm not quite sure what we're planning

21
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,083
to do today.

22
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,930
I'm actually planning
to go get my hair done

23
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,650
really quick, so Papa's headed up

24
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,410
to watch the boys, but
then we'll come back

25
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,243
and then I don't know.

26
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:45,512
We should probably do something fun, huh?

27
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,345
- Yeah.

28
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:47,342
- [Missy] What do you
think we should do today?

29
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:48,900
- Maybe go swimmin'?

30
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,700
- Swimmin' would actually be really fun.

31
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,910
It is probably really
cold, but the hot tub

32
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,743
would be cool, huh?

33
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:55,666
What do you wanna do today?

34
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,202
- Um, daddy.

35
00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:58,176
- Daddy?

36
00:00:58,176 --> 00:00:59,148
- Yeah.

37
00:00:59,148 --> 00:00:59,981
- You wanna see Daddy?

38
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:00,814
- Yeah.

39
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:02,550
- Well, we can't see Daddy,

40
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,780
that's the one thing we can't do.

41
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,587
- I wanna go rock climbin'.

42
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:08,065
- Rock climbing would be really cool.

43
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:08,898
- Yeah.

44
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:09,940
- That sounds really fun.

45
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,773
So yeah, we gotta figure out

46
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:11,717
our plan today.

47
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:13,041
I think it's gonna be a fun day, huh?

48
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:17,280
Just me and the boys, let's go.

49
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,334
All right, I am headed into
my hair appointment now

50
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:24,080
and man, guys, it is so chilly.

51
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,470
It has been like so warm this whole winter

52
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,891
and I've talked about it a lot.

53
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:29,846
And when it has been, like, cold

54
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:31,940
it's been, like, yeah, it's chilly

55
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,960
but, like, the air is
just so much crisper now.

56
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,451
Like it feels like that
wintery, crispy air.

57
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:38,880
I'm sure almost everyone
knows what I'm talking

58
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,370
about right now because it's probably cold

59
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,941
where you are and you know
exactly what I'm talking

60
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:44,170
about, but yeah, I'm,
like, wearing a jacket

61
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,747
'cause it's cold, it's crispy cold.

62
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:49,770
All right, I am headed
home now, hair is done.

63
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,696
I don't know if you can tell,

64
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:54,644
but I definitely needed
a good little hair-doin'.

65
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:56,360
(mumbles) does such a good job.

66
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,761
Like, she does it and
it's, like, not frizzy

67
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,704
or thick or crazy.

68
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,050
It's so nice, it just
feels like a whole new

69
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,430
head of hair when we does my hair.

70
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,361
While I was at the hair salon,

71
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:07,950
I came up with a great idea

72
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,059
of what I wanna do with the boys today.

73
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,580
Actually, I shouldn't take all the credit.

74
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,850
My mom helped me come
with a really awesome idea

75
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,710
and I think they're
gonna be really excited

76
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,670
and super surprised.

77
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,061
I don't think they would think

78
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:20,640
that I would take them to do this.

79
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,480
So I'm gonna go home and get them all,

80
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,811
including Papa and Mimi,
and we're gonna head

81
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,782
to a little fun surprise.

82
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,365
(mellow music)

83
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,158
All right, we just made
it to our secret spot.

84
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:54,540
You wanna tell them where we're going?

85
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,911
We're going --

86
00:02:55,911 --> 00:03:00,374
- At the, at the fish (mumbles).

87
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:03,210
- We're going fishing.

88
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,553
And Finn just ran over here to show you.

89
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:07,499
Are we gonna catch one of those, Finn?

90
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,481
- Yes!

91
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,406
- [Missy] A fishy?

92
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:13,079
Oh my goodness, Finn, this
is like your first time

93
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,051
fishin', huh?

94
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,423
Actually my mom and dad
took Ollie here once

95
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:19,880
a long time ago, or quite a while ago.

96
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,713
Maybe like a year ago?

97
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:21,546
Two years ago?

98
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:23,226
And so I'll have that
video linked down below,

99
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:26,290
up here because it was so cute.

100
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,206
Ollie, like, dropped his pole

101
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:30,149
and, like, it went into the pond

102
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:32,604
and it was just like a
super-cute little vlog.

103
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:34,230
So you guys all check it out.

104
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,521
But now we're going fishing

105
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:38,160
and it is a pretty small pond.

106
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,721
We don't have a lot of
them here in California.

107
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:40,650
(laughs)

108
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,336
Fishing is a big deal
when you're in California,

109
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,389
'cause you gotta find a pond

110
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,185
and you gotta see if there's fish

111
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,073
and you gotta see if
you're allowed to fish.

112
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,910
- [Papa] Don't wake the duck up.

113
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,743
- [Missy] Shh, there's a duck.

114
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:51,469
No one wake the duck.

115
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:52,302
Shh.

116
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,496
Wow, it's such a well-behaved --

117
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:57,212
- Get right up to it and pet it.

118
00:03:57,212 --> 00:04:01,930
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, she
just touched the duck.

119
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,100
Did you see that, Finn?

120
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,294
- [Mimi] Is he real?

121
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,220
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

122
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,940
- [Oliver] Guys, he's not real.

123
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,440
- So yeah, we're gonna go fishin'

124
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,590
and see if we can catch anything.

125
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,761
You think you'll catch anything, Ollie?

126
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,594
- Yeah.

127
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:14,427
- [Missy] You're a little older now.

128
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:15,642
You gonna let go of that pole?

129
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:18,070
Don't let go of the pole, okay?

130
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,732
(mellow music)

131
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,500
- We've gotta get the
fish, who live out there,

132
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,620
we need 'em to come in here with us, okay?

133
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,350
We're gonna talk 'em into it.

134
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,661
We're gonna tell 'em,
"Come here, fishies," okay?

135
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:36,494
- Okay.

136
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:38,340
- So have you guys been
practicing your fish call?

137
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,291
- [Missy] Do you know
how to do your fish call?

138
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,962
- Oh my gosh!

139
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:42,513
- Oh my gosh!

140
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,160
- I just hear a fishy.

141
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,360
- [Missy] A fish just jumped.

142
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,044
- Pretty cool.

143
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:48,735
- [Missy] He says "I wanna
go home with you guys."

144
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,122
- [Papa] Yeah.

145
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,705
(mellow music)

146
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:56,746
(record scratch)

147
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,679
- [Missy] He's putting some
extra security on there.

148
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,012
- [Oliver] Yeah.

149
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:05,029
- [Papa] That's not going nowhere.

150
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:06,946
- [Mimi] From experience.

151
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:08,330
- [Missy] (laughing) From experience,

152
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,124
because we know that Ollie just lets go.

153
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:12,607
- We're just gonna relax.

154
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:13,442
Hold the pole up in the air.

155
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:15,006
- [Missy] (laughing) Hold the pole.

156
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,280
- Okay.

157
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,250
- [Missy] (laughing)
Yay, this is how we fish.

158
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,510
- This is how we fish with Ollie.

159
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:34,758
- [Missy] What'd you catch, Ollie?

160
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:36,340
- I caught this.

161
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,350
I got Finley J.

162
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,600
- [Missy] You got a Finn.

163
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,170
Ollie, do you think
we're gonna catch a fish?

164
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,835
- Yeah, and I'm gonna put it

165
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:47,350
in this net.

166
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,183
- [Missy] Okay.

167
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:49,781
What are you guys doin'?

168
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:52,260
- We're picking some worms

169
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,500
that I like.

170
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,808
- [Missy] You like these worms?

171
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:55,641
- [Oliver] Here.

172
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,070
- [Missy] They are so cute.

173
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,228
Do you like 'em?

174
00:05:58,228 --> 00:05:59,061
- Yeah.

175
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,790
- [Missy] He said, "This
is my very first time

176
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,340
"holding a pet worm."

177
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,200
Are you gonna keep it forever?

178
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,033
- [Oliver] Yeah.

179
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,320
- [Missy] Did you know
that we're feeding them

180
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,410
to the fish?

181
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,333
- Yeah.

182
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,166
Oh.

183
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,910
- [Missy] Oh no.

184
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,339
Don't go down there.

185
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,707
Look at that one.

186
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,240
- [Oliver] That one can climb on.

187
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,870
- [Missy] Oh my goodness,
he's crawling up your shirt.

188
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,870
- [Oliver] Oh no.

189
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,093
Cool.

190
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:28,343
- [Missy] Cool.

191
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,010
Oh, did he get away?

192
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,450
Oh, he finally got a bite

193
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,053
and he took your worm, even.

194
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,070
You were so close, Dad.

195
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,842
This is what it's like
when you go fishing.

196
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:44,020
You just sit here, sit here, sit here,

197
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,990
and maybe you'll get a bite

198
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,134
and then it goes away.

199
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:48,693
So we have been out
here for quite a while.

200
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:52,510
Finn is actually napping on my back.

201
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,910
He's getting a really good nap.

202
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,060
And we still haven't caught anything.

203
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,510
My camera's gonna die.

204
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,762
Huh?

205
00:06:58,762 --> 00:07:01,230
Oh yeah, we get tons of little nibbles

206
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,040
and bites, but no fish, huh, Ollie?

207
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,081
- No.

208
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:07,410
- [Missy] Aww, what a bummer.

209
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,060
Oh my god, oh my god, I think Dad got one.

210
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,831
Oh my gosh, this is crazy.

211
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,940
Mom, you said it's time to go.

212
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,960
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,
it's huge, it's huge.

213
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:21,900
Oh my gosh.

214
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,517
Oh my gosh, Mom, you better not.

215
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:26,392
Oh my gosh, this is crazy.

216
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:28,800
Oh my gosh.

217
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,803
What?

218
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:33,766
Oh my gosh!

219
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,049
(laughing)

220
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,840
We have been here three hours

221
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,454
and my mom says, "It's
time to go, let's go."

222
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,694
And that second --

223
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:45,736
Finn, did you see that?

224
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:46,752
- Yeah.

225
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:48,369
- Did you see that huge fish?

226
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:49,580
- Yeah.

227
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,630
- I had to pull out my phone

228
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,920
because my camera just died. (laughs)

229
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,753
Oh my gosh.

230
00:07:54,753 --> 00:07:56,300
This is crazy.

231
00:07:57,154 --> 00:07:57,987
- You wanna hold him?

232
00:07:57,987 --> 00:07:59,267
- [Oliver] No.

233
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,920
- [Missy] That thing is huge, Dad.

234
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,360
- Here.

235
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,450
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

236
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,977
Ollie, you don't wanna hold the fish?

237
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:06,810
- No.

238
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,940
- [Missy] I can, I mean,
we waited a long time

239
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,773
for that.

240
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:11,606
- Yeah, I didn't think
it was gonna happen.

241
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,270
- [Missy] That is huge.

242
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,435
Did you catch one that big
when you came with Ollie?

243
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,324
- No, it was not that big, it was probably

244
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:17,483
half that size.

245
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,443
I wonder what that one's gonna weigh.

246
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:20,700
- [Missy] That is crazy.

247
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,940
I need to take some
pictures of you, Ollie,

248
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,900
with your fish.

249
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,760
Okay, hold it up.

250
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,740
There you go.

251
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,090
Pick him up higher, higher.

252
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:29,650
That thing's too heavy, huh?

253
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,757
There you go.

254
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:35,720
Wow, good job.

255
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,280
All right, we are finally back home.

256
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,299
I was able to change the battery

257
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,969
on the camera, and that was so funny

258
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,890
that my phone died as
soon as we caught a fish

259
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,320
and my camera died as
soon as we caught a fish.

260
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,310
So basically, she, the biggest fish

261
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,210
she's ever sold was six pounds.

262
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,957
This one was nine pounds.

263
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:52,550
It was huge.

264
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,383
You shoulda heard her.

265
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:56,290
She was like, "Oh lord, that is huge!"

266
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,508
She was freakin' out, it was so cute.

267
00:08:57,508 --> 00:09:01,030
Yeah, and actually, it's not
a catch and release place.

268
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,728
She wants, she, like, makes you pay for it

269
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,500
and then she makes you take it home.

270
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,300
We ended up taking it
home and we are measuring

271
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,750
right now and check this out.

272
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,091
It is 25 inches.

273
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:12,924
(laughs)

274
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:14,717
Oh my gosh, that is insane.

275
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:16,311
Biggest fish she's ever sold,

276
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,157
and actually the biggest fish I've ever --

277
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,310
- This is the biggest
fish I've ever caught.

278
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,764
- [Missy] Caught period?

279
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:21,740
- Pulled in, yeah.

280
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,602
- [Missy] Out of a pond?

281
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:23,840
- On a pond, definitely.

282
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,730
Mom got a --

283
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,930
- [Missy] Swordfish?

284
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,763
- Yellowtail.

285
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,290
- [Missy] Oh, yellowtail?

286
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,878
- It was pretty big.

287
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:30,922
- [Missy] That thing is huge.

288
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:33,034
And we are definitely
eating it for dinner.

289
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:35,050
(laughs)

290
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,420
Not sure how much Ollie
will understand that, but --

291
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,963
Yep, that is pretty neat, huh?

292
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:40,980
Were you pretty excited about that?

293
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,813
- Yucky.

294
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:45,970
- [Missy] All right,
boys, you are all clean

295
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,197
and they smell good again.

296
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:49,870
They were smellin' like
fishes for a while, huh?

297
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,270
- Yeah, 'cause fish bait, if

298
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:56,454
you get it all over
yourself, you'll get dirty.

299
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:57,466
- Yeah, fish bait is gross

300
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,190
and fishes are gross.

301
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,260
So we are gonna make a little hot cocoa

302
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,463
because we were so cold today, huh?

303
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:05,530
- Yeah.

304
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,160
- [Missy] We just want a
little somethin' to sip on.

305
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,000
We were going to take this all up

306
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,162
to Nacho and have some
hot chocolate with him,

307
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:12,739
but it just got a little too late

308
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:16,073
and these boys got a
little too crazy, right?

309
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:16,906
- Yeah.

310
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:18,291
- So we're gonna have a little hot cocoa

311
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,678
before our dinner, okay?

312
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:21,511
- Yeah.

313
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,133
- [Missy] Let's make some hot cocoa.

314
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,883
(relaxing music)

315
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,110
All right, we had to improvise.

316
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,230
We had no mini marshmallows,

317
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,151
so the boys tore up big marshmallows

318
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,830
and put them right into
their hot chocolate

319
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,850
and I went ahead and
skipped on the marshmallows,

320
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,770
but I think that we are just about ready

321
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,603
to drink some.

322
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:21,528
Does that sound good?

323
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:22,361
- Yeah.

324
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:23,194
- [Missy] All right.

325
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:24,921
And of course, Mama got teacup.

326
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:27,431
What did you get, Finn?

327
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,885
Is that Santa?

328
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:29,832
- Yeah.

329
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:30,712
- [Oliver] Papa!

330
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:31,820
- [Finley] Papa.

331
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,286
- [Missy] He usually calls that Papa.

332
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:35,600
And you got yourself.

333
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,158
That says Ollie on it, huh?

334
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:38,030
- [Oliver] Yeah.

335
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,306
- [Missy] Be careful, be careful!

336
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,200
(laughs)

337
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,972
Check to see it's not too hot, 'kay?

338
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:44,620
How does it feel?

339
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:46,900
- Hot.

340
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,807
- [Missy] Hot?

341
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,640
(laughs)

342
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,473
- [Ollie] Yeah, hot.

343
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:50,306
- Okay.

344
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:51,139
All right, boys got a little crazy

345
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:52,250
and I went ahead and put them to bed,

346
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,923
but they had a super fun day

347
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,894
and they had their dinner

348
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:59,120
and they were just super overtired.

349
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,144
But my parents are over again tonight

350
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:04,420
and they're cookin' up some trout.

351
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,810
Hopefully none of you are too squeamish,

352
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,037
but yes, we are not letting that fish

353
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,780
go to waste.

354
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,995
We are gonna have that for dinner tonight.

355
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,744
I know that might seem a little weird

356
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:17,026
for some of you, but we aren't vegetarians

357
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,771
and most of the food we eat was alive

358
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,260
at some point. (laughs)

359
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,346
It is really weird to see it alive

360
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,760
and then eat it, but --

361
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,268
- And actually, the place that we went to

362
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:28,470
is not a catch and release.

363
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,921
You're not allowed to catch a fish

364
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,240
and put it back.

365
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
You have to take it out.

366
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,100
That's just the way it is.

367
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,800
- Yeah, but anyways
I'm just gonna go ahead

368
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,870
and end the video so
you guys don't have to

369
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,703
see me eat it, you know?

370
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:38,868
(laughs)

371
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:42,150
Anyways, I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.

372
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,540
Make sure you give it a big thumbs-up.

373
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,606
How awesome was that that we were able

374
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,126
to catch such a huge fish?

375
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:47,172
We had such a fun day

376
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:48,900
and we will see you guys tomorrow

377
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,790
and Bryan will be back.

378
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,922
He gets home really, really late tonight.

379
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:52,205
I'm so excited to see him.

380
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,182
So we'll see you tomorrow, bye!

381
00:12:55,182 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
