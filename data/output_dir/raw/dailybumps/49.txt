1
00:00:00,971 --> 00:00:02,078
- Not the best way to start the new year,

2
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:05,713
you guys, with a fire in your backyard.

3
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:08,631
(sighs) Happy new year.

12
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:30,136
- [All] Good morning.

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,697
- Finn was on the other side of the table

14
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:33,818
and he was like, Mom, wait.

15
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:35,955
He wanted to come over here and say

16
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:37,351
good morning, huh?

17
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,184
- Yeah.

18
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:41,934
- The boys today saw
our leftover gingerbread

19
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:45,260
house kits and all the
stuff that we had for it

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,857
and they just wanted to
make gingerbread houses

21
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:49,934
so badly that I went
ahead and broke it out.

22
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:51,017
And I was actually kind of excited

23
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,184
because I didn't really get to participate

24
00:00:53,184 --> 00:00:54,873
in the gingerbread
house contest this year.

25
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:56,071
There was just a lot going on.

26
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,214
Oh no, mine's falling apart!

27
00:00:57,214 --> 00:01:00,095
And I just could not get mine standing,

28
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:01,133
and I'm like determined

29
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,959
that I will get it standing this time.

30
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:03,792
Hang on.

31
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,343
All right, so Ollie has been working

32
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:06,176
on his house.

33
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:08,106
Tell me everything about your house.

34
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:11,491
- So this is Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus.

35
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,406
- [Missy] Okay.

36
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,873
- And all of

37
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,430
these are the elves

38
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,429
and these are the tree thingies.

39
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:19,262
- [Missy] Okay.

40
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:21,055
- And then the star.

41
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:21,888
- [Missy] Okay.

42
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:25,179
- And a puppy dog that got lost.

43
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:27,901
- [Missy] Oh my goodness, puppy dog.

44
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:31,640
- And then these are all the balls.

45
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,473
- [Missy] Oh, okay, wow.

46
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:33,934
(screams)

47
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:35,417
Ah, he's falling over!

48
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,636
(Missy laughs)

49
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:38,860
And I have to show you Finn's masterpiece.

50
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,812
He's really proud of it.

51
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:40,905
Oh no, his little house is falling off.

52
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:43,729
You know, he just has big
blobs of icing, right?

53
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,562
- Yeah.

54
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,765
- [Missy] And he's fish and a couple

55
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:49,629
little gummy worms and
it looks super cute.

56
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,284
I love these 'cause they're just so tiny.

57
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,231
They're perfect for the kids to decorate,

58
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,237
not too overwhelming,

59
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,558
and mainly all I was doing was trying

60
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:59,601
to tell Finn not to eat the candy

61
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,265
and to use it decorate. (laughs)

62
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,907
But mine's actually holding up, yay!

63
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,020
I can't wait to see it all done.

64
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,080
- Good morning, you guys.

65
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,582
So Mimi and Papa just drove up the house

66
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:09,936
and they told us to come outside

67
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:11,544
and look.

68
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,145
It's kind of a little scary.

69
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:14,481
I don't know if you guys can see,

70
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,405
but basically that lot of land

71
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,981
just across the street from us in on fire,

72
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,908
and it was right next to the road, right?

73
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:21,742
- Oh yeah, all next to the road.

74
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,966
We literally, my window was hot

75
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:25,821
just trying to drive past it.

76
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,108
- [Bryan] Driving up here.

77
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,823
- I could have reached out
and touched the flames,

78
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:30,586
that's how close it was to the road.

79
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:33,780
- And there's not very
many road up to the house,

80
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,425
so we're really kind of --

81
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:36,258
- [Bryan] That's our main road.

82
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:37,091
- That's our main road.

83
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:38,197
- I don't think you're gonna be able

84
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:40,107
to go that way as of right now.

85
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,016
- [Missy] Yeah.

86
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,462
- [Mimi] I'm surprised we even got here.

87
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,076
- [Missy] Yeah, I mean, this
fire truck's just got there.

88
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:47,928
- [Papa] There was one
truck when we pulled up.

89
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,257
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, look, you can see

90
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:50,274
the fire trucks from here.

91
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:51,555
- [Mimi] That house right there,

92
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,272
they have fire on their land.

93
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,762
- [Missy] I'm texting her right now.

94
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:57,595
- [Bryan] Here comes a helicopter.

95
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,617
- [Finley] Hey, hey, hey!

96
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:06,992
- [Bryan] We've never had
a helicopter that close

97
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:07,825
to us. have we, Ollie?

98
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:08,658
- Yeah.

99
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:11,205
Wish I could get in that.

100
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:12,769
- [Bryan] Missy, do you think
we're gonna get evacuated?

101
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,654
- Um, we could get evacuated.

102
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,049
I don't think it's gonna get on our --

103
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,440
I don't think our house
is gonna burn down.

104
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,273
- [Mimi] There's very little wind.

105
00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:22,106
- [Bryan] Yeah.

106
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:23,494
- [Mimi] But I think --

107
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,810
- [Bryan] White smoke is good, right?

108
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,675
- [Mimi] Yeah, white smoke is good.

109
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:27,857
- [Bryan] They're putting it out?

110
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,815
- [Missy] I see the black up there.

111
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:33,565
(dramatic music)

112
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,645
(neighbors all talking indistinctly)

113
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,114
- Okay, that helicopter
literally just landed

114
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:11,284
in our neighbor's property.

115
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,579
Do you think that was Life Flight?

116
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:13,508
- That looked like Life Flight.

117
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,747
Like maybe there's an injury.

118
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,497
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh.

119
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:22,366
This is really, really
close to us, you guys.

120
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,499
This is probably one of the closest fires

121
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:25,401
we've had to us all year, and of course

122
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,924
it had to happen on the
last day of the year.

123
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:28,035
So we're gonna see if we can try

124
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,457
to get an update and
see what we have to do.

125
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:31,290
What, Finn?

126
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,207
- Our snow's still here.

127
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,492
- [Bryan] Oh, our snow's still here?

128
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:35,618
- Yeah.

129
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,129
- [Bryan] We do have some snow left, huh?

130
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:37,983
- Yeah.

131
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:40,032
- He filled up with the
pool, he's got a hose

132
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,327
sticking out, he's filled up and he's --

133
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:42,829
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh.

134
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:44,135
- Are you guys ready to give up some water

135
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:44,968
out of your pool?

136
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,513
- Yes, heck yes. (laughs)

137
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:49,771
I think as long as the wind's died down,

138
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:51,489
we're probably okay, right?

139
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:52,871
- [Missy] Yeah, I think.

140
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,178
- It seems to be going that way.

141
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:56,384
It's really close to us, though.

142
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:59,340
- It's in a neighborhood,
there's houses here.

143
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,047
- [Bryan] Well, do you
think they'll only evacuate

144
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:01,880
us if it gets out of hand?

145
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,713
- Yeah.

146
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:03,756
- [Bryan] So if they can take care of it,

147
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:04,589
we'll be good, but --

148
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:07,391
- I don't know what the rules are

149
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,150
for an evacuation; it could be just that

150
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,537
it's better to leave now because you won't

151
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:12,510
be able to leave.

152
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,343
- [Bryan] Yeah.

153
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,947
(sighs deeply)

154
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,030
(jet engine roaring)

155
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:21,406
There is a huge plane

156
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:25,207
about to fly over this fire.

157
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:26,860
I can't believe this is happening

158
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,003
right in front of us, Missy.

159
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:30,086
- I know, this is like --

160
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:34,788
- [Bryan] See that plane up there, Ollie?

161
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:36,268
That's circling around?

162
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,370
It's coming lower because it's gonna

163
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,295
fly over the fire and it's gonna drop

164
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,566
water all over it.

165
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:41,399
- Really?

166
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,488
- [Bryan] Should we have Marshall help?

167
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:45,258
Maybe we should let Marshall loose.

168
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:47,548
Maybe Marshall could help.

169
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,706
Look how low this plane is right now.

170
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:50,539
- [Missy] Yeah.

171
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,897
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh,
it's seriously flying

172
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:56,064
right over us, oh my gosh.

173
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,758
- [Missy] There we go, there we go.

174
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,675
Oh my gosh.

175
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,940
- [Bryan] Wow.

176
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,690
- [Papa] Right on the road there.

177
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:08,277
- This is really intense.

178
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,640
- Yeah, this fire is just

179
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,279
a little too close to home for us,

180
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,468
so it's kind of

181
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:13,985
trying to stay positive

182
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:15,914
and I honestly think we're fine

183
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:16,747
'cause of the winds.

184
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,750
It's just crazy that this is happening

185
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,844
in California right now everywhere.

186
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:22,249
There's like three little fires

187
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,371
if I look across the street.

188
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,098
There's like three little
fires, separate areas.

189
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:25,931
- Hi.

190
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:26,989
- Hi, Finn, how are you, buddy?

191
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:28,381
You okay?

192
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,395
- Baby.

193
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,004
- [Bryan] Look at this plane, you guys.

194
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:33,034
This is a commercial plane right now.

195
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,617
Literally right over our house.

196
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,253
Wow.

197
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:45,965
No big deal, just a commercial airplane

198
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,882
flying over our property to drop --

199
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,862
oh my gosh, is this real?

200
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:55,862
(gasps) Oh my gosh.

201
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,725
Oh yeah, it just dropped it right there.

202
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:02,971
Oh my gosh, Jim, have you ever seen

203
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:03,804
that before in your life?

204
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:06,448
- Not at this distance, I mean, wow.

205
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,294
That was a full-size airplane.

206
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,673
- That was like a plane
that, like, people were in.

207
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:12,784
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's
a commercial airliner.

208
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:15,867
(gentle piano music)

209
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,455
(jet engine roaring)

210
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:35,046
Look dude, look at that plane!

211
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:38,517
Do you see it?

212
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:39,350
- I don't see it.

213
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,183
Whoa!

214
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:42,232
- [Bryan] It's like right there. (laughs)

215
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:45,315
(jet engine roaring)

216
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:50,016
See this huge plane over here, Ollie?

217
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:50,849
- Yeah.

218
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:51,682
- It's going to fly right in front of us.

219
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:52,515
You ready?

220
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,348
- Yeah.

221
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,181
- Okay.

222
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:01,582
Is that crazy, Finn?

223
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,415
- Yeah.

224
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,863
- Not the best way to start
the new year, you guys.

225
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:11,410
With a fire in your backyard. (sighs)

226
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,085
Happy new year.

227
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,865
- All right, it looks like the fire

228
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,483
is pretty much out.

229
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,095
I think I read that I think they have it

230
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:20,187
pretty much contained
at seven or eight acres,

231
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:21,994
so that's nice to know.

232
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:24,476
My parents are actually headed up so that

233
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:25,395
we could all go swimming,
and on the way up,

234
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:26,679
that's what happened, so

235
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,986
we had to put a little
pause on the swimming,

236
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:29,985
but now we're headed out.

237
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,341
We're gonna get some pool time in,

238
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:32,823
'cause it's a nice day and we've got

239
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:33,809
a Jacuzzi, so let's get in.

240
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,434
Are you guys goin' swimming too?

241
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:37,532
We just got you groomed

242
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,191
and now you just jumped right in, huh?

243
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,712
All right, Papa is headed
into the freezing-cold pool.

244
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:44,712
- Here, here.

245
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:46,203
- [Missy] Save my sword.

246
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:47,271
- Get your sword.

247
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:48,839
Get the sword.

248
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,922
- [Missy] He's splashing.

249
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:54,308
How cold is it, Dad?

250
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:55,172
- It's cold!

251
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:56,589
It's beyond cold.

252
00:08:57,844 --> 00:08:59,902
- [Missy] Oh my god!

253
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:00,735
Oh my god.

254
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,010
Why are you doing that?

255
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,100
No, Finn!

256
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,488
All right, hopefully you can still hear me

257
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,988
'cause Finn just jumped in

258
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,479
and almost broke the camera.

259
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,955
How cold do you think that is, Dad?

260
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:23,274
Ollie, don't go in
there, it's too cold now.

261
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:24,107
- I did.

262
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:25,143
- [Missy] Don't go in there.

263
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:29,269
- That jump was really (mumbles).

264
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,102
No!

265
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,123
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

266
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:34,290
Finn, do not get in there.

267
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:36,178
No no no no.

268
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:38,720
Oh my goodness.

269
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,624
All right, how was your swim?

270
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:41,457
- Good.

271
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,290
- Good.

272
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,352
That was a really nice swim.

273
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:44,501
The water felt nice.

274
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,203
It's not like freezing
as you're getting out.

275
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:47,946
Sometimes when you go
it's not fun sometimes

276
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:50,364
to go in the hot tub when it's winter

277
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:52,706
because you're getting
out into freezing-cold

278
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:54,463
weather, but it's pretty nice.

279
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,436
- It's not windy, which is pretty good

280
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:56,269
for the fire.

281
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:59,558
- It worked in our advantage twice today,

282
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,391
so that's good.

283
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,693
What is the temperature, like 70?

284
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,289
- It's like 70, I think 70.

285
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:05,930
- It's pretty nice.

286
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,763
Oh wait, come here, I want --

287
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:08,561
I don't want you guys to get wet.

288
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,202
Or get dirty, stay down.

289
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,035
- [Mimi] Come here, guys. (whistles)

290
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:11,868
- [Missy] Come on.

291
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:13,335
Go dry off. (laughs)

292
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:14,446
You guys stay here until you're all dry

293
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,052
and then you can come in, 'kay?

294
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:17,772
- [Bryan] It looks like all the threat

295
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:20,939
of the fire is gone and I am just like

296
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:24,423
looking at this scene
outside my house now,

297
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,923
this is beautiful.

298
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,238
That's the moon, you guys.

299
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:30,300
It's like, oh, hey, did you guys

300
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,133
have a fire down there?

301
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,883
(cheerful music)

302
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,494
Did you boys have a fun time swimming?

303
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:39,327
- Yeah.

304
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:42,542
- So it looks like the
threat of the wildfire

305
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,197
has disappeared, so we don't gotta worry

306
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:46,116
about the fire, okay?

307
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:47,010
- Okay.

308
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,010
- But it has left this amazing scene

309
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,140
in our courtyard.

310
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,222
Look at this.

311
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:54,496
- [Oliver] Whoa.

312
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,039
- [Bryan] Look at this sky.

313
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,861
And that is the moon, huge and bright.

314
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:00,694
Crazy.

315
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,888
What do you think of that, Finn?

316
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:06,794
- [Oliver] Hey guys.

317
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,198
- [Bryan] See that sky?

318
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:10,014
- Hey guys, I think when it's out,

319
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:12,264
maybe it just takes a piece

320
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,662
and maybe it just comes back

321
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:19,995
and just see a truck and wait 'til moon.

322
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,483
- [Bryan] Oh, really?

323
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,316
- Yeah.

324
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,149
(laughs)

325
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,629
Because the moon looks
different every night, huh?

326
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:26,462
- Yeah.

327
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:41,598
- All right, guys, I am gettin' all ready

328
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:43,586
for the night and the boys just finished

329
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:48,207
their dinner, and they
ate their vitamins, huh?

330
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,103
- Yeah.

331
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:50,192
- [Missy] And guys what, guys?

332
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,025
- What?

333
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:52,605
- 2017 is almost over.

334
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:54,022
It's almost 2018.

335
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,178
In 2018, you're gonna turn five.

336
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,133
- Five?

337
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:03,583
- [Missy] In 2018 you're gonna turn three.

338
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,156
In 2018, maybe Mama is gonna get pregnant?

339
00:12:07,156 --> 00:12:08,780
(laughs) Not have a baby.

340
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,001
But maybe I'll get pregnant, I don't know.

341
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:13,216
So many possibilities in 2018.

342
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,807
We actually were just
watching the last vlog

343
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,688
of 2013, the year Ollie was born

344
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:21,185
and it was so cute, I just love watching

345
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:24,843
back and seeing our last
moments of that year,

346
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,123
and it was just, it was
really fun to kinda watch.

347
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:29,044
I did wanna give a really quick update

348
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:29,877
on the fire.

349
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:33,377
It is out, no structures, no one was hurt,

350
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:37,276
nothing was hurt at all.

351
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:39,605
It was obviously a fire, which is scary

352
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:42,016
and does do damage to the --

353
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:44,484
it did damage to certain property

354
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:45,867
and to trees and bushes
and things like that.

355
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,867
But all in all, pretty low-key fire.

356
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:50,562
Thank God.

357
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:53,804
And we just have, honestly,
the best firefighters

358
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:54,886
here in California.

359
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,297
They were on it (snaps fingers) like that.

360
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,976
Dropping the retardant and water on it,

361
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,477
and it was just really awesome to see

362
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:02,930
right from our yard how hard-working

363
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,870
our firefighters are, so thank you

364
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,192
to our California
firefighters for just saving

365
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:10,456
the day, but actually
the road is still closed

366
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:15,430
coming to my house, so we
have some fun plans tonight.

367
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,201
We're hoping to go out, but if my parents

368
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:19,591
can't come up here to watch the kids,

369
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,242
then we'll just be staying in tonight.

370
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:22,751
I guess we'll have to see how that goes.

371
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,955
All right, I'm getting
my last-minute hangouts

372
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:27,815
in to 2017 with my little boys.

373
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:30,203
Finn, did you know that
you're two years old,

374
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:32,341
and you're the cutest little two-year-old

375
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:33,516
I ever did see?

376
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:37,633
And you are four and you're
the cutest thing ever.

377
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,466
- Yeah.

378
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:39,317
(Missy laughs)

379
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,210
- I just love these boys.

380
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,445
I'm just gettin' some last-minute cuddles

381
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:44,992
before it's bedtime.

382
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,137
Almost bedtime, huh?

383
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:47,970
- Yeah.

384
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,597
- He actually did not
sleep well last night,

385
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,772
so hopefully tonight is better, okay?

386
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:52,605
- Okay.

387
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:53,457
- Okay.

388
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,579
Anyways, I think we're
gonna go ahead and end

389
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:56,688

399
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,970

400
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,510
and we'll see you guys next year.

401
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,238
Ollie, can you say bye?

402
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,238
- Bye, poop!

403
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:24,671
