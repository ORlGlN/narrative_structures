1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,317
- This just proves that
this car is ridiculous.

2
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:05,400
It says it's 129 degrees.

3
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:08,004
There's no way.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,544
We made the attempt outside
and I take back everything

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,314
I just said, it's definitely
129 degrees out here.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,033
Don't you think?

7
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,529
It's hot, hot, hot, huh?

8
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:18,372
- Yeah.

9
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:21,011
- A hundred and twenty-nine
degrees sounds about right.

10
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:25,178
("This is Home" by Bryan Lanning)

11
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:00,410
- Good morning, guys.

12
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,291
It is a beautiful day here

13
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,191
in sunny southern California today.

14
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,274
Look at this.

15
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:09,650
Oh, I love all our new pictures
that we hung yesterday.

16
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,143
And today, I've been working
on hanging some stuff

17
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:15,391
on this wall while I
let Missy get some rest.

18
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,433
Missy has not been feeling good.

19
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:20,403
She got a little, I think
like a sinus infection.

20
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,686
So I'm letting her just
relax and lay down in bed

21
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,344
and get better.

22
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:26,216
So the boys are totally
preoccupying themselves.

23
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:28,109
And I've been working
on this hallways trying

24
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:29,515
to get some stuff hung.

25
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:32,090
So we got this big old piece of teak wood.

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,588
We got this at World Market.

27
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:36,439
And every single one of them were unique,

28
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,272
which is what I liked.

29
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:39,161
So I picked this one out,
got it up on the wall.

30
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,145
It looks good there.

31
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:43,343
And then over here, I was
working on a little gallery.

32
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:46,116
We have Ollie's portrait from Disneyland,

33
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:47,394
which we have to get one for Fin too.

34
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:49,411
But then we have some little planters,

35
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,481
which I'm gonna put real air plants in.

36
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,873
And then we have our square photos.

37
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:54,820
I did already break one of the planters.

38
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,243
It was supposed to go there.

39
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:57,785
So if you're wondering why the
gallery looks a little off,

40
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,851
it's because I broke that.

41
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:00,684
(laughs)

42
00:02:00,684 --> 00:02:02,246
Let's go see what the
kids are up to though.

43
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:03,330
- Happy Friday!

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,103
(Fin shouting)

45
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:07,969
- [Bryan] Happy Friday, boys!

46
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,169
(blows trumpet)

47
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,090
(Bryan laughs)

48
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,163
Is that the Friday bugle?

49
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,014
- Yup.

50
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:12,847
- [Bryan] Yup.

51
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:13,680
- Good morning!

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,749
- Good morning, buddy!

53
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:15,853
How you doing today?

54
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:16,768
- Good!

55
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:17,831
- [Bryan] You're just
playing with your brother?

56
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:18,664
- Yeah.

57
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:19,497
- [Bryan] No school today?

58
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:20,330
- No.

59
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,943
- You got lucky, no school!

60
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:24,026
(laughs)

61
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,752
All right, so I also hung this up here,

62
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,303
which I've been wanting to put
something here for a while.

63
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:30,620
It's just a little octagon shelf

64
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,938
with a bunch of little knickknacks.

65
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:33,771
(bell ringing)

66
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,524
Got a bell, got a globe.

67
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:38,438
And this is kind of cool
too, to like have a timer.

68
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:39,271
I wonder how long it is.

69
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:40,995
It's probably about 60 seconds.

70
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,693
There's that too.

71
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:47,172
And then on this wall I
hung some little frames,

72
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:48,142
which kind of look good there.

73
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:49,774
We just need to fill
them up with pictures.

74
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:51,929
I feel like getting our
big pictures in finally

75
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:54,693
and hanging them up in the
hallway kind of encouraged us

76
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,057
to start decorating more. (laughs)

77
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:58,059
We still have a couple places in the house

78
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,457
that need to be decorated.

79
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:00,547
So that's what we've been working on.

80
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,157
And holy cow, I just put these
flowers in here. (inhales)

81
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:06,143
And they smell so good, you guys.

82
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,016
Wanna smell them?

83
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,277
Here, smell them, guys.

84
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:09,125
Smell them, ready?

85
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,482
(inhales) Everyone together now.

86
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,913
(inhales and exhales)

87
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:16,839
Now doesn't that smell nice?

88
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,422
(upbeat music)

89
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,048
- Good morning, guys.

90
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:30,744
I have made it to the couch this morning

91
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,327
and I feel so sick!

92
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,668
I'm so bummed.

93
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:36,368
(Fin shouting)

94
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:38,241
Yeah, I am not feeling good today.

95
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:40,831
I woke up with the worst migraine.

96
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:43,643
I had like a really bad headache
and it felt like a migraine

97
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,137
but I've never had a migraine before.

98
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,652
It was just really, really, really bad.

99
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,665
Yeah, and I am just
all stuffed up in here.

100
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,030
My whole body aches, which
of course could just be

101
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,201
from working out, totally,

102
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,541
but I'm pretty sure that
some of it is more of a ...

103
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,257
It's like deeper down, like
an achiness of being sick.

104
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:02,558
So I'm like, I just don't
want the kids to get it.

105
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,990
I've been kind of trying to
just keep up on medication

106
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,696
so that I can actually be like alive

107
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,755
and play with the kids.

108
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:12,255
So I've made it to the couch which is good

109
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:14,223
because I spent most
of the morning in bed.

110
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:15,839
And now the kids are playing

111
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,337
and they really wanna
show you guys something,

112
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:18,813
so I'm gonna let them show you.

113
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,956
All right, Ollie, what
did you want to show them?

114
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,511
- Okay.

115
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:26,502
- [Missy] Whoa, he can do
these awesome summersaults.

116
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:29,641
Whoa, that was awesome, Ollie.

117
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:31,972
Oh, and Fin can do it too.

118
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,097
(laughs)

119
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:37,514
- [Missy] Hi-hah, wow, those are so good.

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,514
You guys are almost ready
for gymnastics, huh?

121
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,347
- No.

122
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:44,180
- [Missy] No?

123
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,128
- I'm the crazy one and
Fin's the silly one.

124
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:47,671
- [Missy] Oh, you're crazy and he's silly.

125
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,950
Hey Ollie, guess what?

126
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,163
We might have some friends
coming over in a few hours.

127
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,627
Who do you think it is?

128
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:56,877
- I don't know.

129
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,681
- [Missy] You don't know?

130
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,184
Okay, well I guess it's
gonna be a surprise, huh?

131
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:04,085
(Fin shouting)

132
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,944
Okay Fin, you have a snotty nose.

133
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:07,371
You need to go get a tissue.

134
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:09,362
Go get a tissue right now, Finley J.

135
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,656
- No!

136
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:13,988
- Look at us, we made it
out of the house, huh?

137
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:18,082
Fin just woke up from
a nap and I went ahead,

138
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:19,327
I was like, you know what?

139
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:23,083
I'm just gonna take some DayQuil
and rest for a little bit

140
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,410
and then just slap some makeup
on and get out of the house

141
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,149
because I feel like that's
usually how I get better

142
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:29,581
is just like go.

143
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:30,605
Which I know sounds
like the opposite thing

144
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:31,510
that you're supposed to do.

145
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,658
But anyways, Fin just took
a nap and I've just been

146
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:35,912
sitting in the car relaxing
while he was sleeping.

147
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:40,473
Bryan ran into the Home
Depot to grab some plants

148
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,214
and some things that we
needed for around the house.

149
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:43,607
But I did want to show you guys,

150
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:47,663
this just proves that this car
is ridiculous and it's lying.

151
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,726
Because it often says that
the temperature outside

152
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:53,893
is like 114 and I'm like,
it's hot, it is really hot,

153
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:56,446
but it's not that hot.

154
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,212
And look what it says right now.

155
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:00,295
It says it's 129 degrees.

156
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,784
There's no way.

157
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:07,464
So obviously the car is
reading at a much hotter rate,

158
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:09,317
especially because it's a black car.

159
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:11,951
So I'm guessing it absorbs more heat

160
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:14,335
because there's no way
it's actually that hot.

161
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:16,387
Let's see how hot it actually is out.

162
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,224
I mean, it does say it's 104 out there,

163
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:20,010
which is very, very hot.

164
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,620
So Fin is now up and I'm
trying to decide if we should

165
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,996
go walk around the garden with
daddy and pick some plants.

166
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,104
Do you wanna go walk around?

167
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:28,271
- Yeah.

168
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,354
- Yeah? Okay.

169
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:32,341
I know he's got a little cold too.

170
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:34,325
It's not as bad as me I don't think,

171
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:37,904
but he's definitely got
that runny nose going on.

172
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:40,404
Yeah, is that a Minion tissue?

173
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,672
We made the attempt outside
and I take back everything

174
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:47,379
I just said, it's definitely
129 degrees out here,

175
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,527
don't you think?

176
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,230
It is hot, hot, hot, huh?

177
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,505
- Yeah.

178
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,572
- A hundred and twenty-nine
degrees sounds about right.

179
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:55,430
- We are now at Hobby Lobby.

180
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,741
As I told you this morning,
I broke one of those planters

181
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,400
in the hallway, so I came to Hobby Lobby

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,517
thinking this is where
we got them but it's not.

183
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:03,549
We got them at Target.

184
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,029
But I found these ones
which look cool too.

185
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,110
Missy actually found them.

186
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,249
- I like those ones a lot.

187
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:09,105
- [Bryan] You like these ones better?

188
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,386
- Yeah, I actually do.

189
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,209
- [Bryan] Okay, we got these then.

190
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:14,077
What did you find?

191
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,424
(Fin shouting)

192
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:16,601
Oh, it's a fan?

193
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,518
Make it go.

194
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:20,553
Whoa!

195
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,615
Come here, come here,
come here, come here!

196
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,955
(grunts) You wanna tell
them who's coming over?

197
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:25,788
Who's coming over?

198
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:27,485
- Carl and Jinger are coming over!

199
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:30,180
- Carl and Jinger, that's right!

200
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,154
Ollie has been begging to
hang out with the boys,

201
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:35,879
so they are driving down
to come hang out with us

202
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,174
for the weekend, does that sound cool?

203
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:38,007
- Yeah, and play!

204
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:41,468
- Yeah, we're gonna play, we're
gonna film some cool videos.

205
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,383
- I guess we can go swimming today.

206
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:44,955
- We can go swimming too, huh?

207
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:45,788
- Yup.

208
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:46,621
- Yes.

209
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:47,454
You know what you should do, Ollie?

210
00:07:47,454 --> 00:07:48,287
- What?

211
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:50,570
- You should show them your collection.

212
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,040
- Collection?

213
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,238
- Should we?

214
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:54,071
- Yeah.

215
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,790
(everyone shouting)

216
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,290
- Look who's here!

217
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:00,925
Carl and Jinger!

218
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,321
The whole family is in the hiz-ouse.

219
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,201
- Ready to party.

220
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,700
- Click that icon to
check out their channel.

221
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,835
They're gonna come hang out
with us for the weekend.

222
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:08,668
Why not?

223
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:09,501
- It's gonna be amazing, right?

224
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,334
We're gonna do crazy stuff.

225
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:11,167
- Why not?

226
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,513
- We're gonna do some crazy stuff?

227
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:15,346
- Let's start with making lasagna.

228
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:19,748
Because when Carl and Jinger come,

229
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:22,831
that means three boys accompany them.

230
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,372
I used to be a boy, I was a young ...

231
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,934
- Me too!

232
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:28,767
You too?

233
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:32,326
- I was a young man once, I
know how much young boys eat

234
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,765
so we're making lasagna.

235
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,765
- Pet mouse.

236
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:38,632
- [Bryan] What's his name?

237
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:39,701
- John!

238
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:40,817
- [Bryan] His name is John.

239
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,383
Ollie has a pet mouse named John.

240
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:43,929
We even have a clear ball we put him in

241
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,543
and we let him run around the house.

242
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,083
(laughing)

243
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,583
- That is so cool.

244
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:52,071
- [Bryan] Whoa, you like that sword, dude?

245
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:55,269
- Wanna see my Emoji Movie collection?

246
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,410
- [Other Children] Yeah!

247
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,731
- [Bryan] Ollie's got himself a crowd.

248
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:02,532
- [Child] That is a lot, look at that.

249
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:04,715
- [Bryan] He's got them all!

250
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:05,965
- [Child] Got all the emojis!

251
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:09,572
- [Bryan] We have every single emoji.

252
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:11,489
- You have an original.

253
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:14,954
- [Bryan] Yes, even the original.

254
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,924
All right, which one do you
want to show them first?

255
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:17,779
- [Child] That's the heart-faced cat.

256
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:19,114
- [Child] That's the cat emoji.

257
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:23,388
- [Child] That one's cool, oh
yeah, I really like that one.

258
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,388
- The puppy!

259
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:30,189
- That one's an awesome one.

260
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,891
- [Bryan] Fin, you show them.

261
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:35,724
The frog, that one is really cool.

262
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:38,405
- High five!

263
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,238
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

264
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:40,862
And then this is Jailbreak.

265
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:41,916
- [Child] Awesome, yeah!

266
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,495
- [Bryan] What else you got?

267
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:48,012
- The tongue emoji,
another tongue emoji one.

268
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:51,607
- [Bryan] See, I think
this is the original one

269
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:52,794
and that's The Emoji Movie one,

270
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:53,794
so that's like the difference.

271
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,475
- [Child] That's cool, and
then there's smiley face one.

272
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,466
- [Bryan] Oh, he's got two, that's neat.

273
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,513
That's so cool, huh, Ollie?

274
00:09:58,513 --> 00:09:59,625
- We need four of them.

275
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,033
- Oh really?

276
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,883
Yes, Ollie has collected
all of The Emoji Movie

277
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:07,410
emoji plushes from McDonald's
Happy Meals, you guys.

278
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,243
Isn't that so cool?

279
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:10,339
And Ollie, tell them
which one's your favorite.

280
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:11,300
Which one's your favorite?

281
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,133
- The kitty cat.

282
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,409
- [Bryan] The kitty cat
with the heart eyes?

283
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:14,995
- [Child] My favorite
one is the puppy one.

284
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:16,319
- [Bryan] The puppy one is cool.

285
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,166
- [Child] I like the kitty cat one a lot.

286
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,368
- [Bryan] Oh, come on,
you gotta give some love

287
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,911
to the monkey! (laughs)

288
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,911
(everyone laughing and talking)

289
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:29,694
I seriously just love
when Carl and Jinger visit

290
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:33,594
because all of the kids
have so much fun together.

291
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:36,821
By the way, if you guys missed
our last emoji vlog we did

292
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:40,170
where I put on a giant
inflatable poop emoji

293
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,924
and surprised the kids, check
that out in the iCard as well.

294
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:45,916
But it's gonna be a fun weekend
of the boys just hanging out

295
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,999
and getting to let loose.

296
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,493
(upbeat music)

297
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,473
(slashing noise)

298
00:11:07,473 --> 00:11:10,082
All right, everyone is
watching Captain Underpants.

299
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:10,994
Here, you want some popcorn?

300
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:11,827
- Sure.

301
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:12,660
- [Bryan] You want popcorn?

302
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,104
There you go, dude.

303
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:17,287
Oh, and he's also got
some chocolate ice cream.

304
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:18,708
- I'm done with this.

305
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,541
- [Bryan] Oh, you are?

306
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,374
I'll take it, buddy.

307
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:21,761
- There you go.

308
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:22,923
- [Bryan] He is in heaven, you guys.

309
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:26,458
He loves hanging out with older boys

310
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,022
and he loves just
cuddling and eating snacks

311
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,341
and watching a movie.

312
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,094
They're watching Captain
Underpants, by the way.

313
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:33,071
- I've never seen it!

314
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:34,675
- [Bryan] I know, it's so funny, huh?

315
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:38,842
- (mumbling) Ah, I can't say it again!

316
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:42,241
- You can't say it?

317
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:44,041
We're saying goodbye to everyone.

318
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,973
What do you say, Ollie?

319
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:49,790
Thank you for liking,
subscribing, and commenting below.

320
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,623
- Yeah.

321
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:53,460
- Guys, I hope you enjoyed
Bryan and Missy's vlog.

322
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,958
Make sure to give this video a thumbs up

323
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,186
and I'll see you manana.

324
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,769
Say bye too, Ollie!

325
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:01,840
- Bye!

326
00:12:03,942 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
