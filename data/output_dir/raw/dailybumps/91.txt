Go, momma, go!

4
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:07,702
- [Bryan] Turn, oh my gosh.

13
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:32,918
- Good morning, guys, from
Carl and Jinger's house.

14
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:37,091
We are all drinking coffee
this morning, French press.

15
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:38,188
What do you think, babe?

16
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:40,575
- I am really impressed; I've
never liked coffee and it--

17
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,766
- What is going on with the world?

18
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,759
My wife likes coffee, what?

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,103
- It's very sweet.

20
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:48,133
It doesn't have that coffee
flavor that I'm used to.

21
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,180
- [Bryan] Yeah, you love it?

22
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,013
- It smells like it.

23
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,565
It smells like strong coffee.

24
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,515
- [Bryan] Yeah.

25
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:54,056
- But it doesn't taste like that.

26
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:56,161
- [Bryan] Good morning, Finn and Kyle!

27
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:57,572
What are we doing here, Kyle?

28
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:58,711
- Nerf Blaster!

29
00:00:58,711 --> 00:00:59,609
- [Bryan] Nerf Blaster!

30
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:00,598
Say "good morning", Ollie.

31
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:01,519
- Good morning!

32
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,500
- [Bryan] Are you so excited

33
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,141
that we are at Carl and Jinger's house?

34
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:04,974
- Yeah.

35
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:06,612
- [Bryan] Yeah, they
have Nerf guns galore.

36
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:08,278
Oh my god, ah!

37
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,033
- My favorite gun is this one.

38
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:13,490
- [Bryan] Whoa, can I see you fire it?

39
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,657
Grab a dart, there you go.

40
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:17,945
(clicking)

41
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,110
Whoa, nice, dude!

42
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,943
You can do it; that's pretty cool.

43
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:23,290
Hey, Ollie, are you having so much fun

44
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,749
playing with your friends?

45
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:25,582
- Yeah.

46
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:26,415
- [Bryan] Yeah?

47
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:27,248
How about you introduce them to everyone

48
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:28,081
who's watching, 'kay?

49
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:28,914
- Okay.

50
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:29,747
- [Bryan] Okay.

51
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:30,580
- This is Gage, this is--

52
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,712
- [Bryan] Gage.

53
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:32,545
- This is...

54
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:33,378
- Luke.

55
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:35,558
- [Bryan] Luke.

56
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:36,650
- [Finn] Kyle.

57
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,236
- [Bryan] Kyle and who's this?

58
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:39,928
- [Kids] Finn!

59
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:41,215
- 'urprise for you guys!

60
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:42,965
- We have a surprise!

61
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,976
I actually have something really cool

62
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:46,244
that I've been wanting to give the boys

63
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:47,563
because I feel like
they would appreciate it

64
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:48,829
a lot more than I would,

65
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,113
so I'm gonna give it to 'em now.

66
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:51,209
Go show 'em!

67
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,615
Look what we got, you guys!

68
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:54,199
- [All] Whoa!

69
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,145
- [Bryan] Have you guys ever
played with a real lightsaber?

70
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,433
- [All] No.

71
00:01:57,433 --> 00:02:01,600
- [Bryan] It's not going to
work without the head-gear.

72
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,831
- Oh my gosh, this is the--

73
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,939
- [Bryan] It's Star Wars A.R.

74
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,791
So, you can see your house
through there and you can, like,

75
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,899
fight bad guys with your lightsaber.

76
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:12,854
- What, okay, I'm gonna take--

77
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:14,505
- [Bryan] You've never seen that?

78
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:18,853
Oh, now they're fighting
over who gets to do it first.

79
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:21,603
(relaxing music)

80
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:24,795
What are you doing, dude?

81
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:25,806
- Battling droids.

82
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:26,639
- Get up!

83
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:36,748
So, if you guys missed yesterday's
vlog, we are hanging out

84
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:39,318
at my buddy Carl, and Jinger's, house.

85
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:40,399
What is this, dude?

86
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,567
- This is a plasma blaster.

87
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:45,080
It launches two-liter
bottles, like bottle rockets,

88
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,976
off the end of it.

89
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:48,190
- [Bryan] Dude I love that you
made it look like a Nerf gun.

90
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,555
That is so cool.

91
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:51,694
- I know, it's like it's a real
Nerf bullet and everything.

92
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:52,824
Shall we see how it launches?

93
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:53,657
- [Bryan] Let's see.

94
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:54,552
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

95
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:55,565
- Are you ready?

96
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:56,745
- It's so cool, dude.

97
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:57,578
- You ready?

98
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,411
- [Bryan] Ready!

99
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,244
- Three, two, one, go!

100
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,439
(laughing)

101
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,295
Isn't that amazing?

102
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,486
- [Bryan] That is so cool, dude!

103
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,039
- 60 feet, down there.

104
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,335
- That is awesome.

105
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,829
Carl just put up a video today.

106
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,043
I was watching him upload it.

107
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:12,122
I'm gonna have it linked in the iCard.

108
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:14,102
You gotta check this thing out in action.

109
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:14,935
- Thanks, man.

110
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:15,907
- 'Cause they push it to the limit, dude.

111
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:16,903
- Oh, it's so cool.

112
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,272
We did this versus a real Nerf blaster.

113
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:20,105
It turned out awesome.

114
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,107
- I totally feel like Papa
could build something like this.

115
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:22,945
- Oh, he totally should.

116
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:24,349
- Papa, if you're watching,

117
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,098
let's start doing something like this.

118
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,340
This is so cool.

119
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,346
It's so cool.

120
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,524
- [Carl] So, it's already on.

121
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:32,091
All you gotta do is halfway squeeze.

122
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:32,924
- Okay.

123
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:33,912
- [Carl] And, then, when
you pull in the trigger

124
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:35,105
all the way, it's gonna go.

125
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,097
- Okay, are you ready?

126
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:37,430
- [Carl] Uh-huh.

127
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:39,833
Oh, little, baby one!

128
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,144
Try it again, you gotta try it again!

129
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:43,448
- Alright, we're gonna
try again, you ready?

130
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:44,308
- [Carl] Yup.

131
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,394
- I'll see how I look like, holding this.

132
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,698
- [Carl] You looks so awesome, man.

133
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:49,662
Okay, let's see what you got.

134
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,337
Whoa, that went almost all
the way to the swimming pool!

135
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,229
- What, where'd it go?

136
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:56,158
- [Carl] It's like weee!

137
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:58,239
- I can't hear anything, what's going on.

138
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,447
- [Carl] Nice shot, dude.

139
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,615
- I got some Skittles.

140
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,918
- [Bryan] What did you just do, buddy?

141
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:04,393
- He made the magic or the genie!

142
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:05,236
- [Bryan] Oh, no way.

143
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:06,594
What did you guys do, Kyle?

144
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:09,394
- We made candy store
with a candy-dispenser.

145
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:12,352
- Yeah, so Ollie just
filmed a video with Kyle,

146
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,079
over on Kyle's channel,
Kyle Toys and Games.

147
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,490
I'll have it linked up in the iCard

148
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,449
so that you can check it out.

149
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,875
Video will probably be
up in a little bit, but.

150
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,708
That's so cool.

151
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,940
How did Ollie do, did he do good?

152
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,924
- Yeah, he did really good.

153
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,184
- [Bryan] And you guys
got candy out of it?

154
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:24,017
- [Kyle] Yup.

155
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:24,850
- [Bryan] Holla.

156
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,864
Yeah, that was a cool, little
contraption you guys made.

157
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,294
- The huge blaster!

158
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,839
- [Bryan] I know, Daddy was firing it off.

159
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,885
You wanna see it go?

160
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:31,718
- Mm-hmm.

161
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:32,853
- Here, you can come help me do it.

162
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,237
You wanna help me fire it off?

163
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:35,070
- No.

164
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,219
(laughing)

165
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:37,209
- Oh, that's okay, I understand.

166
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,762
- [Bryan] Okay, watch Ollie, watch.

167
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:39,771
- Here we go.

168
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:41,688
Ready, three, two, one!

169
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:46,002
(relaxing music)

170
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:47,241
- [Bryan] Isn't that crazy?

171
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:48,401
- [Carl] You see how far that went?

172
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,968
- That was so cool!

173
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:51,126
- [Bryan] It is so cool, dude.

174
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:51,959
- That was awesome, huh?

175
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,617
Bryan, you should try to
launch that plasma Nerf blaster

176
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:57,421
through this obstacle,
this inflatable obstacle.

177
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:58,690
Let's see, I'm gonna get this angle.

178
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,752
I think I'll be safe, go ahead

179
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:01,622
and go for it when you're ready.

180
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:04,198
Whoa, it came all the
way through, right here!

181
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:07,801
Good job, it went right
through, that was awesome!

182
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:10,551
(relaxing music)

183
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:18,903
- [Bryan] Alright, Finn has
found himself in a wild thing,

184
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,443
but a little bit souped
up, so what is this?

185
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:23,271
- This is a Crazy Cart.

186
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:27,501
It's basically the same
kind of plan, the same idea,

187
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,613
but this one, you choose when
to drift by pulling this bar

188
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,749
and it has no brake.

189
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,274
- And it also has a ton more power,

190
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:36,838
so I think Finn is going to love it.

191
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,750
(clunking)

192
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,583
- Ow!

193
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:44,350
- Woo!

194
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:46,961
That is so cool!

195
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:48,912
Finn loves it.

196
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:50,745
Here comes Luke, whoa!

197
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,436
Yeah, he loves spinning in circles.

198
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:56,853
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

199
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:02,360
- [Bryan] Finn!

200
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,346
At Carl and Jinger's house,
they have so many cool toys,

201
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,172
I am just so excited to play

202
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:08,869
because sometimes, adults need to play.

203
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,736
Okay, I am going to hop
on the Crazy Cart XL

204
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:12,597
for the first time.

205
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:13,718
I've never been on one of these things.

206
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:15,440
I've always wanted to.

207
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,351
Okay.

208
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:17,979
- [Carl] Be careful; there's no brakes.

209
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:18,918
- So this, oh, there's no brakes?

210
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:19,751
- [Carl] There's no brakes;

211
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:21,589
you just have to drift and turn, yeah.

212
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,465
- So, this is the gas?

213
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,298
- [Carl] Yeah.

214
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:24,131
- And this is the drifter?

215
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:25,749
- [Carl] Yeah, and, then,
like, if you turn really hard,

216
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:28,178
it will turn like how
you go, so it's crazy.

217
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,164
- Okay, can I flip it?

218
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:30,140
- [Carl] There goes Finn!

219
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,798
(dramatic music)

220
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:34,881
- Oh, God, there it goes!

221
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:37,234
- [Carl] Here, I'd better take that.

222
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,926
(laughing)

223
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:40,977
Let's see what happened, oh my gosh.

224
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:41,894
Oh my gosh!

225
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,725
It's totally wiped out.

226
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:45,890
I think it's totally fine.

227
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,246
You're good; it's all good.

228
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:49,321
- Finn, this is not the
first time Finn has just

229
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,932
grabbed an R.C. controller and
started pulling the trigger.

230
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:52,765
- [Carl] That was my fault;

231
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:54,305
I left it sitting there, turned on.

232
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,988
- Oh, look, it snapped this off.

233
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:58,393
- [Carl] Oh no, oh no!

234
00:06:58,393 --> 00:06:59,567
That's okay, don't worry about it.

235
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:00,400
- [Bryan] I'm sorry, dude.

236
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,233
- [Carl] We'll fix it.

237
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,546
Back to the drift carts.

238
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,379
- Take two.

239
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,664
Okay, here we go, I'm gonna
try it for the first time.

240
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:06,497
Oh.

241
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:08,068
- [Carl] Reverse, yeah, there you go.

242
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:08,985
- What the?

243
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:11,466
- [Carl] Wha!

244
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,196
Whoa!

245
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:17,170
You did it.

246
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,381
- Dude, this thing is nuts!

247
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:19,885
- [Carl] It's really cool, huh?

248
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:21,051
- I've never been on anything like this.

249
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:22,468
Oh my gosh, okay.

250
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,737
- [Carl] Now you got it!

251
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,987
(whirring)

252
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,374
Turn!

253
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,315
(laughing)

254
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:36,708
It's really fun.

255
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,600
Just try to spin in a fast
donut, like, do a big circle.

256
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,820
There you go.

257
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,653
- Whoa!

258
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,906
Alright, Santa, I want one
of these for Christmas.

259
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:48,402
- [Carl] Heck yeah,
those are awesome, huh?

260
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:51,152
(relaxing music)

261
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,390
- How many times have I wiped out, now?

262
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,915
- [Carl] Probably five, I don't know.

263
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:10,332
- This is the coolest thing ever.

264
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:12,066
- [Carl] I think you
guys should have a race.

265
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:12,899
- I think we should

266
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:13,987
because there's no brakes on these things,

267
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:16,121
so that makes that super-fun
and dangerous, right?

268
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:16,954
- Yeah!

269
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,787
- High five!

270
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:18,832
- [Carl] So, let's start
at this line and, then,

271
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,227
you guys race to the end of
the driveway, down there.

272
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,095
Ready?

273
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:23,242
- I hope we don't smash into the garage.

274
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:24,252
(gasps)

275
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:25,350
- [Carl] Okay?

276
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,320
- Call it.

277
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,284
- [Child] Two!

278
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:29,434
- [Carl] One, go!

279
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:30,267
- No!

280
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,590
Oh, Gage totally won.

281
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,192
Whoo, good race, that was awesome.

282
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:43,525
(squeaking)

283
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,658
(laughing)

284
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:50,082
Nice.

285
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:52,241
Whoa, you made a pizza, look at that.

286
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,489
- Yeah!

287
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,065
- [Carl] Is that why they call it donuts?

288
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,660
- Oh, 'cause you go nuts?

289
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,041
- [Carl] Yeah.

290
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,791
(relaxing music)

291
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:12,149
- [Bryan] Alright, Missy's
trying out the Crazy Cart.

292
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,037
What do you think?

293
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:14,660
- It's so fast.

294
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,943
- [Bryan] You're going so slow, babe.

295
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:18,285
- I know; I don't think
this thing goes any faster.

296
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:21,035
(relaxing music)

297
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,957
- [Ollie] Go, momma, go!

298
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:30,207
- [Bryan] Turn, oh my gosh.

299
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:34,982
(child shouting)

300
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:37,884
- Go, momma, go, go, momma, go!

301
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:41,028
Go, momma, go, go, momma, go!

302
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,928
Go, momma, go!

303
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,490
(screaming)

304
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,879
- [Bryan] Hey, Finn, what
are we eating for dinner?

305
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,073
(baby mumbling)

306
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:49,484
Say pizza!

307
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:50,423
- Ay-yah.

308
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,515
(laughing)

309
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:54,682
- [Bryan] We are having a pizza party!

310
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:56,407
- Woo!

311
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:58,975
- [Bryan] We worked up a
sweat, didn't we, Ollie?

312
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,912
Yeah, we had a lot of fun today?

313
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:01,745
- Yeah.

314
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:02,578
- [Bryan] Someone's tired.

315
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:04,986
- We had such a fun day
with all these boys.

316
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:06,052
- It was so fun.

317
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:06,885
- So many boys here.

318
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:09,547
- We are so outnumbered in a big way.

319
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:12,230
- But, anyways, I think we're
gonna end today's video,

320
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,663
but the fun is not over.

321
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,803
Tomorrow, we're having
more fun, okay, boys?

322
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:16,636
- [Ollie] 'Kay.

323
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,992
- Sound good?
- You guys ready for fun?

324
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:20,216
- Alright, we'll see you guys tomorrow.

325
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:21,541
Make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up

326
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,669
if you enjoyed it and we'll
see you guys tomorrow, again.

327
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:25,896
- Bye!

328
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:26,896
- [All] Bye!

329
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,376
- [Missy] Oop.

330
00:10:29,376 --> 00:00:00,000
(fun music)
