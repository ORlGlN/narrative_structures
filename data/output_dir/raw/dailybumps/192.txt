1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:02,624
- [Missy] Let's see.

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:05,972
(gasps) Is he still sleeping?

3
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,813
Oh, oh, where is he?

4
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:08,798
Where is Ollie?

5
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:09,631
(Finn squeals)

6
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:11,064
Get him!

7
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:12,677
(gasps) Peekaboo!

8
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:14,463
(Finn giggles)

9
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:17,630
(gentle, theme music)

10
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:21,442
♫ Wherever you are

11
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:24,859
♫ That's where I wanna be

12
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,532
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset

13
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:32,393
♫ Big, blue eyes looked up and said,

14
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:35,470
♫ "This is home."

15
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,451
♫ Just foolin' around,
you never looked so cute

16
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:43,101
♫ Huggin' you tight,
cuddling all I could saying,

17
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:46,148
♫ "I am home."

18
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:50,231
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,543
- Good morning, guys!

20
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:58,428
Don't worry, I will not
let that annoying chipmunk

21
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:00,624
start the vlog like he did yesterday.

22
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:02,072
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

23
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:03,073
watch yesterday's vlog.

24
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:07,026
So, today, we put both
kids down for a nap.

25
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,068
They both took amazing naps.

26
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,920
And we were able to get
a ton of stuff done.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,028
But little Finny woke up first.

28
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:17,430
(lightly taps door)
(Finn yells)

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,758
You want out?

30
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:19,591
Oh, Finny!

31
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,057
Whoa, look at it, you guys.

32
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:25,886
His nursery is like a club, it's so funny.

33
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,731
Turn that off, turn this off.

34
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:31,370
Turn this off, how do you turn this off?

35
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,203
There we go.

36
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:33,731
Turn this off.

37
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:36,398
(gasps) Oh, hi.

38
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,799
Good morning, cute, little boy.

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,632
(Finn whines)

40
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,506
Say, "Hi."

41
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:43,487
- Hey.
- Can you say, "Good morning?"

42
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:45,925
(Finn whines)

43
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,722
That's his mumbling good morning.

44
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:48,810
'Cause he's very tired.

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,548
Did you have such a good nap?

46
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:52,995
- Yeah.
- I missed you.

47
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:55,336
What do you want to do today?

48
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:57,730
- Mama.
- You wanna just go see mama?

49
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,563
- Yeah.

50
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:00,445
- He always wants to go see mama.

51
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:01,998
Good morning, Finn.

52
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:04,176
And good morning to you guys.

53
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:06,759
(Finn babbles)

54
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:08,674
Really?

55
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:12,527
(Finn babbles)
Okay, alright.

56
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,448
- Alright, Finn is up from his nap.

57
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:16,580
And he slept so good.

58
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,315
And you know who else slept so good?

59
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:21,458
Ollie, they both went down so good.

60
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,676
They didn't cry, they just went to bed.

61
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,417
And now it's time for
Ollie to wake up, huh?

62
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,649
You gonna go get him up?

63
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,654
He's been a little clingy to mama.

64
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:31,871
(gasps) Let's see.

65
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:35,807
(gasps) Is he still sleeping?

66
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,922
Is Ollie still sleeping?

67
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,731
Oh, oh, where is he?

68
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,791
Where is Ollie?

69
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,111
(Finn babbles)
Get him!

70
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:44,585
(gasps) Peekaboo!

71
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:46,374
(Finn giggles)

72
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,541
(laughs) Did you have a good nap?

73
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,922
You slept so good!

74
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:55,843
Good job, I love you.

75
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:59,596
You guys both did so good.

76
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,571
Yeah, they slept so good.

77
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,142
We were able to get so much work done

78
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:03,198
while they were sleeping.

79
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,031
It was nice.

80
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,668
I told him he didn't have to sleep.

81
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:08,153
I just wanted him to have
some time to rest in his room.

82
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,213
And he was like, "Okay."

83
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:11,033
And then he just fell asleep.

84
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,432
Guess what we get to do, guys.

85
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:13,265
- What?

86
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:14,573
- We get to go see Uncle Corbin

87
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:16,532
and Auntie Kelsey's new house.

88
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:18,904
Do you guys wanna go see their new house?

89
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:20,273
And go play with them?

90
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:21,809
- [Oliver] At Meme and Papaw's?

91
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:24,621
- (laughs) No, not at Meme and
Papaw's, at their new house.

92
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,619
Ollie actually thinks that
Corbin and Kelsey's house

93
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:29,364
is the house that we stayed at in Oregon

94
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:30,425
when we saw the eclipse.

95
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:32,639
So, I've been telling him
that they're moving here.

96
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,862
And he's like, "They don't
have their house anymore?"

97
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:36,727
But he's never actually been

98
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,698
to their real house which is funny, so.

99
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:40,748
Yep, we're going to their real house now.

100
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:43,385
Because they live here now.

101
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,218
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie.

102
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:45,051
- What?

103
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:45,945
- [Bryan] Where are we at?

104
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:48,177
- Kelsey and Corbin's new house.

105
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:50,113
- [Bryan] Yes, we are, aren't we?

106
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:50,946
And look at you boys.

107
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,096
(Finn babbles)

108
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:55,303
(laughs) The boys are already exploring.

109
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,347
We're checking out the new digs.

110
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:59,114
- What do you guys think?

111
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,671
- Oh, my gosh, this is amazing.

112
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,535
- [Bryan] This is so cool.

113
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,021
- [Corbin] Thanks, yeah, I love it.

114
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:06,273
- It's actually happening, you guys.

115
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:09,534
Our friends have moved
from Oregon to California.

116
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:10,652
And we're so excited.

117
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:12,420
I'll let you guys watch
their empty house tour.

118
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,737
I'll have the video of theirs,

119
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,071
linked in our Icard today
so you can check it out.

120
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:20,356
But yeah, we're here
exploring their new house.

121
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:22,365
Whoa, that is really cool.

122
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:23,610
It's really nice.

123
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,980
Ollie, where's June?

124
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,450
- I don't know.

125
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,383
- [Bryan] Is she sleeping?

126
00:04:29,383 --> 00:04:30,993
Gotta be quiet, huh?

127
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:33,521
Do you like that she lives closer now?

128
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,826
She's gonna grow up and you guys,

129
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,883
maybe, are best friends together.

130
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:38,424
That's kind of cool.

131
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,676
Then you can have lots
of cool friends, huh?

132
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:42,880
- Yeah, but where did
Kelsey and Corbin go?

133
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,425
- [Bryan] I think they're
still exploring upstairs.

134
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:47,008
(gentle music)

135
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:52,759
What did you just find?

136
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,239
- [Oliver] A little, tiny, baby lizard.

137
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,202
- [Bryan] That is so cute.

138
00:04:58,202 --> 00:04:59,635
Look at how cute it is.

139
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:02,091
- [Corbin] Aw, it's so little.

140
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:02,925
- You can't have it.

141
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:05,289
(Bryan laughs)

142
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,002
- [Bryan] Aw, it's his
new friend (laughs).

143
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:12,249
- [Corbin] Whoa, that's cool.

144
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:14,163
- This kid is crazy.

145
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:16,756
He just dropped it 'cause
he wanted to catch it again.

146
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,111
Be nicely though.

147
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:18,944
- [Missy] Pick it up nicely.

148
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,643
'Cause his tail will fall off.

149
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:21,493
- [Bryan] There you go.

150
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:22,533
- [Missy] If he gets scared.

151
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,025
- [Bryan] There you go (laughs).

152
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:24,858
- Does he bite?

153
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,140
- No, you're good.

154
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,723
(gentle music)

155
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:34,842
- [Bryan] Hey, Finn,
do you like her outfit?

156
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:35,995
- Yeah.

157
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:39,828
- Yeah, 'cause she's
wearing your old clothes.

158
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,080
That is so cute (laughs).

159
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,663
(gentle music)

160
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:52,445
Missy and I have a plan to get back

161
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:55,834
at Corbin and Kelsey for pranking us.

162
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:56,754
(growls)

163
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:58,689
And we're gonna test it out
on the boys first, right?

164
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,830
Okay, so we have these gorilla suits.

165
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,090
Look at that, that's so creepy.

166
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,310
And Missy's gonna hide in the closet.

167
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,524
The boys are gonna come in.

168
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:07,715
They're eating dinner right now.

169
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,939
So, they're gonna come
in to get ready for bed.

170
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,660
And then, you're gonna
jump out of the closet

171
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,163
and scare them.
- Okay.

172
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,031
- Wait, we need a code word.

173
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:18,424
The code word is going to be bananas.

174
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:19,588
When you hear me say, "Banana",

175
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,832
that's when you jump out, okay?

176
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:22,992
You got this, babe.

177
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:25,044
Oh, yeah, that's freaky.

178
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:26,934
They're gonna love that, okay.

179
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:27,767
Okay, good luck in there.

180
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,705
- [Missy] Okay, bye.

181
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,542
(laughs)

182
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,521
- Okay, I'm going.

183
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,754
(Oliver giggling)

184
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:35,600
(laughs) Come on, Ollie.

185
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,812
Come on, Finn, it's time
to get ready for bed, okay?

186
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,698
(growls) Look at these cute,

187
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:43,256
little kiddos in this mirror.

188
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:45,234
They're so cute, aren't they?

189
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,056
Aren't they so cute?

190
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:49,676
You guys are like a couple
of cute bananas, aren't you?

191
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:53,307
(Missy growls)
(screams)

192
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:55,676
(Missy growls)

193
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,509
Who is it?

194
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:00,007
It's Mama (laughs)!

195
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:04,174
- (laughs) His face was terrifying.

196
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,162
- [Bryan] Really?

197
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,329
(screams)

198
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,573
And now, he's laughing.

199
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:18,477
- Wait a second.

200
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:20,534
Is that funny (laughs)?

201
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:22,367
His face was so funny.

202
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:24,663
Did you get scared?

203
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:27,330
- No, are you wearing a gorilla?

204
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,171
- Isn't she a good gorilla?

205
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,995
What do you boys think, was that scary?

206
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:32,828
- Yeah!

207
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,649
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie, do you think

208
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,145
that would work on Kelsey and Corbin?

209
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:38,729
- Yeah.
- Should we scare them?

210
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,021
- Should I put on a suit too

211
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:42,197
and then we scare Kelsey and Corbin?

212
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:43,726
They got monkey suits.

213
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:45,579
So, I have one and Missy has one.

214
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,612
And I think we're gonna get
back at Kelsey and Corbin.

215
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,363
Because when we were with them

216
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,972
for the solar eclipse, they pranked us.

217
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,471
You don't prank us and get away with it.

218
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,246
So, now there's a couple of scary gorillas

219
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:57,567
that are coming after them, right?

220
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:58,668
- Yeah, let's do it.

221
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:00,843
- Mama, I will distract.

222
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:01,877
- [Bryan] You're gonna distract them?

223
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:03,442
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

224
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,992
- The tables have turned.

225
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:08,764
♫ I'm dressed as a gorilla

226
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:11,081
- (laughs) That's a pretty cool gorilla.

227
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:11,914
- What do you think?

228
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:12,747
Is this a good look for me?

229
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:13,580
- That looks really cool.

230
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,337
- Do you know what this
hair on top reminds me of?

231
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,170
- [Missy] What?

232
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,860
- June (laughs).

233
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,015
Doesn't it look like her hair?

234
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:19,848
- [Missy] Uh-huh.

235
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:21,842
- So, I am in the gorilla suit now.

236
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:23,158
And we have a plan.

237
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:23,991
- Yes.

238
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,333
- [Bryan] Missy's gonna
pretend to see a spider

239
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,340
and she's gonna yell at Corbin.

240
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,177
- Huge spider right there.

241
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:29,865
- [Bryan] There's huge spider, ginormous.

242
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:32,972
- (gasps) Spider, Corbin!

243
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,941
Come get it, come get it, it's so gross.

244
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,522
Oh, my God, it's so gross.

245
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:37,719
It's so big, it's so big.

246
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,272
- It's just a spider.

247
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:41,105
How big is it?

248
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:41,938
- [Missy] Just get it.

249
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,855
It's fine, it's fine, just get it.

250
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:45,223
It's so freaking big and nasty.

251
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,348
It's so gross.

252
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:47,997
- I don't want to.

253
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,330
Oh my, what the!

254
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,201
(yells)

255
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,234
Oh, my God.

256
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:06,570
(imitates gorilla noises)

257
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,035
(yells)

258
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:09,402
- [Bryan] Got you, bro.

259
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:10,693
I remembered the silly string.

260
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,860
- [Kelsey] Babe, what happened?

261
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,911
- [Bryan] Got you.

262
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,078
- That freaking scared me.

263
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,209
(laughs)
Spider.

264
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,997
- [Bryan] Meditating Ollie is back.

265
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:22,481
Oh, my goodness, you are so funny.

266
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:25,665
He's trying to get in zen mode right now.

267
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,644
(Bryan blows tongue)

268
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:30,249
- Thanks for watching today's vlog.

269
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,694
Give it a big thumbs up.

270
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:34,312

275

(gentle, theme music)
