1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:17,925
- [Family] We're in Legoland!

3
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,816
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:28,399
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be

5
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:32,598
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

6
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:37,288
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

7
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:40,423
♫ This is home

8
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:43,233
♫ Just running around
you never looked so cute

9
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:47,954
♫ Hugging you tight,
cuddling all I could saying

10
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:51,081
♫ I am home

11
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:54,914
♫ Home forever you're with me

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,523
- Morning!

13
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:00,680
- Good morning, buddy.
What're we doing today?

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,211
- We're gonna see Lego Batman.

15
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,661
- We're gonna go to Legoland.

16
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:07,495
We're actually just in the shuttle,

17
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:09,120
headed across the street.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,640
We are gonna have a fun day planned,

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,751
and part of that day is
gonna be meeting Lego Batman

20
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,959
and Ollie is so excited.

21
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,874
We've never been to
Legoland with the boys.

22
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:21,696
I've been once, when I was
like 12 or 13 years old.

23
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:23,972
So I'm thinking there's going
to be a lot for them to do,

24
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:25,051
and we're really excited.

25
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,387
- Let's do this!

26
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,105
- [Bryan] Who is that Ollie?

27
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,002
- [Ollie] I don't know.

28
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:30,093
- That is a Lego Knight

29
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:31,559
and he's got something special for you.

30
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,392
You wanna go get it?

31
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,575
- Yeah.
- Go get it!

32
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:34,574
What do you say?

33
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:35,407
- Thank you.

34
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:36,507
- [Bryan] This is so cool.

35
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:37,490
We got our badges
- That's so neat.

36
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,628
- And our pins.
- This says 2017 on it.

37
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:40,928
- [Bryan] Yeah that's so cool.

38
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:42,624
Alright we've got out lanyards,

39
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:45,236
now we're putting on our first visit pin.

40
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:47,113
- Yeah and it's really spiky.

41
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:49,059
- Yeah you gotta be careful, huh?

42
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,409
Yeah. (laughs)

43
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:52,692
So what's cool is our badges
have little mini figs on 'em

44
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:56,361
and we can trade with any
other workers in the park

45
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:59,008
if they have a mini figure
that they want or that we want

46
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:00,436
we can trade them ours.

47
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:02,445
Ollie, so if you see someone
who has a mini figure

48
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:05,777
on their badge, you can
trade it for this one, okay?

49
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:07,743
So don't get attached. (laughs)

50
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:10,193
- You might find one that is
really cool that you want.

51
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:14,193
- Well, I want a Ninjago
that's got a red sword.

52
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:16,934
- [Bryan] He wants a red
Ninjago with a sword.

53
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:18,367
- Ooh, that'd be cool!

54
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:21,625
- And this is our wonderful
Legoland tour guide Innocent.

55
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,271
She's gonna be givin' us the inside scoop.

56
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,059
We get to go behind the scenes,

57
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:26,232
we get to go on all the rides,

58
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:27,314
and she's gonna make it all happen.

59
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,053
So, we're super excited.

60
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:30,411
Thank you Legoland for hooking us up,

61
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,548
because Ollie is so excited.

62
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:35,589
- I hope the Lego door's not locked.

63
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,397
- It's not gonna be locked.

64
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:39,980
(upbeat music)

65
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,727
He is gettin' comfy already.

66
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:48,004
- Come on guys, get in here!

67
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:50,906
- [Bryan] This bed can't
be comfy, you're crazy!

68
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:52,600
- [Ollie] Just kidding!

69
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,511
- [Bryan] He's such a little ham today.

70
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:55,382
- I know.

71
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:58,149
- [Bryan] There's a very
cool Lego brick play area

72
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,982
for the boys.

73
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:02,587
- [Missy] Woo! (laughs)

74
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:04,954
- [Bryan] Talk about
trapped in Lego bricks, huh?

75
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:08,704
And then they have this
huge Lego castle playground.

76
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:11,862
What do you think of this, Ollie?

77
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:14,494
Whoa, it's a skeleton.
Say, "Hi, Skeleton."

78
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,808
- Hi, Skeleton!

79
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:18,784
- That's right guys, we
are behind the scenes

80
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:20,786
at Legoland right now.

81
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:24,165
This is all the little pieces,
they're all categorized.

82
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:25,614
We have models here.

83
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:26,542
Look at this.

84
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,577
That is too cool!

85
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:30,173
Did you build this?

86
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:32,600
- I was actually the only
model builder out of all of us

87
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,598
that didn't build it.

88
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,629
- [Bryan] So this is like a full model

89
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,502
of the new Lego Ninjago world?

90
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:39,335
- Full-ish.

91
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:40,726
- [Bryan] Full-ish. (laughs)

92
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:43,309
(upbeat music)

93
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:08,084
You wanna build something, Ollie?

94
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:10,197
- Yeah, alright, you both get one.

95
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:11,805
Here we go.

96
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:12,638
There we go.

97
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:13,549
We can build with this stuff, right?

98
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,897
- [Bryan] He thinks we're
building a rocket or space ship.

99
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:18,415
- Maybe some sort of vehicle.

100
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:20,019
What do you think this is for, Ollie?

101
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,852
- They could be wheels.

102
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:22,130
- [Worker] Yeah what's that part?

103
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,237
- Whoa, I made it!

104
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:24,880
- [Bryan] You made something, huh?

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,995
- Ready to see what it is?

106
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:29,006
We are building, submarine.

107
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:30,956
- [Bryan] Oh cool!

108
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:32,904
They showed us the completed
model for like 10 seconds

109
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:34,470
and now we're trying to build it.

110
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,593
- I'm crying.

111
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:36,429
- I'm getting close.

112
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:39,448
I did it you guys! I
made a little submarine.

113
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,052
Ollie is doing so good too.

114
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:44,396
Alright, we had so much fun
behind the scenes of Legoland.

115
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:45,229
And now, Ollie.

116
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,316
- Hey guys, I have to tell you something.

117
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:48,201
- Oh, okay, Ollie.

118
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:49,696
What do you have to tell them?

119
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:52,067
- I can jago sword!

120
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,565
- He's on the look for a Ninjago sword.

121
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,347
And we are officially in Legoland!

122
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:58,930
(upbeat music)

123
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,713
- [Family] We're in Legoland!

124
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,728
- [Bryan] We are on the island in the sky.

125
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:20,261
This thing gets up to 150 feet.

126
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,525
- [Missy] Wow.

127
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,487
- Look at that wind
blowing through his curls.

128
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:26,487
We can see the whole park from here.

129
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:36,266
We are now headed in to Duplo Valley,

130
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,299
which I think Fin will like.

131
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:39,040
Ollie, look at this little person.

132
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,141
Hello.

133
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:41,500
Come say hi!

134
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,944
Aww.

135
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:46,106
Fin, we're in your neck of the woods, bro.

136
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,197
Duplo Farm.

137
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:49,030
Let's go check it out.

138
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:03,247
(computerized clucking)

139
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,093
Hey Ollie, did you know
that the chicken is related

140
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:06,799
to the T-Rex?

141
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,632
- Yeah.

142
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:09,799
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

143
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:22,920
Now we are entering The World of Chima.

144
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,618
He's got a big sword doesn't he?

145
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,868
- [Ollie] Yeah.

146
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,492
- That's pretty cool.

147
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,185
We now look like Lego figures, you guys.

148
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:40,764
(laughs)

149
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:41,682
We're on a boat ride,

150
00:06:41,682 --> 00:06:44,421
and the object is to shoot
the other player in the boat,

151
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,652
and Ollie really wants to do it.

152
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:48,160
And I was like, "I don't
wanna get that wet!"

153
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,064
People were getting soaked.

154
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,473
You ready Ollie?

155
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:52,306
Shoot 'em!

156
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,451
- [Ollie] Wow!

157
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,106
(Bryan laughs)

158
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:57,371
- Shoot Ollie, go, go, go!

159
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:59,451
Get 'em, get the bad guys!

160
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:02,888
This is an arm workout for sure. (laughs)

161
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,941
Everything got soaking
wet, including the camera.

162
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,137
(laughs)

163
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,953
Ollie, let me see you. (laughs)

164
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:11,451
I'm sorry, kiddo.

165
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:12,799
- [Missy] We'll get dry, don't worry.

166
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,981
- [Bryan] We'll dry off, okay?

167
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,339
- It's bad!

168
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,805
- [Bryan] It's really bad, I know!

169
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,799
That waterfall came down on us.

170
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,272
Poor Fin got soaked too.

171
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:22,209
- I tried so hard.

172
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,792
I was like, "No, not the baby!"

173
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:30,100
- [Bryan] Ollie is so soaking wet.

174
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,876
He's in this dryer.

175
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,710
How's it feel?

176
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,627
Is it warm?

177
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:40,732
How's that feel? (laughs)

178
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:41,891
- Good.

179
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:44,677
- I got soaked but that was so fun!

180
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,871
- Someone very special
is coming to meet us.

181
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:48,183
Who is that?

182
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:49,277
- Lego Batman.

183
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:50,360
- Oh my gosh!

184
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:52,859
Do you see his face?

185
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:54,136
- Yeah.

186
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:56,182
- [Missy] Look who it is!

187
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:59,980
- Well, hello there, Bruce. (laughs)

188
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,863
Go give him a hug!

189
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,446
Give him a big hug!

190
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:04,589
Hi, Batman!

191
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,324
He's so happy, that's so awesome.

192
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:12,169
Fin is like, "What is going on?"

193
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:14,433
I don't even know who that is, huh?

194
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,790
Alright Batman, I gotta blog with you.

195
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,113
Big fan.

196
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,390
Love the movie.

197
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,223
Good job.

198
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,177
Is there gonna be a sequel?

199
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,047
He's still waitin'.

200
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:26,171
I hope you get the sequel, I really do.

201
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,958
Shake his hand, Fin.

202
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:28,791
- Yeah!

203
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:31,566
- [Bryan] Bye Batman!

204
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:34,214
- [Missy] Look at that cape.

205
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,596
- That is a cape!

206
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:36,866
- There's a cool cape, huh?

207
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:37,698
- Yeah!

208
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:38,670
(Bryan laughs)

209
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:41,588
- Look who else we got, it's Emmet!

210
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:45,176
Emmet is my fave.

211
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:48,192
I just gotta say, Emmet,
you are my fave right here.

212
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:49,191
(laughs)

213
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,445
Look who it is, Ollie.

214
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:51,316
Say hi, Emmet!

215
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:52,593
- Hi, Emmet!

216
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:55,916
- [Bryan] He's gonna take
your slushie. (laughs)

217
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,166
- Just kidding!

218
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:00,162
- Aww.

219
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:02,393
Did you see Emmet?

220
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:03,226
I love Emmet.

221
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,136
Emmet is so cool.

222
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:06,365
Everything is awesome!

223
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,165
Can you dance, Ollie?

224
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,165
Dance party!

225
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,264
I'm embarrassing him,
we're embarrassing him.

226
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,680
That was seriously so cool.

227
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,399
Legoland set up a private meeting

228
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,732
with Lego Batman and Emmet.

229
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,067
- Ollie was so excited.

230
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:20,914
- He was so excited.

231
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,157
Oh, that was so cool to see.

232
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:24,363
Now we are entering something amazing.

233
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,650
This is what fascinates me about Lego.

234
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,728
This is Miniland USA.

235
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:31,027
And Innocent said, how many bricks?

236
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:32,687
- Over 30 million.

237
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:36,251
- Over 30, can you imagine that, babe?

238
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:40,706
So they have tons of little
set ups all around the world.

239
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,583
Built with just Legos.

240
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,166
(upbeat music)

241
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,364
We are now headed to Pirate's Cove,

242
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:31,058
where there's gonna be a pirate show,

243
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:33,182
where they go on water skis.

244
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,471
Very excited about that.

245
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:35,597
Ollie loves pirates still.

246
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:37,617
So there may even be an opportunity

247
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,835
for him to do something really fun.

248
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:41,901
Pirate's Cove, here we go!

249
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:45,484
Oh look and there's
some pirates over here.

250
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,723
They weren't even holding on, Ollie.

251
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:53,973
They were using their feet.

252
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,595
What was that?

253
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,504
- It was a gator!

254
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:02,729
- [Bryan] They're on skis?

255
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,045
- Yeah, that's so funny!

256
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:07,462
- [Bryan] Look at those guys.

257
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:14,888
Oh no, Ollie.

258
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:16,177
There's pirates!

259
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,791
How we gonna get rid of them?

260
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,764
- I don't know.

261
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:20,134
- I don't know either.

262
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:22,667
We got pirates, guys.

263
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:23,500
No!

264
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,327
Oh no, Ollie.

265
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,509
The pirates have taken over.

266
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,342
(swords clanging)

267
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,213
Here's the leader, Captain Brick Beard!

268
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:50,616
Look at his peg leg.

269
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:52,616
Push it, Ollie, push it!

270
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:57,885
- [Pirate] One, two, and wheee!

271
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,707
- [Bryan] Nice job, Ollie! (laughs)

272
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,190
Ollie you scared away all the pirates.

273
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,954
- I scared the pirates away.

274
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:12,162
- [Bryan] Yes you did.

275
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:13,868
Good job, dude.

276
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,889
There's Captain Brick Beard

277
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,562
and he's being chased by a shark.

278
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,209
- [Announcer] Enjoy the
rest of your day here,

279
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,876
at Legoland Florida.

280
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:28,248
- [Missy] Ollie are you
excited to go way up there?

281
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,223
Look up.

282
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:31,324
- Ready to go all the way up?

283
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:33,057
- [Missy] So they get to
like, pull themselves up

284
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:33,997
using the rope.

285
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:34,830
- Gotta work for it.

286
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,736
- [Missy] Yeah! (laughs)

287
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:38,569
Bye Ollie!

288
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:47,669
- He's not helping at all.

289
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,971
(Missy laughs)

290
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:51,888
- [Missy] Go up, go up!

291
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,985
- [Ollie] It's a giraffe!

292
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,167
- [Bryan] Yeah, it is a giraffe.

293
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,537
That's pretty cool, huh?

294
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,103
- I'm going to ride it.

295
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:03,192
- It's actually made out
of the Lego Duplo bricks.

296
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:07,085
And then over here we have
Albert Einstein, right there

297
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:10,206
and another giraffe over
here wearing sneakers.

298
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,039
He's wearing sneakers!

299
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,064
That's weird, huh?

300
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:15,341
- I see Nick's goggle.

301
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,583
- [Bryan] You see Nick's goggles?

302
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,416
- Yeah!

303
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,469
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

304
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:19,625
- [Bryan] I've been trying to teach him

305
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,865
how to pronounce 'Ninjago' all day.

306
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:22,882
- Nick's goggles!

307
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:23,915
- Nick's goggles!

308
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:26,156
Hey Ollie, say "Nin."

309
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,236
- Nin.

310
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:28,835
- Then say, "jago"

311
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:30,289
- Jago.

312
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,021
- Good job, now say, "Ninjago."

313
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:32,996
- Nick's goggle.

314
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:34,889
- Nick's goggles!

315
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,083
We are headed to Ninjago.

316
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,961
Ollie has been dying to go here all day.

317
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,702
The moment he's been waiting for.

318
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:44,874
They've got a really cool
ride and we're gonna explore.

319
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,577
See what they have for us, but sounds fun.

320
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,111
- We saw it in the mini form, right?

321
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:51,921
- Yes, yeah. We saw the actual
display behind the scenes.

322
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:52,754
So that's cool.

323
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,502
And look it, we're eating ice
cream out of a Lego brick.

324
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:55,960
- It's so good too.

325
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,710
(mystical music)

326
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,777
- [Bryan] That's Kai!

327
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:17,505
Kai has fire in his
blood and he likes speed.

328
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:19,033
- He has a sword?

329
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,775
- [Bryan] Kai has a sword, yep.

330
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:23,239
Jay is a master of lightning, huh?

331
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,943
You wanna go see what he has for you?

332
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:27,543
Jay's Lightning Drill, do you wanna start?

333
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:28,543
- [Game] Go!

334
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:31,062
- [Bryan] Push it!

335
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:32,881
Push that one, Ollie.

336
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:33,714
Get it!

337
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:34,547
Good job.

338
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,297
Hurry, hit the light!

339
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:39,947
Hi-yah!

340
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,271
Good job, Ollie.

341
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,345
I'm proud of you dude, you got 12.

342
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:45,131
That's pretty good.

343
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,663
- He has a sword too.

344
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:49,077
- I know, can you take it?

345
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:49,910
Oh!

346
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,527
Ollie, guess who's here!

347
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:52,360
Kai!

348
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,500
Do you wanna meet Kai?

349
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,467
- Yeah.

350
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,784
- [Bryan] He's the one
who controls fire, huh?

351
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:57,617
Say hi!

352
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:58,450
- Hi!

353
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,393
- [Bryan] Ollie, tell him
he's your favorite ninja.

354
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:03,276
- I'm your favorite ninja!

355
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,546
(Bryan laughs)

356
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:06,862
- [Bryan] Ollie is your favorite ninja,

357
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:10,018
that's for sure, huh? (laughs)

358
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:11,490
Aww.

359
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,497
Come here Fin!

360
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:14,006
Come say hi to Kai!

361
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:15,398
Can you give him a hug?

362
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:17,898
Aww. (laughs)

363
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:22,255
He actually gasped.

364
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,389
What is that, Ollie?

365
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:25,759
Let me see it.

366
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,317
That is so cool.

367
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,068
Is that what you've been
waiting for all day?

368
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:29,901
- Yeah.

369
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:30,734
- [Bryan] Yeah?

370
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:31,915
Should we get two and get one for Fin?

371
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:32,748
- Yeah.

372
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,145
- He's been asking for
a Ninjago sword all day.

373
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:37,697
I am so thankful that they sell them here!

374
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:40,971
- How about we can just get one?

375
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,922
- We need to get one for Fin too though.

376
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:45,096
And you and I have to battle, remember?

377
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:45,929
(martial shouts)

378
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:46,762
(swords clashing)

379
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:48,136
- Hiya!

380
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:50,719
(Missy laughs)

381
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,946
- [Missy] Oh, he got you! (laughs)

382
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,460
Oh, you got him!

383
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:16,159
- [Bryan] Alright, we are
entering the ride now.

384
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,005
Ooh Ollie look at those swords.

385
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:18,936
So cool!

386
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,431
- That's the one I got!

387
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:22,207
- [Bryan] That's the one we got, yeah!

388
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:23,125
- [Missy] That's Kai!

389
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:23,958
- [Oliver] That's Kai!

390
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,588
- [Bryan] You just met him!

391
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:26,421
And Nya,

392
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,499
Lloyd,

393
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:30,246
Zane,

394
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,570
and Lord Garmadon.

395
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,802
- [Ollie] Yeah he's mean.

396
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:36,114
- And so is Scales, huh?

397
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:37,605
- Yeah, 'cuz he's mean too!

398
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:38,855
- [Bryan] Yeah.

399
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:42,405
Aww. (laughs)

400
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:47,709
You killed the ride operator, Ollie.

401
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:48,542
(Operator moans)

402
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:49,375
Oh wow.

403
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:53,021
Who's gonna let us on the ride, Ollie?

404
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:55,279
(death sounds)

405
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,362
- Okay, okay.

406
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,599
- So we're at this little play place

407
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,816
called Pharaoh's Revenge.

408
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,035
And in it are these little
machines that spit up

409
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:19,449
all the balls.

410
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,038
And Fin is just doing his duty

411
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:24,705
and helping all of the big kids,

412
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:27,973
by picking up the balls and
putting them in the holes.

413
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:28,973
Look at him.

414
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:32,055
Good job, Fin!

415
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:33,171
Keep going.

416
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:34,004
Woo!

417
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:39,051
He's like, "I just cleaned up this mess!"

418
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:42,209
I feel like though, Fin is very
project oriented like this.

419
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,042
You know?

420
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:45,007
- He loves to put things in its place.

421
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:45,971
- [Bryan] Yeah.

422
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,756
- Check out this double decker carousel.

423
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:49,848
It's so cute.

424
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:51,148
Alright Ollie, we can get on.

425
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,226
We're gonna go to the top!

426
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:54,319
Alright, go pick a horse.

427
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,631
I say get that one.

428
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:57,686
Ollie's got the black one.

429
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,323
Fin's got a brown one.

430
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:03,490
You gonna ride one, Bryan? (laughs)

431
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:14,653
- [Bryan] And the horses
are off, aren't they?

432
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:16,489
- [Ollie] That spins.

433
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:17,322
- [Bryan] What?

434
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:18,155
- That spins.

435
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:19,554
- [Bryan] Yeah that's how it works.

436
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:20,387
- Yeah.

437
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:21,457
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

438
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:22,290
- [Ollie] Yeah.

439
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,198
- [Bryan] Let me get Fin going for it.

440
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:26,992
- [Missy] Whee!

441
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:28,689
- Ollie, did you have fun at Legoland?

442
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:29,522
- Yeah.

443
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:30,848
- Yeah, we had so much fun, didn't we?

444
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:31,811
- Yeah!

445
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:32,644
- Yes.

446
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,883
Thank you Legoland for having us out,

447
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:35,822
and for giving us an amazing experience.

448
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,505
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

449
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:38,840
If you did, be sure to give a thumbs up.

450
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,245
Ollie, thumbs up!

451
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,026
You are breaking all the
rules right now, bro.

452
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:44,210
Thumbs up, thank you guys for watching,

453
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,765
and we will see you mañana.

454
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:46,671
Ollie, can you say bye?

455
00:18:46,671 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye!
