1
00:00:00,227 --> 00:00:02,810
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:09,818
- Good morning.

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:12,682
- [Bryan] Good morning,
how you boys doin'?

4
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:14,240
- We're at Disney World.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,756
- [Bryan] We're at Disney World?

6
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:17,076
- Yeah.

7
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:19,659
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,077
♫ Wherever you are

9
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:26,483
♫ That's where I wanna be

10
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:29,262
♫ All it took was a life
and that soft sunshine

11
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:33,997
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and sighed

12
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:36,580
♫ This is home

13
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,873
♫ Just runnin' around,
you never looked so cute

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,743
♫ Huggin' you tight
givin' all I could to you

15
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:47,513
♫ I am home

16
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:51,680
♫ Home's right there, you're with me

17
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:56,036
- [Bryan] Look at your shirt, who's on it?

18
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:57,302
- That's Mickey Mouse.

19
00:00:57,302 --> 00:01:00,532
- Mickey Mouse, you got
Mickey Mouse too, huh?

20
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:02,709
Good morning guys.

21
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,182
We're up bright and early this morning.

22
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:05,147
- Good morning.

23
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,583
- Good morning.

24
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,230
We're gonna go meet our
friends for breakfast

25
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,521
and then we are gonna head
into the park all day!

26
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,368
You ready?

27
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:16,035
- Yeah, and I gonna
dress up like a captain.

28
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:18,001
- [Bryan] Like a captain?

29
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,834
- Yeah.

30
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:21,037
- Yes, Ollie may be
dressing up like a pirate.

31
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:22,064
We'll see what happens.

32
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:25,235
- Ow.
- Ow, you slept so good.

33
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,503
(chuckles)

34
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,086
(upbeat music)

35
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:44,958
And we have made it
into Walt Disney World,

36
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,709
and I swear walking in I had goosebumps,

37
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,026
and they're pretty excited too.

38
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,953
Look at that castle you guys!

39
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:51,786
- [Male Voice] Isn't that great?

40
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:53,943
- I just wanna go up in it.

41
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:55,582
- There we go, we can go up n it.

42
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,886
Look at this, it's incredible.

43
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,159
I feel like I should know where everything

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,548
is because I've been to
Disney Land so many times,

45
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:02,820
but I have no idea where I am.

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,255
It's completely different.

47
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:05,855
Bro, you see that castle?

48
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:08,438
(upbeat music)

49
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:16,273
- [Male Voice] Watch out
for the camel they spit.

50
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:19,950
- The camel's actually spitting. (laughs)

51
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,397
Ollie, we're gonna ride a magic carpet!

52
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,766
Fin has the biggest smile
on his face right now.

53
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:25,599
- Does he really?

54
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,740
- Yeah.
- Awe.

55
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,524
(upbeat music)

56
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,962
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie.
- What?

57
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:31,442
- [Bryan] Watch out for that camel.

58
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,038
It spits. (laughing)

59
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:35,038
Is he ready?

60
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:38,663
- Hey, say hi daddy.

61
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:40,913
- What, we're flying Ollie!

62
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,811
Let's get this thing higher.

63
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:48,351
Whoa! (chuckles)

64
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,555
This is a great ride to start with

65
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:53,725
because we can see the
whole Adventure Land.

66
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:56,811
- What do you think of that, Fin?

67
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,144
- Let's go down!

68
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:00,147
Whoa!

69
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,118
- Now up.
- Now up. (laughing)

70
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,701
(upbeat music)

71
00:03:09,786 --> 00:03:11,179
Whoa, what's it doin'?

72
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:12,085
- I don't know.

73
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:12,943
- Are we okay?

74
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:13,776
- Yeah.

75
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,764
- He's like kind of
freaked out. (chuckles)

76
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,700
Are you excited?

77
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,473
- All right we're goin'
down for the landin'.

78
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:24,473
(suspenseful music)

79
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,496
All right, we just got out
of Pirates Of The Caribbean,

80
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,062
and Ollie is all dressed
up like a little pirate!

81
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:54,014
Look at you.

82
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,887
Show me your best pirate move.

83
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:59,873
(chuckles) He's a dancing
pirate apparently.

84
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,960
Arrg matey! (laughing)

85
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,552
- I'm gonna get all your treasure!

86
00:04:04,552 --> 00:04:07,141
- I'm gonna take your treasure! (chuckles)

87
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,416
He plays the role quite well.

88
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,780
All right, you wanna go ride more rides?

89
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,593
It was really cool seeing
Pirates Of The Caribbean here

90
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:13,703
and how different it, it's
just cool seeing all the rides

91
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:16,298
that they do have in California
and how they're different

92
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,822
and then of course being on all
the new rides is really fun.

93
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:20,383
We're having a blast.

94
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:23,551
(upbeat fiddle music)

95
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,035
All right, we are about to ride--

96
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:28,020
- We are getting wet.

97
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,752
- Splash Mountain.

98
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:31,554
I told Carl I'm a little
worried about my hair,

99
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:32,746
he said, "Me too."

100
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:33,769
- I'm worried about my shoes.

101
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:34,871
- [Bryan] His shoes. (chuckles)

102
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:35,779
- I've got the tri-colors on.

103
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,019
This is nerve-racking.

104
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,067
- I rarely get to ride Splash Mountain.

105
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,040
Missy didn't want to 'cause
she didn't even wanna get wet.

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,829
I was like, no, I don't mind gettin' wet.

107
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:44,891
It's hot out here in Florida.

108
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:47,974
(upbeat banjo music)

109
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,000
And the journey begins.

110
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,394
Woo, oh, I literally thought

111
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:59,102
we were gonna go under water for a second.

112
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:02,185
(upbeat banjo music)

113
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:13,318
That's gonna be us in like 15 seconds!

114
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:16,246
(upbeat banjo music)

115
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:18,964
All right, we are getting
closer and closer.

116
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:20,538
It's a short one, it's a short one.

117
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:21,612
This is a tester.

118
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,677
This is a tester!

119
00:05:23,677 --> 00:05:26,010
(screaming)

120
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:28,421
(laughter)

121
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,254
- Oh!

122
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:31,986
I'm wet.

123
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:35,069
(upbeat banjo music)

124
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,335
No fishin', and then he
says, hey, no fishing!

125
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:42,458
[Male Voice] No fishin', no fishin'!

126
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,541
(upbeat banjo music)

127
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,818
- We're entering the big one now.

128
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,528
(upbeat banjo music)

129
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:54,430
It's really goin' up.

130
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,640
It's really goin' up there.

131
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,171
(screaming)

132
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:00,479
Oh my gosh!

133
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,359
(screaming)

134
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:06,392
(water splashing)

135
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:08,977
Oh my gosh! (laughing)

136
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:12,477
(camera shutter snapping)

137
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:16,606
They said you were gonna get a little wet!

138
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:18,044
- We went under the water!

139
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,685
- These got a little bit wet!

140
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:20,964
- Sorry Bryan.

141
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:21,797
- Oh my gosh.

142
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:22,950
(laughing)

143
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,346
My hair is definitely messed up--

144
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:25,179
- That was exciting.

145
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,374
- For the rest of the day.

146
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:27,409
(cheering)

147
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,121
So we are leaving Frontier Land

148
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:32,918
and entering Liberty Square.

149
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,305
And this is a part that we
don't have in California.

150
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:36,538
We have New Orleans Square,

151
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,768
they have Liberty Square,

152
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:38,714
and if you look over here,

153
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:39,869
this is actually really cool.

154
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:42,542
They have Hall Of Presidents over there,

155
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:46,709
13 flags surrounding this
replica of The Liberty Bell.

156
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:48,962
Check that out.

157
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,095
That's cool.

158
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:55,328
13 lanterns hang from that
tree across from there,

159
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,442
and in the Hall Of Presidents,

160
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:59,873
they have an actual, official
seal for the president.

161
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,607
They only have three places in the world

162
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:03,168
where they have that, two in D.C.

163
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:05,215
and one in Walt Disney World.

164
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,528
How cool is that?

165
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:09,111
(upbeat music)

166
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:19,577
Ollie, guess what?

167
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:20,410
- What?

168
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,846
- [Bryan] We're goin'
on the Haunted Mansion.

169
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:23,171
You're not afraid of that, are you?

170
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:24,272
- Yeah, I am.

171
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:25,186
- [Bryan] No you're not.

172
00:07:25,186 --> 00:07:26,330
- Yeah, I am!

173
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,645
- I don't know why he's saying that.

174
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:29,621
He is not afraid to go on Haunted Mansion.

175
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,967
This Small World is a
lot different from ours.

176
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:32,999
- Yeah.

177
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,630
- We have a huge clock

178
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,236
where the Small World ride is in.

179
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:38,992
This one's right in
Fantasy Land, right here.

180
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,160
I'm sure it is just as annoying, though.

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,121
- Is this (gibberish)?

182
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,934
- [Bryan] Nope, this
is It's A Small World.

183
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:47,601
Look at, we're inside the clock.

184
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:50,449
The clock is inside.

185
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:52,550
That's cool.

186
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,133
(upbeat music)

187
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:02,457
- He chooses Gage over everyone.

188
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,099
- [Bryan] Ollie, what's down there?

189
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:06,435
- Treasure and stinks.

190
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,849
- [Bryan] Treasure and stinks. (chuckles)

191
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,432
(upbeat music)

192
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:33,697
(upbeat music)

193
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:50,904
- It says, goodbye
Finley, Missy, and Bryan.

194
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:52,837
Ollie's not wearing his Magic Band.

195
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:54,115
(laughing)

196
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:55,261
It's funny 'cause a lot of the rides

197
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,697
use the Magic Band,

198
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:59,996
and they will grab it and know you're in--

199
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,233
- We don't even scan it.

200
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,638
It just scans it itself.

201
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:03,880
- Like when we were in Haunted Mansion

202
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,546
it said, and with the ghost
who was in our carriage said--

203
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,486
- Back to California.

204
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,902
- Back to California, and we were like,

205
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:09,884
that's a weird coincidence,

206
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,202
and then theirs said, back to Utah.

207
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:12,035
I was like, what?

208
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,187
- To which, I was like, oh okay.

209
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,033
- And then our guide said
they scan our Magic Band

210
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,551
and get all our information
while we're on the ride

211
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,930
to like customize it like that.

212
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,117
It's really cool.

213
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,700
(upbeat music)

214
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:34,648
Ollie, we're getting on a pirate ship.

215
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:35,481
- Yeah.

216
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:36,738
- [Bryan] And we're
gonna go see Peter Pan!

217
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:39,082
- Yeah, and I'm Captain Hook.

218
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,235
- [Bryan] You're gonna be Captain Hook?

219
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:44,402
- Yes. (background
noise drowns out speech)

220
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:49,076
- [Bryan] Yeah, Fin is
enjoying Disney World a lot.

221
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:52,069
This is a much-needed nap
right now though. (chuckles)

222
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,652
(mellow music)

223
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:58,832
Hi Wendy.

224
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,829
- [Male Voice] And off we go!

225
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:06,049
- [Bryan] Ollie, look at,
there's Tinker Bell and Nana.

226
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:08,632
(upbeat music)

227
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,676
- Ah, ah!

228
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:40,259
(upbeat music)

229
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:43,505
- [Bryan] We are in line for
the Seven Dwarf's Mine Train.

230
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:44,652
- I'm tall enough!

231
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:45,636
- [Bryan] What Ollie?

232
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:46,469
- I'm tall enough!

233
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:48,003
- [Bryan] You can ride the train?

234
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:49,112
- Yeah!

235
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:51,042
- [Bryan] This is so, it's
a roller coaster, you ready?

236
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:51,954
- Yeah!

237
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:53,684
- [Bryan] All right, let's go do it.

238
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:57,867
(upbeat music) (screaming)

239
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,389
- Oh my goodness.

240
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:00,298
Are you excited?

241
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:01,572
Are you scared?

242
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:03,068
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)

243
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:05,651
(upbeat music)

244
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,953
(screaming)

245
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,536
(upbeat music)

246
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:15,375
(camera shutter snapping)

247
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,474
(camera shutter snapping)

248
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:20,057
(upbeat music)

249
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,705
(camera shutter snapping)

250
00:11:26,705 --> 00:11:29,418
(camera shutter snapping)

251
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:30,501
- Oh my gosh!

252
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,306
(upbeat music)

253
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:42,636
(screaming)

254
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:47,104
(upbeat music)

255
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:54,218
(screaming)

256
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,656
How was that?

257
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:57,489
- Pretty good.

258
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:58,322
- It was pretty good?

259
00:11:58,322 --> 00:11:59,155
- Yeah.

260
00:11:59,155 --> 00:11:59,988
- Were you scared?

261
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:01,052
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (chuckles)

262
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,180
Do you wanna do it again?

263
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,498
- Yeah.
- Okay.

264
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:06,081
(upbeat music)

265
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:11,728
- Okay Seven Dwarf's
Mine Train was so good

266
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:14,027
that we are now riding it again.

267
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:17,104
Ollie, we're gonna ride
it a second time, okay?

268
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,364
You hear somethin'?

269
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,556
(bird calling)

270
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:23,389
(laughing)

271
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:26,257
Whoa, did that scare you?

272
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:28,840
(upbeat music)

273
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:32,980
(camera shutter snapping)

274
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,563
(upbeat music)

275
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,792
(camera shutter snapping)

276
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,012
So being in Fantasy Land, there are lots

277
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,864
of princesses around here.

278
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,055
Come over here, bud.

279
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:47,055
How are you?

280
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:52,692
(background noise drowns out speech)

281
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,949
- Ollie came in and immediately, hi Ariel.

282
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,782
Awe, look at her tail.

283
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:02,974
(soft music)

284
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:12,489
So I think Ollie has a crush on Ariel.

285
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:13,322
- What?

286
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:14,155
(laughing)

287
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:15,572
- [Bryan] He loved that.

288
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:17,579
- He ran in, and he was like, hi Ariel.

289
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,674
- [Bryan] Just casually
hanging out with a mermaid.

290
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,820
- You loved her, huh?

291
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,050
- Yeah, that was pretty cool.

292
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,606
When I found out they had Ariel here

293
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:24,798
as a mermaid, I was like,

294
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:25,701
we need to meet her.

295
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:26,978
That needs to happen.

296
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:28,498
Hey, Ollie, see that tower up there?

297
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:29,566
- Yeah.

298
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,488
- [Bryan] That is Rapunzel's tower.

299
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:32,846
- Yeah.
- From Tangled.

300
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:33,955
- Yeah.

301
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:35,096
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

302
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:35,929
- Yeah.

303
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:37,549
- She's up there waitin' for her prince.

304
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,416
Look at that, that's
Rapunzel's castle right there,

305
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,492
and I just realized too
we're surrounded by lanterns.

306
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,375
(royal music)

307
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,839
We have found ourselves in a castle.

308
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,339
(royal music)

309
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:57,462
Glass slipper, it's amazing! (chuckles)

310
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,110
Come on Fin!

311
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,693
Ollie, who is that?

312
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:03,578
It's Rapunzel?

313
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,099
You gonna give her a big hug?

314
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,535
I'm gonna go with you.

315
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:09,202
He's embarrassed. (chuckles)

316
00:14:09,202 --> 00:14:10,202
Hi Rapunzel.

317
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:13,957
(royal music)

318
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:15,810
It's Tiana!

319
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,605
Ollie literally just watched
this movie the other day.

320
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:22,105
(royal music)

321
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:26,898
Ollie, you got really shy, didn't you?

322
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:29,185
It's just a princess,
you don't have to be shy.

323
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:31,884
All right, we are now
riding Winnie The Pooh,

324
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,586
which is Fin's favorite Disney movie.

325
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:35,979
He loves watching Winnie The Pooh.

326
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:36,956
And look at all the honey.

327
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,969
Look at all the honey on his mailbox.

328
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,611
Isn't that cool?

329
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:43,194
(upbeat music)

330
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:07,323
Fin, what did you think of
the Winnie The Pooh ride?

331
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,291
He was looking all over the place.

332
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,730
He absolutely loved it.

333
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,497
Oh, it has a blanket inside?

334
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,481
- [Missy] I don't know.

335
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:14,602
- [Bryan] Somethin'.

336
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:16,373
That's a big Winnie The Pooh though, huh?

337
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,013
- Yeah, it's so big.

338
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:19,412
- [Bryan] Ew, you got a sucker?

339
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:20,896
- Yeah, can I have one these?

340
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,491
- We'll have one during the parade, okay?

341
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:25,074
(upbeat music)

342
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,137
So our guide has instructed us, Ollie,

343
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:32,073
that we are now about to meet the boss.

344
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:33,921
Mickey himself.

345
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:34,820
Are you ready for this?

346
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,653
- Yeah.

347
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:36,908
- Yeah, let's go do it.

348
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:39,491
(upbeat music)

349
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:43,187
- Hi there, come on in.

350
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:44,340
- Hi Mickey.

351
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,608
Give him a big hug?

352
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:47,253
- Awe.

353
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:48,238
- He had a question for you.

354
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,350
Ollie, you wanna ask him?

355
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,679
- (gibberish)

356
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,901
- He was wondering if you
could do a magic trick.

357
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,117
(laughter)

358
00:15:57,117 --> 00:15:58,552
- Well, I tried to do one last night,

359
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:02,719
and well, we found out the
sprinklers work. (laughing)

360
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:06,501
I think I gotta practice a lot more.

361
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,039
But you know what, this morning,

362
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,330
I got to ride on a great big train!

363
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,727
- Whoa!

364
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:15,367
- Hey, how about we pretend
