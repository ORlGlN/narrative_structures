1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:03,920
- We have a little
announcement for you boys,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,364
and the people watching this.

3
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:06,947
Should we tell 'em?

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,507
♫ Wherever you are that's where I wanna be

5
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:19,292
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

6
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:24,267
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

7
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:26,998
♫ This is home

8
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:29,912
♫ Just running around
you've never looked so cute

9
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:34,079
♫ Hugging you tight
cuddling all I could saying

10
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:37,979
♫ I am home

11
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,062
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,446
- [Together] Good morning.

13
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:48,627
- What is today?

14
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:50,015
- School.

15
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,308
- Today is school, but it's not just

16
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:52,987
a regular day at school.

17
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,366
What kind of day is it?

18
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,520
- It's share day.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,574
- It is share day.

20
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:58,701
And, it's grandparents day.

21
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:01,203
Which means, who's coming
with you to school Ollie?

22
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:03,429
- Mimi and popa's gonna stay with me!

23
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:04,885
(cheering)

24
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:06,576
- So I am taking him to school.

25
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,596
But then mimi and popa are gonna come

26
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:11,372
and they get to experience
school with him.

27
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,650
Which I'm actually really jealous.

28
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,221
I'm like, why isn't there a parents day,

29
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,705
where we can go and do
crafts with him and stuff.

30
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:17,923
They seriously don't have one.

31
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:19,061
Today is share day though.

32
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:20,911
And we never picked out a toy yesterday.

33
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:22,662
Alright Ollie, so what
is your letter today

34
00:01:22,662 --> 00:01:23,495
for share day?

35
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:24,794
- H.
- H.

36
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,576
And what does an H sound like?

37
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:28,266
(exhaling)

38
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:29,358
Good job!
- A horse.

39
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:30,796
- [Missy] Yes like a horse!

40
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:33,177
So we have to find
something in your playroom

41
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,668
that starts with the letter H.

42
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:36,257
Just like this little bag says.

43
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:39,588
And it has to sound like. (exhaling)

44
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:41,111
Let's see what we can find, kay?

45
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,441
What's that ones name?

46
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,274
- Dozer.

47
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,145
- [Missy] Dozer.

48
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:45,978
Okay.

49
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,198
Well Dozer starts with a D.

50
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:50,403
So that's a da, da, dozer, huh.

51
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:52,071
We've been lookin' through his toys.

52
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,865
Honestly it is so hard to find

53
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:56,825
these letters because everything just.

54
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,900
I don't know, you're
like nope, that's not it.

55
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,857
And like the other day
I was looking for an A,

56
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:03,024
and I was like, uh, a car?

57
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:06,555
(laughing)

58
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:07,460
A gun.

59
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,985
I think we found the
perfect toy though huh?

60
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:10,818
- Yeah.

61
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:12,450
- [Missy] Alright, show 'em what it is.

62
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,746
- It's a hamster.

63
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:15,513
- [Missy] It's a hamster!

64
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:16,914
- Can you say Ollie?

65
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,552
(hamster talking)

66
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,075
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

67
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:22,772
- Say you are beautiful mama.

68
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:26,045
(hamster talking)

69
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,848
(laughing)

70
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:32,119
- I'm sure his teacher
will love that thing.

71
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,705
- No I'm Ollie.

72
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:34,812
- [Hamster] I am Ollie.

73
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,464
- No I am Ollie.

74
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:37,927
- Alright, we are on the way to school.

75
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:40,461
But today is a little bit different.

76
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,273
Normally I always make Ollie breakfast.

77
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:45,323
And I've realized, that he
never ever eats his breakfast.

78
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:46,679
And I've been trying to figure out why.

79
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,163
I've been changing his different foods.

80
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:49,300
I'm like maybe it's this.

81
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,389
Because he usually loves breakfast.

82
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:52,717
And I realized that he just
doesn't like eating breakfast

83
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:53,791
in the morning.

84
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,494
It makes him sick.

85
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:57,400
Like he goes, ugh I just feel sick.

86
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,468
I can't eat it.

87
00:02:58,468 --> 00:02:59,575
And I was like, okay that makes sense.

88
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,407
A lot of people can't eat
breakfast in the morning.

89
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:04,631
So I thought instead of
wasting our time in the morning

90
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,029
trying to get him to eat his breakfast,

91
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:07,346
we'll just go to Starbucks.

92
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,983
And I was like, all for that plan.

93
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:10,933
So I've got Starbucks, he's got Starbucks.

94
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,579
And I got him a little pumpkin bread.

95
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,731
And this is very nice.

96
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:17,920
But one other thing that
I think is pretty funny

97
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,688
is that today, Ollie is going to school

98
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,727
and he's got his really cute clothes on.

99
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:24,563
But let me see your feet.

100
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,313
Where are your shoes?

101
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:29,604
We don't know where your shoes are, huh?

102
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,820
- They are stinky.

103
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,954
- So I really like to put him socks

104
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,340
and tennis shoes for school.

105
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,799
But I can't find his
tennis shoes anywhere.

106
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,458
And I'm pretty sure
that since the Johnson's

107
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,582
picked him up the other day from school,

108
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:45,891
that he must have left them in their car.

109
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:49,369
So I'm going to take him
to school with no shoes,

110
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:51,758
hoping that they show up

111
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:54,392
and that I can get his shoes from them.

112
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,476
But worst case scenario,

113
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:59,221
I can always just put on some sandals

114
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,970
that I have in the backseat.

115
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,515
Alright let's head to school okay?

116
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:04,746
Gotta get a picture of him.

117
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,035
We do this every time
we drop you off, huh?

118
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:07,868
- Cheese!

119
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:13,231
- And look what he's wearing, sandals.

120
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,776
What happened to your tennis shoes?

121
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,277
We lost 'em.

122
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:17,428
Jeffrey just texted me

123
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:19,789
and he's like, nope, I don't
see his tennis shoes anywhere.

124
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,527
So I don't know where they are.

125
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,122
So he has to wear his sandals today but,

126
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:25,393
that's okay huh?

127
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:28,143
(cheerful music)

128
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,504
Good morning Finney!

129
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:37,733
Aw, he's kind of in a bad mood.

130
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,602
I just got home and actually
went out with Kelsey

131
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:41,991
and we got a pedicure.

132
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,092
Which was super fun but now I'm back.

133
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:47,592
And this one's actually ready for his nap.

134
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,334
And look it, who's here Fin?

135
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:51,294
- Mimi.

136
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,313
- No.

137
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:53,519
Who's here?

138
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,473
- Ga-ga.

139
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:55,430
- Ti-ti.

140
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,171
He says, Ti-ti.

141
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,678
Auntie's here.
- He does it, I swear.

142
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,275
- Yeah he says auntie's here,

143
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,691
and look what we're filming.

144
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:05,712
Yep, I'm gonna be in one
of her videos this week.

145
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:06,962
And we're super excited

146
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:10,307
'cause it is a pancake, art challenge.

147
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:11,499
We just made all that pancake mix.

148
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,970
- We all know who's gonna win this.

149
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,602
- Me.
- Who's gonna be

150
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,123
better at art stuff?
- Me.

151
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:17,172
(laughing)

152
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:18,330
So we've got all those colors.

153
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,637
This guy's going down
for a nap just in time,

154
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,267
'cause now we're gonna film.

155
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,188
So that sounds good huh Fin?

156
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:25,021
- Kay.

157
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:25,854
- Kay.

158
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:27,774
I just put Fin down and got ready to film

159
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:29,441
and look who's home!

160
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,374
Did you have fun at grandparents day?

161
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,578
- Yeah!

162
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:38,501
And Mimi and Popa bringed
Mimi in Popas car.

163
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,394
- [Missy] Oh and they picked you up?

164
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:41,227
- Yeah.

165
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:42,358
- [Missy] So how did you
like having Mimi and Popa

166
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,191
at school today?

167
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:44,033
- Good.

168
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:44,983
- [Missy] Good.

169
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:45,932
Did you show 'em everything?

170
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:46,885
- Yeah.

171
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:48,006
- [Missy] Yeah was it so cool?

172
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:49,944
He's just so excited that auntie's here.

173
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:52,342
He's like, why didn't you come?

174
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:53,675
They don't have an auntie day.

175
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:54,721
- Is there not an auntie and uncle day?

176
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,048
- [Missy] There's not
an auntie and uncle day

177
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,695
and there's not a parents day.

178
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,130
Which I think is really messed up too.

179
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,380
And look what you did here!

180
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,911
(laughing)

181
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:06,994
Alright so this his family, right?

182
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:09,308
- [Ollie] There's flowers on it.

183
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,406
- [Grandmother] CJ and Berry.

184
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:11,671
(laughing)

185
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,510
- [Missy] So you have mommy and daddy,

186
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,122
and Oliver and Fin.

187
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:16,088
And CJ and Berry.

188
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:17,088
Who's Berry?

189
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:19,536
(laughing)

190
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:21,734
- [Grandmother] Did you mean Bailey?

191
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:22,685
(laughing)

192
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:23,637
- [Ollie] Look there's flowers!

193
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:24,585
- [Bryan] I love that.

194
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,535
Thank you Jesus for my family.

195
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,842
- There's flowers!
- So cool!

196
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:28,486
- Flowers.

197
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:30,206
- [Missy] Alright mom, how did it go?

198
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:31,968
- Okay, so it was really cute.

199
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:34,071
When we got there they started out with

200
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:35,797
doing the pledge of allegiances.

201
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:37,591
They did their share.

202
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:40,425
So they all brought their H share bags.

203
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:41,393
- [Missy] He shared his hamster?

204
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:43,837
- And every kid was so excited.

205
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,413
And then I even had all the grandparents

206
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:47,036
asking me where we bought it.

207
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:49,349
'Cause they want to buy one too.

208
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:50,661
- [Missy] Aw.

209
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,390
He's sharing your gift
on grandparents day.

210
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,259
- I was like, it's just on Amazon.

211
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,071
I'm not even sure what it's called.

212
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:58,835
I think it's a repeating hamster.

213
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,619
And then we all got to play together.

214
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:04,926
And we did some, like,
colored, and had fun.

215
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,286
And the last one, it was so funny.

216
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:09,490
We're like playing food games.

217
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,970
With pretend food.

218
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,408
And we're all pretending to
make hamburgers and sandwiches.

219
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:16,638
And then all of a sudden
there was a little bell,

220
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:19,216
like a ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

221
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:20,408
And I didn't know what it was.

222
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,087
And all of a sudden Ollie
goes, time to clean up.

223
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:23,734
He starts scooping things up,

224
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,382
putting it all back in the cupboard.

225
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:26,780
I'm like, what are you doing?

226
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,934
He's like, it's time to clean up.

227
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:30,009
And he's just making sure
everything is put away,

228
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,149
and closes it.

229
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,337
I'm like, okay that's pretty cool.

230
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:34,287
- [Missy] I'm gonna need a bell.

231
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,607
- We're gonna need that bell at our home.

232
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:38,357
Not a word was said, just a bell.

233
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,715
And man that table was spotless.

234
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:43,286
- That's so crazy.

235
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:45,093
How cute is that.

236
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:47,564
So you know what the bell means Ollie?

237
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:48,650
- What does the bell mean?

238
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,233
- Clean up.
- Time to clean up.

239
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,455
- I ordered one on Amazon.

240
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,074
(laughing)

241
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,022
- [Grandfather] We all need one.

242
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,067
- Be like, ding, ding, ding, ding.

243
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,206
That is so cute though.

244
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:02,397
I'm so excited that my
mom and dad got to go.

245
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:05,286
And I'm seriously bummed that
they don't have a parents day.

246
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:06,372
- Yeah how come?

247
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:07,322
We made him.

248
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:08,272
How come we don't get to do that?

249
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,513
- I should be allowed to see what they do.

250
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:11,263
- Nice new robe dada.

251
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:14,446
- [Bryan] Thanks dude, I
just put it in, you like?

252
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:15,718
- Yeah.

253
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:18,268
- So Ollie was sent home from school

254
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:20,018
with a little report.

255
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,097
Out report.

256
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:24,376
Oliver and a classmate
bumped into each other,

257
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:25,980
he hit his nose.

258
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,813
What we did.

259
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:28,539
Iced and TLC'd.

260
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:29,599
Do you know what TLC is?

261
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,553
- What?

262
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,758
- It means, tender loving care.

263
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:33,027
Lots of kisses.

264
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,383
What happened at school?

265
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,528
- I broke my nose.

266
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:36,750
- You broke your nose?

267
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,721
- Yeah.

268
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:38,669
- Is it okay?

269
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,621
- Yeah.

270
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:40,570
- Aw.

271
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,280
So apparently he bumped
into one of his classmates

272
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,414
and hurt his nose really bad.

273
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:44,524
Did you have to put ice on it?

274
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,650
Does it look okay?

275
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,303
- But there's no ice.

276
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:48,789
- No ice, no one cared.

277
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:49,748
Wanna show 'em your nose?

278
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:51,141
Look at that cute little nose.

279
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,095
- Right there.

280
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,150
- Aw.

281
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,206
- But I am actually fine.

282
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:56,156
- You're fine?

283
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:56,989
- Yeah.

284
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:57,822
- You're good?
- Yeah.

285
00:08:57,822 --> 00:08:58,655
- High five.

286
00:08:58,655 --> 00:08:59,944
So you don't need to go to the doctor?

287
00:08:59,944 --> 00:09:01,717
No, you're just gonna be
careful in the classroom

288
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:02,916
so you don't bump into people?

289
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,302
Okay.

290
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:05,938
Alright we have been running errands

291
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,593
and we actually just did a little bit

292
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:08,990
of furniture shopping

293
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,995
with Kelsey and Corbin.

294
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:12,640
Because they're still
gettin' everything set up.

295
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,097
It's so interesting though,

296
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:16,371
because I feel like they're just a couple

297
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:17,983
of years behind us.
- Yeah.

298
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,062
- What we were doing you know.

299
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:20,582
Renting their first house,

300
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:21,965
filling it with furniture,

301
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:24,270
eventually they'll buy
a house and all that.

302
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,511
It's just really cool to like,

303
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,319
be able to have them out here

304
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,073
and do all that stuff with 'em.

305
00:09:29,073 --> 00:09:30,131
- Yeah it's so cool.

306
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:31,082
- Yeah.

307
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:32,543
Now we are headed to dinner.

308
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:35,465
We are seriously so hungry.

309
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:36,518
Missy did we eat lunch?

310
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:37,914
- Nope.

311
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:39,400
I never eat lunch.

312
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,753
- I don't think I ate lunch today.

313
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:42,253
I forgot to eat lunch.

314
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:44,084
Look at little June!

315
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,190
- [Corbin] Watch your
food, she will grab it.

316
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,857
- She's sittin' in a high chair.

317
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:53,362
Fin, I need you to set
a good example okay?

318
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:54,541
Sit down.

319
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,623
You ready to eat some dinner?

320
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:56,571
- Yes.

321
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:57,532
- Yes.

322
00:09:57,532 --> 00:09:58,400
He came in and he was
like, where's the bread?

323
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,815
I need bread.

324
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:01,178
Can't function without the bread.

325
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:03,710
They have the best bread don't they?

326
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,947
That's a yes.

327
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:06,846
- [Missy] I'm so hungry.

328
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:08,845
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie.

329
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:09,816
- What?

330
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:10,763
- [Bryan] What are you doin'?

331
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:11,715
- Eating some dinner.

332
00:10:11,715 --> 00:10:13,687
- [Bryan] No but what are
you doin' with that straw?

333
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,864
- Putting it like this.

334
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:18,564
(laughing)

335
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:19,979
- [Bryan] Were you doin' a shooter?

336
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:23,074
Were you puttin' like, the
paper in it to shoot it?

337
00:10:23,074 --> 00:10:24,677
- Yeah, but it wasn't working.

338
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:25,627
- Oh it wasn't working.

339
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:30,046
I saw him over here, putting
a spit-ball in his straw.

340
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,628
Ollie, who taught you that?

341
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:33,137
- Mama did.

342
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:35,875
- Mama taught you how to do spit-balls?

343
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,845
- No, that was popa.

344
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,364
- I think popa taught you.

345
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,818
- He's always doing the
funniest, weirdest things,

346
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:42,674
and then I'm always like,
where'd you learn that?

347
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,808
And he says, popa taught me.

348
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:46,542
So thanks a lot popa.

349
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:47,491
(laughing)

350
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:48,441
Family time!

351
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,608
- Family time!

352
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:55,081
- So we have a little
announcement for you boys,

353
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,977
and the people watching this.

354
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:57,923
Should we tell 'em?

355
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,109
Should we tell 'em?

356
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:00,858
- Should we tell you?

357
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:01,980
(laughing)

358
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,662
- I'm gonna go ahead and let
Ollie say our announcement.

359
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:07,206
Go ahead Ollie, say the announcement.

360
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:09,241
- Our new song is out!

361
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,470
- That's right!

362
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,303

(upbeat music)

384
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,249
♫ We've gotta rise up

385
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,232
♫ And let the sun in

386
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:13,104
♫ We've gotta be strong

387
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,960
♫ Keep bringin'

388
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,234
♫ And take this shield
and we'll all be fine

389
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:22,480
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

390
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,519
♫ Let's live it

391
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,885
♫ 'Cause this is our tribe

392
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,063
♫ This is our tree

393
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:32,211
♫ We stand together

394
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:35,319
♫ We protect the kids

395
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,372
♫ This is our life

396
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:37,315
♫ This is our fun

397
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:39,122
♫ This is who we are

398
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,778
♫ This is our dream

399
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:41,961
♫ This is our team

400
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,390
♫ Shine among the stars

401
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,683
♫ Take this shield and we'll all be fine

402
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,359
♫ Take this hand and we'll all just shine

403
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:51,458
♫ This is our life

404
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,728
♫ Let's live it

405
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:55,705
♫ Live it forever

406
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:56,656
- I'm dying, stop it.

407
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:57,993
Let's do this!

♫ This is our fun

410
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:02,114

413
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:07,148
♫ Shine among the stars

414
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:09,363
♫ Take this shield and we'll all be fine

415
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:11,975
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

416
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:14,041
♫ This is our life

417
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,309
♫ Let's live it

418
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:19,142
♫ Live it forever

419
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:23,985
