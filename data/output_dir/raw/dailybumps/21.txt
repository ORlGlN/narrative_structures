1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,246
- But I have to tell you
guys some crazy, crazy news.

2
00:00:02,246 --> 00:00:05,798

14
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:28,376
- [Both] Good morning.

15
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,510
Ollie, what are you wearing today?

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,570
- Dr. Seuss.
- Dr. Seuss,

17
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,630
a Cat in the Hat outfit?
- Yeah.

18
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,720
- [Missy] And he's got his
favorite Dr. Seuss book,

19
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,060
and this is the Have You Seen My Dinosaur,

20
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,110
this is actually my favorite one as well,

21
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,943
we love reading

22
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:43,900
that one.
- But the dinosaur one

23
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,340
is my favorite.

24
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,410
- That is your favorite.

25
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,780
Today is Dr. Seuss' birthday I think,

26
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,460
it's either today or tomorrow,
or one of those days,

27
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,060
and so it is Dr. Seuss day,

28
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,480
which means he gets to dress
up in his Dr. Seuss outfit,

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,908
bring his favorite book, and
then you're off to school, huh?

30
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:01,370
(light, peaceful music)

31
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,120
Now that Ollie is dropped off at school

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,720
I'm headed in to get my hair fixed up,

33
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,710
I've got all my hair
extensions and some Starbucks.

34
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,120
I am so behind today, I
was so late to school,

35
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,280
so late to everything,
and I was up super early

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,340
'cause Finn woke up at 5:30.

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,870
But I've just been a little off,

38
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,250
not feeling my best today.

39
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,630
Hopefully I can get a
little pick up right now.

40
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,750
Alright, hair is done.

41
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,080
It must be so weird when I'm like,

42
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,230
alright, I'm going in to get my hair done,

43
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,270
and then the next clip is my hair is done.

44
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,440
Oh, I feel so much better.

45
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,010
I am still feeling a little off today,

46
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,860
I'm just so tired, and I
just don't feel very good.

47
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,600
You guys, I just got home,

48
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,640
and I've just been doing a
little cleaning and organizing.

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,330
P.S. here's the update on
my closet, oh, it's so bad.

50
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,030
A lot of this is actually Bryan's as well,

51
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,660
but this is all donation.

52
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,760
But I have to tell you guys
some crazy, crazy news.

53
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,606
Finn, tell us your crazy
news, what did you do?

54
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:54,452
- Pee pee.

55
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,285
(Missy gasping)

56
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,930
- [Missy] What did you do?

57
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,840
- Pee pee.
- Pee pee on what?

58
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,220
(Finn babbling)

59
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,017
On the potty?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:02,850
(Missy gasping)

61
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,850
- [Missy] Good job, did
you do the potty dance?

62
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,610
He's like, come see.

63
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,970
Yes, he actually said
he had to go poo poo,

64
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,274
and so I put him on the potty,

65
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:18,274
and he went pee pee,
yay, I'm so proud of you.

66
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,068
And he got a little candy and
we did the pee pee dance, huh?

67
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:23,240
(Finn babbling)

68
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,420
Yep, and we had to go tell Daddy.

69
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,250
It's so exciting, this is
actually the second time

70
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,450
he's done it, and I'm
just so proud of him.

71
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,130
I know we're not in
full-blown potty mode yet,

72
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,810
but we are very, very close.

73
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,570
It's exciting to do stuff like this

74
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,890
just to get him excited to
potty train, and make it fun

75
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,010
and not scary or anything.

76
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,210
Yay, I'm so proud of you,

77
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,630
you know who's gonna be so excited?

78
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,120
Ollie, Ollie is gonna be so excited, huh?

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
Honestly, Ollie is more excited

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,520
about him being potty trained than I am,

81
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,360
he gets so excited when
Finn wants to go potty,

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,440
or he actually does.

83
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,470
Ollie is more excited than
even Finn or any of us,

84
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,960
he's like oh my gosh, it's so cute.

85
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,000
He's a good little
cheerleader for his brother.

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,730
Anyways, I gotta get back to this mess.

87
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,430
I am back at the school to pick up Ollie.

88
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,150
It was so cold this morning,
I had a big old sweater

89
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,650
and a jacket, and it ended
up being a beautiful day,

90
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,200
I wish I could go riding, it's 78.

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,210
So I put a short-sleeved shirt,

92
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,340
just this light throw over it,

93
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,070
and it's so beautiful,
I just wanna be outside.

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,370
The fresh air feels so nice,

95
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,750
it's been a little too
chilly for California

96
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,000
these past couple days.

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,080
But it's finally time
to see my oldest boy,

98
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm so excited, I missed him today.

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,570
I think I'm actually gonna take him out

100
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,310
for some lunch, I think
he already had lunch,

101
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,140
but maybe he'll get a
little dessert or something,

102
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,810
and we're gonna hang out for a little bit

103
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,474
before we head home.

104
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:48,807
(light, peaceful music)

105
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,940
This kid did not wanna wake up,

106
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,468
and he kinda still doesn't.

107
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:14,935
Are you just sleepin' so good?
- Yeah.

108
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:18,750
- Aww, I missed you.
- I missed you.

109
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,140
- So me and Ollie have gone
on a couple little dates,

110
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,089
we went to lunch, where'd we go?

111
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,460
- To Free Birds.
- Free Birds,

112
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,380
and we had lunch, and then actually

113
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,850
really getting my nail
fixed because I broke it,

114
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,680
and so he sat there while
I got my nails done,

115
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,800
huh?
- And I watched

116
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
something too.
- Yeah,

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,370
and he watched something on my phone.

118
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,300
He was so good, and I was so thankful.

119
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,540
So now we're gonna head home,
meet up with Daddy and Finn,

120
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,100
and I think we need to play outside,

121
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,240
we don't have much time left,

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,580
but we need to play outside today, huh?

123
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,850
It's such a nice day, so
let's see what we can do.

124
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,220
We're home, hey Finn,
do you wanna tell Ollie

125
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,980
the big news?
- Yeah.

126
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,760
- [Missy] What did you do today?

127
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:01,370
- Potty.

128
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,682
- [Missy] Finn went pee pee in the potty.

129
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:04,950
(Ollie gasping)

130
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,420
- That was so good.
- Isn't that so good?

131
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,262
- In the little one

132
00:05:09,262 --> 00:05:10,962
or the big one?
- The little one.

133
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,943
Isn't that so cool?
- Yeah!

134
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,110
- [Missy] Yay!

135
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,640
(Missy laughing)

136
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,155
Tell him you're so proud of him.

137
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:21,650
- I'm so proud of you Finn.

138
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,840
- We have made it to the park,
and Mimi and Papa are here.

139
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,970
The boys are so excited,

140
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,610
we just have a little
bit of sunlight left.

141
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,443
Bryan stayed home,

142
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,200
he had a little bit more work to get done,

143
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,650
so hopefully we'll see
him once we get home,

144
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,130
but for now we're just
gonna play, are you so happy

145
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,050
to be at the park?
- Yeah,

146
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,890
and I'm talking to Papa.

147
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,047
- [Missy] And it's so nice outside, huh?

148
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:45,630
- Hello, hi.
- Papa?

149
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,647
- [Missy] Shhh.

150
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:53,564
(playful, upbeat guitar music)

151
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,640
- Does anybody want some ice cream?

152
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,990
- I'll take some ice cream.

153
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:01,778
Mmm,

154
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:05,310
mmm, oh, it was so cold,

155
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,776
I'm so cold!
- I'll get you

156
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:09,020
some warm candy.
- Warm candy,

157
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,470
can this be hot cocoa?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,510
- Okay, mmm.

159
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,582
Mmm, now I'm so warm.

160
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,140
- Yeah, I'm gonna get an ice cream.

161
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,720
- [Missy] Oh, another ice cream?

162
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,553
I'm so cold!

163
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,380
Oh, hot cocoa, oh, ooo, what is this?

164
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,386
- It's a special candy ball.

165
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:29,219
- [Missy] Ooo yum, thank you boys.

166
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,283
Woo, Mom you're a daredevil!

167
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:37,831
- It's so scary.

168
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:40,540
- Is that what I need to
get you, is a scooter now?

169
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,373
We'll go for a walk,

170
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,569
(speaking drowned out by laughing)

171
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:44,440
- [Missy] Oh geeze.

172
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,140
This is just a random
scooter we found here,

173
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,160
it's been here forever.

174
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,200
Finn, I think you're just too small, bud.

175
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,541
- [Mimi] Get on there and
Papa will scoot you around.

176
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,040
- [Missy] Is that fun?

177
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,873
- Yeah.

178
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,480
- [Missy] Alright Ollie, your turn.

179
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,170
You're actually a good size,
can you do it by yourself?

180
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,450
So you gotta push, oh my gosh, oh my gosh,

181
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,670
you just did that really good.

182
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,503
Oh my gosh.

183
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,760
You scared me, are you good at that?

184
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,590
Have you done that before?
- No.

185
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,000
- [Missy] Oh, can you
do both feet on there

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,320
after you get it going?

187
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,300
Get ready, push,

188
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,130
and then, oh my gosh, you
did it, that's pretty good.

189
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,150
You're gonna need one
of those for Christmas.

190
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,650
Alright bud, let's go.

191
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,138
- Hey boys, I've got a challenge for you.

192
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:30,490
- [Missy] A challenge?

193
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,090
- Their faces lit up
when I said challenge.

194
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,950
I think that we should all try

195
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,690
to fit in this little
camping A-frame tent,

196
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,523
you think we could all fit

197
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:42,539
in there?
- Yeah.

198
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,536
- You think all of us, even Luna?

199
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:45,440
- Yeah.
- Okay.

200
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,000
- [Bryan] We should try, k?

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,060
Alright, I'm gonna set the camera down,

202
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm gonna grab this piece of wood,

203
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm gonna set the camera down right here.

204
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,970
Okay, I'm gonna go in first,

205
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,860
ready?
- He's going in first.

206
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,160
You're next Ollie.
- It's so big

207
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,340
and spacious in here.

208
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,870
- Alright, my turn.

209
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:09,756
- Come on in Finn.
- Come on Finn.

210
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:10,898
- Come on in Luna.
- Come on Luna.

211
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,190
- Come on Luna.
- We need Karma.

212
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,169
- [Bryan] Come on in Luna, all the way.

213
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,162
All the way.
- We all fit!

214
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,910
(Ollie laughing)

215
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,960
- [Bryan] Now we're all stuck in here.

216
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,793
Hey Finn, Finn, go get the camera.

217
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,366
- [Ollie] You're not my baby,

218
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,290
my baby.
- Good job, Finn.

219
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,880
That is right, we all, including Luna,

220
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,160
fit in this little tiny A-frame tent

221
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,993
in the boys' room.
- I think we could fit

222
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,526
Karma in here too.
- Oh, we could totally

223
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:39,030
fit Karma in here.

224
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,320
But anyway, I think that's
all for today's video,

225
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,533
did you have a good day buddy?

226
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,040
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

227
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,873
You had a good day too?

228
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:45,900
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

229
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,220
Finn hung out with Daddy most of the day,

230
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,928
we just had a lot of fun, huh?

231
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:51,420
- But you did do a big thing today.

232
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,480
- Yeah, we're so proud of you.
- Woo!

233
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,170
He's like, I'm tired.

234
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,720
- Anyway, thanks for watching guys,

235
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,630

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,879

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,694

240
00:10:08,430 --> 00:00:00,000
