1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,020
- Hey guys.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,100
- So we thought we should
throw up a little quick

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,860
update video to you guys
on our YouTube channel.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,625
Missy and I are actually
headed on a vacation.

5
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:12,458
- Yay.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,070
- It's gonna be the first
vacation that we've never vlogged

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,540
or had to upload videos
or anything like that.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,010
- Yeah. Like we've done a lot of trips

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,490
and we've gone on a lot of vacations,

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,210
but we are not vlogging on this vacation

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,070
and I am so excited to have
quality time with my husband

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,990
and not worry about at thing.
- We'll take

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,440
lots of pictures and if you
guys want to follow along

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,437
with us make sure you're
following both of us on Instagram

15
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,670
at Bryan Lanning, at Missy Lanning.

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,700
We might be Instagram story-ing a time.

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,552
We might be posting.

18
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:44,710
- I think I'm sure we will be.

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,370
- Yeah. So check us out on Instagram.

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,630
- You guys can find out where we're going.

21
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,940
- Yeah. We're gonna
have a blast this week.

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,030
It's gonna be really, really cool.

23
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,970
The next thing you're gonna wanna do guys

24
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,966
is make sure that you're not
only subscribed to this channel

25
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:58,360
but you also have your
notifications on for this channel.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,790
And I'm gonna tell you
why for a couple reasons.

27
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,370
But first, if you are not subscribed

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,740
to this channel, pay attention to this.

29
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,140
If you are subscribed, just, it's okay.

30
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,040
Just like listen and maybe like

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,690
send a text message you've
been waiting for or something.

32
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,523
Send a tweet.

33
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:11,830
Okay. So Missy's going to now demonstrate

34
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,120
what to do if you are not
subscribed to our channel.

35
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,690
And I actually have it up
here on the monitor, too.

36
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,800
What you're gonna want to do is

37
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,040
find this big, red button on the side.

38
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,873
It says subscribe.

39
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,200
And it actually says 3.1 million people,

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,070
so three million people have
already done it so why not you?

41
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,090
So click that button.

42
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,630
And then you're also gonna want to click

43
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,220
that little bell next to that button.

44
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,640
So click that. Boom.

45
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,350
And that is gonna basically tell you

46
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,700
when we upload a new video, or it should.

47
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,410
It should notify you on your device

48
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,350
or whatever you watch on.

49
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,690
And you're gonna want this on
because our upload schedule

50
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,360
is going to be changing slightly.

51
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,070
Like we said in our five year Q&A,

52
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,880
we want to do some really big things

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,130
these next five years and
we honestly just need to

54
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,300
open up our schedule to
be able to have that time.

55
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,000
I feel like daily has been
super fun on this channel.

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
It's how we started.

57
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,960
But I feel like daily blogging
isn't so much a thing anymore

58
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,550
because it's kind of becoming
more of a harder thing to do,

59
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,130
especially in creating content,
quality content for YouTube.

60
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,260
So that being said, we have a lot

61
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,100
of really big things we
want to do this year.

62
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,350
We want to involve you guys and

63
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,890
we have some really cool plans.

64
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,670
So make sure you're subscribed.

65
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,890
Make sure you're notified
so you know what's going on.

66
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,850
You're gonna have to be notified

67
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,390
cause you guys aren't gonna
know when we upload a new video.

68
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,223
You're gonna want to see it.

69
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:29,320
But yeah, we do have some cool
videos coming out this week

70
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,360
and this weekend is gonna be a blast.

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,620
- And I just want you guys to know that

72
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,610
we have loved daily vlogging and trust me,

73
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,560
there is still going
to be plenty of content

74
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,940
going out and our content's not changing.

75
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,660
You're still gonna see all
of us doing our fun stuff

76
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,030
in daily life.
- [Bryan] Growing, adapting,

77
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,300
and learning and all that fun stuff.

78
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,890
- Yeah. And I will say that we
have mastered daily vlogging.

79
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,060
We've found a way to vlog.

80
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,893
- I was gonna say that, too.

81
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:57,210
I really feel like we have
found a really great way

82
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,330
to put a video out every
day and to make it work.

83
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,260
And it's hard and it took us

84
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,190
like four years to figure it out.

85
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,040
I feel like this last year I've been like

86
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
we've basically mastered this.

87
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,870
But in order for us to do anything else,

88
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,372
we kind of just need a little
more leeway in the schedule.

89
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,205
- Yeah.

90
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,620
We've found a way to do it so it really

91
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,220
does not interfere in our life.

92
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,498
You know, our kids barely
notice the camera and all that,

93
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,390
but we just, we want to do
more things, bigger things.

94
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,500
That's why we're gonna try
and change it up a little bit.

95
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,120
It's still gonna be exciting for you guys.

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,000
You guys probably won't notice a lot.

97
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:29,210
- But we just want to
keep you guys in the loop

98
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,050
because you guys are
awesome and we love you and

99
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,360
your support and we couldn't
be doing this without you.

100
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,980
And we're going to need your
help these next five years.

101
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,340
Cause we want to do
some really big things.

102
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,380
I want to make an impact
and I want to make change

103
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,190
and so we want to take you
guys along for it, too.

104
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,160
- But anyways, make sure you guys

105
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
give this video a big thumbs up.

106
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,740
- If you've made it this far in the video,

107
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,950
click the thumbs up button
so we know, you guys.

108
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,250
- Yeah.

109
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,270
- We don't really do this a
whole lot, but it'd be cool

110
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,264
to see how many of you
click the thumbs up button.

111
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:57,550
- Yes, of course.

112
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,890
And we just want you guys to know how much

113
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,330
we appreciate you guys
and we love this channel.

114
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,390
It is our passion and we are so excited.

115
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,394
- We're gonna do some
crazy things with it.

116
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:07,227
- So, yeah.

117
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,370
- As Missy gets tongue tied.

118
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,010
- Yeah. We are so excited to see

119
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,460
what the future of
Daily Bumps has to hold.

120
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,890
So make sure you guys are subscribed

121
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,470
and got the notifications on.

122
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,709

124
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,351
- Okay babe.

125
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:22,185
We gotta go.

126
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:23,018
We gotta get on the airplane.

127
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:23,851
- Let's go.

128
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:24,830
Alright. See you guys later.

129
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,663
Bye.

130
00:04:26,986 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
