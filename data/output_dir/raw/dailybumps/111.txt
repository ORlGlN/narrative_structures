(Missy giggles)

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,549

- [Family] Good Morning.

19
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:40,844
- Good morning.

20
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:42,427
Good morning family.

21
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:44,492
We are up in the woods living life

22
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:46,758
a little bit easier.

23
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:47,591
- Yay.

24
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:48,684
- Life just moves a little bit slower

25
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:49,900
up here in the woods.

26
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,303
We've been hanging out in our cabin.

27
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:53,814
Yesterday we went to the
tree lighting ceremony.

28
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:56,288
If you missed that blog,
check out that icon.

29
00:00:56,288 --> 00:00:57,583
I'll having it above so you can watch.

30
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,444
Finn, can you do a little dance?

31
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:00,470
A little dance.

32
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,433
Oh, oh, oh.

33
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:04,122
I love his Santa's Little Helper shirt.

34
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:05,185
(Missy giggles)

35
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:06,021
It's so cute.

36
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:06,947
Was that Ollie's shirt ?

37
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:08,373
- Yeah, It's a pajama shirt but

38
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:09,325
I think it's cute.

39
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:10,158
- Yeah.

40
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:11,693
- I think it was actually CJ's.

41
00:01:11,693 --> 00:01:13,276
- Aww, that's cute.

42
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,185
The boys have been enjoying
running around with nature.

43
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:19,349
It's been kinda nice,
they are kind of just

44
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:21,103
occupying themselves.

45
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:24,369
Hey Luna, you are kinda tangled up there.

46
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:25,691
What are you trying to do Ollie?

47
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,024
- I'm trying to clime the tree.

48
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:30,691
- Okay, well let's see
you try and climb it.

49
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:36,126
Finn's like I'll just jump up the tree.

50
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:39,293
(upbeat guitar music)

51
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,750
- So we just got to the park and

52
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,850
we are gonna let the kids
play and go on a little walk.

53
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,041
We just got out of the car and
look what we just realized.

54
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,603
- I'm wearing my handy dandy slippers.

55
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,691
- He is wearing his slippers still

56
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:54,524
- Yeah.

57
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:55,357
- Do they just feel like shoes?

58
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:56,190
- I just do it all the time.

59
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,962
I put on comfy slippers and I forget

60
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:01,273
and then I leave the house and
then people make fun of me.

61
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:02,929
- So he is gonna go back to the house

62
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:04,622
and get his shoes so
we can go hike a little

63
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:07,265
and I will wait here with the kids

64
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:10,606
and Meme and Papa and Auntie and Uncle.

65
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:11,665
You wanna go with Mama?

66
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,607
- Yeah.

67
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,112
- Yeah, alright let's go.

68
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:17,532
We made it to the community
Idyllwild playground.

69
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:18,674
Are you gonna play, play, play?

70
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:19,710
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

71
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,125
- [Missy] Are you gonna Play?

72
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,209
- Yeah.

73
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,788
- You are so excited, huh?

74
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:24,819
Someone took their shoes off thought

75
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,349
so I gotta spend ten minutes putting

76
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,010
them back on for you, okay?

77
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,303
(Missy giggles)

78
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:31,308
You ever wonder why Finn
isn't wearing shoes sometimes

79
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:34,156
it's because they take forever to put on.

80
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:35,429
Okay, shoes are on.

81
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,280
It's time to play.

82
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,089
Look at him go, look at him go.

83
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:41,791
Are you going to climb up?

84
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,643
- No.

85
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:45,293
- [Missy] No, too little still.

86
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:48,460
(upbeat guitar music)

87
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,830
Look who I just spotted.

88
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,000
It's Meme, wave your arms Meme.

89
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,741
- Hey Meme!

90
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,509
- [Missy] Oh, there's Ollie.

91
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,259
Dad will you push us?

92
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,709
- [Meme] Here we go.

93
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,309
That's going to knock you over, kid.

94
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:08,537
(Finn squeals)

95
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:09,993
- Spin around Mama.

96
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:12,615
- That that does not look fun.

97
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:15,005
- Uh, a little sick.

98
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,102
(squealing)

99
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:20,134
(upbeat guitar music)

100
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,634
Oh, gosh, oh gosh.

101
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,624
Don't throw up Ollie.

102
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:26,228
- [Meme] Are you okay, Ollie?

103
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:27,721
He is lookin a little pinked.

104
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:28,657
Are you dizzy?

105
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:29,619
- Okay, ready?

106
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:30,452
- Push.

107
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:34,684
- [Missy] Good.

108
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,171
- [Meme] Watch out.

109
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:39,338
(upbeat guitar music)

110
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:44,352
- [Missy] Alright, we do this every year.

111
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:45,519
- [Papa] Whoa.

112
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,657
- [Missy] Look up.

113
00:03:47,657 --> 00:03:48,925
(Missy giggles)

114
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,592
(Ollie screams)

115
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:55,269
(Missy laughs)

116
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,220
Alright, get out.

117
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,383
- [Papa] Wait, you gotta go
the other way to unwind ya.

118
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:05,205
Wait, let me get the
throw up out of there.

119
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:06,076
(Missy giggles)

120
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:07,119
Oh look, the got a hole for throw up.

121
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:07,952
- [Missy] Yeah.

122
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:10,283
For all of the throw up,
it just goes right down.

123
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,444
- That was so bad.

124
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,427
(Missy giggles)

125
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,663
- [Missy] Alright, it's Finn's turn.

126
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:15,831
Are you ready?

127
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:16,664
- Yeah.

128
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:17,853
- [Missy] Okay.

129
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:20,005
- [Papa] Now his name is Spinny.

130
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,001
(Missy giggles)

131
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:22,189
Not Finny, it's Spinny.

132
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:23,648
- [Missy] Spin.

133
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:26,231
(Finn squeals)

134
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,483
A little faster.

135
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:33,181
He is so cute.

136
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,233
- [Papa] Go spinny, go spinny.

137
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,156
(Missy giggles)

138
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:39,486
- I'm gonna unwind you now.

139
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:42,566
You won't be dizzy if
you go the other way.

140
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:43,923
- [Meme] We undo what happened.

141
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:46,463
- [Missy] Okay, let's see how dizzy he is.

142
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,213
- [Papa] Oh ga, what.

143
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:50,994
Look at that.

144
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,454
(Missy giggles)

145
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:54,603
- [Missy] He is like jumping.

146
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:56,041
Alright, Auntie's turn.

147
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:56,980
Do you want me to spin you
because I'm really good at it.

148
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,127
- As fast as you can.

149
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:01,169
I want no mercy.

150
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,919
(Auntie squeals)

151
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:08,618
Okay, I feel sick.

152
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:11,414
- [Missy] Yeah, we are not stopping it.

153
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:13,828
- [Papa] Hold on, let me stop it, hold on.

154
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:16,283
I can't grab your legs,
hold on, let me stop it.

155
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,116
Keep moving by. Oh no.

156
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,116
- [Missy] Okay, Auntie walk.

157
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:22,744
- [Papa] You gotta go down the hill.

158
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,389
- [Missy] Wow, you recovered nicely.

159
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,222
- I'm still gonna throw up.

160
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:27,646
- [Missy] That's not how I am.

161
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:29,030
Mom, your turn.

162
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,343
Dad, your turn.

163
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:33,010
(Missy giggles)

164
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:37,710
Can he hold on?

165
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,793
Auntie, help.

166
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:43,608
(Missy laughs)

167
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:50,779
- I'm okay.

168
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:54,801
- [Missy] Okay, spin, hard.

169
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,608
Go.

170
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,441
Come on.

171
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:04,932
- [Papa] Okay, now you
gotta get up and walk.

172
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,281
The best thing is to walk
straight towards the fence here.

173
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,406
- [Missy] Okay.

174
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:09,377
So your walk.

175
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:12,044
(Missy giggles)

176
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:16,846
One, two.

177
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:18,757
- [Meme] Why do you put
your head down like that?

178
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:19,590
- I don't know.

179
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,672
- [Meme] You look even crazier.

180
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,005
(screaming)

181
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,089
- [Papa] There.

182
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:34,245
Now let her jump upside
down, that's funny.

183
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,952
(laughing)

184
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:39,707
(unintelligible)

185
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,530
- Are you going to make fun of each other?

186
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,363
- I get very dizzy when
I do things like that.

187
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:50,091
- [Missy] Are you guys dizzy yet?

188
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,428
(laughing)

189
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,665
- [On Spinner] Okay, I'm gonna fall out.

190
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:56,165
- [Female] You can't fall out.

191
00:06:57,457 --> 00:07:00,571
- We'd thought you would give
you a first person thing.

192
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:01,892
Let us know if you got busy, or

193
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:02,900
if you got dizzy.

194
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,817
Wow, I'm still so sick.

195
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:09,480
(upbeat guitar music)

196
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:15,845
Oh, shoot.

197
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:16,678
- [Meme] Is he okay?

198
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:17,695
- [Male] He is okay.

199
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:18,711
- [Missy] Oh gosh.

200
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:20,804
- [Meme] Don't let him go.

201
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:24,045
- [Missy] Just let him go, he is fine.

202
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,665
- [Papa] Let him go.

203
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:28,355
- [Male] Let me go, I am good.

204
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:30,054
- He isn't taking long to recover.

205
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,095
(everyone laughs)

206
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,636
- [Missy] Climb all together.

207
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:33,690
There you go.

208
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,850
- [Papa] Now can you come over here?

209
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,696
- [Missy] There you go.

210
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:36,654
- [Papa] That one is lava.

211
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:38,583
- [Missy] Lava, don't let it touch.

212
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,930
- [Papa] Don't touch it,

213
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,091
can you make it over here to mom?

214
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:42,210
(squealing)

215
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,719
Oh no.

216
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,149
Alright, it's not real, it's not lava.

217
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,469
It's like jelly bean lava.

218
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:48,927
It's like lots of jelly beans,

219
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,234
don't squish the jelly beans.

220
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:51,106
- [Missy] There you go.

221
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:53,273
- [Papa] Careful, careful.

222
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,342
(screams)

223
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,175
You are almost...

224
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,613
- [Missy] What is that thing?

225
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:58,608
- [Papa] It's not really hot lava.

226
00:07:58,608 --> 00:07:59,441
- [Missy] Go right here.

227
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:01,349
- [Papa] It's jelly beans.

228
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,835
- [Missy] We are gonna have
to do a hot lava rescue.

229
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:04,972
(screaming)

230
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,574
- Jelly beans, don't
touch the jelly beans.

231
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,039
- [Meme] He is literally biting it.

232
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,400
- [Missy] Finn, You can't bite it.

233
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,982
- [Papa] We found a new way to hanging on.

234
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:14,267
See, you didn't think
of it like that did you?

235
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,100
No, don't.

236
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,286
- [Missy] No stop.

237
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,608
- He heard the word jelly bean I think.

238
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:26,898
- [Missy] Yeah, we told him
to grab his jelly beans.

239
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,065
He is biting the things.

240
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:30,110
Go Finn go.

241
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,596
Go Finn Go.

242
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:32,773
Whoa.

243
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,880
Are you going so high with Auntie?

244
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,463
(Finn Giggles)

245
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:39,764
- Yeah.

246
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:41,038
- [Missy] Yeah.

247
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,538
I'm gonna get you.

248
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,317
(Ollie screams)

249
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:56,882
- Ollie is doing a big boy swing.

250
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:58,333
- [Missy] Yay.

251
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,606
- I want you to do higher.

252
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,439
- Higher?

253
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,308
- Yeah.

254
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,558
- [Missy] Wooo.

255
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,784
Can you hold on?

256
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,460
- I'm afraid his little
bum gonna slip out of it.

257
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,335
- [Missy] I know.

258
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:12,502
(upbeat guitar music)

259
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:23,122
(upbeat guitar music)

260
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:33,916
- [Bryan] We are going for a little walk.

261
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,113
And the boys have found a log.

262
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:37,446
What do you see?

263
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,216
- There's a playground too.

264
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:42,004
- [Bryan] A playground, yeah.

265
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:43,743
- [Missy] Alright, we gotta
get a picture of Luna.

266
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:44,619
- Come here.

267
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:46,149
- [Missy] Come on girl.

268
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:47,219
I don't know what you want.

269
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,219
Go Luna, go.

270
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:50,505
- You're up, yay.

271
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:51,736
- [Missy] Yay.

272
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:55,816
Let's take a beautiful
pictures of you now.

273
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:57,410
- [Bryan] Whoa dude.

274
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,243
Good job.

275
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,501
Finn, you wanna try and stand on it.

276
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,516
That one is really tall Ollie.

277
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:04,349
Go Finn.

278
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,872
Yay, that's so cool.

279
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:11,055
They have these cool little
activities you can do

280
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:12,576
throughout the park.

281
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:15,985
This is seriously so
beautiful, look at this.

282
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:19,503
This is a little walking path
next to Strawberry Creek.

283
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:20,852
Do you see any squirrels yet?

284
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:21,685
- Nope.

285
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:22,518
- [Bryan] And what are you supposed to do

286
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:23,418
when you see a squirrel?

287
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,819
(animal noise)

288
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:26,973
Yep, you gotta do the squirrel call.

289
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,473
Don't fall in that creek.

290
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:29,306
(giggles)

291
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:30,335
You too Finn, okay.

292
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:31,678
Did you see any squirrels yet?

293
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:32,540
- No.

294
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,396
- No.

295
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:35,340
We found a squirrel you guys.

296
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,601
Well, Luna found a squirrel.

297
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:39,457
Oh and now the squirrel
is gone because of Ollie.

298
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:41,689
Luna, she found a squirrel didn't you?

299
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:44,413
She pointed her body towards
it to show us where it was.

300
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:45,691
She heard us looking for it.

301
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:48,111
Clearly, she is the smartest
dog in the whole world.

302
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:49,048
Don't worry folks.

303
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,018
That squirrel is safely
eating up in the tree now.

304
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,457
Oh, he dropped his nut.

305
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:55,518
Oh, he is like Oh, I dropped my nut.

306
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:56,831
(Missy giggles)

307
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:57,992
What am I going to do now?

308
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,285
Oh, did these people see me drop it?

309
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,014
This is so embarrassing you guys.

310
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:04,585
Dropped a nut right on YouTube.

311
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:07,752
(upbeat guitar music)

312
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:37,824
We are back from our little forest walk.

313
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:38,994
Back at the cabin.

314
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:42,946
Everyone is asleep or
relaxing or lounging.

315
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:44,943
It's like one of the very few times

316
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,929
that I think us as a family of four

317
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:50,070
have gotten to stop and just
not worry about anything

318
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,150
and just be comfortable
and enjoy ourselves

319
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,579
and enjoy each other.

320
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,504
We have been having such
an amazing cabin trip.

321
00:11:57,504 --> 00:11:58,726
This is something we love to do

322
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:00,840
every year up here in Idyllwild.

323
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,252
It's always a fun time.

324
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:03,965
We are definitely enjoying the cabin.

325
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:05,556
I'm gonna be quiet.

326
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:08,173
I'm going to let everyone rest now.

327
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:11,340
(upbeat guitar music)

328
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:15,388
- Whoa.

329
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:20,303
- [Bryan] It's like
cheersing your knuckles.

330
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:21,678
Good morning guys.

331
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:22,981
How was your nap?

332
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:23,814
- Good.

333
00:12:23,814 --> 00:12:24,647
- [Bryan] It was good?

334
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:25,620
- Yeah.

335
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,664
- We actually drove down to a little cafe

336
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,466
really close to our cabin and
now we are getting dinner.

337
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,460
And Ollie is obsessed with cheersing.

338
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,771
Hey Finn, how is that edamame?

339
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:37,637
- [Missy] Is it good?

340
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:39,064
- [Bryan] Yeah, he is eating that stuff.

341
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:41,886
- He doesn't like the spicy
but if I take them out without

342
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,919
letting him touch then he is good.

343
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,318
- [Bryan] Yeah.

344
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:46,151
He loves it.

345
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:46,984
- Watch this.

346
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:47,976
- [Bryan] What?

347
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:48,809
- This.

348
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,701
- And then you drink that, whoa.

349
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:55,535
And you mix em?

350
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:58,136
He is mixing lemonade and
water, ladies and gentlemen.

351
00:12:58,136 --> 00:12:59,773
Never has this been done before.

352
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:00,894
But will he drink it?

353
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,168
Did you drink it?

354
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:03,784
Prove it.

355
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,042
He drank it.

356
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:07,201
(giggles)

357
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:09,064
- [Ollie] It has chocolate chips on it.

358
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:10,081
- [Bryan] Yes it does.

359
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,573
What did you decide to eat
for dinner tonight, Ollie?

360
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:13,588
- Um, pancakes.

361
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:14,507
- [Bryan] Yeah, cause pancakes,

362
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:16,544
is that your favorite food?

363
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:17,462
Yeah.

364
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:20,011
- I mean Ollie is basically an elf.

365
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,019
- [Bryan] Yeah, I know right?

366
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,148
(Missy giggles)

367
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:24,286
Elves eat pancakes and syrup for dinner.

368
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,465
- Finn, do you want a pickle?

369
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:26,314
- No.

370
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:27,147
- [Bryan] We are seeing if Finn wants

371
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,836
to try a pickle for the first time.

372
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:29,677
- Try it.

373
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,215
Alright, you try it.

374
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:32,691
(Bryan giggles)

375
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:33,524
You try it.

376
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:34,913
- [Bryan] Nope.

377
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:37,197
No one wants to try the pickles.

378
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:41,014
- [Missy] I just made hot
chocolate for all of us.

379
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:44,648
We even got some for Finn,
Ollie, and Mommy, and Daddy.

380
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:45,872
Are you excited?

381
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:46,705
- Yeah.

382
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,148
- [Missy] What are we missing?

383
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:49,349
- Marshmallows.

384
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:52,087
- [Missy] Yeah, we gotta
add the marshmallows.

385
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:52,961
There is some for Ollie.

386
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,760
- [Bryan] Hot chocolate with marshmallows.

387
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,380
You can't drink it without.

388
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,448
But some people don't
drink it with marshmallows,

389
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:00,578
they drink it with whipped cream.

390
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:01,625
- I'm just gonna do a little for me.

391
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,458
- [Bryan] Oh.

392
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,182
- I think they are good,
I just don't need a ton.

393
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:05,714
- Let us know down below in the comments

394
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,124
and an the icon above.

395
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:09,129
What do you like on your hot chocolate?

396
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,289
Whipped cream or mini marshmallows?

397
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,563
Ollie, you're digging
the marshmallows huh?

398
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,453
This is our hot cocoa set up.

399
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:18,053
Sitting out back in the cabin.

400
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:18,971
Is it yummy?

401
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:19,804
- Yeah.

402
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:22,001
- [Bryan] Just take a little sip.

403
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:25,577
You gotta get a marshmallow, huh?

404
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:26,420
- [Missy] Is that good?

405
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,253
- Yeah.

406
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:28,423
- It is very good hot cocoa.

407
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,923
Hot cocoa is best.

408
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:32,613
- [Bryan] It's so good, huh?

409
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:34,321
We are also just sitting back here

410
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:37,326
and we realized you can
see the Christmas tree

411
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,330
right down there all lit up.

412
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,163
- Cool.

413
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:41,726
- [Bryan] I know you can even
see it zoomed out like this.

414
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:42,877
It's that blue spot.

415
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,632
- Come out here, turn
on some Christmas music

416
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:46,891
and did our own countdown to
the Christmas tree lighting.

417
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,141
- [Bryan] True.

418
00:14:49,024 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat guitar music)
