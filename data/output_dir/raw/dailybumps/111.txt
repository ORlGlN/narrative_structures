00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:02,373
- Hey guys, welcome to today's vlog,

2
00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:04,801
but before it begins I have to
a quick announcement to make.

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:08,356
Yesterday we put up two videos
on the Daily Bumps channel.

4
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:11,319
One was the vlog and then
one was the kid's reacting

5
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,655
to the I Ate All Your
Halloween Candy prank.

6
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:16,355
I'm gonna have the prank
linked up above in the icard

7
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:17,793
so that you can check that video out.

8
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:19,820
We filmed that today, but I
wanted to give it to you guys

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,325
as early as possible
because it was pretty funny.

10
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:23,362
Finn was quite vocal.

11
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:24,532
So go check that out.

12
00:00:24,532 --> 00:00:26,642
Now on to today's vlog.

13
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:27,659
♫ This is our life

14
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:28,984
♫ This is our fun

15
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:31,286
♫ This is who we are

16
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:32,420
♫ This is our dream

17
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,678
♫ This is our team

18
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:36,152
♫ Shot among the stars

19
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,480
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,459
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

21
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,082
♫ This is our life

22
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:45,071
♫ Let's live it

23
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:47,606
♫ Live it forever

24
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:49,427
Good morning, Finn.

25
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:51,849
How ya doing this morning?

26
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:54,349
Yeah, you're eating breakfast.

27
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,789
Ollie's clinging on to Halloween still.

28
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,238
(laughs)

29
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:00,641
Did you have a good Halloween, Ollie?

30
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:01,474
- Yeah.

31
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:02,307
- Yeah.

32
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:04,025
The boys woke up in a very happy mood

33
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,540
so I think we're gonna
go somewhere fun today.

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,433
You ready?

35
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:08,266
- Woohoo!

36
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:11,531
(Finn babbling)

37
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,463
- [Bryan] You eating?

38
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:13,799
- [Ollie] Woohoo!

39
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,641
- [Bryan] Look at those little waffles.

40
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,492
Those are just your size, huh?

41
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:19,145
- Look where we're at!

42
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,172
Where we at?

43
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:21,216
- Disneyland.

44
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,707
- We made it to Disneyland!

45
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,085
Are you so excited?

46
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:25,918
- Yeah.

47
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:26,751
- Yeah.

48
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,827
- A bubble maker.

49
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:29,217
- Oh, look at that.

50
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:30,760
It's a fountain.

51
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,689
It's kind of a weird time
'cause Halloween's over

52
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,715
but the holiday stuff hasn't happened yet,

53
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:37,721
but they're starting to let out
a lot of the Christmas stuff

54
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:38,913
and it's so exciting.

55
00:01:38,913 --> 00:01:41,930
I can't wait for it to be
Christmas time at Disneyland.

56
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,765
We're meeting Kelsey and Corbin here.

57
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:45,923
And we're gonna have a lot of fun today

58
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:48,946
because Ollie gets to ride
a lot of the big kid rides,

59
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:49,990
and he's so excited.

60
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,074
Which big kid ride are
you excited to ride?

61
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:53,356
- Star Wars?
- Star Wars!

62
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:55,760
- Stars Wars, he's super
excited about that one.

63
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,954
- They have guns.

64
00:01:56,954 --> 00:01:58,949
- They do, do they have guns?

65
00:01:58,949 --> 00:02:01,576
There is a lot of shooting
going on in the Star Wars one.

66
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:04,326
(cheerful music)

67
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,221
- There's Disneyland!

68
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:14,422
- Yeah, we got a very
special princess joining us.

69
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:16,339
Princess June, hi baby.

70
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:24,705
All right, you guys.

71
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:26,703
Ollie is about to ride
a big kid ride with me.

72
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:28,167
What ride are we gonna ride, dude?

73
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,105
- Star Wars!

74
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,811
- Star Wars!

75
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:33,122
We're riding the Star
Tours ride with my boy.

76
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:34,323
This is actually happening.

77
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:36,045
He's big enough, this is so cool.

78
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:37,878
He's so excited.

79
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:39,310
You so excited?

80
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,143
- Yeah.

81
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,105
- Are you gonna be scared though?

82
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:43,483
- You don't need to be scared.
- 'Cause Darth Vader.

83
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:44,599
Darth Vader will be there.

84
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,454
- Darth Vader will be there,
but he won't get to you, okay?

85
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:48,287
- Okay.

86
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:50,520
- As long as you're sitting
next to me, you'll be fine.

87
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,512
Headed in to Tomorrowland.

88
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,663
Honestly, these are
scarier than Star Tours.

89
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:55,603
- Yeah, this is really scary.

90
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:56,989
- [Bryan] They should not be up anymore.

91
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:01,102
(laughs) The seatbelt
functionality is lacking.

92
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,852
(cheerful music)

93
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:08,643
- That's Star Tours!

94
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:09,647
- [Bryan] Yes, we are.

95
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,480
Let's do this!

96
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,524
And look it, Ollie, there's
some Stormtroopers coming.

97
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:14,691
- Yeah, I see.

98
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:21,470
So Ollie, we are about
to board a spaceship.

99
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,303
This is where we board.

100
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,543
Isn't that cool?

101
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:24,376
- Yeah!

102
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,328
- [Bryan] Ollie, who's up there?

103
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,745
- R2D2 and a gun.

104
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:34,241
- [Bryan] Whoa!

105
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,522
- There's C-3PO.

106
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:36,852
- Yeah!

107
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:39,685
(energetic music)

108
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:52,979
- We're getting ready
to board our spaceship.

109
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,268
But we have our special flight googles on.

110
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,268
Show 'em.

111
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,362
We have to wear these in
order to be on the spaceship?

112
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:00,162
- Yeah.
- Oh okay.

113
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:00,995
He's so excited.

114
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:02,760
He almost didn't get on.

115
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,167
They had to measure him again,

116
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,477
but he's tall enough now.

117
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:07,955
Probably almost tall
enough for Space Mountain.

118
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,717
Or he can do Space Mountain, huh?

119
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:10,550
- [Missy] Yeah.

120
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,725
- Crazy, he can Space Mountain.

121
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:12,600
He can do Thunder Mountain Railroad.

122
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,608
- It's closed today.

123
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:14,493
That's the only that's closed.

124
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:15,537
- [Bryan] Oh, Space
Mountain's closed today?

125
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:16,903
- Yeah, but we can save that one.

126
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:20,486
- [Bryan] Yeah, he's
too excited right now.

127
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,901
(energetic music)

128
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:36,199
- [Missy] What do you
think of this, Ollie?

129
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,599
You got your seatbelt on?

130
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,099
Buckle it in.
- Good job, dude.

131
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:45,483
- Ollie, are you getting nervous?

132
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:46,566
He's excited.

133
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,429
- We just off the Star Tours
ride and it was so fun.

134
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:05,248
It was actually the one where
we go into the Death Star.

135
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,663
Hey Ollie, you have to tell me.

136
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:08,577
What did think of the Star Tours ride?

137
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:09,499
- It was good!

138
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,088
- [Bryan] What was your favorite part?

139
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:12,190
- The guns.

140
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,023
- [Bryan] The guns?

141
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:13,856
- Yeah.

142
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,665
- Were you scared when
you saw Darth Vader?

143
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:16,498
- No.

144
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:18,392
- No, you knew you were safe.

145
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:19,589
They have now just put us

146
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:22,506
into a Star Wars mecca of shopping.

147
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,805
That's what Disney does,
puts you in the gift shop.

148
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:29,115
Now he's like I want something.

149
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:32,107
Ollie, you know we get to go
to see the new Star Wars movie.

150
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:33,178
It's coming out soon.

151
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:34,957
- Yeah, I know.

152
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:37,540
(upbeat music)

153
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,621
- So we are hanging out
in New Orleans Square

154
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:46,748
while Kelsey and Corbin ride Indiana Jones

155
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:48,220
so we're watching baby June,

156
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,704
but we were just sitting here in the shade

157
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:51,846
and seeing the small amount

158
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:54,122
of Christmas decorations
start trickling in.

159
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,485
- Yeah, slowly coming out.

160
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,415
- Kind of like at our house I feel like.

161
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:58,248
- Yeah.

162
00:05:58,248 --> 00:05:59,924
- Once November 1st rolls around.

163
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:01,553
You see 'em?

164
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:04,527
Yeah, look, they have these
Santas hanging in the tree

165
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:05,976
and then they even have a
little bit of the garland

166
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:07,171
on the windows and stuff.

167
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:08,399
Oh, and over there too.

168
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,232
They're getting ready.

169
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,754
- The castle's already covered in snow.

170
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:12,750
And that's just like the holiday thing.

171
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,827
- Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.

172
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:16,341
- It's really cool how Disneyland
always changes and adapts

173
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,224
to the seasons and stuff.

174
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,458
Excited to see some new things

175
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,544
for Christmas here at Disneyland.

176
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,750
- Do they keep Nightmare
Before Christmas the same

177
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,378
because it's Christmasy?

178
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:25,994
- I think so.

179
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,360
I think so, yeah.

180
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,195
I'm not really sure.

181
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:30,770
Oh, maybe Jack wears a Santa outfit.

182
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,603
- Yeah.

183
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:32,706
- That would be cool.

184
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,454
- We've been here for like five years now.

185
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:35,330
We still don't know.

186
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,163
- We still don't know it all.

187
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,891
We're always learning all the new secrets.

188
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:39,900
Ollie, what'd you get?

189
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,733
Beads?

190
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,566
- Yeah.

191
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:44,437
- [Bryan] Whoa, they both got
beads and they're so excited.

192
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,983
We were listening to the
live music band in here

193
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:48,227
and they threw them at the boys

194
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:49,714
'cause they were having so much fun.

195
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:51,459
Getting a little taste of Mardi Gras here.

196
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,459
Finn, did you show June?

197
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:58,230
You like those, you like the beads?

198
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,860
(laughs)

199
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,277
This is so funny.

200
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:06,975
(upbeat jazz music)

201
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,746
All right Ollie, what
big boy ride is next?

202
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,767
Big.

203
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:36,600
- Big.

204
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,433
- [Bryan] Thunder.

205
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,266
- Thunder.

206
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:39,099
- [Bryan] Mountain.

207
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:40,098
- Mountain.
- Railroad.

208
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:40,931
- Railroad!

209
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:42,491
- [Bryan] Yeah!

210
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:43,928
This is another ride that he's never done

211
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,191
and he's tall enough for.

212
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,483
- One of my favorites when I was a kid.

213
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,471
- I know, all right,
check your height, dude.

214
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:51,038
Stand right there on the horseshoes, see?

215
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,794
See, you're tall enough.

216
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,007
Let's go.

217
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,590
(upbeat music)

218
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,332
- He's always climbing.

219
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:10,499
- [Bryan] Always climbing.

220
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:18,691
- [Missy] Ollie, we're about to go

221
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:21,050
on a big kid rollercoaster ride.

222
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,269
What do you think?

223
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,102
- Good.

224
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,228
- [Missy] Are you so excited?

225
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,061
- Yeah.

226
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:30,062
- [Missy] Yay, you're tall enough.

227
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:32,241
We're gonna go on Thunder Mountain.

228
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:36,074
- [Announcer] Howdy
partners, for your safety.

229
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:41,993
- Oh yeah, here we go.

230
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:42,953
Ready?

231
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:44,537
- Yeah.
- All right.

232
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,291
(screaming)

233
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,345
- [Missy] Are you having fun?

234
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:12,753
- That was so fast.

235
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:13,934
- [Missy] We're gonna go again.

236
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:14,934
- You ready?

237
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,952
(screaming)

238
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:30,096
(screaming)

239
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,004
Whoa!

240
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:44,627
(upbeat music)

241
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,207
Wow Ollie, that was crazy.

242
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,063
- Yeah.

243
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:52,360
- Did you see the dinosaur?

244
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,193
- Yeah.

245
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,315
- Then the explosion?

246
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,148
- Yeah.

247
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,161
- Was that cool?

248
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,384
- Yeah.

249
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:59,063
- You're not afraid?

250
00:09:59,063 --> 00:09:59,896
No?

251
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:01,167
You're a big boy, that's why, huh?

252
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,768
Always trying new foods at Disneyland.

253
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,645
Look at this breadstick, Ollie.

254
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:07,296
It's called a Tiger Tail.

255
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,443
(laughs)

256
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:09,823
He's not so sure about that breadstick.

257
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:12,250
Got some skewers there,
that's chicken and beef.

258
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,289
It looks so good.

259
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:14,582
- [Missy] You wanna try this?

260
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:15,415
What is it?
- I'm gonna try this.

261
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,165
This is Jungle Julep.

262
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:21,086
It's just like a slushie.

263
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:22,220
It kind of taste like...

264
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,176
- Just like a big slushie.

265
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:25,673
- [Bryan] Yeah, you know those
slushies we like to drink?

266
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:27,104
- Or Icee.
- Why you being so weird?

267
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,821
It's Icee, Ollie.

268
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,604
- That looks like a scorpion.

269
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,021
- No, it doesn't.

270
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:34,553
He's so funny.

271
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:35,697
(Finn babbling)

272
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:37,405
Yeah, you wanna try some?

273
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,243
Finn seriously just grabbed
the camera out of the bottom

274
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:40,834
of the stroller and then it turned it on

275
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,164
and gave it to me because
he wanted me to vlog him.

276
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:44,897
All right, what do you wanna show 'em?

277
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:47,242
- [Ollie] We are at Disneyland.

278
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:49,428
- [Bryan] He's being so silly.

279
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:52,761
You wanna go do a little dance with him?

280
00:10:57,468 --> 00:11:00,051
(upbeat music)

281
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,134
- We're home!

282
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:21,750
- We're home.

283
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,917
And what you don't know is
that all day I have had someone

284
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:31,376
in here cleaning my carpets
because they were trashed.

285
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,650
I mean literally trashed.

286
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,368
And not just from the Halloween party.

287
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:39,038
It was already so disgusting
for just from having kids

288
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:42,246
and living in the country and having dogs.

289
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:46,088
And it was just so dirty
and check out my carpet now.

290
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:49,330
First of all, everything is cleaned out.

291
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,654
All my couches over here.

292
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:53,965
But yeah, this walkway was so bad.

293
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:56,262
There were just stains
all over the carpet.

294
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:58,708
And over here you can still
see a couple little stains.

295
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,554
To be honest, when Luna was in heat,

296
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,891
she kind of made a little
bit of a mess over here

297
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:06,537
so that look like 90%
better than what it did

298
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:08,114
so I'm actually really happy with that.

299
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:09,883
And that's usually where
her crates goes anyway

300
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:11,768
so I'm not too worried about it.

301
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:14,194
But yeah, anyways,
besides that little stain,

302
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,555
it looks so good.

303
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:16,878
Check out the kid's playroom.

304
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:20,841
Which wasn't bad either
because it had a big rug in it,

305
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,521
but there were a few
spots where the rug wasn't

306
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:25,430
that was really, really bad.

307
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,342
Honestly, just from
having a puppy and stuff.

308
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:30,565
It's just been like. (groans)

309
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:31,418
The carpet's been gross.

310
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,159
I'm actually very much
debating just getting rid

311
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,619
of all the carpet and just
doing tile throughout the house.

312
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,540
Or maybe not tile,

313
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,093
but some sort of wood
looking tile or hardwood.

314
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,213
I'm not really sure.
- Hey guys.

315
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,046
- [Missy] What's up?

316
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:44,879
- Look.

317
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,928
- Oh my goodness, he did magic.

318
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:48,011
You're magic.

319
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:51,041
We are home, the boys are exhausted.

320
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,932
So they're eating a little
bit of dinner on the counter.

321
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:55,490
If you're wondering why
he's on the counter.

322
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,792
It's because he's eating
dinner on the counter.

323
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:00,125
And then we are actually
gonna get them ready for bed.

324
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,315
And they're going to bed.

325
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,434
They had a long day, huh?

326
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,847
And Finn wants to ride his Spider-Man toy

327
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:08,696
which has been outside, on
my freshly clean carpets

328
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:10,648
which is not okay so
I'm gonna stop that now.

329
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:13,350
- All righty, Missy is getting
the boys ready for bed.

330
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,718
But what a fun day.

331
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,488
That was seriously such a good Disney day.

332
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:20,542
The weather was perfect,
the lines were not long.

333
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,868
We actually used the new
fastpass thing on your phone.

334
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:26,354
You pay $10 and then all day you're able

335
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:28,309
to deserve fastpasses on your phone

336
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,850
so that was super helpful too.

337
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,780
So if you're going to Disneyland, the $10

338
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,979
for the fastpass thing on your
phone is totally worth it.

339
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,358
That's all for today's video.

340
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,562
Hope you guys enjoyed it.

341
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:40,427

Ollie says that Star Tours
is now his favorite ride

346
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:52,302
which I think is amazing.

347
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:53,368
