00:00:00,237 --> 00:00:03,121
- [Bryan] We are going to FaceTime Santa.

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:04,080
(phone ringing)

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,269
Boys, who's calling?

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:06,102
- Santa.

5
00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:07,458
- [Bryan] Santa, we'd better answer it.

6
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:08,737
- [Missy] Alright guys, should we answer?

18
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,137
- [All] Good morning.

19
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,111
- We are just waking up this morning,

20
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:35,164
and of course is...
- Morning.

21
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:37,678
- Day two of finding Fred.

22
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:39,563
And, we haven't found him yet,

23
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:40,524
but we're about to go find him.

24
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:43,522
The boys can not wait
(laughs) any longer, huh?

25
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:47,189
This will be the start
of a very crazy December

26
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,739
of getting up early and taking the boys

27
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,279
to go find Fred.

28
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,779
Are you ready to look for him?

29
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,346
Where are you looking
Ollie, did you see him?

30
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,775
- [Oliver] He was right there.

31
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,630
- [Missy] He was right here.

32
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,758
And he's not on the Christmas tree?

33
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:00,675
- Lets see.

34
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,325
He's not on top

35
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,408
or over here.

36
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:07,822
- [Missy] Nope.

37
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:08,935
- Not on the Christmas tree.

38
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,768
- [Missy] Hmm

39
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:12,085
- [Oliver] Let's see out
of the living room guys.

40
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:13,335
- [Missy] Okay.

41
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:16,382
Fred, where are you?

42
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:19,716
- Fred?
- Hey! (babbles)

43
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:21,581
- [Oliver] I see something.

44
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,748
- [Missy] What do you see?

45
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,279
(gasps) What's that?

46
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:30,170
- [Oliver] His reindeer and his puppy.

47
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,003
- [Missy] What is this?

48
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:32,396
Is that a marshmallow?

49
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,003
What is the marshmallow connected to?

50
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:36,209
(Finley babbling)

51
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,042
- [Oliver] Fred?

52
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:39,343
- [Missy] It's connected to Fred!

53
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:42,010
Was he fishing for the reindeer?

54
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:44,410
(Finley babbling)

55
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,928
He must've brought you some friends!

56
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:49,248
(laughs)

57
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:51,984
Did he bring you some
friends and some books?

58
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:54,562
Ollie, this is Buddy, your friend.

59
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,171
Remember you got him last year?

60
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,039
- [Oliver] Mhmm.

61
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,040
(Finley babbling)

62
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,873
- [Missy] Buddy!

63
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:01,984
And Finn, you have your
own little friend now.

64
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,290
Isn't that cute?

65
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,066
- [Oliver] Wow, that
puppy had to have been

66
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:07,241
(mumbles)

67
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:08,080
- Yeah!

68
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,946
So if you guys don't know,

69
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:11,183
Fred usually brings a
little friend for the boys

70
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:14,074
to get to play with and touch,

71
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:16,755
and they can rub the
little heart for magic.

72
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:18,552
We'll have to read the
story and remember exactly

73
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:19,646
what they're here for.

74
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,006
But basically they're just a friend that,

75
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:23,656
because they can't touch Fred up here,

76
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,467
they can't touch him
and that's kind of sad,

77
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,533
they can touch their little friends, huh?

78
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:28,366
- [Oliver] Mhmm.

79
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,297
- [Missy] Is that cute?

80
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:31,563
- Yeah.
- That's Buddy!

81
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:32,684
We have to name this one now.

82
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:33,873
I think Finn should name this one

83
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:35,562
since you named this one.

84
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:36,395
How cool!

85
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:39,860
Isn't that cute?

86
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,520
- [Both Boys] Uh huh.

87
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,660
- So you guys get to keep these

88
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,648
until Christmas, and
then once it's Christmas

89
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:49,433
he's going to fly away with Santa, okay?

90
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,266
- Okay.

91
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,424
- All right.

92
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:52,316
So cute.

93
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:54,622
Alright, we have to get ready for school.

94
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:57,389
My alarm is saying it's
time to go to school.

95
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:58,401
(Missy laughs)

96
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,026
And look at what the reindeer is wearing.

97
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,990
He's wearing a little outfit, huh?

98
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,823
- [Oliver] Yeah.

99
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:05,969
- [Missy] And check it
out, Fred matches them.

100
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,532
He's wearing the same
little pajama outfit.

101
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:09,583
How cute!

102
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,774
- Here, Finn.
- Mama!

103
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,447
- [Missy] I wonder if we
can get you guys matching

104
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,158
outfits with your reindeer and Fred.

105
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,523
- [Finley] Mama! (babbling)

106
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:18,377
- Yeah, a bear with a heart!

107
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:19,994
The heart is magic.

108
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:21,313
Can you rub the heart?

109
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:22,146
Good job.

110
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,331
And you get to rub your heart.

111
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,164
How neat.

112
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,676
Alright, let's go get
ready for school, okay?

113
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:31,676
(upbeat Christmas violin music)

114
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:56,913
Alright, we are all ready for school,

115
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:59,663
and the boys have their elf pets.

116
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:02,503
Finn is like loving it.

117
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:05,267
Oh and Finn's decorating
the tree right now?

118
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:06,775
(Finley singing)

119
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:08,024
And singing Christmas songs?

120
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,622
- Yeah!
- You're so cute!

121
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:11,245
(laughs)

122
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:12,078
Alright, are you ready for school?

123
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:13,768
Oh no, you're not ready for school!

124
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:15,042
Your hair's a mess!

125
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,255
We've got to do your hair,

126
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,212
And then we've go to go, okay?

127
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:18,045
- [Oliver] Okay.

128
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:18,878
- [Missy] Let's go.

129
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,813
Alright, the boys are saying bye.

130
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:22,010
- [Finley] Bye. (sadly)

131
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,885
- [Missy] Give kisses and hugs.

132
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,046
- [Finley] No!

133
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:26,625
- (laughs) Finn's a little sad

134
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,065
that you're leaving, huh?

135
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:29,548
But you're going to have a fun day.

136
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:32,715
(upbeat guitar music)

137
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,948
Are you excited for school, Ollie?

138
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:37,276
- [Oliver] Yeah.

139
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,443
(upbeat guitar music)

140
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,102
- So I just dropped off Ollie at school

141
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,623
and I have a ton of errands to run,

142
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,364
one of them being I have
to get an oil change,

143
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:54,170
which always takes up so much of my day.

144
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,277
But with Exxon Mobile they
have recently launched

145
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:00,747
Mobil 1 Annual Protection
Motor Oil changes.

146
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:03,511
So with Mobile 1 Annual
Protection Motor Oil,

147
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,027
it guarantees one full year of driving,

148
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:09,882
or 20,000 miles in
between every oil change.

149
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:12,371
With having to get only
one oil change a year,

150
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,189
this gives me so much more time

151
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,475
to do so many fun things with Ollie.

152
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:19,058
(upbeat music)

153
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,908
- I love it!
- Do you like that?

154
00:05:27,908 --> 00:05:28,854
- Yeah!

155
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,164
- Mobile 1 Annual
Protection is available at

156
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,723
Wal Mart and select auto parts stores.

157
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:35,533
This video is sponsored by Exxon Mobile,

158
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,143
and if you would like to get information

159
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:39,129
on only having to get
one oil change a year,

160
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,705
click the link down below.

161
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,818
- Good morning you guys!

162
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:47,165
♪ It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas ♪

163
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:48,743
Check out this awesome sleigh

164
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:53,139
and this Santa was apparently
hand-crafted in Napal.

165
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,516
This is how we do Christmas you guys.

166
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,753
Missy and I are obsessed,
you guys know that.

167
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:59,046
But I am also really excited because

168
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:02,198
I got invited to the Grammy's, you guys.

169
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:04,876
This is a Grammy invitation
that was sent to me.

170
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:08,740
It's the 60th Annual
Grammy Awards in January,

171
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,451
in New York City.

172
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:13,647
Look at this, this invitation is crazy.

173
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,629
I am so excited.

174
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:16,891
Missy and I are going
to try and get tickets

175
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:19,986
this year, so that we can
have a birthday celebration

176
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:21,997
for me in January and go to New York

177
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:23,744
and see the awards show.

178
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:25,667
I think that would be amazing,

179
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,097
and definitely like a bucket list thing

180
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:28,782
that we've always wanted to do.

181
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,850
But as for right now,
I am waiting for Finn

182
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,359
to wake up from his nap.

183
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,648
Missy's out running errands with Ollie,

184
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:35,126
they're having a super fun day.

185
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:36,925
And it's nice to be back in the house

186
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,166
after our little cabin get away.

187
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,767
I'm enjoying being back
home and being back

188
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,685
in the swing of things.

189
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:45,685
(upbeat Christmas violin music)

190
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:51,446
I was just looking out my office window.

191
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:53,239
Look at these trees!

192
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,057
They're basically brown.

193
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:56,964
These two trees are going to be bare,

194
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:58,687
I'm calling it, by the end of the week.

195
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,051
All of those leaves will be on the ground.

196
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:02,014
We've been getting so many lately.

197
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,665
All of our trees in the pasture over there

198
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,849
have turned brown.

199
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,174
It's getting to be that
time in California.

200
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,433
I know we're a little late.

201
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:10,346
Everywhere else it's
snowing and dead trees.

202
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,794
We just had a hot week, okay?

203
00:07:11,794 --> 00:07:13,430
I'm feeling great that its, what is it?

204
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,299
Oh here.

205
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,760
Hey Siri, what's the temperature?

206
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,252
71 degrees right now, 71 degrees.

207
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:21,275
That's not very Christmas-y.

208
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,318
Alright you guys,

209
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,735
Only 26 days until Christmas!

210
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,250
- Yeah!
- Are you so excited, Finn?

211
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,083
- Yeah.
- Yes.

212
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,837
Finn is still rocking his

213
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,038
Elf on the Shelf pajamas because he is

214
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,150
so excited that Elf on the
Shelf is back, aren't you?

215
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,914
Yeah, you got the Elf?

216
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,892
- Yeah.
- Nice. (laughs)

217
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,213
He's just chilling', watching
some Christmas shows,

218
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:41,637
playing with his toys.

219
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:43,193
Did you have a good nap?
- Yeah.

220
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:45,782
- You guys, he slept in Ollie's bed

221
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,409
for nap time, and he did so good.

222
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,945
Was Ollie's bed comfy, Finn?

223
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,271
- Yeah.
- It was?

224
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,104
- Yeah.

225
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,115
- [Bryan] Yeah, so Finn slept
so good in Ollie's room,

226
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:55,319
which just makes me think
that we should definitely

227
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,101
be getting the room ready for both boys,

228
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,996
because we want both boys to
share that room eventually.

229
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,496
They do night time already in that room.

230
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,221
They read books, and then
they just go to their

231
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:05,401
separate beds.

232
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,602
So, we may be doing that soon. Hopefully.

233
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:10,179
I'm still kind of in shock
about our entire house

234
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,910
is decorated for Christmas already.

235
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,811
You guys did not see the
surprise yesterday with Fred,

236
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,609
I'll have it linked above
so you can watch it.

237
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,541
What're you doing?

238
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,152
(Finley babbling)

239
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:20,386
- (laughs) Oh really?

240
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,040
You doing the splits?

241
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,324
(Bryan laughs)

242
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:25,241
What is this kid up to?

243
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:28,576
Oh no, pick up your car!

244
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,934
(Bryan laughs)

245
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:32,101
He's so funny.

246
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,111
Where are you going?

247
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:39,111
(upbeat Christmas violin music)

248
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:44,154
Welcome home Ollie!

249
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:45,210
Hey, guess what boys.

250
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,043
- What?

251
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,862
- I just got a text message from Santa,

252
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,038
not kidding, he said he wants
to check in on you guys.

253
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:52,181
Does that sound cool?

254
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,165
I love technology you guys.

255
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:56,748
We are going to FaceTime Santa.

256
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,039
- Are you excited?

257
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,116
Are you nervous?
- Yeah.

258
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:01,160
- [Bryan] What if you've been naughty?

259
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,703
Have you been naughty or nice?

260
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:03,564
- Nice.

261
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:04,874
- [Bryan] Nice, well make
sure you tell Santa that

262
00:09:04,874 --> 00:09:05,888
if he asks you, okay?

263
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:06,758
- [Oliver] Okay.

264
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:08,928
- [Bryan] Okay, Finn, you say
nice if he asks you, okay?

265
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,304
You guys have been
really good and he knows.

266
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:14,302
- Nice boys, they have
been really good boys.

267
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:15,500
- [Bryan] Yes, they have.

268
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,333
(ringing sound)

269
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,483
Boys, who's calling?

270
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:18,316
- Santa!

271
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,371
- [Bryan] Santa! We'd better answer it!

272
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:20,492
- [Missy] Alright guys, should we answer?

273
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:21,325
- [Oliver] Yeah.

274
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,377
- [Missy] Press the green button.

275
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,325
- Hello there!

276
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:27,859
Merry Christmas, ho ho ho!

277
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,214
- [Bryan] Say hi, Ollie.

278
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,047
- Hi!

279
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:31,448
- I know who you are,

280
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:34,014
you are Oliver, aren't you?

281
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:36,241
- (gasps) Oh my gosh!

282
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,039
- Have you been naughty or nice this year?

283
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,984
- Nice!

284
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,901
- Ho ho ho, fantastic!

285
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:47,914
Now tell me, what do
you want for Christmas?

286
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,387
- [Bryan] What do you want for Christmas?

287
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:52,039
- A truck.
- You want a truck?

288
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,206
- Say it again.
- A truck!

289
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:57,795
- Ho ho okay, got it!

290
00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:00,843
I will see you soon, Merry Christmas!

291
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:02,203
- Say bye, boys!
- And bye bye!

292
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:03,188
- [Oliver, Missy, And Finley] Bye!

293
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:04,105
- Ho ho ho!

294
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,683
(Missy laughs)

295
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:07,516
- [Bryan] What!

296
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,127
- [Missy] Ollie, did
you just talk to Santa?

297
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:09,960
- Ollie, you just talked to Santa!

298
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,953
- And he knew your name!

299
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:13,369
- [Bryan] How cool was that, Ollie?

300
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:14,202
- Yeah!

301
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:16,159
- Oh my gosh, so cool!

302
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,250
- [Bryan] Maybe we should
call Santa a couple of times

303
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,673
and just see how things
are going with him, huh?

304
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:20,506
- Yeah.

305
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:22,202
- Yeah, before Christmas we'll talk to him

306
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:23,164
a couple more times, okay?

307
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,349
That was so cute!

308
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,415
The boys just Face Timed Santa!

309
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:28,115
(Finley babbles)

310
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:30,747
Yeah, and you told him you want a truck?

311
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:32,044
You got a little nervous, is that really

00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:32,942

313
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:33,775
(phone ringing)

314
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:34,720
Is he calling again?

315
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,921
- He's calling again!
- He butt dialed us.

316
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:36,957
It's okay, Santa butt dialed us.

317
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:38,447
(laughs)

318
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:39,283
Is that really what you
want for Christmas Ollie,

319
00:10:39,283 --> 00:10:40,173
a truck?

320
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,006
- Mhmm.
- Okay.

321
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:42,563
- Yeah? Alright.
- And you also want like that

322
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:45,959

323
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,216
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

324
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:48,470
- Yeah, I want that one.

325
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,863
(Missy laughs)

326
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:50,802
- [Bryan] Finn, next time we talk to him

327
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,655
you have to tell him what
you want for Christmas, okay?

328
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:53,488
- What do you want for Christmas?

329
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:56,488
- Maybe Finn wants a new baby bottle

330
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,135
with two (mumbles), it's a baby bottle.

331
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:02,160
(Missy laughs)

332
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,993
- A baby bottle?

333
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:04,498
Oh, he wants the Baby Bottle Pop?

334
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,590
The candy?
- Oh yeah. (laughs)

335
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,507
- Finn likes that, he sure does.

336
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,486
That was so special, we
got to talk to Santa!

337
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:11,934
(Missy awes)

338
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:13,363
You did really good, dude!

339
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:14,196
- Yeah.

340
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:15,629
That Power Ranger was so cool,

341
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,316
I want to call him one more time.

342
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:19,299
- You want to tell him now what you want?

343
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,174
- Okay, now that Ollie really knows

344
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,821
what he wants for Christmas,
we'll have to call him

345
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:24,380

346
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,445
- Okay.
- Okay.

347
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:26,714
You've got to smile, smile!

348
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:28,908
You've got to be happy!

349
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:29,957
I love that face.

350
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,303
Oh he's hugging you guys.

351
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:33,588
This is what it's like to hug Ollie.

352
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:34,864
Alright you guys, I just got another

353
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,007
text message from Santa.

354
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:38,511
He said he's super
bummed, he didn't see Finn

355
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,357
sitting next to Ollie, so
he's going to call back

356
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:42,647

- Yeah!

359
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,360
You can talk to him again.

360
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,557
- He's calling!
- He's calling!

361
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:51,140
Can you press the green button?

362
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,932
- Hello, there!

363
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:54,897
Merry Christmas!

364
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:55,897
Ho ho ho ho!

365
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:59,452
I know who you are.

366
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,751
You are Finn, aren't you?

367
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:02,584
- Yeah!

368
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:04,907
- So, I've been watching you from the

369
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:06,648
North Pole lately.
- He's been watching you.

370
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:08,612
- And I found out that you haven't been

371
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:10,907
going to bed on time.

372
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:12,839
I'm a bit disappointed,

373
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,051
but I want you to promise me that you will

374
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:19,772
go to bed on time from now on,
and listen to your parents.

375
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,701
- Say okay.
- Will you promise?

376
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:22,618
- Say yeah.

377
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:26,575
- Fantastic!

378
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:31,448
Now tell me, what do
you want for Christmas?

379
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:34,351
- What do you want?
- Tell him, Finn!

380
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:38,210
- Say candy!
- Okay can you say that again?

381
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,877
- [Bryan] Say candy!

382
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,303
He's shy, he wants candy.
- Okay, got it!

383
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:46,506
I will see you very soon!

384
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,563
Merry Christmas and bye-bye!

385
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:50,059
- [Bryan And Missy Together] Say bye!

386
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:50,976
- Ho ho ho!

387
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,475
- [Bryan] Santa had to call
you, Finn, and let you know--

388
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,308
- Was that so cool?

389
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:58,849
- [Bryan] he's been watching you.

390
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:01,740
- Yay, he was so nervous and so shy.

391
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,236
It was so cute.

392
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:04,465
Was that exciting?

393
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:05,479
- [Finley] Yeah.

394
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:09,479
(upbeat Christmas violin music)

395
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:13,950
- Come here, buddy!

396
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,975
Come here!

397
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:15,998
Climb!

398
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:17,307
Come to daddy!

399
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:18,140
Oh hey.

400
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:20,764
- Hey.
- We meet again.

401
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:22,269
That time of day, huh?

402
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,102
- [Oliver] Yeah.

403
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:23,989
- Did you have a fun day?

404
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:25,396
- Yeah.
- Yes.

405
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:27,820
So we just went on a little
night out with the boys,

406
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,088
we went and saw the movie
Coco, what did you think?

407
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:31,531

00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:32,956
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

409
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:34,152
Ollie, did you have a fun day?

410
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:35,029
- Yeah.

411
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,853
- It was so cool that
Santa Face Timed you.

412
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,821
Wasn't that neat?

413
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:42,077
- But we forgot to say
I want to see Santa.

414
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:46,725
Now I need forever to
drive to his (mumbles).

415
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,319
- You want to go see him for real?

416
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,526
- Yeah.
- Well, guess what?

417
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:51,130
- What?
- We're going to do that okay?

418
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,462
- Okay.
- Okay.

419
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:53,815
We're going to get you out of school,

420
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:55,075
and then we're going to go see Santa.

421
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:55,912
Does that sound fun?

422
00:13:55,912 --> 00:13:57,927
