What do you think it is?

4
00:00:07,736 --> 00:00:09,640
Do you think it's a dinosaur?

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,473
- I think so. (gasps)

00:00:10,473 --> 00:00:11,687

- Good morning guys and
welcome to today's video.

19
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,060
Today we are going on a
little family adventure

20
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,960
and Missy and I have something that we are

21
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,800
very excited to share with you guys,

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,180
a very big project that
we've been working on

23
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,110
for almost over a year now.

24
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,820
We're gonna reveal to
you guys in this vlog.

25
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,230
So be sure to click that thumbs up button

26
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,810
if you guys are excited
to learn what that is

27
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,890
but for right now we
are headed to the barn

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,500
and Missy's gonna throw me on a horse

29
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,398
and we're gonna trail ride for
just like 20 or 30 minutes.

30
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:01,231
(Finn babbling)

31
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:02,780
Good morning Finn.

32
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,337
You excited to go to the barn?

33
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:05,369
- Yeah.
- Daddy.

34
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,050
- [Bryan] Good morning dude.

35
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,640
Ollie who's in our car with us?

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,140
- Karma.
- That's right.

37
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,990
Karma is headed to the barn with us.

38
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,070
Hi Karma boy.

39
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,450
He's like I don't know what I was doing

40
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,130
but yeah mom put me in the car.

41
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,253
Guess I'm going somewhere.

42
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:19,262
- You're funny.

43
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:21,413
- [Bryan] Wow. (laughs)

44
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:22,840
(Finn babbling)

45
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,060
Yours don't light up?

46
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,299
Aw, we'll have to get you
some cool light up ones

47
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,142
okay buddy?

48
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:31,725
(upbeat music)

49
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:37,923
Good morning.

50
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,088
- Good morning.
- Hey babe.

51
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:40,500
Beautiful day at the barn.

52
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,222
- It's so nice, it has not
been this nice in like a week.

53
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:44,530
(Bryan laughs)
I'm so excited to ride.

54
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,000
- [Bryan] Hey babe, why do
you have a bowl of oatmeal?

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,360
- Well I needed some food
but also Natcha loves it

56
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,646
when I eat oatmeal 'cause
he gets a bite. (laughs)

57
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:53,480
And he thinks it's delicious.

58
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,560
- [Bryan] You're a crazy horse lady.

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,930
- I know.
- You know that right?

60
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,900
Alright this is Rusty.

61
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,140
We got him all saddled up.

62
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,510
We got his headstall on.

63
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,026
Is it headstall?

64
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:03,060
- Yes.
- Headstall.

65
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,230
He's wearing a headstall.

66
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,922
Say hi, say hi to the
internet Rusty. (laughs)

67
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,259
I'm gonna hope on this guy.

68
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,200
- Look at us we're riding, how fun.

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,910
I love watching Bryan ride
and I love riding with Bryan.

70
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,750
He's definitely still
trying to get comfortable.

71
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,840
So he's on Rusty who's a very good horse.

72
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,330
He's safe safe safe.

73
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,270
He's probably boring. (laughing)

74
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,640
Like he's not gonna do anything

75
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,980
unless you really really
really want him to.

76
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,000
So he's just kinda getting
used to sitting on a saddle.

77
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,430
We're gonna walk over and see the boys.

78
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,340
Hi Ollie!

79
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,866
- Hi.
- Are you playing?

80
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,234
- [Woman] They're trying to
get the tractor beam from me.

81
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:42,767
- [Missy] (laughs) They're
having a fun time over there.

82
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,350
(upbeat music)

83
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,090
- Passed out.

84
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,460
Passed out.

85
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,440
Alright now that the boys are passed out,

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,240
we are headed somewhere really really cool

87
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,231
and we have something to tell you guys

88
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:07,490
and show you guys at the same time.

89
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,880
So get excited.

90
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,340
Like I said this has been something

91
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,080
that we've been working
on for over a year now

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,700
trying to make this happen
and it's finally happening.

93
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,160
It's cool, it's kinda like
one of those surreal things.

94
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
I think it's like one of those things

95
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,070
you actually have an idea and you work on

96
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,870
for a really long time and
you're like this is never

97
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,360
gonna happen, like you
just keep working at it.

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,504
But this something's
actually happening now guys.

99
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:30,337
- It's moving along.

100
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:33,040
- It's moving along, (laughs)
I'm very very excited.

101
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,090
Oh hey Finn.

102
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,210
- Hey.

103
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,801
- [Bryan] You want to see
what we're working on?

104
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:37,634
- Yeah.

105
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,560
- [Bryan] Yeah, he's
like yeah after I am done

106
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,010
digging in this bread. (chuckles)

107
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,489
Hey Ollie you want to see
what we've been working on?

108
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:45,880
- Yeah.
- Alright, shut the door.

109
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,822
Let's go.

110
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:49,655
(uplifting music)

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,290
Alright are you guys ready to see (laughs)

112
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,390
this is kind of crazy.

113
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,350
I don't even know if any of
you guys are expecting this

114
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,060
at all but Missy and I bought a building.

115
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,469
Look how giant this place is.

116
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,889
And it's ours babe.

117
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,540
Like this is where dreams are
gonna happen and come true.

118
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,890
- There's some major dreams that need

119
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,120
to come true in this building.

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,400
- Yeah. (laughs)

121
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,640
So right now we have kind
of just an empty shell.

122
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,290
There's a little bit of stuff being put up

123
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,740
but it's all being demoed.

124
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,680
This is all actually going down tomorrow

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,010
and then we're gonna start demolition.

126
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,480
And Papa was in here
(chuckles) and he just like

127
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,770
had to make a big old pile.

128
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,770
He's like I gotta do something. (laughs)

129
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,020
But this is really
exciting because we have

130
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,070
a building now where we can start doing

131
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,350
a lot more of our projects.

132
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,290
First and foremost, this is
going to be a music studio.

133
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,900
So we are actually starting
construction this month

134
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,560
and we are building a whole other building

135
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,880
inside of this building.

136
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,720
- This is going to be--

137
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,706
- It will never look
like this again. (laughs)

138
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,130
- It's gonna be the coolest thing.

139
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,440
I mean, we're definitely
gonna make a cool studio

140
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,660
but it's also gonna be
just an awesome space

141
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,630
to do a lot of really fun projects

142
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,100
that we have planned for the year.

143
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,933
- Yeah that's right.

144
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,960
I want it to be kind
of like a headquarters.

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,290
We're gonna have office here.

146
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,700
We're gonna be able to film videos here.

147
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,736
We're gonna be able to record
podcasts, record music.

148
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:29,710
I think it's gonna be a
really cool creative space.

149
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,040
- So this is like such a crazy
thing for me and Bryan to do.

150
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,660
Basically we're starting a new business.

151
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,180
Continuing on kind of off
of what Daily Bumps is

152
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,458
but there's so much more
that we want to do with

153
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,930
just ourselves and plans and aspirations

154
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,900
that we want to be able to acquire.

155
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,110
- And there's also like new
things we want to start also

156
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,330
and we're very restricted in our house.

157
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,130
We have an amazing house
and it's great for living

158
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,000
and our family and filming and stuff

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,590
but to get to that next level

160
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,859
we need to have something else.

161
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,457
And you know how you always
wanted one more bathroom.

162
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:05,240
- [Missy] (laughs) Yes I
always needed just one more.

163
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,690
No lights. (laughing)

164
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,920
There you go, there's the bathroom.

165
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,925
- So if I ever really needed
a private place to potty.

166
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,620
- (laughing) There you go.

167
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,720
But yeah, I'm just so
excited because like for us

168
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,290
we just really want to be
able to reach out even farther

169
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,040
with what we're doing in our lives

170
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,860
and I'm excited for this building

171
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,970
because I feel like it's
gonna be a great place

172
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,140
for us to come up with ideas, and create

173
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,140
and make music and have
fun and play, huh? (laughs)

174
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,010
This is so exciting.

175
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,640
- Yeah, I mean this is
like a huge dream of mine.

176
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,890
You guys know I love working on music.

177
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,660
I've been writing a bunch of new music.

178
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,950
I want to work with a lot
of different musicians.

179
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,180
This is gonna be a really
cool place to do that.

180
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,660
It's gonna be a place
where other musicians

181
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,270
can come and work too,
which is kinda cool.

182
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,440
- I just wonder how well
you're gonna be able

183
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,085
to make music with this echo. (laughs)

184
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,630
- This is seriously never
ever gonna look like this.

185
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,360
- [Missy] Yeah, this is like a nutshell.

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,660
- When you walk into what
we are going to build,

187
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,260
it's going to look completely different.

188
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,990
- Oh yeah, we have it already all planned

189
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,980
and what it's gonna look like

190
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,070
and this whole place is just like,

191
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,481
there's gonna be walls, there's
gonna be whole new stuffs.

192
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,314
So it's gonna be cool.

193
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:22,147
- Let's go look behind now.

194
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:25,130
- [Missy] Okay, everything
is a mess right now too.

195
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,530
- So right now the building is equipped

196
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,157
with like a reception and office area.

197
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:32,770
And we're gonna keep this in the design

198
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,050
but we're tearing all this out

199
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,680
because we need a new
roof 'cause we're also

200
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,870
gonna do a cool little
loft space up there.

201
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,450
So Papa was here and he decided
to break the ceiling out.

202
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,130
So it's kinda gonna be like this

203
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,359
but it's gonna be different.

204
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,580
- [Missy] So this is the reception.

205
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,454
- And then there's an
office that goes in here.

206
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,542
and it's pretty big.

207
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,100
Like every other building
we were looking at

208
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,040
was pretty massive and I
thought I needed something big

209
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,730
but then when I saw like a small building

210
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,580
I'm like this could definitely work.

211
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,420
I could have a lot of cool stuff in here.

212
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,450
- Yeah, it's just nice
because you got this space

213
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,890
for like other things
than just the studio.

214
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,631
Like an office and stuff
like that but it's not huge.

215
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:17,690
- Yeah, so over here we're
gonna have a spiral staircase

216
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,657
and all that's gonna be loft area,

217
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:24,730
and then this is gonna be a lounge.

218
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,868
- [Missy] This is all lounge.

219
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,560
- And the studio kinda starts here and.

220
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,393
- Moves on.
- It's pretty cool.

221
00:08:28,393 --> 00:08:30,840
The design is really cool.

222
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,679
It's gonna be fun updating you
guys on how it's all going.

223
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,479
It's supposed to happen pretty fast.

224
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,690
- We'll see, they always
say we can get this done

225
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,370
in a couple months and who
knows how long it'll take

226
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,090
but it's just gonna be so fun
to be able to take you along

227
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,480
with us and see the process
of it going from this

228
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,570
to something hopefully really cool.

229
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,620
- I wanna make a new album
and I wanna do more music

230
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,450
with the kids and with you
guys and I wanna do a podcast

231
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,470
with you and I just have so
many different thing in mind.

232
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,270
- And that's the thing,
is there's so many things

233
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,680
that we can do but this is
also gonna be a business.

234
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,793
We're starting a business
so, it's pretty huge.

235
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:09,376
(upbeat music)

236
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,880
- [Bryan] So Papa heard we here
and not tearing things down

237
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,150
so he showed up.

238
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,010
We got some tools, we got a sledgehammer.

239
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,690
Think we're gonna create
some destruction Ollie.

240
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,654
- [Missy] You think you
can tear down some walls?

241
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:25,487
- No.

242
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,320
- [Bryan] Could you even
pick that sledge hammer up?

243
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,602
Try to pick it up.

244
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:29,530
Oh, wow!

245
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,797
Just watch your feet when you
put it down okay. (laughing)

246
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:36,120
- That's Aquaman.
- Yeah.

247
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,031
- [Missy] Ah, there a hammer
you could pick up huh?

248
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:39,864
- Yeah.

249
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:40,697
- [Missy] You already did it.

250
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:42,010
- Be careful.
- You ready to tear down

251
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,843
some walls?

252
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,304
Not the floor baby,
not the floor. (laughs)

253
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:47,322
- [Bryan] Keep the floor,
we want to keep the floor.

254
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:49,960
(Missy laughing)

255
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,940
- [Missy] Papa will tell you
what you could hit, okay?

256
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,540
Ollie, you're about to
hit that hammer so hard,

257
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,780
you're gonna put a hole in the wall.

258
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,837
You've never been allowed
to do that before huh?

259
00:09:58,837 --> 00:09:59,970
- No.
(Missy laughs)

260
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,279
- [Missy] Are you excited?

261
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,580
- I'm so up for it.

262
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,720
- You want to see?
- Yeah.

263
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,103
- Come over here.

264
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:06,936
You ready Ollie?

265
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,888
- Yeah.
- Okay.

266
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:11,850
- Like that.

267
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,683
- [Missy] I'm so sacred.

268
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:14,860
Could you just do it low? (laughs)

269
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,540
Wait, that looks like a 2x4 though.

270
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,283
Oh my gosh.

271
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,696
(Missy shrieks)

272
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,373
Oh wow.

273
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,332
- This is how you get things done people.

274
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,900
(Missy laughs)

275
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,900
- [Bryan] Aw yeah, check it out.

276
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,510
Made some damage you guys. (chuckles)

277
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,560
- [Ollie] Tear down the wall.

278
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,750
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

279
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,700
Alright hit.

280
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,454
There you go. (laughs)

281
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:49,952
- There you go.
- Alright.

282
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:51,616
- Right here, ready?

283
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:52,929
- Nice.
(Missy screams lightly)

284
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:54,980
- You got it.
- Is it stuck in the wall?

285
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,884
- Yeah.
- What?

286
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:58,533
- [Missy] You can't do
this at home Ollie, okay?

287
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,390
(laughs)

288
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,850
- [Bryan] We're tearing
this place down aren't we?

289
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:05,697
(Bryan chuckles)

290
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:11,650
Oh it's stuck.

291
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:13,992
- [Missy] Woo!

292
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:15,410
- Woo hoo.
- Whoa.

293
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,020
- [Missy] That definitely worked huh?

294
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,858
(Missy screams)

295
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,138
- [Bryan] I'm coming through!

296
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,197
- [Missy] No. (screams)

297
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:25,821
What do you think of that Finn?

298
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:27,770
(laughing)

299
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,140
- Daddy's here!

300
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,564
- [Missy] My God, that's so scary.

301
00:11:31,564 --> 00:11:33,240
(laughing)

302
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,340
- Oh they have some nails in the wall.

303
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,320
I should really hammer those in more huh?

304
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,010
(Missy screams)

305
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,121
- [Bryan] Sorry, sorry babe.

306
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:44,170
Alright there you go.
- Oh you got it. (laughs)

307
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,896
Alright I think the
nail's in, you're good.

308
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:47,944
- I think the nail's in.

309
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:48,993
Is the nail in Ollie?

310
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,824
- [Ollie] No, I think it fell down here.

311
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:52,265
- Oh did it? (laughs)
- I think it's

312
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:53,765
on the other side.

313
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:00,486
(upbeat music)

314
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,860
Go for it babe.

315
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,040
Yeah.

316
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,300
The whole thing is shaking.

317
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,133
Let's go!

318
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,566
- Oh God.

319
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,420
(laughing)

320
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,230
I don't want to be in there.

321
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,230
- [Bryan] Look at this hole babe.

322
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,120
Isn't that awesome?

323
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,610
Ollie, Finn look at the walls
are full of cotton candy.

324
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,230
Isn't that cool?

325
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,908
Don't touch it, oh don't touch it.

326
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,180
It's not real cotton candy.

327
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,442
It's just insulation.

328
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:29,275
- Oh.

329
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,858
(upbeat music)

330
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,968
- [Bryan] Whoa, you guys
something's breaking in!

331
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,870
Something's breaking in!

332
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,514
What do you think it is?

333
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,470
You think it's a dinosaur?

334
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,548
- I think so. (gasps)

335
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:47,381
Hey look!

336
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:51,390
- [Bryan] Ah, they're getting in. (laughs)

337
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,470
Hello.
- Hello.

338
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,765
- [Bryan] It's just mama.

339
00:12:56,765 --> 00:13:00,580
(hammer thuds)
Whoa!

340
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,944
You getting a workout?

341
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,020
- Yeah, I'm really gonna be sore.

342
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,810
(Bryan laughs)

343
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,320
- [Bryan] So Papa has been
a huge help on this project.

344
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,080
He's kinda been a second
me when it comes to this

345
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,110
because it's a lot of work.

346
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,610
Construction starts this month.

347
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,010
- That's right, it does yeah.

348
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,010
- Ain't that crazy?
- Very soon we gotta

349
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,490
have all this down by the 13th.

350
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,620
- Yeah. (laughs)

351
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,500
So yes, this our next project
we are very very excited for.

352
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,240
We hope you guys are too and
we're gonna bring you along

353
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,940
for the whole journey because
we've never done this before.

354
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,340
Huh?
- Yeah I've never

355
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,238
done anything like this.

356
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:33,156
(Bryan laughs)

357
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:34,170
Ollie's teaching me how to demo.

358
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,995
How do you do it?

359
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,890
- You just do it like that.

360
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,020
- [Bryan] Oh I see.

361
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,458
- [Missy] So it's like.

362
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,660
- [Bryan] You could actually
rip this whole thing out.

363
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,493
Watch out dude.

364
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,003
Whoa.

365
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:45,860
- [Missy] Just like that?

366
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,942
- [Ollie] Yeah.

367
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:47,950
- [Missy] Cool.

368
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,783
- [Bryan] And then you hit it.

369
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:50,533
Look at all that cotton candy.

370
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,031
- It's not cotton candy.

371
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,448
- I know, don't eat it. (laughs)

372
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:58,031
(upbeat music)

373
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,100
Don't mind us, just hanging out

374
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,970
in the forest with my boys, huh? (laughs)

375
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,600
Did you guys have a good day today?

376
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,380
(boys whining)

377
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,830
Oh yeah, mama's ready to read you books

378
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,870
so you can go night night, okay?

379
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,490
- Mm hmm.
- Okay. (lips smacking)

380
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,990
I love these boys so much.

381
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,864
- Mm hmm.
- I love you.

382
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,990
- Love you too.

383
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,910
(Bryan laughs)

384
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,910
- But anyway, I think that's
all for today's video.

385
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,360

finally share with you guys
