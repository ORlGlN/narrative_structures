00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,378
- Hey guys, and welcome to a
very special Daily Bumps video.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,497
This video is paid for by Hot Wheels,

3
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:06,678
and they partnered with us

4
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:08,452
in the production of this video.

5
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:09,547
Today's video is special,

6
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:11,409
because I have a surprise for Ollie.

7
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:16,045
He is now the perfect age
for my all-time favorite toy.

8
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:16,962
Hot Wheels.

10
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:22,540

11

♪ Live it forever ♪

12
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:26,305
Hot Wheels knew how excited I was

13
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:27,163
to share this with Ollie,

14
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:28,936
so they sent us, not one car,

15
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:31,949
but literally hundreds of cars.

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,309
This is going to blow his mind, you guys.

17
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,400
This is probably a quarter of
what they actually sent us.

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,016
But I'm gonna show all this to Ollie,

19
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:40,495
and see what he thinks.

20
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:42,957
I think he's gonna be very, very excited.

21
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:45,540
(upbeat music)

22
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:50,923
Hey dude!

23
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:51,756
- Hey.

24
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:54,089
- I have a surprise for you!

25
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:59,903
Look at all of these new Hot Wheel cars!

26
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:00,803
Guess what, Ollie.

27
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:01,636
- What?

28
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:04,629
- Hot Wheels sent you all
of these cars to play with.

29
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,430
Just for you.

30
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,500
Isn't that so cool?

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,333
- Yeah!

32
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,695
Thank you Hot Wheels!

33
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,758
- [Bryan] Oh, my gosh, look at this one.

34
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,762
- Whoa.
- [Bryan] It's a street beast.

35
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:16,767
That one is called Motosaurus, Ollie.

36
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:18,400
Is that a real type of dinosaur?

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,233
- Yeah.

38
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,856
- It is in Hot Wheels, huh?

39
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:23,189
Oo, that one is Crate Racer.

40
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:26,183
That one's cool.

41
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:28,237
- This one has a trash can.

42
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:29,463
- [Bryan] What is that?

43
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:30,403
- Trash can.

44
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:34,688
- It's an Aisle Driver,
so it's a shopping cart.

45
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:36,138
I've never seen that before.

46
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,588
There's so many cool Hot
Wheels to play with, huh?

47
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:39,421
- Yeah!

48
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,425
- Well, let's open 'em up.

49
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:42,182
Open up one you wanna play with, dude.

50
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:43,413
- I'm gonna open this one.

51
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:44,306
- [Bryan] The shopping cart one?

52
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,389
- [Ollie] Yeah.

53
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:47,213
- It's a shopping cart Hot Wheel,

54
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:48,571
that is so cool, huh?

55
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,623
- And it has...

56
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:50,782
- A little guy!

57
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:52,696
- Yeah, a little guy.
- A little driver.

58
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,037
Okay, Ollie, you have to see this one.

59
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:55,870
- What?

60
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,895
- This is the dinosaur one,

61
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:58,145
the Motosaurus.

62
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:00,424
Check that out.

63
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,229
- (shouts)

64
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,681
- (growls)

65
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:04,566
Oh, let's get Shark Bite.

66
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,399
- Shark Bite?

67
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,923
Does he chomp on things?

68
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:08,211
- I think he does chomp on things,

69
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,872
look his mouth even moves.

70
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:11,872
Look at that.

71
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,238
That's so cool, huh?

72
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:15,320
- I'm gonna eat you.

73
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,946
- (sound affects) That cool?

74
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,261
Out of all these amazing Hot Wheels,

75
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,358
which one is your favorite?

76
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:24,286
- This one!

77
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,850
- This one, the gold one?

78
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,683
- [Ollie] Yeah.

79
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:29,472
- Whoa, that's the Rogue Hog.

80
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:30,569
That is a really cool one.

81
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:33,671
Hey Ollie, what if we take
your favorite Hot Wheel,

82
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:37,636
and we create the longest
Hot Wheel track we can.

83
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:39,242
- (gasps)
- Should we do that?

84
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,318
- Yeah!

85
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:41,942
- What other cars do you
wanna race on the track?

86
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:43,081
- This one!

87
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:44,126
- This one?
- Yeah.

88
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:45,293
Let's do this!

89
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:51,257
- Alright, Ollie,

90
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:52,090
I'm gonna give you a lesson

91
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,429
in how to put together a
Hot Wheels track, okay?

92
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:58,080
This is the track, and this
blue piece is the connector.

93
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,552
So, you just pop it in, just like that

94
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:02,185
and then you take your other track,

95
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,685
and you pop it in, just like that

96
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,212
and now look, it's twice as long.

97
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:06,402
- That's a cool track!

98
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,184
- I know, let's make it longer, 'kay?

99
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:10,767
(upbeat music)

100
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,208
- I put it on!

101
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,791
- [Bryan] Good job,
let's keep building it!

102
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:19,282
- I did it!

103
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,810
- [Bryan] I knew you could, buddy!

104
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,450
That's pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

105
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,337
- We made our first piece of track.

106
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,107
Now we gotta make a lot more.

107
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:28,690
(upbeat music)

108
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:37,730
Look at this huge track
we just built, you guys,

109
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,929
I've never done this before.

110
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:40,956
This is seriously so cool,

111
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:44,537
it goes through the entire house!

112
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:46,358
I think we did pretty
good on that huge track,

113
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,191
didn't we?

114
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:48,024
- Yeah!

115
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:49,941
- That's the biggest Hot
Wheels track I've ever seen.

116
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:50,774
- Yeah.

117
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:51,676
- [Bryan] Alright, Ollie.

118
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:53,726
What do you think of this huge track?

119
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:54,559
- Good!

120
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,509
- [Bryan] Should we test it out?

121
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,342
- Yeah!

122
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:57,748
- [Bryan] Let's turn all
the boosters on, okay?

123
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:58,599
- Okay.

124
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,182
(upbeat music)

125
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,631
- [Bryan] It just keeps goin', huh?

126
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,464
- Yeah.

127
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:06,493
- I can't believe, you guys,

128
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:09,587
we made a track go
around our entire house.

129
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,362
It's coming through our hallway,

130
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:12,689
past Ollie's bedroom,

131
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,499
it goes through my office

132
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:17,894
and outside, into our courtyard...

133
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:18,957
Turn that booster on!

134
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,091
We really need that one
to get the car over the

135
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:22,059
bush, huh?

136
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:22,892
- [Ollie] Yeah!

137
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:23,725
- Isn't that crazy,

138
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:24,558
you think it's gonna work?

139
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:25,498
- Yeah, I think so.

140
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,510
- Okay, comes all the way around here.

141
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,343
Around the gnome,

142
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:29,335
we have it comin' all the way

143
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,693
through our courtyard right now,

144
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:31,895
over this box,

145
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:32,921
and then if we're lucky,

146
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:34,762
it's gonna go all the way around

147
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:37,012
and back into the playroom!

148
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,655
Let's try it, okay.

149
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,662
Whoa!

150
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,062
- Ah!

151
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,645
(upbeat music)

152
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,191
Two scorpion ones!

153
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:16,067
- Whoa, they're scorpions?

154
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,506
- Yeah.
- They even have tails?

155
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:18,339
- Yeah.

156
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,866
- Do you think they're fast on the track?

157
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,050
- I don't think so.

158
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,539
- No, well let's try 'em, 'kay?

159
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,336
Let's follow it!

160
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:25,169
Whoa!

161
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:29,117
It's goin', it's goin' Ollie, wait!

162
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:31,027
Whoa, 'round the gnome!

163
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,610
(upbeat music)

164
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,977
Alright, Ollie, you wanna
see the loop in action?

165
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:55,810
- Yeah!

166
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,381
- Alright.

167
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,466
Whoa!
- Whoa!

168
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:01,509
- You want me to see if your
scorpion will go through?

169
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:02,970
Whoa!

170
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,969
But what is this, Ollie,

171
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,812
all of the cars are just crashing together

172
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:09,220
at the end of our huge track, huh?

173
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,327
Do you think we need something
to put all these cars in?

174
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,160
- Yeah.

175
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,993
- Yeah, 'cause look they're all just

176
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,261
crashing into each other.

177
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:16,344
(shouts)

178
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,374
- What are we going to
do with all these cars?

179
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,957
(upbeat music)

180
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:41,059
Whoa, this is awesome!
- What!

181
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,392
This is so cool!

182
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,107
Ollie, do you know what this is?

183
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:45,940
- What?

184
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,308
- [Bryan] It's the Hot
Wheels Super Ultimate Garage!

185
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,558
That's so cool!

186
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:53,589
Look at all this parking space.

187
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:54,422
- Whoa!

188
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,602
- The Hot Wheels Super Ultimate Garage

189
00:06:57,602 --> 00:07:00,528
is the single biggest
Hot Wheels item ever.

00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,575
It stands over three feet tall

191
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:04,661
and can hold over 140 cars

192
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,659
for hours of endless play.

193
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,974
- This is the car wash.

194
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,641
- [Bryan] Yeah, this is
where all the cars go

195
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:10,698
to get clean

196
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,795
and then they're gettin' dry.

197
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:13,814
Isn't that so cool?

198
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:18,547
- Is that dry one, and
that one make the bubbles?

199
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:20,015
- Yeah, ain't that neat?

200
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:23,118
(upbeat music)

201
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,363
The Super Ultimate Garage features

202
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:26,553
a continuous motorized elevator

203
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,548
that can hold up to 23 cars at a time.

204
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,428
But watch out for the menacing gorilla,

205
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:32,544
who can climb the tower

206
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:34,926
and will try to swipe your
friends out of the elevator.

207
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:36,168
- Is that a gorilla?

208
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:37,780
- That's a gorilla!

209
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,020
He's knocking cars off the elevator, look!

210
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,023
- Hey, stop it gorilla!

211
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:44,498
(grunts)

212
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,865
- They come through here,

213
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,032
and they race.

214
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:50,167
Whoa!
- Whoa!

215
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,750
(upbeat music)

216
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:02,371
Woo, I'm flying!

217
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:08,022
Flying backwards.

218
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,413
Hi, mama!

219
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,256
- Hi, Ollie!

220
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:17,839
(upbeat music)

221
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,241
- [Bryan] There's so
many amazing features,

222
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:26,903
there are endless
story-telling possibilities.

223
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:28,820
- Over three feet tall!

224
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,801
A gorilla.

225
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,362
Mechanized elevator.

226
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,597
Jet launch pad.

227
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:38,092
Car wash.

228
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,009
Side-by-side racetrack.

229
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:43,402
Holds over 140 cars.

230
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:47,506
- What I love about Hot Wheels

231
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,388
is that it's more than just a toy.

232
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:51,953
It helps kids develop life skills.

233
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:53,472
It fuels their imagination,

234
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:55,740
sparks motor skills as
it develops strength

235
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,305
and dexterity for better building

236
00:08:57,305 --> 00:08:59,217
and there's hours of fun to be had!

237
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:02,033
Which promotes concentration
for extended periods of time.

238
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,000
I loved Hot Wheels growing up.

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,476
It was one of my favorite things

240
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:07,188
to build and to play with

241
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:08,602
and I just love that now,

242
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,182
Ollie is the perfect age

243
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,975
that he can do it as well.

244
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:13,275
Isn't that so cool, Ollie?

245
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:14,108
- Yeah!

246
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,242
- You love Hot Wheels too?

247
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,075
- Yeah.

248
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:16,908
- Just like daddy, right?

249
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:17,741
- Yeah.

250
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:19,449
- I love you.

251
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,748
Look at all your cars, are
you obsessed with them?

252
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:22,581
- [Ollie] Yeah.

253
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:24,168
- Which one's your absolute favorite?

254
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:25,515
- [Ollie] Um, the scorpion one!

255
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,221
- The scorpion one!

256
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,049
That is a pretty cool car, huh?

257
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,184
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

258
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:31,263
I love you.

259
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,217
Did you have fun building
that track, today?

260
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:34,050
- Yeah.

261
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,025
- Had a good time, huh?

262
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:36,581
'Kay, go play with your cars.

263
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:37,499
- 'Kay.

264
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:38,517
- So, if you're a parent

265
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,731
and you're looking for an
awesome gift this holiday season,

266
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:43,819

273
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:55,204

277
00:09:58,444 --> 00:09:59,739

00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:00,761
