1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,463
- [Missy] What are you doin'?

2
00:00:02,463 --> 00:00:05,720
Oh my gosh, are you allowed to do that?

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,754
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh.

4
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:08,000
(laughing)

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,833

00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:32,982
- [Both] Good morning!

18
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,418
- How are you this morning, bud?

19
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:35,251
- Good.

20
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:38,020
- Bryan's getting work
done in the office, huh?

21
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,190
And mommy and daddy are goin'
somewhere really special today

22
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,640
and we're really looking forward to it.

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,273
It's got something to do with you.

24
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:45,180
- Really?

25
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,380
- Mhm.

26
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,840
(babbling)

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,010
He wanted to redo his morning,

28
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,690
'cause he was a little grumpy huh?

29
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,187
Are you having a good morning?

30
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:53,981
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:55,040
He's so funny.

32
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,990
He's like, wait, I need
to redo my morning.

33
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,165
- Oh hey Finn.

34
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:00,300
- Hey.
- Finn, you got it easy.

35
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,665
We're not talking to your
teacher today, are we?

36
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:03,770
- No.
- No.

37
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,450
We're talking to your teacher.

38
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,340
Did you know that Ollie?

39
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,323
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:11,360
- We are doing a parent-teacher
conference today.

41
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,050
- It's his first
parent-teacher conference.

42
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,950
He's not coming, right?

43
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,783
- [Missy] Mm, mm.

44
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:16,770
- So, it's just Missy and I.

45
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,791
You're teacher's gonna tell
us how good you've been.

46
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:19,624
- Really?

47
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:22,004
- [Bryan] Yeah, oh, see a
little worry in those eyes.

48
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:22,837
- [Missy] He's like hmmm.

49
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:24,120
- [Bryan] Are you afraid
that your teacher's

50
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,466
gonna tell us somethin' that
you don't want us to hear?

51
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:27,630
- Un-hun.
- No?

52
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,980
'Cause you've been a good boy?

53
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,290
Yeah, okay.

54
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,200
Yeah, parent-teacher conferences
aren't something you really

55
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,190
need to worry about when
you're in preschool probably.

56
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,550
She's probably just gonna say
he's the best little boy ever.

57
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,200
All right, go have fun with Mimi and Papa.

58
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,930
We're dropping the boys off
at Mimi and Papa's house,

59
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,120
so that we can go do that.

60
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,070
Finn, do you like my Star Wars shirt?

61
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,730
- Yeah!
- Isn't that so cool?

62
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,970
They're fighting with the lightsabers.

63
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,803
Isn't that neat?

64
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:49,636
- Yeah.

65
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:51,020
- All right, we are so excited

66
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,690
for Ollie's parent-teacher conference,

67
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,260
'cause we actually haven't
had a chance to talk

68
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,300
with his teacher to see
how she feels he's doing,

69
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,360
and I think this will
also give us a good idea

70
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,940
if he'll be ready for
kindergarten which is next year.

71
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,380
I cannot believe our kid is going

72
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,018
into kindergarten next year.

73
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:06,127
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

74
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,289
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

75
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,611
But yeah, I think we'll
get a good idea of like,

76
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:12,450
you know what she feels,
how he's progressing,

77
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,283
what he's doing.

78
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:15,040
I think he's doing great, but
he's definitely a preschooler,

79
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,179
and he just wants to have fun still.

80
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,762
(upbeat music)

81
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,540
- [Bryan] Missy holds in her hand Oliver's

82
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,098
very first report card grade.

83
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:32,931
- Yeah!

84
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,480
- [Bryan] How crazy is that?

85
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,190
- It's really crazy, like, he's old enough

86
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,810
to have a report card.
(laughing)

87
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,010
- His teacher basically
looked at all these things

88
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,500
on this report card,
and graded him on them.

89
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,510
I think this is the first time as a parent

90
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,260
that this is something
that's really happened,

91
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,800
and we got to sit down with his teacher

92
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,380
and learn so much about him.

93
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,037
It was really kind of
incredible as a parent.

94
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:54,870
- [Missy] Yeah.

95
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,860
- I think to get to that point,
you know in your parenting.

96
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,540
- Yeah, 'cause like, as a
parent, like you know your kid.

97
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,590
You know all that, but
when you get to kinda get

98
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,490
the perspective of someone
who also loves him,

99
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,670
but that they're not necessarily a parent,

100
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,840
is really, really, really
cool and very interesting, so.

101
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,580
- Yeah, so we just wrapped
up lunch, and we are headed

102
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,840
back to Mimi and Papa's to grab the boys.

103
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,568
We can talk to Oliver about
his first report card.

104
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:15,920
- Yeah.
(laughing)

105
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,950
- [Bryan] All right, Ollie.

106
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,220
Mommy and Daddy just got back

107
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,850
from our parent-teacher conference,

108
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,630
and we have your very first report card.

109
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,538
Did you know that?

110
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:24,629
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

111
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:27,340
So, we talked to Miss Tracy today,

112
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,449
that's your teacher, right?

113
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:29,282
- Mhm.

114
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:30,315
- Okay good, we talked to the right one.

115
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:34,110
And she gave me all this
information about you.

116
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,740
Look at all this.

117
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,780
You see that?

118
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,150
And you know what she said?
- What?

119
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,150
- She said that you are
so fun to have in class,

120
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,700
that she absolutely loves you.

121
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,950
She says that you have
gotten so confident,

122
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,078
and you're getting so much better.

123
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:53,850
Do you like going over
with her and working

124
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,810
on your letters and numbers?
- Yeah.

125
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,898
- Is she like the nicest teacher ever?

126
00:03:57,898 --> 00:04:00,500
It sounds like she really
has really poured a lot

127
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,800
of like attention into him to kinda like.

128
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,633
- [Bryan] Yeah.

129
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,490
- Like just make him super confident.

130
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,020
Well, it sounds like
you're getting really good

131
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,302
at your numbers, huh?

132
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,020
- [Bryan] Super proud of you, dude.

133
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,320
- Yeah, and you're learning
all the kids' names.

134
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,320
- She said that when school
starts, if certain kids

135
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,269
aren't there yet, Ollie will say like,

136
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,919
"Well, so-and-so's not here."

137
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,120
And Ollie knows their
names; whereas other kids

138
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,328
don't really pay attention to that.

139
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,634
- Wait that kid.

140
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:24,892
Where's that one kid?

141
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:29,010
And, I'm like, that's so cute
that you know their names huh?

142
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,949
It just sounds like you're doing

143
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,300
such a great job in preschool.

144
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,771
Do you like preschool?
- So proud of you.

145
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:33,770
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

146
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,050
I'm just so proud of you.

147
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,536
- We're both so proud of you.

148
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:40,000
- So smart and you're learning so much.

149
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,220
And it's really cool.

150
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,720
- So, Miss Tracy also said
that Oliver connects a lot more

151
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,040
with numbers or recognizes
numbers versus letters,

152
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,500
and that was something that
I did a lot of in school.

153
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,300
I always connected more
with like math and science,

154
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,840
and she said that you're really interested

155
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,165
in math and science, too, huh?

156
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:57,998
- Yeah.

157
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,080
- So maybe this summer,
Papa we could put together

158
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,090
some cool science experiments with Ollie?

159
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,181
Would that be fun?

160
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:04,014
- Yeah.

161
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:07,210
- Yeah, he's also like really
good at like patterns and.

162
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,910
- Like creating his own patterns?

163
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,410
- Yeah, like he's really good at like

164
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,430
creating his own patterns
and just kinda like,

165
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,860
if she says like it's blue, blue, yellow,

166
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,560
he'll keep doing blue, blue, yellow.

167
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,393
So, that's really cool.

168
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,740
It's really good at that age, so yay!

169
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm hanging out in my parents' backyard

170
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,310
which is still just dirt.

171
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,170
So sad.

172
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,940
But we, we really wanted to start, like,

173
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,970
kinda changing it up,
and making it look nicer.

174
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,230
They have a really big backyard
but definitely mostly dirt.

175
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,420
Cassie really needs
some concrete back here,

176
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,676
so she can ride her tricycle.

177
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:39,470
- It'd be really nice to
not be driving it on dirt.

178
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,280
- [Missy] All right, show me
how you ride the tricycle.

179
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,420
This is the cutest tricycle ever.

180
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,315
Can you do it?

181
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:45,148
- No.

182
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,220
- No, doggy Kota.

183
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,440
Go, Finn, go!

184
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,570
Aw, your feet are not
quite big enough, huh?

185
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,590
But yeah, so my mom still needs to, like,

186
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,940
do the backyard and then
there's one other area

187
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,400
that people are always
talking about or asking about.

188
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm gonna show you right now.

189
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,090
And it's this room.

190
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,670
It's super duper empty.

191
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,440
No, it's not empty on purpose.

192
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,540
It's just that it's a big project,

193
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,130
and we gotta figure out, like,
what they all want in here.

194
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,350
What do you think you want in here, Mom?

195
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,020
- Well, I know for sure we wanna do

196
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,727
maybe a dining area right here.

197
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,390
- [Missy] Yeah, not that.

198
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,604
(inaudible chatter)

199
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:24,640
- And then we're kinda
thinking maybe a library.

200
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,473
- [Missy] Yeah.

201
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:27,299
- So, like bookshelves
and a little seating.

202
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,132
- [Missy] Mhm.

203
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,512
- This room has overwhelmed
me just because.

204
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:31,544
- [Missy] It's so big.

205
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:32,630
- It's the last room I wanted to get done,

206
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,030
because it's the last
room I know we'll use.

207
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,863
- [Missy] Yeah.

208
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,070
Oh my goodness, what are you doing?

209
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,341
Finley!
(laughing)

210
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:40,745
- [Mimi] He's like where is it?

211
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:43,078
- [Missy] What are you doin?

212
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,904
Oh my gosh, are you allowed to do that?

213
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,270
He's just looking at me.

214
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,230
What do you say?

215
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:53,967
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh.

216
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:56,786
- [Missy] Bye.

217
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:01,283
What are you doing?

218
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:02,600
- [Mimi] He's vacuuming the floor.

219
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,130
- Oh my gosh, that is, what
do you think of this, Mom?

220
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,503
- It kind of stresses me out.

221
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:10,060
Bit of an expensive toy.

222
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,989
- [Missy] Yeah, it is.

223
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:12,691
(laughing)

224
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:14,680
- [Mimi] Papa taught him
how, so I can't get mad.

225
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,370
- [Missy] Yeah, you can get mad at Papa.

226
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,710
No, poor Ollie can't do it, huh?

227
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,730
You're too big.

228
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,563
I can't believe that.

229
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:22,745
That's hilarious.

230
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:25,912
(upbeat techno music)

231
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,800
- [Bryan] It's time for some juice.

232
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,310
We need a little juice pick-me-up,

233
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,130
so Mimi is hooking it up.

234
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,470
- I'm out of pineapple but I still have

235
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,230
some strawberries and some apples.

236
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:03,000
- [Bryan] That is crazy.

237
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,070
- Ready Ollie, you wanna help?

238
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,525
- [Bryan] Ooh, you wanna make some juice?

239
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:08,358
- Yeah.

240
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:11,020
- [Bryan] All right, makin'
juice at Mimi and Papa's house.

241
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,291
- Start grabbin' stuff.

242
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,890
Put it in.

243
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,360
- [Bryan] Throw a
strawberry in there, nice.

244
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,700
- Put more oranges and apples in there.

245
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:26,494
- [Bryan] Whoa!

246
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,599
Ollie did you know this
is how juice gets made?

247
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,432
- Really?

248
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:33,265
- [Bryan] Yeah.

249
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,848
(upbeat music)

250
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:43,060
And then, there was juice.

251
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,080
That's crazy.

252
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,614
- I want one.

253
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:47,595
- [Bryan] You want one?

254
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,428
- Yeah.

255
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,674
- [Bryan] Looks yummy, huh?

256
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:50,507
- Yeah.

257
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:53,040
- [Bryan] Wow, that looks so good.

258
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:55,299
- [Papa] And the chickens love that.

259
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,220
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, that's awesome.

260
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,070
- [Missy] That's crazy.

261
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,500
- All right, Ollie, will
you try yours with me?

262
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,010
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

263
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,843
- Cheers.

264
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:06,540
- [Missy] How is it?

265
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,480
- Good.
- Oh wow, that is gnarly.

266
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,600
That's so yummy.

267
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,870
- [Papa] It's smooth isn't it?

268
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,910
- Yeah.
- That's good.

269
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,260
- [Bryan] And it's good for you, huh?

270
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,630
'Cause it's just fruit.

271
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,430
Try it Finn, what do you think?

272
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,771
Well, is it good?

273
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:21,604
- Yeah.

274
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,040
- Yeah.

275
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,412
- [Missy] Can you and Ollie cheers?

276
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:26,245
Cheers!

277
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:28,783
- Watch this, Mama.

278
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,033
- [Missy] Okay.

279
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:32,974
Are you watering the plants?

280
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:33,807
- Yeah.

281
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:34,940
- [Bryan] Yeah.

282
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,670
He's been out here helping me
water all our house plants.

283
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,280
I got 'em all in this little
wagon, and we watered 'em all.

284
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,300
And now they're just getting some sun.

285
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,890
I basically taught him today
that plants are living,

286
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,090
and so I said you have
to be gentle with them.

287
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,030
And so he's like walking
around like, "Hi, plant."

288
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,220
Or, "Are you okay?"

289
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,290
- [Missy] That's so cute.

290
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,123
- [Bryan] These ones are yellow,

291
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:55,666
'cause they need more water, huh?

292
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,499
- Yeah.

293
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:57,980
- [Bryan] Yeah, see these
ones that are green?

294
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
They got more water than these guys.

295
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,155
- [Missy] Cool, so you're
givin' lots to drink?

296
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:03,988
- Yep.

297
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:05,130
- [Bryan] Yeah, I showed the plants, like,

298
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,158
the water going in 'em, like
getting sucked up by the plant.

299
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:08,280
- Oh cool.

300
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,460
- [Bryan] He's like, "They're drinking!"

301
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,890
That one needs more water?

302
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,450
Awesome.

303
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,666
Thanks for helping me water
all our plants, buddy.

304
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,499
- You're welcome.

305
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:16,590
- [Bryan] Oh, look at these, Ollie.

306
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,170
We're gettin' some flowers.

307
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,020
- [Ollie] I know, I watered them.

308
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,450
- [Bryan] You did water them?

309
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,760
That's probably why we're getting flowers,

310
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,840
'cause you watered them.

311
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,250
Oh, that's awesome.

312
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,860
Water this one.

313
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,642
Yeah, good job dude.

314
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:32,225
(upbeat music)

315
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:39,190
- All right, we are
gettin' ready for bed now.

316
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,643
Did you have a good
day with Mimi and Papa?

317
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:42,476
- Yeah.

318
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,930
- Yeah, you drank all that yummy juice.

319
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,140
- Uh-huh.

320
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,010
- We had such an awesome day.

321
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,080
It was so fun getting
to talk to his teacher,

322
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,990
and just kind of talk all about Ollie

323
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,180
and how awesome he is.

324
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,339
Finn, did you have a good day?

325
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:53,594
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

326
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,660
All right, we're gonna go
ahead and end today's video.

327
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,770
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

328
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,068
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did.

329
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,400
And we will see you guys tomorrow.

330
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,271
What do you say?

331
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,283
- Bye, boop.

332
00:11:04,283 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
