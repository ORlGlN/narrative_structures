1
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:02,357
- [Family] Good morning.

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:05,533
♪ This is our life ♪

3
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,393
♪ Let's live it ♪

4
00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:09,592
♪ Live it forever ♪

5
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,834
- It's actually kind of a chilly morning

6
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:12,333
I've got the fire on

7
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,717
and it looks like our
heater is not working.

8
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:17,470
It says something like it's been trying to

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,332
like heat up the house for two
hours and nothing's changed

10
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:23,450
and I'm like aah, it's
so cold all of a sudden.

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,488
I am really proud of Ollie because

12
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:27,578
he slept in his bed all night.

13
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:28,411
- Da, da.

14
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:31,985
- So we are super excited
because we are looking for Fred

15
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:33,911
like we do every single morning.

16
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,667
But wait, you guys still
haven't seen him anywhere?

17
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:36,500
- Yeah.

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,460
- They've been kinda
running around the house

19
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,722
while mama woke up and they
haven't found him anywhere.

20
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:44,862
- [Missy] Have you guys checked
your very messy playroom?

21
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:46,551
Have you seen him anywhere in here?

22
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:47,384
- [Ollie] Nope.

23
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:49,297
- [Missy] No? Sometimes
we miss him on the tree

24
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:52,025
'cause there's a lot of stuff on the tree.

25
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,754
I don't see him anywhere.

26
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,004
- [Finn] There!

27
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:59,003
- [Missy] What? (laughs)
You think you see him?

28
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:00,123
- [Finn] Ya.

29
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:00,956
- [Missy] Where?

30
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:02,137
- [Finn] (Mumbles)

31
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:03,464
- [Missy] Oh, that right there?

32
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:05,161
That's just like an ornament Fred,

33
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:07,779
it's not the real Fred. You're so silly.

34
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:10,604
He really thought he just found him.

35
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,947
I don't know where he is right now.

36
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,204
I think we should just
get some breakfast going

37
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:17,868
and maybe we'll find him
in a little while, okay?

38
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:21,785
Today I think we're gonna make
real pancakes for breakfast.

39
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:23,754
While they're waiting for
me to make the pancakes,

40
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:26,155
I'm gonna get them some chocolate milk.

41
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:28,166
Can someone get the milk, please?

42
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,844
- [Ollie] I can get the milk for it.

43
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:31,261
- Thanks.

44
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:38,069
- [Finn] (Mumbles)

45
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,236
- [Ollie] Fred? Where are
you, Fred? Where are you?

46
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:47,817
Yeah.

47
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,173
[Missy] All right, what else do we need?

48
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:51,816
- [Ollie] (gasps) Aaah!

49
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:52,649
- [Missy] What?

50
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:53,482
- [Ollie] There!

51
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:54,700
- [Missy] How did you not see him?

52
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,375
- [Ollie] (Laughs) I thought
he was in the refrigerator

53
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,882
but he wasn't.

54
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:02,015
- [Missy] First of all, you
guys went in the fridge twice

55
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:05,057
and you never saw him, so
did he just magically appear

56
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,674
when I opened it? Or was
he there the whole time?

57
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:09,729
- You opened it, and I didn't

58
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,312
I open it, and I thought I saw,

59
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:17,137
then I grabbed the milk,
then I didn't saw Fred,

60
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,678
then you open it, and I saw Fred.

61
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:23,179
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.
That is so crazy.

62
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,919
All right, what is he doing in here?

63
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,264
So he's hanging in our fridge right now,

64
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,437
but look what's under him.

65
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,528
Look at this green stuff.

66
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:34,933
It says Elf Milk. That's his milk.

67
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,757
Like you have chocolate milk,

68
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,032
he has Elf Milk, and it's green.

69
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,222
Isn't that funny?

70
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:42,971
I wonder
- That's disgusting.

71
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:44,212
- [Missy] (laughs)

72
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:47,402
I wonder if it has magic powers in it.

73
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:50,566
He's like, I'm not drinking it, mom. Huh.

74
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,122
Don't worry, I wouldn't drink it either.

75
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:53,999
I don't know what's in that stuff.

76
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,166
He's like, no.

77
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,149
Finn, would you drink the Elf Milk?

78
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,982
- [Finn] No.

79
00:02:58,982 --> 00:02:59,815
- [Missy] No?

80
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:00,895
- (Mumbles)

81
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:02,335
- [Missy] Looks kinda weird?

82
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:03,884
Oh my goodness, I cannot believe

83
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,061
he is hanging out in our fridge.

84
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,337
If you're gonna hang out in that fridge,

85
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,835
can you grab me the milk, Fred?

86
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:10,668
- [Ollie] No.

87
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:14,054
- [Missy] (laughs) All right,
boys. Let's leave him be.

88
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:15,306
Hopefully, he doesn't get too chilly.

89
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,306
I mean, he is used to
the North Pole, right?

90
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:18,862
So he won't get too cold.

91
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:19,695
- Yeah.

92
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:21,718
- We are getting ready for the day now.

93
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,285
We ended up actually skipping church.

94
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:25,520
I spent a lot of the time yesterday

95
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,022
running around and getting
Christmas gifts and stuff.

96
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:30,338
I was like, we just
need to clean the house

97
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:34,013
and hang out and I am just so
proud of this guy right now

98
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,540
'cause you are being such a good boy.

99
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,373
- Yeah.

100
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:38,389
- [Missy] Did you just dry
mommy's dishes for her?

101
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,222
- Yeah.

102
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:42,796
- So what I normally do,
is I wash all the dishes

103
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:47,318
and then I stack them wet
over here and then I dry them.

104
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,759
But this guy offered to dry them for me

105
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,077
and he's doing such a good job.

106
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:55,311
He dries them all, and
then he puts 'em away

107
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:58,293
and I'm like wow. I'm
starting to get a kid

108
00:03:58,293 --> 00:04:01,227
who does chores and it's just so exciting.

109
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:03,642
And he already does like
cleaning up his playroom

110
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:05,167
and stuff like this,
but this is a big deal.

111
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:09,894
Like picking up these heavy
pans and drying them off for me?

112
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:12,976
That looks great! I am so proud of you.

113
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:14,056
I just think that's really exciting.

114
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:16,079
So let's set that here and
then I'll get another one.

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,431
I got a lot more to do. (laughs)

116
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,416
Can you help me with these?

117
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,147
No? You're done?

118
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:22,980
- Yeah.

119
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:25,914
- That's all I got? That's it?

120
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:29,081
You are such a good helper. Thank you.

121
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:34,036
Plus, you slept in your bed all night.

122
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:37,833
It's like you literally
are just a big boy now.

123
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,151
Anyway, my hair is crazy.

124
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:41,766
I just took a shower and it's air drying.

125
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:44,903
I'm gonna finish doing these dishes.

126
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:48,070
- Oh the places I find Luna sleeping.

127
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,026
She's so cute you guys.

128
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:54,186
Today has been kind of a busy day.

129
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:56,169
I'm getting lots of little things done

130
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,474
that I've been needing to
finish like Christmas shopping.

131
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,436
Are you guys done with Christmas shopping?

132
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,236
It's getting closer to Christmas you guys.

133
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,903
I also just talked to a muralist

134
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,075
because I'm trying to
get something really cool

135
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,502
designed Ollie and Finn's new shared room

136
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:13,226
that we're gonna be showing
to you guys next week.

137
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,715
I've been looking for
a muralist for a while,

138
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:15,855
haven't been able to get anyone.

139
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:17,324
Got someone super last minute,

140
00:05:17,324 --> 00:05:18,426
and it sounds like it's gonna work

141
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:20,957
so I'm hoping that it does and the boys

142
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:23,017
can have something really
cool designed in their room.

143
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:25,240
Speaking of design,
check this out you guys.

144
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,145
Papa brought this to me today.

145
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,074
It's like a little bowl he made.

146
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,674
And I was like oh, that
actually would work perfect

147
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:33,084
for an air plant.

148
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,179
Check that out. That's pretty cool.

149
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:37,846
(Festive music)

150
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,877
Friendly reminder for those
of you with Christmas trees

151
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:49,872
to check and see how
the water is down below.

152
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:51,112
Ours is pretty full.

153
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:52,711
Usually, we're not very
good at keeping it watered

154
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:55,861
but it's actually super
soft and luscious still.

155
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:57,112
Super surprised.

156
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:58,662
Last year our Christmas
tree around this time

157
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,850
was already starting to turn brown.

158
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,002
All right you two, what time is it?

159
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:05,064
- Peanut butter ball time.

160
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,431
- Peanut butter ball time.
Rolling peanut butter balls.

161
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,083
- Yep. Just started our first rolling.

162
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,488
- [Bryan] The holiday pastime of

163
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,958
smelling like peanut
butter until New Years.

164
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,804
- Mama, look at that
one. That one's spicy.

165
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:17,766
- [Missy] It's gonna seep into your skin.

166
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:18,599
- [Bryan] Yeah.

167
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,266
(Festive music)

168
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,001
- [Bryan] From peanut butter
balls to sugar cookie dough

169
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:33,637
and we got our own little sweet
thing over here visiting us.

170
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,225
Kelsey and June are here,

171
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:37,218
they just rolled a bunch
of peanut butter balls.

172
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:40,684
Now we're moving onto the
next Christmas classic.

173
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:43,503
- I know, we're just baking
all day today. Love it.

174
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,904
- Sugar cookies are so fun

175
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,122
because you can just make 'em all

176
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:49,920
and then the boys can just
decorate them however they want.

177
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,907
Ollie's like really enjoying
this kitchen time I feel like.

178
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:56,421
He's liking being a part
of these house duties, huh.

179
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,813
- Yeah, today he dried my dishes.

180
00:06:58,813 --> 00:06:59,646
- Oh yeah.

181
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:00,479
- Yeah?

182
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,612
- You know what that means,

183
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:03,745
pretty soon he's gonna
be taking out the trash.

184
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:05,940
That's all I'm waiting for.

185
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,222
Are you rolling out cookie dough?

186
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:08,055
- Yeah.

187
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:08,888
- Yeah.

188
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:09,721
- [Bryan] You're doing so good.

189
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,128
Hey Finn, I think we're
good on flour, dude.

190
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,795
(Festive music)

191
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:27,407
- [Bryan] Look at all these
Christmasy cookie cut-outs.

192
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:28,240
What do you guys have?

193
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,808
Which one do you have,
Ollie? Ooh, the bow.

194
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,043
And Finn, you have the stocking.

195
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:36,117
And we also have a glove,
and which one's that one?

196
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:37,025
- Snowflake.

197
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,024
- [Bryan] Ooh.

198
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,258
- So that's the sharp side.

199
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,275
You just gotta find a spot and then

200
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,443
push it down really hard.

201
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,693
Good job, Finn.

202
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:49,042
- [Bryan] Right in the
middle. Good job, Ollie.

203
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:53,035
- Usually, there's like a
plan, but that's fine. So then

204
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,461
- [Bryan] Good job, Finn.
There you go. That one works.

205
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:56,750
- [Missy] So then you can make more.

206
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,583
- [Bryan] I'm gonna do the

207
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,510
- [Missy] But you don't
wanna mess up any others.

208
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,123
- [Bryan] The gingerbread man right here.

209
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:02,670
- [Missy] Right there. Good, Finn.

210
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,379
You wanna do another one, Ollie?

211
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,037
- [Bryan] Ooh, do a
snowflake right here, Ollie.

212
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:08,291
There ya go.

213
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,958
(Festive music)

214
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,207
- [Bryan] Now you gotta peel
out all your cookie shapes

215
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:26,786
and put 'em on the pan,

216
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,980
and put them in the oven to cook them.

217
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,402
How they comin' out, babe?

218
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:32,509
- Pretty good. I've never done this kind.

219
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,701
- [Bryan] Kelsey makes her
sugar cookies from scratch.

220
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:37,177
- I do, but this is a lot easier.

221
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:38,024
- [Bryan] Yeah.

222
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,688
- [Missy] Especially with kids.

223
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,974
- [Bryan] Yeah. Those are lookin' good.

224
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:43,318
- [Missy] If they do,
we can just fix it, kay?

225
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:44,381
- [Kelsey] You can just
fix it a little bit.

226
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:47,048
(Festive music)

227
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:50,572
- Ho, ho, ho.

228
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,405
- [Bryan] Ho, ho, ho.

229
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,005
- Ho, ho, ho.

230
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,911
- [Bryan] Finn is so good
at doing the ho, ho, ho

231
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,570
ever since he did it for the song.

232
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,555
- I know. Also, if you guys have noticed

233
00:08:58,555 --> 00:09:01,743
whenever Finn sees Santa
Clause, he calls him Papa.

234
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:06,408
The reason why is because Papa
dressed up as Santa Clause

235
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:09,015
in The Nightmare Before
Christmas skit that we did.

236
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,100
- [Bryan] Yes, yeah,

237
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,756
so now every time he sees
- We just put that together

238
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:12,589
- [Bryan] (laughs)

239
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,293
- He's like um, Papa is Santa Clause.

240
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,383
I was like oh, yes.

241
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:19,146
- If you guys wanna hear
Finn sing ho, ho, ho

242
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:20,592
all cute and stuff, too, you can get

243
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:23,668
our Christmas album on iTunes right now

244
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:26,047
for only $3.99 for a limited time.

245
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,104
I'll have it in the iCard and

246
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:28,510
in the link down below in the description.

247
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,177
(Festive music)

248
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:37,121
- [Ollie] I wanna try it.

249
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,652
- [Bryan] You wanna try it? Here you go.

250
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:39,887
What do you think?

251
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:41,058
- [Finn] I try it.

252
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:42,893
- [Bryan] You wanna try it, too?

253
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:43,741
- [Missy] I wanna try it.

254
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:44,574
- [Bryan] Oh.

255
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,721
- [Missy] No. Karma gets to try it.

256
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,730
- [Bryan] Karma got to
try it before Missy.

257
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,423
There are amazing. (Oven timer)

258
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,892
- [Ollie] Done now?

259
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,180
- Mmm.

260
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,357
- But one thing is they did
not keep their shape very well.

261
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:57,395
This is how they went in the oven,

262
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:59,043
and this is how they're coming out.

263
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,460
- [Missy] This is how they're coming out,

264
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,927
and then they're even shrinking from that.

265
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:02,918
These are really poofy.

266
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:03,878
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's true.

267
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:07,878
Look at all these pretty
colors and decorations.

268
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:11,395
- Yeah, we made icing, homemade icing,

269
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:12,228
- [Bryan] Yes.

270
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,293
- and then we colored them.

271
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:17,678
We've got light blue, red,
green, and then white.

272
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:18,663
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

273
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:19,553
- [Missy] So I'm excited
to see how it turns out.

274
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,597
- [Bryan] You guys ready to decorate?

275
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:22,569
- [Boys] Yeah.

276
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:24,748
- So I'm gonna decorate
this little one right here.

277
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:27,630
I'm just gonna cover it
in a little bit of this,

278
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,104
and then I'm gonna use my
knife to spread it around okay?

279
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,357
- [Ollie] Okay, but I wanna do red.

280
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:34,766
- [Missy] Okay. You can do red.

281
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,292
- [Bryan] Is your
favorite color red, Ollie?

282
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,125
- Yeah.

283
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,860
- [Bryan] I think mama's
favorite color's blue.

284
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,466
Hey Finn, what color's your favorite?

285
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:42,299
- [Ollie] Green.

286
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,132
- Green.

287
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,234
- [Bryan] I think it is green.

288
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:45,890
He does always point to green.

289
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,834
- [Finn] (Mumbles)

290
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,501
(Festive music)

291
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:53,052
- [Bryan] All right,
now Missy is outlining

292
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,618
the snowflake with her little

293
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,389
piping bag.
- It probably

294
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,587
- [Missy] Looks so ridiculous.

295
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:59,320
- Mommy, you're doing really great.

296
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,785
- [Missy] Thank you.

297
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,952
- [Bryan] She's doing a good job, huh?

298
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:08,062
There you go, you got a green candy cane.

299
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,543
And then, Ollie, you should
do red stripes on it.

300
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:13,272
That'd be cool. There ya go.

301
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,771
Oh, Ollie's adding some sprinkles.

302
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,723
That looks good, dude.

303
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:19,875
- [Missy] No, Finn.

304
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,142
- [Bryan] There ya go, buddy.
That looks good, Ollie.

305
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,725
All right, Finn is adding some

306
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,808
Christmas tree candies to his cookie.

307
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,611
Looking really good.
Hey, guess what, Finn?

308
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:32,494
We actually did a name reveal
for your brother, Finn.

309
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:33,327
Did you know this, Ollie?

310
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,863
We did a name reveal with sugar cookies.

311
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,011
- Yep. I don't now how he did so good.

312
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:41,179
- We decorated so many sugar cookies

313
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,595
and they looked so good,
and they were like amazing,

314
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:44,498
and they came out perfect,

315
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:45,696
and we filmed a really cool video.

316
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:47,073
That's actually a very old video.

317
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,470
I'll have it linked in the
iCard so you guys can watch it.

318
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,264
But it was when we revealed Finn's name

319
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:53,113
and we had this idea to
do it with sugar cookies.

320
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:53,946
- Yeah.

321
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,629
It's funny.
- I don't know why.

322
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,623
- [Bryan] That looks
very, very good, Finn.

323
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:58,806
You did a good job.

324
00:11:58,806 --> 00:11:59,639
- [Finn] Mama.

325
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,472
- [Missy] Yeah?

326
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:01,305
- [Bryan] How's it taste, Ollie?

327
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,934
Is your creation good? Yep?

328
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:06,277
(Festive music)

329
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:09,045
- [Bryan] Check out my gingerbread man.

330
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,231
He's not a gingerbread man, though.

331
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,729
He's a sugarbread man.

332
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:15,961
He's got a green shirt
and he's got blue jeans

333
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:18,752
and lots of sprinkles,
and he's happy, obviously.

334
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:20,539
If I was a cookie, I probably
would have a permanent

335
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,963
smile on my face all the time, too.

336
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:22,862
How about you, buddy?

337
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:26,529
- No, I could be a star
with some sprinkles.

338
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:28,198
- [Bryan] (laughs)

339
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:30,865
(Festive music)

340
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:40,434
- [Missy] All right,
boys are ready for bed.

341
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:41,267
- Chewbacca.

342
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,064
- [Missy] We got Chewbacca,
and who are you, Ollie?

343
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:43,897
- Darth Vader.

344
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:44,730
- [Missy] That's right.

345
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,113
- What does Darth Vader
do? (making sound effects)

346
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:50,196
Luke, I am your father.

347
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:53,293
- [Missy] And what does Chewbacca do?

348
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:56,543
(making sound effects)

349
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:00,878
- Finn is actually wearing
a 4t outfit right now

350
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:03,456
'cause he really wanted
to wear Star Wars as well.

351
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:06,615
Bryan actually picked out
a really cute Santa pajama,

352
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:08,746
but he was like, no. If
Ollie's wearing Darth Vader,

353
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,830
then I'm wearing something Star Wars.

354
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,695
Do you know how many days?

355
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:12,917
- Uh, nine.

356
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,017
- [Missy] Eight.

357
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:14,850
- Eight?

358
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,023
- [Missy] Eight days 'till Christmas.

359
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:17,488
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh.

360
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:19,438
- Seven for you guys. One week away.

361
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:20,965
- [Bryan] Are you serious?

362
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:25,330
- [Missy] Yep. Kay. We gotta
get these down. Do, do, do.

363
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,653
- [Bryan] Grab it. Ooh,
that's a small one.

364
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:27,871
- [Missy] A tiny one.

365
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,547
- [Bryan] It's Belle.

366
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:32,083
You got this one? Ooh, that's cool.

367
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,975
It's like a storage, a tool box.

368
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:37,225
Boom. A box for your tools.

369
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,246
And it came with a blaster, too.

370
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:43,340
Hey Finn, look. Is that you?

371
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,298
- Yeah.

372
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:48,274
- That's Chewie. This is the
new book Chewie and the Porgs.

373
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:49,365
- [Missy] Should we read that one?

374
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:50,198
- Ya.

375
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:52,430
- [Bryan] Should we add
that to the ever growing

376
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,484
stack of books? (laughs)

377
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:56,317
- [Missy] Oh.

378
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:57,548
- [Bryan] Oh.

379
00:13:57,548 --> 00:14:00,965
- Wow. It was a tie. Good job. High five.

380
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,662
- [Bryan] Night, guys.

381
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:06,246
- Kids are asleep and we are enjoying

382
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,663
our beautiful Christmas home.

383
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:11,970
We love turning off the
lights and just relaxing

384
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,398
especially after the kids go to bed.

385
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:14,681
But yeah, we spent the whole day doing

386
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:16,681
traditions and just fun.

387
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,197
I love making my peanut butter balls

388
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:20,445
as hard work as they are.

389
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:23,696
- It's cool having, I
hate to say it, but ugly

390
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,088
- [Missy] Yeah (laughs)

391
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:26,921
- Christmas cookies.

392
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,096
- [Missy] Yeah, they're so funny.

393
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:30,053
- It's like no one's going to eat these.

394
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:30,886
- [Missy] No.

395
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:33,298
- These are gonna be
thrown away on December 26.

396
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,567
- We've just been having
such a fun Christmas season.

397
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,315
It's been so nice.

398
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:39,286
It's actually been pretty relaxing too.

399
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:41,355
Sometimes our Christmas season can be like

400
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:45,052
go, go, go and crazy, but
it's been really, really nice

401
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,391
and I've really enjoyed it.

402
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,847
And this whole week, we have even more

403
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,251
traditions that we're doing and
I'm just getting so excited.

404
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,587
We have like one week until
Christmas. It's so crazy.

405
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:56,562
Let me know down in the comments

406
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,770
what is your guys' favorite
Christmas tradition

407
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,300
that you guys do in your family?

408
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,199
I love making more tradition.

409
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:03,437
I feel like as the years go,

410
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,103
we're gonna start creating more.

411
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,554
And we don't even realize
that they're a tradition

412
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:08,781
until we're like, oh yeah,
we've been decorating

413
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,477
Christmas cookies every year
for the past three years.

414
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,106
I guess that's a tradition now.

415
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:14,522
I hope you guys are
having a good Christmas

416
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,978
but yeah, Bryan's making me some dinner.

417
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:19,463
- Yeah, just making some steak and pasta.

418
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:20,641
- You know, I gotta be honest, guys.

419
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,407
I've been doing a lot
more cooking, lately,

420
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:24,282
so it's pretty nice, actually

421
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:25,380
Bryan's making some dinner tonight.

422
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,290
- It's been really nice, just like

423
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,666
kind of getting taken care of for a while.

424
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,529
- Yeah, he's been working
really, really hard

425
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,807
so we've definitely been picking
up slack where it needs to.

426
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:37,853
But yeah, tonight steak
dinner sounds amazing.

427
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,002
I hope you guys enjoy today's video.

428
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,715
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did

429
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:43,079
and again, let us know in the comments

430
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,447

431
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:47,253
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

432
00:15:47,253 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Bryan And Missy] Bye. Boop.
