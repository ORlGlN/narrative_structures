1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,652
- [Bryan] Wait, you
didn't see any dinosaurs?

2
00:00:01,652 --> 00:00:05,030
Well, guess what, daddy
knows the secret spot

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,737
where we can actually see
dinosaur tracks, real ones.

4
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:09,966
- (gasps) Real ones?

5
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,477
- [Bryan] Yeah, do you wanna go see them?

6
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,077
♪ This is our life ♪

7
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:15,210
♪ Let's live it ♪

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,672
♪ Live it forever, ♪

9
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:20,172
(peppy music)

10
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:25,857
- Look at these, Dad, cool mountains!

11
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:29,288
- Good morning, guys, Ollie, where are we?

12
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:31,050
- Um, we are at the hill.

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,768
- We have driven up to Warner Valley

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,610
we're gonna do a little bit of riding.

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,635
Are you excited, babe?

16
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:39,235
- Yeah, it should be really fun.

17
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:40,068
- [Bryan] This is beautiful.

18
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:41,535
- We look like professionals.

19
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:42,675
- [Bryan] I know. (laughs)

20
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,765
Carl and Jinger loaded
up all of their bikes.

21
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,185
Look at these motorcycles, dude.

22
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:48,435
We've got ATVs.

23
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:50,896
- Yeah, it's gonna be awesome, guys.

24
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:52,112
- [Bryan] This is cool.

25
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:54,103
They just loaded up this big old trailer

26
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:55,907
with all this fun stuff
and now we get to go play.

27
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:56,740
- Yay.

28
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,656
- [Bryan] This is like
a playground right here.

29
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,229
Playground of beauty.

30
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,812
(upbeat music)

31
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,595
If it wasn't too long of a drive up here,

32
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:11,099
but it was just long enough
that Finn fell asleep.

33
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,950
I'm actually gonna let him
get a little bit of a nap,

34
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,228
and we have the windows cracked

35
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:18,326
so we can hear him when he wakes up.

36
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:19,481
- We need training wheels for this thing.

37
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,314
- [Bryan] I know, right?

38
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,160
- He could drive it if
we had training wheels.

39
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,626
- [Bryan] Totally. (laughs)
That would be so cute,

40
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,374
seeing him on a motorcycle.

41
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:28,874
(peppy music)

42
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:46,401
Good morning, buddy.

43
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:47,765
- Yep, he's like, "Where are we?"

44
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,234
- [Bryan] You wanna go racing?

45
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,190
- Yeah.

46
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,803
- So, we are getting
ready to hop on some ATVs

47
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:54,238
and do some riding out here.

48
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:58,685
Carl and Jinger are doing
a ATV versus RC car,

49
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,153
so definitely go check
that out on their channel.

50
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,722
I'll have it linked above in the i card.

51
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,423
And then, actually, we have a little bit

52
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:07,212
of a prehistoric surprise
for Ollie and Finn,

53
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:08,645
so don't miss that coming up.

54
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,197
- Motorcycles are cool!

55
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,768
- [Bryan] Vroom, vroom!

56
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:15,868
These boys are ready to
go riding, aren't you?

57
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:17,752
Alright, Gage, what are you riding here?

58
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:19,919
- I am riding a Honda 125.

59
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,641
- [Bryan] A Honda 125,
this is Gage's bike.

60
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:27,966
And then Luke, yours is so
cool, dude, it's like green.

61
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:29,980
- This is a Honda 110--

62
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,486
- That's not a Honda, that's a Kawasaki!

63
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,220
- [Bryan] (laughing) You guys are funny.

64
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,170
What are you riding, dude?

65
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,611
This looks so cool, this little 50.

66
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:39,372
- Yamaha TTR 50.

67
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:41,035
- [Bryan] Yeah, this thing is awesome.

68
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,643
How long have you been riding, dude?

69
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:44,485
- Um, about four months.

70
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:46,109
- [Bryan] Right on, that's awesome.

71
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,159
I can't wait 'til we can get Ollie

72
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,284
on one of these, you know?

73
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,240
- Dude, I just really
was wanting to get some

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,447
training wheels on this one.

75
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:52,413
- [Bryan] I know. (laughs)

76
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,671
- It would just be so cute!

77
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,962
- [Bryan] Yeah, it really would be.

78
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,443
Alright, you guys gonna show us around?

79
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,276
- Yeah

80
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:58,109
- [Bryan] Okay.

81
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,859
(engine revving)

82
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:04,401
- Let's go!

83
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:07,118
(upbeat music)

84
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:08,701
I see pterodactyls.

85
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,784
- [Missy] Ollie, what'd you find?

86
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:28,034
- A dinosaur egg.

87
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:31,737
- [Missy] Wow, what kind of
dinosaur you think's in there?

88
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:34,708
- I can't really open it, too hard.

89
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,062
- [Missy] Aww man.

90
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,818
- Alright, before I hop on the ATV,

91
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,401
Finn's gotta warm it up for me.

92
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,245
- We made it.

93
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:44,506
- [Bryan] What do you think,
that's pretty cool, huh?

94
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:48,173
Oh, he's like, "Oh,
that was a little much."

95
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,602
- Wanna keep going, go
fast, no, no thanks.

96
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,020
- [Bryan] There you go, dude.

97
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,380
- Hang on right here, there you go, ready?

98
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,213
(engine revving)

99
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:03,232
- [Bryan] Hang on, both hands!

100
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:04,601
- We'll just go slow and be careful.

101
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,838
- [Bryan] Okay.

102
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:08,338
(peppy music)

103
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:14,704
Missy's getting ready to hop on her bike.

104
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,787
And here comes the Ollie.

105
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:20,887
Oh, watch out for the RC car.

106
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,054
Was that cool?

107
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:23,756
- Yes.

108
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,324
- [Bryan] Pretty awesome, huh?

109
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,157
- Yeah.

110
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:28,118
- [Bryan] Woo, he's
like, "That was bumpy."

111
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:30,193
- Kind of a bumpy ride.

112
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:31,215
- [Bryan] Say, "Thank you, Carl."

113
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:33,520
- Thank you, Carl,
- You're welcome, buddy.

114
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,466
- All the way down is first.

115
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,706
- [Carl] All the way down is first

116
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,430
and then you've got second, third, fourth,

117
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,851
all the way up, yeah.

118
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:39,684
- Yeah.

119
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:40,517
- [Carl] So you're gonna
go, there's five gears.

120
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:44,499
Be really careful, dude, here goes -- oh!

121
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:45,922
Everybody does that
their first time, dude.

122
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:49,545
It's totally normal. (laughing)

123
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:50,628
Here he goes!

124
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,837
Yeah, awesome!

125
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:58,736
Here goes Missy on her
first dirt bike ride.

126
00:04:58,736 --> 00:04:59,986
Yeah, good job!

127
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,144
And off she goes.

128
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:06,424
- Hold the shift, just
pull there and pull off.

129
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:08,043
- [Carl] So far, so good.

130
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:10,093
How's it feel, Bryan?

131
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,806
Oh, off he goes again,
he doesn't even care,

132
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:13,306
he's going for it.

133
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,946
You're doing awesome, Missy!

134
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:19,660
What are you guys doing, kyle's out here

135
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,153
with Finley right now, oh,
they're racing RC cars!

136
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,647
That looks fun, this is your red one?

137
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:26,480
- Yup.

138
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,362
- [Carl] It's going so
fast it looks awesome.

139
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,114
Here it comes on a jump!

140
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,614
Whoa, peeling out!

141
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:37,142
Whoa, there it goes,
that's fast, huh Finn?

142
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:38,006
- Yeah.

143
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,810
- [Carl] Yeah, it's
going really fast, huh?

144
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,643
- Yeah.

145
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:43,476
(energetic music)

146
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:15,710
- [Carl] How's it feel, bro?

147
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,703
- That's so cool.

148
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:17,666
- [Carl] It's really fun, huh?

149
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,161
- Those little tracks are so neat.

150
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:19,994
- [Carl] Yeah, they're awesome.

151
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:21,846
It's just like a motocross track out here

152
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:24,679
everywhere you look, it's so cool.

153
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:27,827
Woo.

154
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:29,386
- I'm here to pick you up.

155
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:30,219
- [Carl] What?

156
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,052
- I've come to pick you up.

157
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:31,885
- [Carl] Are you really?

158
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,305
Let's go for a ride, dude!

159
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,972
(playful music)

160
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:44,246
- The camera is filthy, you guys.

161
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:46,075
Carl rode up to the
middle of that mountain

162
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:47,045
and was getting some
good footage of me going

163
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,241
through all the cool,
like motocross sports,

164
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,525
and everything is so dirty.

165
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:53,228
I'm very, very dusty, this red dirt,

166
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:57,145
is like, so interesting, too,
never seen anything like that.

167
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:59,472
Not in Idaho, not in California.

168
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:01,629
So it's very interesting being out here,

169
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,967
riding on the red dirt. (laughs)

170
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:04,468
But yeah, the kids are having a blast,

171
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:06,778
Missy's having a blast,
and we're just finishing

172
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:08,495
up some riding so we can take the boys

173
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,544
to our special surprise.

174
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,896
Finn, you love wearing the helmet?

175
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:12,729
- Yeah.

176
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:13,562
- [Bryan] Yeah.

177
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,229
It's like, actually too heavy for him.

178
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,847
And he has trouble walking but he does not

179
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,375
want to take it off. (laughs)

180
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,768
You're so cute, dude.

181
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:20,935
- Hi, man.

182
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:22,356
- [Bryan] Hey.

183
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:25,832
- Ask us why we just went
to the dinosaur section.

184
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,521
- [Bryan] Wait, you
didn't see any dinosaurs?

185
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:30,701
- Yeah, but we just went
to the dinosaur section.

186
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,934
- [Bryan] Oh, you did?

187
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:32,767
- Yeah.

188
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:33,648
- [Bryan] Well, guess what?

189
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:34,481
- What?

190
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,365
- [Bryan] Daddy knows the secret spot

191
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:40,235
where we can actually see
dinosaur tracks, real ones.

192
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:41,255
- (gasps) Real ones?

193
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:42,397
- [Bryan] Yeah, do you wanna go see them?

194
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:44,730
- Yeah, I see a pterodactyl!

195
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:49,069
- [Bryan] That is actually a bird.

196
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,275
Did you know that. (laughs)

197
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,338
It's funner when they're
pterodactyls, huh?

198
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:57,088
(dramatic music)

199
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,726
- We are now taking the
drive to the dinosaur tracks,

200
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,620
and we are so excited.

201
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,368
Everyone else took ATVs and motorcycles,

202
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:08,034
but there aren't quite enough for everyone

203
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:09,299
so we thought we'll just take the truck

204
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:13,449
and it does feel like we
are off-roading a little.

205
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,816
- Pretty bumpy,
- Yeah.

206
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,120
- [Bryan] You excited to see dinosaurs?

207
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,104
- [Both] Yeah!

208
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:18,412
- Well, we're not gonna see dinosaurs,

209
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:19,245
cause they're all dead.

210
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,129
But we're gonna see their
tracks, it's so cool, Ollie.

211
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:23,874
There used to be dinosaurs
living in this area.

212
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,106
Isn't that nuts?

213
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:28,271
- Were they just nice dinosaurs?

214
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:30,144
- I think they were
probably mean dinosaurs,

215
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,712
but they're gone now, you
don't have to worry about that.

216
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,210
- You don't have to worry about it.

217
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,844
- [Missy] But they're gonna
be, big, huge dinosaur feet.

218
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:40,984
Wouldn't that be cool,
and they're real ones.

219
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:43,114
- Well, are you gonna come with me?

220
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:43,947
- [Missy] Yep, I'm coming with you.

221
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:45,815
I'll be with you the whole time, kay?

222
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:49,056
And look how beautiful this drive is.

223
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:53,165
This whole area is just
so crazy magnificent.

224
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,915
(dramatic music)

225
00:08:57,007 --> 00:09:00,063
- [Bryan] He's so excited
to see dino tracks.

226
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:01,230
- Attacks, on.

227
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:04,323
- [Bryan] We no longer have
a black truck, by the way.

228
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:06,474
It is now red, that is
the color of our truck.

229
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:07,552
We've accepted it.

230
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:10,219
(ominous music)

231
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:16,723
- I did not see tracks, come on you guys.

232
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,954
- They're up this way, let's go.

233
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:20,921
These are real dinosaur
tracks, guys, not fake.

234
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,002
The real thing.

235
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:24,307
- [Bryan] Woo, ollie is so excited.

236
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:27,110
(dramatic music)

237
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,277
- Hey guys, I see them, walk
down the trails, let's go!

238
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:34,573
- They're right here, guys.

239
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,047
I can see the tracks on
the ground right here.

240
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:37,880
Look at this.

241
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,666
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh.

242
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,526
- That's a real track.

243
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:42,359
Look, you can see right
where it ran through.

244
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,755
- [Bryan] Wow, look at this one.

245
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:45,829
Wow!

246
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,841
- So the first ones, come way back here,

247
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,633
and then you can see where it ran.

248
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,050
Like right, left,

249
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:53,984
right, left,

250
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:57,832
and then this piece you
know, going the other way.

251
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:58,919
Isn't that crazy,
- [Bryan] Crazy.

252
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,405
- See, they go all the
way up through here.

253
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,936
- [Bryan] Look at that, Missy.

254
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,521
Ollie, do you see this, look at this.

255
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,644
See this outline right here?

256
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:06,577
- [Ollie] Yeah.

257
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:09,227
- [Bryan] That is a dinosaur track.

258
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:10,060
That's crazy.

259
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,558
- Crazy that it's still there.

260
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:13,409
- You wanna check out the raptor ones?

261
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,227
We are literally walking with dinosaurs

262
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:17,304
right now, you guys,
they walked in this spot.

263
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:21,205
That's just crazy, oh, so
they have some information

264
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,471
about the dinosaurs
that were in this area.

265
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:25,804
So this was a Megapnosaurus.

266
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:28,790
Big, dead lizard.

267
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,720
About six to eight feet long.

268
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,797
- And this is the bigger one.

269
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,738
- [Bryan] That's a Dilophosaurus, yep.

270
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:37,787
- Dilophosaurus lives in
this area, that's so cool!

271
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:41,461
- [Bryan] I know, these were
the dinosaurs in this area.

272
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,664
So cool, so there's more over here?

273
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:45,517
- Yeah there's little
ones, like the small one

274
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,305
that was six feet, you can see its tracks.

275
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:49,280
It looks like a little
chicken ran through.

276
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
- Wow, ollie, come look!

277
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,969
How is this all so preserved?

278
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,791
- So this used to be like, a huge,

279
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,024
ancient lake bed millions of years ago,

280
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,185
and then all of a sudden it
just dried up really fast,

281
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:04,094
and all the mud and clay
just petrified into sandstone

282
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:07,367
so it preserved the last
footprints of the last dinosaurs

283
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,609
that ran through here.

284
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:09,442
- [Bryan] Wow.

285
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:10,636
- See this little three-toed one?

286
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,868
- [Bryan] Oh, wow, yeah.

287
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,774
- [Carl] Here, and then here's
the next step right there.

288
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,625
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

289
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,830
- [Carl] And then you can see
all the way up towards Missy.

290
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,413
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, that's incredible.

291
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,437
- That's so crazy.

292
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:22,852
- [Bryan] Wow.

293
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:26,019
(inspirational music)

294
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:30,261
You are touching history, Ollie.

295
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,976
Finn, put your hand in
there, look at that, dude!

296
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,975
You are crawling where
dinosaurs once roamed.

297
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,006
Isn't that amazing, Finn?

298
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:37,839
- Yeah!

299
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,422
(upbeat music)

300
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:46,565
(dinosaur roaring)

301
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:47,564
- [Bryan] More over here?

302
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:50,731
Whoa, look at these tracks right here.

303
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:56,578
Ollie, can you imagine a
dinosaur running through this?

304
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:58,621
How cool would that be, you see these?

305
00:11:58,621 --> 00:11:59,454
(gasping)

306
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:01,012
Put your hand in there,
Ollie, these are almost

307
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:05,070
as big as your hand,
yeah, isn't that neat?

308
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,313
- [Missy] Look at that
one right there, Ollie.

309
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:07,738
- [Bryan] These ones are
way smaller than those

310
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:09,933
other big dinosaur tracks
that were over there.

311
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,100
It's a little dinosaur, huh?

312
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,464
- Let's go over here.

313
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,814
- [Bryan] What do you think's over here?

314
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,484
- Scary dinosaurs.

315
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:19,888
(playful music)

316
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:21,169
Look at that snake.

317
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:22,917
- [Bryan] Whoa I gotta pick up this, oh,

318
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:26,529
that's not a snake, that's
juat a stick. (laughs)

319
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,386
Oh, wow, you guys, ollie
just found a dig site.

320
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:31,396
- [Missy] What is that, Ollie?

321
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:32,376
- It's a fossil!

322
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,104
- [Bryan] It is a fossil, huh?

323
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:34,937
- Yeah!

324
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:36,262
- Yeah.

325
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:37,279
- [Bryan] Do you see it, Ollie?

326
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,469
Clean it up, what do you see?

327
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:39,719
- I don't know.

328
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,300
- [Missy] Is it a head?

329
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,187
- I see a head.

330
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:45,375
- [Bryan] It definitely looks
like a dinosaur head, huh?

331
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,207
- Wait, what's that, that thing?

332
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:50,575
I think I got the nose of the dinosaur.

333
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:51,408
- [Bryan] Really?

334
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:53,061
- Keep digging, keep digging.

335
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,643
- [Bryan] Keep doing it, Kyle.

336
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,297
I wanna see an actual dinosaur head.

337
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,309
- [Kyle] These are his eyes.

338
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,233
- [Bryan] That's where his eyes were?

339
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,816
(upbeat music)

340
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:10,046
There we go, now we got some good tools.

341
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:14,522
(upbeat music)

342
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:21,736
(dinosaur roaring)

343
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:29,426
- [Bryan] We are having an
after-riding dance club.

344
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:32,211
As if these boys didn't
burn off enough energy.

345
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,474
- Oh, we had so much fun today.

346
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,775
- [Bryan] I know, was that so
cool, riding around, Ollie?

347
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:36,608
- Yeah!

348
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,498
- [Bryan] Yeah, look at
him in his Christmas PJs.

349
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:41,584
He's so excited, (laughs) woo!

350
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:44,737
Ollie's a good dancer, a lot
of times he's just on his head.

351
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:48,285
