20
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:38,846
- They are so excited right now,

21
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:42,287
'cause I'm pretty sure they

22
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:43,120
- Yeah.

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,080

24
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,160
and so were gonna go see what he's doing.

00:00:47,993 --> 00:00:48,826

00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,284
- Yeah, come on!

28
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,539
You got a Star Wars shirt?

30
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:56,385

31
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:57,556

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,264
- We're gonna go see it.

35
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:02,549
- Fred!

36
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:03,507
- Where's he at?

37
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:05,007
- What's he doing?

38
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:07,122
He's in the...

39
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:10,158
Oh he left a note you guys!

40
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:11,308
- Oh my goodness!

41
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:12,593

42
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:13,426
- What Ollie?

43
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:14,259
- Read it!

44
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,833
- Okay, the note says, "Help!

45
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:19,245
The dark side has taken me hostage."

46
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,333
(gasping)

47
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,745
"You must find BB-8 to
help defeat Darth Vader.

48
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:26,304
You're my only hope, Ollie and Finn."

49
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:27,551
Fred.

50
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:28,835
- You guys have to save Fred.

51
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,752
- Darth Vader has him held captive.

52
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:34,538
You guys want to help save Fred today?

53
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:35,420
- Yeah.

54
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,713
- That means that we have to be

55
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,139
a part of the good side, okay?

56
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,474
No bad side okay?

57
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,764
Only the good side.

58
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:41,759
Put your hand in Finn!

59
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,592
Okay.

60
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:44,150
On three, say use the force okay?

61
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,615
- Use the force!

62
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:46,689
- One, two, three,

63
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,398
use the force!

64
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:50,008
(laughing)

65
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:51,019
- Alright, we're gonna be

66
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,297
on the good side today,
and we're gonna go see

67
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:53,255
Star Wars okay?

68
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:54,088
- Yeah.

69
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:55,285
- You gotta save Fred, right?

70
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,118
- Yeah.

71
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:57,631
- K, lets go get ready.

72
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,548
(bells playing)

73
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,990
- Check out Ollie's Star Wars shirt!

74
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,499
- I'm so excited to see Star Wars!

75
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:17,966
- I know, me too buddy,

76
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:19,003
I love your shirt.

77
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:20,304
Look, its got stormtroopers.

78
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:23,356
It says merry force be with you.

79
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,738
(laughing)

80
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,416
- It has Darth Vader on it.

81
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,929
- Oh Darth Vader he's the one that

82
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:31,232
messed with Fred, our elf, huh?

83
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:32,360
- Yeah!

84
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,615
- Yeah. Hey Finley,

85
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,532
I like your shirt dude!

86
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:39,767
Is that the bad guy?

87
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:40,774
- Yeah.

88
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:41,607
- Yeah!

89
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:42,911
- Darth Vader!

90
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:46,727
- Yeah, my shirt has Star
Wars characters on it too huh?

91
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:48,539
(laughs)

92
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,376
You're so cute.

93
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:50,615
That's Han Solo!

94
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:51,580
Too soon.

95
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,830
Missy is rocking her Santa,

96
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:55,815
- R2-D2!

97
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:57,565
- R2-D2. Yep.

98
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,511
- I'm going old school.

99
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:00,893
- Yeah. Looking good babe.

100
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:02,584
She's mixing Christmas with Star Wars,

101
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:04,084
for the Star Wars movie today.

102
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:08,128
I am so excited for Star
Wars today, you guys.

103
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,462
I have been looking
forward to this day for

104
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:11,539
a really long time, really
excited about the movie,

105
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,444
I love that Ollie is so into it,

106
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,777
its one of those things it's like,

107
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:17,976
a dad taking his kid to Star Wars,

108
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:19,346
I think that's, there's something

109
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:22,029
really iconic about that,
and I'm like, so happy.

110
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:22,862
Hey dude!

111
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:23,883
I was just talking about how

112
00:03:23,883 --> 00:03:25,466
we're going to Star Wars.

113
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,299
You excited?

114
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,132
- Yeah.

115
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:27,965
- What are you doing?

116
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:28,798
- Just playing.

117
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:29,631
- Okay.

118
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:30,975
Alright, so we have to try and

119
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:32,654
find BB-8, right Ollie?

120
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:33,487
- Yeah.

121
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:35,196
- And maybe our little Christmas cage here

122
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,495
can actually be of some
use, and we can catch

123
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:39,659
something that we need
to help Fred, right?

124
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:40,532
- Yeah.

125
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,287
- So, we have set a trap,

126
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:44,791
for BB-8, and we have got...

127
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,830
- Is it under the trap?

128
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,418
- Yep, its under there.

129
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:48,928
So we have our Christmas
cage hanging up there,

130
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,512
- We've got WD-40 as his like drink right?

131
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:53,372
Nuts and bolts,

132
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:54,586
- Nuts and bolts, so,

133
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:55,421
- I feel like thats a good bait.

134
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,002
- You think we can catch BB-8 with this?

135
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:57,835
- Yeah.

136
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,733
- Well we really need to catch BB-8,

137
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,204
because that's what Fred said we do.

138
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:02,375
We gotta save our Elf on the shelf.

139
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,958
(upbeat music)

140
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,384
Alright, so as you guys know,

141
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,505
we are on the lookout for BB-8,

142
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:10,012
so we just got out of the Disney Store,

143
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:13,293
and I picked up my friend, Poe Dameron!

144
00:04:13,293 --> 00:04:15,708
Because Poe and BB-8 are besties, right?

145
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,541
- Yeah.

146
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,288
- You are the cutest
little pilot ever dude.

147
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:19,120
Look at this pilot suit we just grabbed.

148
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,953
(laughs)

149
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:22,715
Looking good man.

150
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:23,709
Alright, lets go!

151
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,332
He is so excited to see the new movie,

152
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,334
and so am I.

153
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,876
We're headed in now.

154
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:31,459
(heroic music)

155
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,588
And we just got out of seeing Star Wars,

156
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:41,660
The Last Jedi, Ollie what did you think?

157
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,910
Of the movie?

158
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,743
- Good.

159
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:44,803
- And who was your favorite character?

160
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:45,684
- Kylo Ren!

161
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,031
- Kylo Ren.

162
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:48,809
Always rooting for the bad guy, huh?

163
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:49,808
(laughing)

164
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:51,727
I think he knows, secretly,

165
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:54,137
in his heart, that he's q good guy, right?

166
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:55,127
Ollie sees the good in everyone.

167
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,802
- I mean, right now you're a good guy,

168
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:58,912
and good guys have to
help save Fred, right?

169
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,374
- Yeah.

170
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:01,629
(laughing)

171
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,344
He's been wearing his costume all day,

172
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,016
he sat through the whole movie.

173
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,014
- He loves it

174
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,712
- He loved it, it was a
really, really fun time.

175
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:10,821
- We're home, I missed you Finn!

176
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:13,147
I'm so bummed that he didn't get to go.

177
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,982
But we're home now, its so nice out!

178
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:19,095
It feels like chilly, but
not that cold, you know.

179
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:21,482
The boys are kind of
on a mission right now,

180
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,363
to find BB-8, 'cause Fred told us

181
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:25,565
to find BB-8, and we
haven't seen him yet, right?

182
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:26,398
- Yeah.

183
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:27,231
- We're kind of just looking
around the chicken coop,

184
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:28,572
check on the chickens, and hopefully

185
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:30,889
we can find BB-8 soon.

186
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,889
(chirps and clicks)

187
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,230
- Alright, we got one
egg from the chickens,

188
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,145
we played outside for a little bit,

189
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:46,156
and we had a ton of fun,
its so nice out there.

190
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:49,412
The weather is nice, and yeah.

191
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,085
Ollie did you hear that noise?

192
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:51,918
- Yeah.

193
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,963
- What do you think it was?

194
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:53,796
- I don't know.

195
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:57,274
- Maybe, it's what we've
been looking for all day.

196
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,297
What?

197
00:05:58,297 --> 00:05:59,558
Come here, come here!

198
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:00,821
- [Bryan] He's caught!

199
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:01,654
- BB-8!!

200
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,687
- Oh my goodness.

201
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:08,077
- BB-8, what are you doing in there?

202
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,711
Wait, that's not BB-8, Ollie.

203
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:12,606
That's Santa BB-8, he's
wearing a Christmas hat.

204
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,703
- Aww!

205
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:15,539
- He does not like being this cage.

206
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,723
Let's take this cage off him huh?

207
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:17,556
- Yeah.

208
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:19,125
- I can't believe we caught BB-8.

209
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,241
Okay, Fred told us to find him.

210
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:22,624
- [Bryan] Gonna set BB-8 ...

211
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:26,214
- And our little, and our bait worked!

212
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:27,047
Hi BB-8.

213
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:30,402
(baby squeals)

214
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:31,235
(laughs)

215
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:33,051
- Go see him, say hi.

216
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,963
- BB-8, please help us.

217
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:38,384
Fred told us that you could
help us save him, right?

218
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:39,217
- Yeah.

219
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:42,253
- BB-8, how can you help us save Fred?

220
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:45,072
(beep and chirps)

221
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,944
- Okay, we'll follow you.

222
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:49,444
I think we have to follow him.

223
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,509
Let's see where he's going.

224
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,346
I guess we're going this way.

225
00:06:58,346 --> 00:06:59,522
You gotta follow him.

226
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:00,355
- Let's follow BB-8.

227
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:02,204
- I hope he helps us save Fred, huh?

228
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,342
- Yeah!

229
00:07:03,342 --> 00:07:05,833
Okay BB-8 we came to Ollie's room,

230
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,666
what's in here?

231
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,499
Ahh!

232
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:08,332
(laughs)

233
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:09,589
He almost ran into you.

234
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:11,139
you guy's he's coming this way, come on.

235
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,453
- Follow BB-8, let's see
if he leads us to Fred.

236
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,536
(laughs)

237
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:20,382
- Going in our room?

238
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:21,361
- Where's he going?

239
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:22,216
Come on boys.

240
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:23,808
I think he's headed in here.

241
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:25,844
BB-8 what are you trying to tell us?

242
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:27,353
Where do we go?

243
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,495
(laughs)

244
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:31,495
Where do we go BB-8, where do we go?

245
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,355
I mean does BB-8 even
know where he's going?

246
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,407
Okay, hang on he's taking
us somewhere else now.

247
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:40,798
Where are we going?

248
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:42,267
(gasps)

249
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:43,530
- Mama, what's Kylo Ren doing?

250
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,334
- Oh my goodness.

251
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,565
What is going on here?

252
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,982
Is that Kylo Ren?

253
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,470
And he's got Fred!

254
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:53,838
- Oh no!

255
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,548
- Fred are you okay?

256
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:57,424
You know what, I think BB-8 is telling us

257
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:58,565
what we need to do.

258
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,481
We need to defeat Kylo Ren!

259
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,648
(screams)

260
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,261
- Kylo Ren is still a bad guy huh?

261
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,156
- Yeah!

262
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:11,060
- Yes, he's a bad guy, who has
not treated Fred very nice.

263
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,454
- We saved you Fred.

264
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,411
You can go home now when you need to.

265
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,183
At least we had BB-8, Santa BB-8 here to

266
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:19,664
help us find Fred and save him huh?

267
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:20,598
- Yeah.

268
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,186
- That was crazy.

269
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:23,898
- Are you okay Fred?

270
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:26,538
- Are you okay, I think he's okay, bud.

271
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:27,371
Luckily --

272
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:28,984
- What about BB-8 Santa?

273
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,939
- We should tell him thank you.

274
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:32,530
- Say thank you BB-8 guys.

275
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,119
- Thank you BB-8!

276
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:37,172
(beeps and chirps)

277
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:38,797
- Awwwww.

278
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:41,236
(laughs)

279
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:44,069
Finn, you want to give BB-8 a hug?

280
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:45,941
- Awwwww.

281
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,303
How sweet.

282
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,723
(happy Christmas music)

283
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,149
BB-8, why are you so cool?

284
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,700
- Huge thanks to BB-8 for helping us

285
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,148
save our Elf on a Shelf Fred today.

286
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,698
That was so nice of him huh boys?

287
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:02,878
- [Both] Yeah.

288
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:03,734
(laughs)

289
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,887
- Do you guys want to play
with him a little bit?

290
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,761
Here, go chase him.

291
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,738
- Whoa.

292
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,292
- I got him.

293
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:11,625
- There he goes.

294
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,011
- Go get him, go get him boys!

295
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,610
- Get ya.

296
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,710

297
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,627
- I got ya!

298
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:27,061
Awww, you guys chasing each other.

299
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,587
You guys are gonna be like,
best friends after this.

300
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:32,897
Cool, you have like your
own little robot now.

301
00:09:32,897 --> 00:09:34,731
- BB-8, stormtroopers!

302
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,161
(gasps)

303
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:37,624
Turn yours on Finn.

304
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,621
(laughs)

305
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,639
- Ohhhh!

306
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,676
Why are they so cute?!

307
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:44,790
Turn your lightsaber on.

308
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,123
Oh, there it is.

309
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,835
- Alright guys, Santa
BB-8 has to go back to the

310
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:51,550
North Pole and charge up.

311
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,496
So say goodbye.

312
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:53,676
- Bye bye!!

313
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,078
- Bye, say bye BB-8.

314
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,462
- Bye BB-8.

315
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:58,358
(laughs)

316
00:09:58,358 --> 00:09:59,946
- Say bye Finn.

317
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:00,779
- Bye.

318
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,529
- Bye, thanks for all your help.

319
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,279
(dramatic music)

320
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,279
- I cannot stop thinking about the new

321
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,239
Star Wars movie you guys, the Last Jedi.

322
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,809
It was so good and I gotta say

323
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,952
I am a new Star Wars fan.

324
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:30,785
I've just been watching for like

325
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:32,365
the past three years or so.

326
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,202
But it was just such a great movie,

327
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:36,037
I just loved like the humor,

328
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:38,556
I loved the emotion, I loved the message.

329
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:39,780
There was a part in the movie and

330
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,540
I'm not gonna give anything away, but.

331
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,002
There was a part in the movie where

332
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,119
she said: this is how we're gonna win.

333
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,694
Not by destroying what we hate,

334
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:49,610
but by saving what we love.

335
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,283
And I think that's such a great message

336
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,670
for this day and age.

337
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,627
Because negativity is something that's

338
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:56,214
really easy to attract.

339
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:59,232
I feel like to our culture and our people.

340
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:02,000
And if you really stop and look around,

341
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,991
I think you'll see that
love is really everywhere.

342
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:06,462
And we just kinda need to save that,

343
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:09,149
and hold on to that and believe in that.

344
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:10,331
So that was really cool.

345
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:11,164
That was a really cool message.

346
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:13,586
It was just one of those
full circle moments.

347
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,218
Being able to experience the duality.

348
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,277
So, it was really cool.

349
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:18,641
But, anyway I think that's
all for today's blog.

350
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:19,617
