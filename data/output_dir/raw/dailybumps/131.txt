1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,235
- [Missy] Finn, what are you looking for?

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:03,068
- Water!

3
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:04,450
- [Missy] Water?

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,302
- Yeah.

5
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:06,238
- Say, thank you.

6
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:07,738
- Thank you, mama.

7
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:09,864
- I love you, Finn!

8
00:00:09,864 --> 00:00:10,870
Wow!

9
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,983
And you're learning some new sword moves.

10
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:14,305
That's very cool, dude.

11
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,769
You're like a ninja.

12
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,330
Like a real-life ninja.

13
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,183
♫ This is our life

14
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:20,281
♫ This is our fun

15
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:22,478
♫ This is who we are

16
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:24,022
♫ This is our dream

17
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:25,282
♫ This is our team

18
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:27,559
♫ Shot among the stars

19
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,874
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

20
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:32,246
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

21
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:33,464
♫ This is our life

22
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:35,498
♫ Let's live it

23
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:38,708
♫ Live it forever!

24
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,958
- Good morning, my little Ghostbusters!

25
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:44,132
Are you a ghost buster today?

26
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:45,231
- No.

27
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:49,011
- And Finn is back to
being a marshmallow ghost.

28
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,636
I'm the ghostbuster guy.

29
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:51,937
[Missy] You are the ghostbuster guy.

30
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:52,923
Are you getting him?

31
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:55,255
- Yeah, I have claws.

32
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,088
- [Missy] Yeah.

33
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:57,634
They have been playing all morning,

34
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:00,681
and they've been loving
their ghostbuster costumes.

35
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,225
They actually have so many costumes now

36
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,462
that, like, whatever they
wanna be, they can be.

37
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:05,295
(laughs)

38
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:06,129
It's pretty cute.

39
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:09,052
Yes, we're enjoying some
beautiful weather today.

40
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:11,385
It is literally so nice out.

41
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:15,835
It is just cool weather,
beautiful weather,

42
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:17,782
crisp weather...

43
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:18,615
Jump!

44
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,482
And I think this boy has a little poopy.

45
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,147
I better go change your bottom, huh?

46
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:24,936
Anyways, we're just enjoying this really,

47
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:25,994
really nice weather.

48
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:27,092
Getting some work done.

49
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:29,130
Planning to have a pretty fun day.

50
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,267
What should we do today, Ollie?

51
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,431
- Go to Peyt and Liv's.

52
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,785
- You always want to go
to Peyt and Liv's, huh?

53
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:35,720
- Yeah!

54
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,059
Alright, we'll see what
they're doing today, okay?

55
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,134
Boys are down for a quick, little nap.

56
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:40,269
Well, Finn's down for his nap,

57
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:42,382
and Ollie is doing probably
just a quick, little nap.

58
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:46,895
I got Elf on for the first
time this Christmas season,

59
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:48,721
because it is Christmas season right now.

60
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,554
Officially.

61
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:51,240
I haven't decorated yet,

62
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,355
but I am looking forward
to it really soon.

63
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:56,188
And, I've got cookies in the oven!

64
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,062
Yum!

65
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:00,671
I have been working off the
same batch for a few days now.

66
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:03,093
I made cookie dough and
I've just been making

67
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:04,604
like one little batch at a time.

68
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:07,177
And then we spend like a
couple days like eating these.

69
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:09,176
And they are so good!

70
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:11,643
They're like better if
you let the cookie dough

71
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:13,382
like sit in the fridge a little bit.

72
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,571
And then I've also got oatmeal cookies,

73
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,066
which is Bryan's, like
one of his favorites.

74
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,386
I really like cookie-- oatmeal too.

75
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:22,568
But, these ones are the best!

76
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:25,735
(happy, upbeat music)

77
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:34,659
- Oh, hey guys!

78
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:35,492
How is it goin?

79
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:37,485
I've been working in my office
a little bit this morning.

80
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:38,808
Cause it's Monday.

81
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:40,880
I had a bunch of emails,
but now I'm all done.

82
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,405
But I just realized, my wall
plant is not doing very well.

83
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:48,428
As you can see, this one down
here is just completely dead.

84
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:49,487
No matter how much I water it,

85
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:51,316
I just don't think it was doing well.

86
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:52,819
This one's doing really good.

87
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,364
That one's doing okay.

88
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:55,790
That one not so much.

89
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,453
And that one's doing good up there.

90
00:02:57,453 --> 00:02:59,444
So, it's like, I could
probably take the ones

91
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:02,368
that are not doing very
good out and replace them.

92
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:04,930
But, I'm just like worried
about keeping up on this.

93
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,801
I think I'm gonna take this down.

94
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,200
Just get some nice shelves,
so I have a little bit more

95
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,825
storage for books and stuff.

96
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,181
I'm always changing out
my office I feel like.

97
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,049
I feel like it's almost
getting to the point

98
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,632
where it could be done.

99
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:18,178
And, you know what, maybe it's never done.

100
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,194
And maybe that's okay.

101
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:20,898
Maybe that's the point
of having your own home,

102
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:22,116
is it's never done.

103
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:24,960
It's kind of always in transition
and always getting better.

104
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,339
And that's okay, cause it's our home.

105
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,195
Hey, dude!

106
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:28,815
Come over here and give me a big, fat hug!

107
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:30,356
I love you.

108
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:31,534
- I love you, too.

109
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:32,631
- What are you doing?

110
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:36,008
- I was waking up from, from my--

111
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:36,944
- From your nap?

112
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:37,777
- Yeah.

113
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,051
- Yeah, you had a good, little rest?

114
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:42,497
Yeah, the kids have been
getting such good rest lately.

115
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:44,042
- Let's go outside!

116
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,585
- Let's go outside.

117
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:47,898
It's a beautiful day!

118
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:48,731
Whoa, dude!

119
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,566
Look at those blue skies.

120
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,691
- Those are cotton candy skies.

121
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:52,869
- Cotton candy skies?

122
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:55,138
Aww, I don't see any cotton candy.

123
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:56,194
Just clouds.

124
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,430
Ollie always refers to the
clouds as cotton candy clouds,

125
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,581
regardless if they are
cotton candy clouds or not.

126
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,414
- Cotton candy!

127
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:02,776
- Yay!

128
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,622
I think our yard is actually
getting serviced right now.

129
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:06,799
They're like--

130
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,652
Oh, they're doing this.

131
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:08,749
They're fertilizing it,

132
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,535
cause we're trying to get
it super nice and green.

133
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:11,469
What's up?

134
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:14,756
- The guys that put these flags here

135
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,423
so Santa can bring his reindeer.

136
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,124
- That is right!

137
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:24,796
These flags are so that Santa
knows where to land, huh?

138
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:25,629
- Yeah.

139
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:27,679
- Yeah, cause Santa's coming soon, dude.

140
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,349
Is he gonna come to our house?

141
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,527
- I think so.

142
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:32,885
He's gonna get our presents!

143
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:33,863
- You think so?

144
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:34,696
- Yeah.

145
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:38,528
- I don't know, what
if he doesn't show up?

146
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,736
That'd be sad, huh?

147
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:40,913
I'm sure he's gonna show up.

148
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,805
I'm sure he's gonna show up.

149
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:43,106
And you know he likes to dance

150
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:44,891
on our cameras every year, right?

151
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:45,724
- Really?

152
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:46,557
- Yeah, member?

153
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:47,513
We saw him.

154
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:48,346
- Yeah.

155
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:49,179
- Yeah.

156
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,106
Santa always like to come
and dance at our house.

157
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:51,939
I don't know why.

158
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,931
- Santa lives in the North Pole.

159
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:58,019
- Yeah, he lives in the North
Pole with all his elves.

160
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,406
How's that cookie, by the way?

161
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:00,826
That looks so good.

162
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,088
- Yeah, mom made it for me.

163
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:03,104
- [Bryan] She did?

164
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:05,300
Well that's the best mom ever, huh?

165
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,089
- Such a nice day.

166
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,388
- [Bryan] I know, right?

167
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:10,221
Yeah!

168
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:13,190
We are getting some good,
fall weather, you guys.

169
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,773
(lively music)

170
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,297
Whoa!

171
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:22,167
You circling the flag with that?

172
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,167
What is that by the way?

173
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:28,432
- It's from the old Christmas--

174
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,250
- [Bryan] Oh, from your elf, right?

175
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,082
What's his name, Fred?

176
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,039
- Fred, yeah!

177
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,158
- [Bryan] Yeah, he left this
here last year, didn't he?

178
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:35,991
- Yeah.

179
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:36,824
- [Bryan] Yeah.

180
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:38,515
I wonder if he's going to do
anything with it this year?

181
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:42,031
Yeah, I guess we're just gonna
have to wait and see, huh?

182
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:43,390
Christmas is comin up, so we gotta see

183
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,423
if Ollie's elf on the
shelf is gonna come back.

184
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:46,723
And if Santa's gonna come.

185
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:48,433
It's gonna be a fun time, huh?

186
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:49,266
- Yeah.

187
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,099
- Yeah.

188
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:50,960
Alright, let's go inside.

189
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,141
It's getting a little chilly.

190
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:53,359
There you go, dude.

191
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:56,526
(happy, upbeat music)

192
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,160
Alright, boys.

193
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,613
Mommy has a surprise for you.

194
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:02,243
You ready?

195
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:03,501
- Ahhh!

196
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,722
The boys have been cooped up all day,

197
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:06,835
so we thought we'd reward
them with something.

198
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,381
Which we got...

199
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:09,762
- We got...

200
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:10,679
Hatchimals!

201
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:12,606
- Yeah!

202
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,439
- Yay!

203
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:17,604
So these are the new Hatchimals Surprise.

204
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:18,784
Who will you hatch?

205
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:20,972
- And are they twins?

206
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:22,692
- I kind of think they're twins.

207
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,275
That's pretty cool.

208
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:26,224
- Ooh, that'd be so cool!

209
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:27,145
- [Bryan] Alright.

210
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,447
- Here's the different kinds.

211
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,912
You could get this cute, little, blue one.

212
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:30,967
A pink and purple one.

213
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:31,800
- [Bryan] Peacat, okay.

214
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,633
Or Giraven.

215
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:33,855
That's cool.

216
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:34,911
You want it out?

217
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:35,744
- Yeah.

218
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:38,283
- [Bryan] Yeah, I have
feeling you're going to

219
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:39,116
be saying that all night long.

220
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,091
These hatchimals will only open

221
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:41,174
if you show them lots of love

222
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,357
and take care of them, okay Ollie?

223
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:44,190
- Okay.

224
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,356
- You gotta take really,
really good care, okay?

225
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:46,695
- [Bryan] Okay, Finn?

226
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:47,752
- Okay.

227
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:50,073
- I think this is a
case for the hatchimals.

228
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:50,906
- Yep, you gotta open it up.

229
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:52,484
Whoa!

230
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:54,845
Look at that huge egg, Finn!

231
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:56,178
He's so excited.

232
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,077
Whoa!

233
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:02,340
- Wow, it is really big!

234
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,451
- [Bryan] Wow, alright you ready?

235
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:06,523
Alright, the boys got their eggs!

236
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:08,268
Are you guys so excited to start them?

237
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:09,101
- Yeah!

238
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:09,934
- [Bryan] Yes!

239
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:13,005
Let's let the hatching commence!

240
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:16,255
- [Missy] Turn these and pull them out.

241
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,582
- [Bryan] Oo, it's making noise!

242
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:19,885
Ooo.

243
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,240
Alright, that's your friend tonight.

244
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,073
Okay, Ollie?

245
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:27,240
Make sure you give it all
the love it needs, okay?

246
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:29,295
You hear it, Finn?

247
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,266
- Yeah.

248
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,099
- [Missy] Oh, look.

249
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:31,932
Look!

250
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:34,932
- [Bryan] Do you hear them in there?

251
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,368
- [Missy] Oop, there it is.

252
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:38,657
Do you see?

253
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:41,130
- [Bryan] Can you guys hear it?

254
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,713
There's something in there.

255
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,176
Ooh, I see it lighting up too.

256
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:45,155
See the cracks?

257
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:48,530
There's a couple of creatures
in these I think you guys.

258
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,969
I think you guys have two sets of twins.

259
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,552
That's exciting, huh?

260
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:55,719
Finn, you're making yours dizzy, dude.

261
00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:00,036
(happy, upbeat music)

262
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:04,301
So the boys look situated in the play room

263
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,763
so they can cuddle with their eggs.

264
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:07,062
And look, they're lighting up!

265
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:07,895
See?

266
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:10,152
Ooh, is yours lighting up too?

267
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:11,069
Whoa, look!

268
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:13,533
They're lighting up, Finn!

269
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,793
Keep giving it love.

270
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:15,626
Give it a hug.

271
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:18,617
It's the only way it'll
hatch is if you give it love.

272
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:20,819
Ollie's got his blankie for it.

273
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:21,652
Here, Finn.

274
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:22,769
You can borrow some of Ollie's blankie

275
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,231
to keep it warm, okay?

276
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,589
And make sure to keep
tilting it and stuff, okay?

277
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,690
And playing with it.

278
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,519
They seriously love hatchimals so much.

279
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,645
It's so cute.

280
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,498
Ollie!

281
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,611
Your furry hatchimal is coming out.

282
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:35,508
Take it off!

283
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:36,509
Look at him!

284
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,184
Finn, what you got?

285
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:41,601
He just came out?

286
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,349
There's another one in there?

287
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:46,182
Whoa!

288
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:48,689
It came out from the top?

289
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:50,843
There's one in there still, Finn.

290
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:52,346
This is so cute!

291
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:53,179
Look it!

292
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:55,778
Aww, it's fluffy.

293
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:57,688
- Yeah, and different from the other kind.

294
00:08:57,688 --> 00:08:58,945
But, like super cute.

295
00:08:58,945 --> 00:08:59,778
- [Bryan] Yeah!

296
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:01,898
Aww, look at that.

297
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:04,505
Ollie, you getting yours too?

298
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,398
Oh, get it Finn!

299
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:06,231
Get it!

300
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:08,611
Finn's gonna be such a good,
little daddy to his hatchimal.

301
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,929
Look at him, he's like, let it out.

302
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,151
Come on out, come on out!

303
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,151
There he is!

304
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:14,896
Whoa!

305
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:16,958
Here, let me see that one.

306
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,791
Oh, no!

307
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,065
- He got twins.

308
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:22,244
- [Bryan] Twins!

309
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:25,460
That's four new hatchimal
babies for you guys.

310
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,243
- [Missy] Aww, look at these two twins.

311
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,905
- [Bryan] Aww.

312
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,186
Aww, that's so cute.

313
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,151
- [Missy] Look how cute they are!

314
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:36,573
Ollie, you have to name them.

315
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,818
- [Bryan] Well, hey guys.

316
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:39,651
What's up?

317
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:40,548
Look at them, dude.

318
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,134
They're looking at you.

319
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:44,634
Finn, look at your hatchimals.

320
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,063
They're so cute!

321
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:51,134
Yeah, you gotta name them, Finn.

322
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:52,193
Here's your other one.

323
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:56,110
- His children name is
Finn and the other Finn.

324
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:59,222
- [Bryan] So, Finn and Finn?

325
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:00,055
- Yeah.

326
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:00,888
- [Bryan] Okay, and what are your names?

327
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:05,187
- This one's name is Ollie
and that one's name is Ollie.

328
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,492
- [Bryan] Oh, so these
are both named Ollie,

329
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:10,612
and these are both named Finn.

330
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:11,445
That's so cute.

331
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,445
- Baby Ollie #1 and Baby Ollie #2?

332
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:15,282
- Yeah.

333
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,532
- Okay, got it.

334
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,044
(upbeat music)

335
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:26,008
- They're hugging together.

336
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:28,673
- [Bryan] Aww, they're hugging?

337
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:31,354
- So some of you may
know that a few days ago,

338
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:34,399
Luna ended up getting out of our yard

339
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,150
and running away.

340
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,710
And we thought that she had her collar on,

341
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,722
which she did, which of course
has her tags and everything,

342
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:43,952
but the tags had fallen off.

343
00:10:43,952 --> 00:10:45,621
And we were so surprised and shocked

344
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:46,515
that that ever happened.

345
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,894
I don't know how that happened.

346
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:51,471
But basically, she didn't
have any of her identification

347
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:54,075
on her when she got lost,
and that's super scary.

348
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:55,946
So, obviously, first thing we want to do

349
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,571
is make sure she can't get lost again.

350
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:00,454
But second thing is to also
make sure that if she does,

351
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:03,013
someone can contact us if they get her.

352
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,897
(laughter)

353
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:09,673
We found this collar that has
where we put her name on it

354
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:11,501
and my phone number is on it as well.

355
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:14,990
And that way, when they find
her, they can easily call us.

356
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,059
And it's on her and it can't fall off,

357
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,578
unless her collar falls
off, which it won't.

358
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,529
But, at least we won't lose tags.

359
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:22,989
I'm really excited about this.

360
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:24,087
- It's on me.

361
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,763
- [Bryan] You're wearing Luna's old one.

362
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:26,700
- A little scary.

363
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,489

He's getting so big.

00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:02,170
He usually just calls it wat'n wat'n--

00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,999
