1
00:00:00,388 --> 00:00:01,892
- Is it for humans?

2
00:00:01,892 --> 00:00:02,752
- [Bryan] Yeah, try it!

3
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:03,978
It's just a sprinkle.

4
00:00:03,978 --> 00:00:08,363
- It's just like flour,
applesauce, random things.

5
00:00:08,363 --> 00:00:09,196
- [Bryan] It's good stuff.

6
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:10,029
Try it.

7
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:12,433
(laughs)

8
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:14,294
Did you just eat dog food?

9
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:15,752
(Missy laughs)

10
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:17,863
♫ This is our life, this our fun

11
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:20,180
♫ This is who we are

12
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,633
♫ This is our dream, this is our team

13
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:25,077
♫ Shot among the stars

14
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:27,518
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

15
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,590
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

16
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,131
♫ This is our life

17
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:34,148
♫ Let's live it

18
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:36,053
♫ Live it forever

19
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:36,886
- Good morning!

20
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:37,719
- Good morning!

21
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,027
Good morning, Finn.

22
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:40,511
Good morning, guys.

23
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:42,904
It is a beautiful day here in Cali.

24
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:45,120
It's sprinkling, huh?

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,953
- Yeah.

26
00:00:45,953 --> 00:00:47,112
- [Bryan] It's raining a little bit.

27
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:48,224
So the boys are playing outside.

28
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:49,564
Luna's trying to get into the fortress.

29
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:50,515
Hi, Luna!

30
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:51,608
Good morning!

31
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,196
Good morning, Luna Loo!

32
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:54,166
Hi, baby!

33
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,041
- Can you open this?

34
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,680
- Of course I can!

35
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,513
Of course!

36
00:00:57,513 --> 00:00:58,492
It's October.

37
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,892
You eat Halloween candy
for breakfast, right?

38
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:01,725
- Yeah.

39
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:02,958
- No, the boys have
actually been really good,

40
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,393
but today I'm like, if
you guys want candy,

41
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:05,373
you can eat candy, okay?

42
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:06,736
I'm in the festive spirit.

43
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:07,923
It's a Friday.

44
00:01:07,923 --> 00:01:09,103
It's a good day.

45
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,345
There you go, my boy.

46
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:11,216
What do you say?

47
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:12,049
- Thank you.

48
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:12,882
- You're welcome.

49
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:14,014
But yeah, check this out you guys.

50
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:15,487
California's like, oh, is it October?

51
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,373
Should I be acting like it's October?

52
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:18,776
It's a little chilly out here.

53
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:20,392
And like I said, it's
even starting to sprinkle,

54
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:21,225
which is cool.

55
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:23,053
I love fall time because it's just like,

56
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,848
that feeling, the smell
in the air, like it feels

57
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:27,677
different in October for some reason.

58
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:29,622
Uh oh, I think all the
sprinklers are turning on!

59
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,455
Oh no!

60
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:33,020
Yeah, we've been trying to
fill in these little holes

61
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,116
in our grass for a while,

62
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:36,985
so we've been seeding
and doing sprinklers,

63
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:39,934
and trying to make this all
look really, really nice.

64
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:43,453
(bright beat music)

65
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:44,900
- Hey, guys!

66
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,768
- Hey.

67
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:48,063
- So today, Ollie said he really wanted to

68
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:50,397
answer some questions, huh?

69
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:52,751
So we decided to ask you guys on Twitter,

70
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:55,195
using the hashtag #AskDailyBumps,

71
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:58,143
and we got a bunch of questions
and so we just chose some,

72
00:01:58,143 --> 00:02:00,739
and I'm gonna let you answer some, 'kay?

73
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:01,908
Alright, here we go.

74
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,760
The first question comes from Maelyn,

75
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,422
and she says, "Ollie what
is your favorite dinosaur?"

76
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:09,607
- A T. Rex!

77
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:12,663
- Alright, next question, Ollie,
is from Amy, and she says,

78
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:15,084
"What's your favorite thing
about the holiday season

79
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:16,050
"having kids?"

80
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,426
I think my favorite
thing is just being able

81
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:21,352
to relive a lot of the
moments that I got to do

82
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:23,963
as a kid, and kinda watching
it through his eyes.

83
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:25,232
- Go, go.
(Missy laughs)

84
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:28,128
- And everything is just so
much more magical with them.

85
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,447
Okay, next question is
from Gabby, and she says,

86
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:33,742
"What is your most favorite
thing about vlogging?"

87
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:35,196
What's your favorite thing about vlogging?

88
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:39,077
- I love doing fun stuff with my family.

89
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:40,524
- [Missy] That's good, and what else?

90
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:42,967
- I love doing thumbs up.

91
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,135
- (laughs) He was like,

92
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:45,884
"Mama, I really love giving thumbs up."

93
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:47,242
I was like, alright say that!

94
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:48,897
So yeah, make sure you
guys thumbs up this video,

95
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:50,576
'cause that's Ollie's favorite thing, huh?

96
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:51,409
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,242
(laughs)

98
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,270
- Ollie wants to take a break,
and now Finn wants to go,

99
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,111
okay, the next question
is from The Daily Fam,

100
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:02,020
the question is "Best prank
you've pulled on someone."

101
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,495
Hands down, the best
prank I've ever pulled

102
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:07,881
was the one I did on Bryan with the snake.

103
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:11,237
I've never been able to pull
off a prank, like, good before,

104
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:12,672
I'm usually like giggling and laughing,

105
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,242
and I did a really dang good job,

106
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:17,185
and his reaction was perfect,
exactly what I was hoping for.

107
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,351
So if you guys haven't watched that,

108
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:20,246
make sure you click the link
up here, and go watch it.

109
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:21,750
It was hilarious.

110
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,311
The next question is
from Daily Bumps Gifs,

111
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:26,806
and she says, "Missy, what is
your advice to help someone

112
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,729
"get motivated to work out more?"

113
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,890
It's hard for me to give
advice, because everyone has

114
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,175
different motivations that
get them to that point.

115
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:35,905
For me, I love the fact that every time

116
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:39,110
I go back to the gym, I
feel like even stronger.

117
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,126
I know that what I'm doing
today is gonna be awesome

118
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:44,009
because the next time I go to the gym,

119
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,035
it's gonna be a little bit easier,

120
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,879
plus I can push myself
a little bit farther.

121
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,357
Plus, the hope of one day maybe

122
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:50,427
losing the weight and
feeling really comfortable

123
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:51,962
in yourself is always good, too.

124
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:54,047
But I just love the
little goals that you make

125
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,771
throughout the week or months
that you actually can meet.

126
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,756
Looks like both kids have ditched me now,

127
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,763
so I'll just finish a couple
more of these questions.

128
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:04,002
Janelle asks, "How is
Ollie doing at school?"

129
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,385
He's doing awesome.

130
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:06,335
He loves it.

131
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:07,870
He's learning so much.

132
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,886
He's learning how to
just like, really listen

133
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,865
and cooperate because
he's being forced to.

134
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,349
It's been a really,
really cool experience,

135
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,083
and I'm really excited about the school

136
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,795
that we chose especially.

137
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:20,961
Next question is from
Rayne, and she asked,

138
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,418
"Can you show us Finn's bed set up?"

139
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:25,278
Sure I can, let's go!

140
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:29,308
So this is Finn's bed set
up. Basically his mattress

141
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:33,397
is all the way to the floor.
He's got this little net

142
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:36,497
that this thing flips down and zips up.

143
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:39,080
Because he is a master at
getting out of the crib.

144
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,592
I never had to do this with Ollie.

145
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:43,517
And then in order for
him to sleep really good,

146
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,208
he needs a sound machine on,

147
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,375
and this sound machine on.

148
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,296
He needs like a noise
maker and a music maker.

149
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:55,585
Oh, and then also a little
light maker. (laughs)

150
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:58,493
He needs all these things
so that he can sleep

151
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:00,895
in his bed at night,
and a really good sleep.

152
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,484
(laughs) And that's what works.

153
00:05:02,484 --> 00:05:06,579
Alright, last question
is from Liz, I believe,

154
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,245
"Gonna get any more pets for the house?"

155
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:10,936
I don't see us getting any more pets

156
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,727
for the house anytime soon,

157
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:15,522
although I'm not sure
about outside of the house.

158
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:17,618
But, speaking of pets...

159
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:21,616
(energetic bright music)

160
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:23,533
- Happy birthday, Luna!

161
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,980
Happy birthday, girl!

162
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,122
- It's her birthday!
- That's right.

163
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,026
- How old is she, Ollie?

164
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,730
- Um, one!
- Yeah!

165
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,341
- She is now one years
old, and she is such a good

166
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:37,268
little puppy dog, aren't you?

167
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:38,101
Aren't you?

168
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:39,685
Ollie, do you remember when we got Luna?

169
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:40,518
- Yeah.

170
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:41,460
- [Bryan] How did we get Luna?

171
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,387
- Santa brought her.

172
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:44,220
- Yeah!
- That's right!

173
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,183
Santa brought her for Christmas, huh?

174
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:49,094
And now she's our puppy, and
she's such a good puppy, huh?

175
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,036
Happy birthday, Luna.

176
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:52,910
That's right, it's your birthday.

177
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,344
We're giving you lots of treats.

178
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:55,766
She's getting all the treats she wants.

179
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,688
- [Missy] (laughs) She's getting
so many treats right now.

180
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,412
- She's gonna have treats,

181
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,709
she's gonna have a
special birthday costume.

182
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,245
We're gonna have a little activity,

183
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:06,038
and she's even gonna open some presents.

184
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:08,065
'Cause we are gonna
spoil our little puppy.

185
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:10,827
(upbeat music)

186
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:13,393
We have some funny outfits to put on her.

187
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:15,276
This one has a little cupcake.

188
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:18,118
And then we also have
a hat, and of course,

189
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:21,175
a bib that says it's my birthday.

190
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:24,762
Luna, you got your
special birthday shirt on!

191
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:27,295
Check it out, she's so
pretty in her shirt.

192
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:28,837
- [Missy] Oh, and you need your bandana.

193
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:32,079
It says, it's my birthday. (laughs)

194
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,386
- [Bryan] Aw, she looks so happy. (laughs)

195
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:39,146
She actually does look
really happy, it's so cute.

196
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:39,979
Hi, Luna!

197
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,938
Oh, look at that thing going crazy!

198
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,038
You silly puppy.

199
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,284
- [Missy] It's my birthday!

200
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:49,387
(upbeat music)

201
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:50,220
- [Bryan] Hi, Luna.

202
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,142
Hi, Luna.

203
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:51,975
Hi, Luna.

204
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:52,808
Look at her.(laughs)

205
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,520
You think she's enjoying herself already?

206
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,767
Happy birthday, Luna.

207
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,930
Happy birthday, Luna.

208
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,552
- So I picked this up at
the pet store the other day,

209
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:04,012
and it's this decorating
kit for their birthday,

210
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:07,269
and it comes with a little
cookie and a cupcake,

211
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,628
and this is what it looks
like, and I thought it would be

212
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:13,315
super fun for the kids to
get to decorate the cookies.

213
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:18,176
So it comes with icing, and
it even comes with sprinkles.

214
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,116
Then they get to eat
it, and so the kids are,

215
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:21,379
like, super excited to decorate it

216
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,907
so we're gonna go ahead
and decorate it now.

217
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:26,238
Finn's gonna do the cupcake,
and Ollie's gonna do the bone.

218
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,466
This is our expectation. (laughs)

219
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:30,959
It's super cute, and we're
gonna have the boys decorate it,

220
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,332
so we'll see how it turns out.

221
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:33,165
(Finn babbles)

222
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:34,509
Are you excited?

223
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:36,479
- [Bryan] Whoa, that's so cool.

224
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,412
- [Missy] Oh, that's cute.

225
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,091
- [Bryan] It's like little swirlies.

226
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,674
(upbeat music)

227
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,292
Finn's gonna sprinkle some sprinkles.

228
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:04,219
- Go like this.

229
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,386
- [Bryan] Woo!

230
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,432
Look at your cookies for Luna, boys!

231
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,214
You made those, that's awesome!

232
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:12,068
(Missy laughs)

233
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:13,465
- Is it for humans?

234
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:14,451
- [Bryan] Yeah, try it!

235
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,582
It's just a sprinkle.

236
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:19,955
- It's just like flour,
applesauce, random things.

237
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:20,788
- [Bryan] It's good stuff.

238
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:21,621
Try it.

239
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,032
(laughs)

240
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:25,933
- Did you just eat dog food?

241
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:28,643
- [Missy] (laughs) Is it good?

242
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:29,476
- [Finn] Yeah!

243
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,749
- [Missy] Yeah? You like it?

244
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:32,698
(Finn babbles)

245
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,870
- [Bryan] Finn's like, yeah, I'll eat it.

246
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,775
- Nom nom nom.

247
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:36,608
- [Bryan] Those are for Luna.

248
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:38,311
That was so nice of you boys.

249
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:41,644
♫ Happy birthday to you

250
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:47,117
♫ Happy birthday to you

251
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:52,798
♫ Happy birthday dear Luna

252
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:59,026
♫ Happy birthday to you

253
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,026
Happy birthday, Luna!

254
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,715
We love you.
- Eat it, eat it, eat it!

255
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:07,893
- [Missy] I feel like I'm
so full of treats! (laughs)

256
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,545
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

257
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:11,032
More treats, really guys?

258
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:12,012
She likes it.

259
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:12,845
- [Missy] She's like, give that to me!

260
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,570
That is mine!
- That is hers.

261
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,426
Maybe she'll share with
you, though, okay guys?

262
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:17,617
(Missy laughs)

263
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:18,450
- [Missy] Do you guys want a bite?

264
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,768
- It's not good for humans.

265
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,604
- [Bryan] No, I'm sure it's fine. (laughs)

266
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,227
Alright, Luna, here's a present.

267
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:25,517
Here, what's this?

268
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:26,350
Do you know that's for you?

269
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,627
Do you know how to unwrap it?

270
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:28,460
Get it!

271
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,768
I had a feeling this was gonna happen,

272
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:32,025
so we're gonna have to bring in Karma

273
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:35,637
to have him teach her
how to unwrap presents,

274
00:09:35,637 --> 00:09:37,296
like a true puppy.

275
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:38,668
Karma!

276
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:40,484
Karma, Luna, come on!

277
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:41,317
Come on, guys!

278
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,150
Karma, we need your help!

279
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,015
Come on, Luna!

280
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,151
Luna will be right back,
she had to go potty.

281
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,538
Alright, Karma, can you teach
Luna how to open this present?

282
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,371
Get it, Karma! Get it!

283
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,425
See, Luna, listen, you
gotta put your paw on it,

284
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:56,290
and then you rip apart
the tape with your teeth,

285
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,185
there you go.

286
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:58,101
Get it, Karma, get it!

287
00:09:58,101 --> 00:09:59,457
He is so delicate

288
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,318
when he is unwrapping
presents, it's so funny.

289
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:02,456
Finish unwrapping it!
- Get it, boy, get it!

290
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:03,768
Get it, boy, get it!

291
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,148
- There you go.
- Good job!

292
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,654
- [Bryan] That is how you
unwrap a present, Luna.

293
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,880
- (laughs) Whenever your
kid's having a first birthday,

294
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,795
your oldest usually helps them.

295
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:13,693
- [Bryan] Yeah.

296
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,671
Kinda like the same with Karma and Luna?

297
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:16,671
- I know it!

298
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:18,891
That's my boy!

299
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,809
(laughing)

300
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:23,468
- [Bryan] Karma's a good boy, huh?

301
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:24,368
Open it, Karma, open it!

302
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:25,778
So what did Luna get?

303
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:27,551
She got a snake?

304
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:28,737
- [Missy] A pink snake.

305
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:30,698
- [Bryan] That's so cool!

306
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,649
Here Luna, wanna open this one?

307
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,847
Here, get it.
- Get it Luna, get it!

308
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:38,514
- [Bryan] It's a little bone
that says it's my birthday.

309
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,875
- It says happy birthday,
Luna, I love you!

310
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,657
- Oh, that's what it says, huh?

311
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:46,676
Karma's finishing up this
one for her. (laughs)

312
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:48,076
Oh, it's a tug of war!

313
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,029
Luna loves playing tug of war with Karma,

314
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,403
it's actually really cute.

315
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:52,734
Oh, oh, oh!

316
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,377
Get it, get it!

317
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:55,540
Tug of war!

318
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,197
Oh, oh, who's gonna win?

319
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:58,230
Who's gonna win?

320
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,030
Who's stronger, Luna or Ollie?

321
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,634
Let us know in the comments below!

322
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:03,082
Who do you think is gonna win this epic

323
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:04,065
tug of war match?

324
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:05,992
You still have time to leave a comment!

325
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:07,764
Ollie, or Luna?

326
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:09,701
Who's it gonna be, ladies and gentlemen?

327
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,553
Who's it gonna be?

328
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:14,082
(laughs) Get it!

329
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:17,665
They are both battling
it out for the title

330
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,961
of tug of war champion.

331
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,757
- [Missy] Get it, Ollie! Get it! (laughs)

332
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,394
- [Bryan] She's bringing you down, Ollie.

333
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,365
She's bringing you down.

334
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:27,198
You ain't gettin' that.

335
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:28,031
Oh!

336
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:32,205
Luna won!

337
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,877
(laughs)

338
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:35,917
Aw, good job, guys.

339
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,844
- Hey, gimme that.

340
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:39,220
I'm back.

341
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,488
- [Bryan] He's back! (laughs)

342
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:42,321
She's gettin' it!

343
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:43,214
She's gettin' it, oh!

344
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:44,631
She's gettin' it!

345
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:48,008
(laughs)

346
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,111
There you go, Ollie!

347
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,101
Just use your weight against her!

348
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:53,684
(upbeat music)

349
00:11:57,298 --> 00:11:58,131
Oh!

350
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:59,788
And it's Karma versus Luna!

351
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:01,288
Who is the winner?

352
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:02,956
Who's gonna win?

353
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:03,789
Get it, Karma!

354
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,633
Oh, Karma gave it up to her.

355
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:06,575
(Missy laughs)

356
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:07,771
He's like, it's your
birthday, I'll go easy.

357
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:09,128
- I think it's just
like a little too close,

358
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,489
when it's like further away.
- Oh yeah.

359
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:13,416
Look at Karma in the spirit.

360
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,847
Aw.

361
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,370
Love your hat, Karma.

362
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,615
(laughs)

363
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:20,514
It's dinner time for these fishies.

364
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:22,854
We're putting in some
food and some seaweed.

365
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:23,687
Oh!

366
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,574
We've got some blood worms, too?

367
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:27,639
You guys are spoiled.

368
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,056
We have a new fire angelfish,

369
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,957
and we haven't really
got a good shot of her.

370
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,165
She's peeking out right there.

371
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,607
- [Missy] (laughs) She gets so nervous.

372
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:37,523
- [Bryan] Yeah.

373
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,343
Come on, come on, come on.

374
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,178
Look at that fish, you guys.

375
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,802
Such a pretty fish, we
just want to see you.

376
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:47,969
(smooth guitar music)

377
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:53,213
We are getting seaweed for the fish,

378
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,980
and the dogs are going crazy over it.

379
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,118
- You will not like this.

380
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:58,235
This is gross.

381
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,223
You would not like this.

382
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:00,449
This isn't dog food.

383
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:02,534
- [Bryan] This is fish food. (laughs)

384
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:04,611
- Yeah, Karma was like, yeah,
you're right, ew. (laughs)

385
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,082
Alright, we gotta put one more in.

386
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,367
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, what
do you think we should name

387
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,154
our new red angel fish?

388
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,301
- Um, Tina!

389
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:11,933
- You think Tina?
- Yeah.

390
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,208
- Hmm...

391
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,041
- [Bryan] That's interesting.

392
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,070
Missy, what do you want to name it?

393
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,237
- I wanna name it Rajah,
from the tiger from Aladdin.

394
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:21,681
- What do you guys
think we should name it?

395
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,239
Tina or Rajah?

396
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,196
I'm gonna have an iCard poll in the corner

397
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:27,159
if you guys wanna click that, answer it,

398
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,547
and we'll choose the one you pick.

399
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:30,823
Those are two good names, right?

400
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,181
- Mm-hmm, actually I like them both.

401
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:33,014
- [Bryan] Yeah.

402
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:35,287
You guys actually helped
us name this big guy.

403
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:37,804
- The choices were
between Rafiki and Dude.

404
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:39,338
I really, really wanted Rafiki,

405
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:41,771
'cause he looks like Rafiki,
but you guys chose Dude,

406
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,614
so that's his name. (laughs)
- Yeah.

407
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,979
You guys are doing a good job
at helping us name our fish.

408
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:46,865
(laughs)

409
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:50,032
(smooth guitar music)

410
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,457
This boy is a wild one.

411
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:55,402
Huh, Finn?

412
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:58,429
- Do you like crazy?
- Yeah.

413
00:13:58,429 --> 00:13:59,762
And you're a good one?

414
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:02,304
- (laughs) This boy is a good one.

415
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:04,982
- Self-proclaimed good boy.

416
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:06,956
That's what you are.

417
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:07,938
(laughs)

418
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:09,963
- [Missy] That was so cute.

419
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:10,796
- Yeah!

420
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:13,766
It is an oatmeal and applesauce dinner

421
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,956
kinda night, isn't it?

422
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,096
These boys love oatmeal.

423
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:19,549
And honestly, it smells really good,

424
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:21,539
I might just eat some oatmeal, too.

425
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:23,484
- I think it smells like dog poop.

426
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:25,797
- [Bryan] You do? Why?

427
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:26,742
- 'Cause...

428
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,162
(Finn babbles)

429
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,516
- Why would you say that, Ollie?

430
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,799
It doesn't smell like dog poo!

431
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,695
- Yes it does.

432
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,845
- [Bryan] Luna, did you
leave us a birthday poo?

433
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:36,825
Is that what you did?

434
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,916
No, Luna's a good puppy.

435
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,378
- [Ollie] Yes, she did!

436
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:41,280
- [Bryan] No, she didn't!

437
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,625
- [Ollie] Yes, she did!

438
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,349
- [Bryan] Don't tease
Luna on her birthday!

439
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:48,925
It has been such a crazy
long day, hasn't it, Ollie?

440
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:49,758
- Yeah.

441
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:52,231
- Yeah, we've been working
so hard on some projects

442
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:54,530
for you guys that are
coming out later this month.

443
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,217
Are you excited?

444
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:57,050
- Uh-huh.

445
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,918
- Do you wanna tell 'em?

446
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:58,751
- Uh-huh.

447
00:14:58,751 --> 00:14:59,717
- Don't tell 'em! No!

448
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:01,312
Don't tell 'em! Don't do it!

449
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:02,423
- The jack.

450
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,256
- No!
- Yeah.

451
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:05,461
- Anyway, that's all for today's vlog.
