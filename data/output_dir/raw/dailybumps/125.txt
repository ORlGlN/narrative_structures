1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,947
- [Meme] Boys, Mommy and
Daddy are gone, right?

2
00:00:02,947 --> 00:00:03,996
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:06,329
- [Meme] Yeah, Papa and Meme decided

4
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:07,373
we're gonna play a fun game.

5
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:11,307
Now this game is called Tiny Hands.

6
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:14,724
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)

7
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:36,357
(cheerful instrumental music)

8
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:45,402
Good morning guys,
Missy and I just woke up

9
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:47,942
in our villa.

10
00:00:47,942 --> 00:00:49,958
What (laughs)?

11
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,588
We are eating breakfast outside.

12
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:53,168
It feels amazing.

13
00:00:53,168 --> 00:00:54,371
Of course, no breakfast is complete

14
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:56,988
without a little Mario, right?

15
00:00:56,988 --> 00:00:57,821
I'm so excited to eat.

16
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:00,579
I have a burrito, and
bananas, and waffles.

17
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,482
And we're staying at this
amazing place by the beach.

18
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:06,134
And what's funny is, I
booked so last minute

19
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:09,283
that the room we got was
already a pretty nice room.

20
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:11,567
Then when we got here, they upgraded us

21
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,430
to a four bedroom villa.

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,859
Sleeps like 20 people.

23
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:17,964
It's just us two (laughs).

24
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:20,309
I know I was like, "Is that
okay, it's just us two."

25
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:21,512
And they were like,
"Oh no, you'll love it.

26
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:22,363
"There's lots of space."

27
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:24,138
So I'm like, oh my gosh,
there is lots of space.

28
00:01:24,138 --> 00:01:25,435
Check this out.

29
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:30,235
We have fireplace, living room, kitchen.

30
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:31,712
I've never been in something like this.

31
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:34,303
It's like a two story hotel villa.

32
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,992
It's kind of crazy (laughs).

33
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:38,843
And there's like a whole
other side over there.

34
00:01:38,843 --> 00:01:41,203
So I was like okay, but they upgraded us

35
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:43,210
because they were booked; completely full.

36
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,978
They had to make room, so I was like,

37
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,346
"Alright, I guess we'll take
this huge, nice villa, right?"

38
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:48,179
- [Missy] Yup.

39
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:50,439
- [Bryan] Time to dig into this burrito.

40
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,151
(cheerful instrumental music)

41
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:56,395
Babe, check out all
those Italian gondolas.

42
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:57,299
That's so cool.

43
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,617
- [Bryan] How cool would
it be to ride in one?

44
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:00,067
Yeah, that would be really fun.

45
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,474
- [Bryan] I know, should we do it?

46
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:02,307
Yeah.

47
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:05,727
Okay, (laughs) I booked us
a couple's gondola ride.

48
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,607
So they're gonna take us
on one of these cool boats,

49
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:10,770
and give us a little tour
of the bay here in Newport.

50
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,217
It's kinda cool, huh?

51
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,080
Look at that one, it's
like a little house.

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,571
- [Missy] Yeah, it's so cool.

53
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:19,404
(cheerful instrumental music)

54
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,767
So we are taking a gondola
ride, here in Newport Beach.

55
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:43,825
And we're going through
the Newport Channel.

56
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,279
And they have the coolest boat right here,

57
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,336
check this out.

58
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:51,580
It says Hogwatts Express 9 3/4 (laughs).

59
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,818
That's so cool.

60
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:55,110
It's a Harry Potter themed little boat.

61
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,068
Oh maybe, I don't know.

62
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:59,735
(Italian music)

63
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:06,985
We might be boarded babe
by pirates (laughs).

64
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,671
This house clearly loves pirates.

65
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:09,840
Check this out.

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,672
Oh, that's so cool.

67
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:15,339
(pirate instrumental music)

68
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,564
Look at what we found here

69
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:28,171
in very cloudy Newport Beach;
an old telephone booth.

70
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:29,754
I'm on my phone.

71
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:30,587
- [Bryan] What?

72
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:32,369
Just on my cellphone.

73
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:34,444
Yeah, I love how it says,
"Payphone is no more,

74
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:36,387
"cellphones close this door."

75
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:38,381
we just got done with our gondola tour,

76
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,130
so it's like a little taste of Italy.

77
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,020
This is so fun.

78
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,130
Now I just wanna go to Italy.

79
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,212
I know, I really do.

80
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:47,250
We're walking along Newport,
trying to find our way

81
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,706
to the water, so we can go explore.

82
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,443
Go through some of the shops.

83
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:53,542
We just found a hammock.

84
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:54,375
You gonna get in it babe?

85
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,888
We're literally just
walking around randomly.

86
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,436
We don't really know where to go.

87
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:00,599
I think we're gonna call an
Uber and go to Laguna Beach.

88
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,099
Be careful babe.

89
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,584
Whoa, that is cool.

90
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:09,646
I actually love the way it looks

91
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:11,484
with the tassels on the side.

92
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:15,199
Yeah, I feel like I'm just
on an island somewhere.

93
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,269
Looking at the palm trees.

94
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,746
- [Bryan] Not a bad view, huh babe?

95
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:20,997
Not a bad view.

96
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:25,271
Is there room for two?

97
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,104
Yeah.

98
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:29,957
I love how my wife just finds a hammock

99
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,447
and gets in it.

100
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:32,625
Are you gonna get in?

101
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,794
- [Bryan] No, I'm not.

102
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:34,891
Why?

103
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:38,724
(cheerful instrumental music)

104
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,006
- [Meme] Boys, Mommy and
Daddy are gone, right?

105
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,146
Yeah.

106
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:48,979
- [Meme] Yeah, so Papa

107
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:53,258
and Meme decided we're
gonna play a fun game.

108
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:57,425
Now this game is called Tiny Hands, okay?

109
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:01,102
So you have to use tiny hands,

110
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:04,519
to get all the fun things you want, okay?

111
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,063
No.

112
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,857
[Meme] So we're gonna show you
how to use your tiny hands.

113
00:05:09,857 --> 00:05:12,160
Okay, Papa's gonna put 'em together,

114
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,351
and we're gonna put on our tiny hands.

115
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,934
(upbeat music)

116
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,748
- [Papa] Biting a marshmallow
with their tiny hands.

117
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:28,699
- [Meme] Can only use
your tiny hands, ready?

118
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:29,532
Go.

119
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:34,241
That was pretty good.

120
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,411
He got that marshmallow
right in his mouth.

121
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:37,729
- [Papa] Okay Finn, are you ready?

122
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:38,562
Yeah.

123
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,010
- [Meme] Okay, it's gonna be Finn's turn.

124
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,927
- [Papa] And, eat your marshmallow.

125
00:05:44,313 --> 00:05:47,186
Oh, what the, aye.

126
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,147
Supposed to use tiny hand.

127
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,538
Look at how it stuck there.

128
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,520
Gotta use your tiny hands.

129
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,353
There you go.

130
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,186
- [Meme] Got it?

131
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,019
- [Papa] There you go Finn, almost.

132
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:55,852
- [Meme] Get it, get it.

133
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:56,685
- [Papa] There you go.

134
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:58,294
- [Meme] Get it.

135
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,127
Get it.

136
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:03,135
Almost Finn, almost.

137
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:06,004
Get the marshmallow.

138
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:07,882
- [Papa] Pick it up Finn.

139
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:08,827
Here, I'll help you.

140
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,994
Hang on tight.

141
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,032
You got it.

142
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:17,123
Almost Finn.

143
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:18,626
- [Meme] Oh, oh you got it.

144
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:19,464
- [Papa] Reach your mouth, eat it.

145
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:22,269
- [Meme] Bring it to your mouth, get it.

146
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:25,602
Oh yeah, you did it.

147
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,769
- [Papa] Hi five.

148
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:28,602
Hi five.

149
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:30,465
Hi five.

150
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:32,302
Bumper bump.

151
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,967
- [Meme] Alright, round two.

152
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:36,786
Whadda we got here?

153
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:37,619
Oh, a ring pop.

154
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:38,679
- [Papa] Oh, oh.

155
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,979
- [Meme] Oh, oh.

156
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:40,935
- [Papa] Oh, the dexterity.

157
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,268
- [Together] Oh.

158
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:45,594
- [Papa] Stinkin' tiny hands
are gettin' in the way.

159
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:46,427
You know what?

160
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,118
You already have tiny hands.

161
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:51,831
Why you have tiny hands
in your tiny hands?

162
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:53,567
Hold your hand out.

163
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,317
That's the same size.

164
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,891
He's got tiny hands.

165
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,704
It's like he's cheatin'

166
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:00,537
- [Meme] It's looks like those

167
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,011
actually bigger than his hands.

168
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:02,844
- [Papa] Yeah.

169
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:04,183
- [Meme] So we're gonna
call these big hands.

170
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:05,061
- [Papa] Okay Finn.

171
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,230
- [Meme] Finn you gotta
use your big hands.

172
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,478
- [Papa] Ready, pick it up.

173
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,169
- [Ollie] Who are you guys?

174
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,574
Who are you guys?

175
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:14,302
- [Papa] He's cheating again.

176
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:16,802
- [Meme] Oh yeah, there we go.

177
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:23,985
- [Papa] Hold on, he's gettin' ready.

178
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,886
He's warming up now.

179
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:25,763
- [Ollie] Hey, who are you guys?

180
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:27,075
- [Papa] Here's his tiny hands.

181

We drove to a bowling
alley nightclub place,

241
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,232

00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,619
