00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:01,947

(boy meows)

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,613
Now you're a kitty cat.

4
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:04,446
Ah. Ah.

5
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:08,613
(boys laugh)

6
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:09,446

18
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:32,956
- [Family] Good morning.

19
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:34,678
- We are basically starting the vlog

20
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:35,770
exactly where we ended it.

21
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,350
They slept all night in their crib.

22
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,412
It is basically a crib, huh? (laughs)

23
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:43,206
in their bed, and they were such good boys

24
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,558
we are now getting ready for our day.

25
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:47,554
We have a big, exciting day today

26
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:50,117
so I'm just getting them
dressed, getting them ready.

27
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:50,950
- [Ollie] Watch this.

28
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,633
Start eating some breakfast.

29
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:53,879
Did you eat some breakfast?

30
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:54,780
- Yeah.

31
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,613
- [Missy] Yeah.

32
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:56,446
- [Ollie] Watch this, guys.

33
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,356
- Did you eat breakfast?

34
00:00:57,356 --> 00:01:00,384
Okay, he wants to show us
what we was doing last night.

35
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,130
(Ollie blows his lips)

36
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,309
(Finn laughs)

37
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:04,620
- [Missy] Is it as funny?

38
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,453
- [Finn] Yeah.

39
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:06,848
(Ollie blows his lips)

40
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:09,372
(Finn laughs)

41
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:11,191
- (laughs) oh goodness, you boys.

42
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:13,212
Hours and hours of fun, I tell ya.

43
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:14,323
- Hey guys.

44
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:15,807
So Missy and I are headed out of

45
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:17,273
the house today to do
something really fun.

46
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:18,687
We're actually already going to

47
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:20,923
the racetracks with her aunt today.

48
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:23,356
And then a horse that
Missy's been looking at,

49
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:24,639
the lady said that she's gonna be

50
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,095
right across the street
from the racetrack,

51
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:27,386
also doing more racing stuff.

52
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,864
And that she was gonna bring the horse by

53
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:30,501
in a stable so that we could go see it.

54
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,293
So we're hoping that
everything lines up today

55
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,439
and we're gonna be able to see

56
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,889
Missy's horse that she's looking at.

57
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,357
But otherwise, we have
a really exciting day

58
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,001
because Missy and I are headed to Pasadena

59
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,120
and we're gonna go have some fun up there

60
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,026
and go look at some horses.

61
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:44,526
(light music)

62
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:48,700
Alright, we are in the car now.

63
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,498
And I thought I would let Missy explain

64
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:52,963
a little bit more about
where we're going exactly

65
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:54,558
and what we're doing exactly.

66
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:59,264
- Okay, so we are actually
headed to my great aunt Sally.

67
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:02,219
I don't see her very often and she lives

68
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,411
kind of in the LA area.

69
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,942
And she's a super busy lady,

70
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,898
but we're gonna kind of
just hang out with her.

71
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:10,014
She's gonna take us to
a couple fun places,

72
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,135
but I'm really excited to go to her home

73
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:15,505
because as a kid I used to come here often

74
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:18,188
and she has a beautiful piano.

75
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,337
She loves to play all kinds of instruments

76
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:22,324
and I used to play the piano over there

77
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:25,823
on her beautiful piano and
play the harp and stuff.

78
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:28,626
And what's interesting
is that she has lived

79
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:33,264
in this home since 1940 and her
dad actually built the home.

80
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:36,946
And her mom and her are also very small,

81
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:39,455
sort of like my mom who's four eight,

82
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:41,422
and they're like the exact same size.

83
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:42,512
- Just smaller.

84
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:44,210
- (laughs) Yeah, so she's kind of

85
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,667
on the smaller side as
well and her mom was too.

86
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,876
And when her dad built this home,

87
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:52,234
he built it to scale for her mom.

88
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:55,246
So it actually is, like all the counters

89
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,319
are a lot shorter and smaller,

90
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,646
so my mom used to come here as a kid too

91
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,130
and she always loved it.

92
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,478
Because she could reach everything

93
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:04,800
and it's just like a
really, really fun house

94
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,214
that is custom built.

95
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:07,419
She's been living in it since

96
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,915
she was a child, like a baby.

97
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,445
She was born and raised in this home.

98
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:12,151
- And they have peacocks
running around too, I heard.

99
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:12,984
That's cool.

100
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:13,817
- Yeah, so we're really excited.

101
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,533
I'm excited to take Bryan,
he's never really been.

102
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,339
And I'm excited to kind
of just hang out with her.

103
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:18,978
I know her dad has been through a lot.

104
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:20,425
I think he was in the war and he's done

105
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:21,612
a lot of really cool stuff.

106
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:23,292
So it'll be interesting
to hear some of that.

107
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:26,481
Alright, we are here
now with my aunt Sally.

108
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:29,607
(laughs) And she's giving
us a tour of her home.

109
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:32,650
And my aunt Kris is gonna show
me all about the bathroom.

110
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,677
- Yes, okay the bathroom is quite amazing.

111
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:37,317
So she had it redone in peacock.

112
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,808
- [Missy] Oh yes, there's
peacocks everywhere.

113
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,101
- But look at the sink.

114
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,841
So she won't even use this sink.

115
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:45,424
She had this peacock sink done.

116
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:48,148
Isn't that amazing?

117
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:48,981
- [Missy] (laughs) It's so cool

118
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:49,924
and I just love the counters.

119
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:51,196
They're like so small.

120
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,873
- And pictures from
the Hunnington Library.

121
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:53,706
These we got up there.

122
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,702
- [Missy] I think I had some
of these when I was little.

123
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,710
- [Sally] Missy.

124
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,143
- [Missy] Yeah?

125
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:01,518
- The rose lamp is
something I gave my mother.

126
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:04,790
And then this little thing
and the rose on the spoon,

127
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,049
I mean, I found it.

128
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:06,882
- [Missy] Really?

129
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:09,082
- Going through family stuff.

130
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,859
- [Missy] Oh wow, that's so cool.

131
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,734
- And the napkins, the rose soap.

132
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,259
- [Missy] So pretty.

133
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,737
I love it in here.

134
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:19,987
(piano playing softly)

135
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:36,417
- That's enough.

136
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:37,250
(laughter and applause)

137
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,083
- [Bryan] That was great.

138
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:38,916
- [Male] That was awesome.

139
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,749
- [Missy] So good.

140
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,249
(light music)

141
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:50,753
So we are now at the riding club, right?

142
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:53,181
- Missy, 170 horses out here.

143
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:54,242
- 170.

144
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,450
- [Bryan] Wow.

145
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,111
- And she has one and she
rides almost every day?

146
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,265
- Every week.

147
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,422
- Every week.

148
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:03,878
- Every week, I used to ride
twice a week, but not now.

149
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:06,044
- Yeah, she said she even does jumping.

150
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,183
- [Bryan] That's amazing.

151
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,412
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

152
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:09,935
- [Sally] Oh, that one's cute.

153
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,927
- [Missy] So cute and little.

154
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,114
- [Bryan] Henry.

155
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:16,864
- [Missy] Hi Henry. (laughs)

156
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,098
(Henry neighs)

157
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:20,339
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

158
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,518
- [Bryan] What's he doing?

159
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:24,573
- [Kris] Can you smile?

160
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,261
(banging)

161
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:27,428
- [Bryan] Wow.

162
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:33,626
He's trying to lick you.

163
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,822
Aw, Missy's just, like, making friends.

164
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:41,322
(light music)

165
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,344
Alright, so we have said goodbye

166
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:54,190
to aunt Sally and aunt Kristy,

167
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,292
and we are actually going
on an adventure of our own.

168
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,683
Because the horse that
Missy has been looking at,

169
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:02,346
is actually down here at another stable

170
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,671
that was actually pretty close
to the last one we were at.

171
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,314
So we thought we'd use this opportunity

172
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:08,474
to go and check it out.

173
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:10,340
- Yes, so excited.

174
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,559
I really like this horse.

175
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,421
I really like all of its background,

176
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,478
it's supposed to be a
super sweet, nice one.

177
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:18,878
So I'm interested.

178
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,955
I'm not gonna ride it, no one's riding.

179
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:22,521
I don't have anyone with
me, either, to ride it.

180
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,115
But I'm just gonna look
at it, see how that goes.

181
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:26,953
And then we'll come back another time

182
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,359
with a trainer and stuff to check it out.

183
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,801
But, I'm excited.

184
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:31,831
- Yeah, so we're kind of just doing

185
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,845
a little bit of horse
shopping today, basically.

186
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:35,684
Which is kind of cool,
never done this before.

187
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,561
- I know, it's so fun.

188
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:40,144
(bright music)

189
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:01,614
- [Bryan] What do you think, babe?

190
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:03,299
- Cool, I like her.

191
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:04,132
she's so pretty.

192
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,155
- [Bryan] So pretty and sweet.

193
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:06,988
Hi.

194
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,819
Oh hey, little dude.

195
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:14,918
What's up?

196
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:16,372
Aw, did you miss me?

197
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:17,388
(boys shouting)

198
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:18,833
Did you miss me?

199
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,666
And you missed me?

200
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,011
And you missed me?

201
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:21,844
(Bryan laughs)

202
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:22,677
Give me a hug.

203
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:23,510
Argh.

204
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,081
Wow, this is what
happens when I come home.

205
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:26,914
(dog panting)

206
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,182
All my dogs and all my humans

207
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,082
(boys shouting)

208
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,304
greet me.

209
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:31,504
Hi guys.

210
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:33,413
Okay, Finn, what do you have?

211
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:34,428
- Prise.

212
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:35,261
- What?

213
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,474
- A surprise.

214
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:37,571
- You guys have a surprise for me?

215
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:38,404
- Yeah.
- Yeah, in the playroom.

216
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:39,257
- Okay, show me.

217
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,661
Let's go.

218
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,888
- [Ollie] So under the
couch, I can't show you.

219
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:44,439
- [Bryan] Oh jeez, you just put

220
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,097
all your toys under the couch?

221
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:47,253
- [Ollie] Yeah.

222
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:48,689
- [Bryan] You silly boy.

223
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,243
Look at all those toys.

224
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:52,910
(boys shouting)

225
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,249
- (laughs) Oh my gosh,
I missed these boys.

226
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:02,352
(boys screaming and playing)

227
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:03,867
- [Missy] Are you guys playing?

228
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:04,700
- Yeah.

229
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:11,432
(boys giggling and playing)

230
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:13,693
- These kids are playing,
it's almost bedtime.

231
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,597
And they ate all their dinner.

232
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:19,217
They ate all their dinner so
they get a peanut butter ball.

233
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:20,050
(boys cheer)

234
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,883
I'm getting low, guys.

235
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,301
I think I need to dip a few more.

236
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,702
I've actually a bunch of peanut balls

237
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:25,945
that are in the

238
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:27,106
(boys cheering)

239
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,825
freezer that I need to dip.

240
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:30,667
Alright, you get one.

241
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,000
And you get one.

242
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,744
Let me know how they are.

243
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,289
Are they good?

244
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,841
Good, then none for you.

245
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:38,741
Sorry girl.

246
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,732
Alright, we are getting ready for bed now.

247
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:42,665
I wanted to show you guys.

248
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,937
We have been taking these probiotics

249
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:48,335
for quite a few months now.

250
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:52,820
It's the Ultra Flora
Children's daily probiotic

251
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,430
and I swear everybody
around us has gotten sick.

252
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,440
(boys shout and play)

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,960
And we're normally grouped into that,

254
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,442
like we usually got that cold and stuff.

255
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,750
And these kids have not
had a cold in quite awhile

256
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,387
and haven't gotten sick.

257
00:09:04,387 --> 00:09:06,908
And I'm like, is it
because of the probiotics?

258
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:08,401
Or have we just been staying home more?

259
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,890
I don't know what it is exactly,

260
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,849
but I'm pretty proud of us for not getting

261
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,715
the cold that's been passed around.

262
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:15,155
I haven't seen like the flu.

263
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,843
And we've even had people
over the Christmas season

264
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,383
who've been pretty sick with either

265
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,147
flu type symptoms or bad colds

266
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,718
and we've got nothing yet.

267
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,233
Knock on wood. (laughs)

268
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,393
I need to find wood, knock on wood.

269
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,226
You never know.

270
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:30,677
We could totally end
up being sick tomorrow,

271
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:32,184
but so far so good.

272
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:34,479
And I swear, I'm like
maybe this is working.

273
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,312
I dunno.

274
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:37,092
They've been taking that,
a few other vitamins.

275
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:39,309
But I'm pretty excited about the fact

276
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:42,040
these guys haven't been sick.

277
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,873
Oh, look at that ring.

278
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:47,159
Alright, let me see that. (laughs)

279
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,061
(laughs) These boys are so cute.

280
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:51,248
(Finn whoops and plays)

281
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:53,144
I have missed them all day.

282
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:54,714
Why are you guys so cute?

283
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,187
Are you a bull, Ollie?

284
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:57,642
(boys shout and play)

285
00:09:57,642 --> 00:09:59,636
Is that a bull, or like a yak?

286
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:01,530
Is that what it's called, a yak?

287
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,404
(Finn roars)

288
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:03,237
Ah.

289
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:05,205
Oh my goodness, that's a scary bear.

290
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,038
(Finn roars)

291
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,150
careful, careful.

292
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,739
You guys are so cute.

293
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:11,409
Yeah, I had such a fun day,

294
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:14,740
but I definitely missed
these boys so much.

295
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,869
(Finn shouts)

296
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:17,430
Oh my goodness, now you're a kitty cat.

297
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,608
Now you're a kitty cat.

298
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:19,441
Ah.

299
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,966
(boys laugh)

300
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:25,280
Dog pile.

301
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:27,821
(laughter)

302
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:28,988
Dog pile Mama.

303
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,434
Why are you guys so cute?

304
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:33,267
- Because.

305
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,100
- I love you.

306
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,935
- I love my pa.

307
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,086
- [Missy] These little kitty cats

308
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:40,253
are now climbing this little
scratching pole. (laughs)

309
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,904
Wow, he literally climbed up you.

310
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,630
- [Bryan] Okay, thanks for that.

311
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,480
- [Missy] And he did it.

312
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,867
Finns like, me next, me next.

313
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:49,076
(Bryan laughs)

314
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:51,527
Finn, you gotta climb
onto Ollie's shoulders.

315
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,589
- Look it, he's getting a rock.

316
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,509
- [Missy] Oh my gosh. (laughs)

317
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:55,986
He's gonna do it.

318
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:57,385
- Come on, okay.

319
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:58,218
(Finn giggles)

320
00:10:58,218 --> 00:10:59,480
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

321
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,329
(boys giggle)

322
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:03,264
- [Missy] Why are you guys so cute?

323
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,940
- Hashtag dad life.

324
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,396
- These aren't kitty
cats, these are monkeys.

325
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:08,379
(Ollie shouts)

326
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:11,168
I cannot believe I got
to see a horse today.

327
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:12,541
That was really, really exciting.

328
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,216
I'm not purchasing it
yet, or I don't even know

329
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,947
if that's officially the one.

330
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:17,840
(boys shout and play)

331
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,796
It was extremely sweet, very loving,

332
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,487
but I definitely need someone to ride it.

333
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,365
And even I need to ride it before

334
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:26,001
I make any decision like that.

335
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,673
I'll probably even have a vet take a look,

336
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:30,059
just to make sure I'm
making the right decision.

337
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,963
But I'm really excited
and maybe it is the one.

338
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:32,910
I don't really know.

339
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,345
That connection was definitely there,

340
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:38,485
I loved just looking at her
and she was just so sweet.

341
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:40,374
She definitely laid her
head on me a couple times

342
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:43,943
and was just really
loving and affectionate.

343
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:46,643
And I've never really seen
a horse like that before.

344
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,363
I mean, I've had them come up to me,

345
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:51,214
but never really like rubbed their face.

346
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:53,322
So that was kind of fun, it was exciting.

347
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:54,807
But anyways, I think we're gonna go ahead

348
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:55,771
and end today's video.

349
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,815
These boys are long past
their bedtime, right?

350
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:01,320
(Finn shouting)

351
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,176
Oh my gosh, how am I gonna get
these boys to bed? (laughs)

352
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:05,017
alright, so make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up.

353
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,363
Say thumbs up.

354
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,502
Thumbs up, Ollie.

355
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:11,285
Yeah, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

356
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:12,465
Do you wanna do it Finn?

357
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,304
What do you say?

358
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,137
- Bye.

359
00:12:21,676 --> 00:00:00,000
(bright music)
