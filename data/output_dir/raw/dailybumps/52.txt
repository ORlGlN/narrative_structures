00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:02,520

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,810
- So today's vlog is very special.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,754
Do you know why boys?

7
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:14,587
- Why?

8
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:15,740
- Here, take a seat on Daddy's knee,

9
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,220
and I will tell you why
today's vlog is special.

10
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,770
Because this vlog marks

11
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,830
five years of vlogging on YouTube.

12
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,663
Did you know that?

13
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:25,496
- Yeah.

14
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:28,504
- We have been vlogging longer
than you have been alive.

15
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:30,080
- True story.

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,930
We've been vlogging every
day for five years, you guys.

17
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,900
This actually has happened.

18
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,460
This is a thing that has happened,

19
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,856
that has changed our life, and
we couldn't be more grateful.

20
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:42,543
It's crazy, Ollie, we
have every single day

21
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,210
of your life documented, isn't that cool?

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,043
- Yeah.

23
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:48,460
- So you can go back and
you can see everything,

24
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,670
how amazing is that?

25
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,170
- You can see when you are three days old.

26
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,500
- [Bryan] And when Finn
is three days old, yeah.

27
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,490
- You can see when you're two.

28
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,752
Do you remember when you were two?

29
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:56,750
Yeah?

30
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,390
Well, you can go back and remember any day

31
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,310
that you might have forgot.

32
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,610
- If you guys have been
here since the beginning,

33
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,661
I want you to leave a comment down below

34
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:07,758
and tell us what your favorite
moment of the five years

35
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:10,140
that we've been on YouTube is.

36
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,090
Because I feel like it'd
be such an amazing thing

37
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,400
to go back and look.

38
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,410
And we're gonna share

39
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,500
some of our favorite moments coming up.

40
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,930
Today's vlog is gonna
be a tiny bit different,

41
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,070
we're gonna be answering some questions

42
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,380
about our experience
in the last five years

43
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,907
of daily vlogging, and
we are also going to have

44
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:29,214
a pretty big announcement
at the end of this video.

45
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,450
So be sure to stay tuned for that.

46
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,283
Right Ollie?

47
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:33,116
- Yeah!

48
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:35,920
- [Bryan] Yeah, okay, should
we answer some questions?

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,940
We have been so incredibly
blessed these last five years

50
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,220
so we wanted to take this
moment to reward you guys.

51
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,570
So if we answer your
question in today's video

52
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,712
we're also going to be
sending you some swag.

53
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:50,650
- Coloring book and calendar!

54
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,670
- [Bryan] That's right!

55
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,990
We are gonna be sending
you guys a calendar

56
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,490
and a Daily Bumps coloring book

57
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,090
if we answered your
question in today's vlog.

58
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,840
Huge thanks to everyone
who submitted a question

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,570
with the hashtag
#FiveYearsOfDailyBumps on Twitter,

60
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,990
it was seriously so
cool getting to go back

61
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,332
and see all your guys' questions,

62
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:12,055
all your guys' memories of
your past videos and stuff.

63
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,410
I think that's amazing.

64
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,930
Alright, we are gonna get started

65
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,830
answering questions right now.

66
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,460
All right, so Ghost asked,

67
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,980
"What made you want to start vlogging

68
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,140
"every single day of your life?"

69
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,420
- You know, it was kind of the
thing to do when we started.

70
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,690
You know, it's like, let's daily vlog.

71
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,220
- At the time, Missy
was pregnant with Ollie,

72
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,750
she was, like, just a
couple months along, right?

73
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,200
Missy had her own channel

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,580
where she talked about her pregnancies,

75
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,720
and it was all about us starting a family.

76
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,920
And then when we actually
started a family with Ollie,

77
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,180
a lot of people were like,
what are you guys doing?

78
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,000
They were interested in
how we were doing things,

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,750
you know, we were like a young family,

80
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,890
we still are a very young family.

81
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,790
And I think it's been pretty incredible

82
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,370
that people have got to see us
grow and evolve from a couple

83
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,320
and two parents who don't
know what they're doing,

84
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,160
to kind of learning everything
in front of you guys

85
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,940
and sharing that experience
with you guys too,

86
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,100
so I always thought
that was super important

87
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,010
to do with the vlog,

88
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,640
and it's something we
still continue to do now.

89
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,195
(upbeat pop music)

90
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:12,650
Alright, so Kate has asked,

91
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,552
"What has been your biggest accomplishment

92
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:17,430
"with vlogging, sending
love from Michigan."

93
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,263
Well thank you Kate,

94
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:20,350
I'm gonna show you one of them right now.

95
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,440
It would probably have to be
this giant gold Play Button!

96
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,000
So this is our gold Play Button.

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,430
We got it when we passed
a million subscribers,

98
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,900
it was on New Years Eve I believe,

99
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,040
couple years ago.

100
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,780
So this is our dining
room, we have it displayed

101
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,810
up here with all of our other plaques.

102
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,390
Hundred thousand on my channel,

103
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,223
Missy's channel,

104
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,570
and that was the hundred
thousand award for Daily Bumps.

105
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,420
Hopefully Missy's channel will
be getting one of these soon,

106
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,050
I think she's at about a
half a million subscribers,

107
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,280
and she always wants to start
doing more content on there.

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,070
So maybe she'll also get one of these

109
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,040
for her channel as well.

110
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,750
But yes, we have one for Daily Bumps,

111
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,970
I think of this as a huge
accomplishment as a YouTuber.

112
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,360
This is something that's amazing to get,

113
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,580
it's recognition from YouTube saying,

114
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,780
You did awesome, here's something for it.

115
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,900
Like something physical,
I think that's amazing.

116
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,820
I would say another major accomplishment

117
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,990
that we've done on this channel

118
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,586
is our fundraisers for
the missions in Cambodia,

119
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,940
where Missy's cousin Curtis serves,

120
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,839
we've been over there as well,

121
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,039
and we've been able to
raise a ton of money

122
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,940
for the schools and the ministry,

123
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,270
and all the work that they do over there.

124
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,130
So I would have to say that's definitely

125
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,380
a huge accomplishment
of the channel as well.

126
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,830
Alright, so Sarah wants to know,

127
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,230
when we are not vlogging,

128
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,720
what are our favorite things to do?

129
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,310
My favorite things to do
when I'm not vlogging,

130
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,010
and sometimes I'm vlogging it too,

131
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,110
is taking care of all of our plants.

132
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,540
I have definitely acquired a little bit

133
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,901
of a green thumb hobby over the last year,

134
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:50,780
and I just love getting new plants

135
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,830
and taking care of them.

136
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,050
I also enjoy playing video games,

137
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,330
which is kinda hard to vlog anyway,

138
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,590
and listening to music.

139
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,100
I love just closing all
the shades in my office

140
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,280
and just sitting down and like,

141
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,800
listening to a good song or two.

142
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,840
Usually John Mayer or Khalid, but yeah,

143
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,370
those are my favorite things
to do when we're not vlogging.

144
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,010
And now here's Missy to tell you hers.

145
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,900
- A couple things, I love
to go get my hair done

146
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,950
and just not vlogging
it, and just relaxing

147
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,970
and getting pampered, and
not worrying about a thing.

148
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,424
And then my other favorite thing to do

149
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:18,860
is actually hang out with some friends

150
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,750
that we don't always vlog with,

151
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,760
and we just kinda like get to chill,

152
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,330
and we just don't
necessarily need to vlog it,

153
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,080
'cause we just like to enjoy
our time with our friends.

154
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:31,840
(upbeat pop music)

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,410
- Alright, so Marvey asked,

156
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,610
"If you could relive any vlogged moment

157
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,400
"from the past five years,
what would it be and why?"

158
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,730
I'm gonna go ahead and answer this one,

159
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,750
and I'm gonna say it's a vlog we put out

160
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,800
called Swimming with Sharks in Hawaii.

161
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,760
Whenever I feel cooped up in the house

162
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,930
I watch that vlog and it's
just such an amazing time.

163
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,760
Not only is Hawaii beautiful,

164
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,960
but we got to do this crazy experience

165
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,550
where we snorkeled down and got to walk

166
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,620
on the bottom of the ocean.

167
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,150
There was a ton of beautiful fish,

168
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,360
it was just one of those moments

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,660
that I will never forget,

170
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,119
and sometimes I just want to
jump right into that video

171
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:08,104
and do it all over again.

172
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:09,260
(laughs)

173
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,270
I'll have the video up in that corner

174
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,982
if you guys wanna watch it.

175
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,880
(upbeat pop music)

176
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,760
- Alright, Lauren actually asked us,

177
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,285
"How do you keep a
work/relationship/family balance

178
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:22,440
"and do you think the
boys would want to stop

179
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,530
"being in the vlogs as they get older?"

180
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,490
As far as keeping a balance
with our relationship,

181
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,490
and family, and work, I think
it's all about how you vlog.

182
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,260
So for one thing, we
really, really try hard

183
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,430
not to over-vlog our day,

184
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,670
obviously we've done it in the past,

185
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,480
and I think it's what a lot
of people start out doing,

186
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,740
is they over-vlog,

187
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,120
they vlog everything they're doing,

188
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,650
every little thing throughout the day,

189
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,730
and it really, really will
start to wear you down,

190
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,290
and really feel like that's
all you're doing all day,

191
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,930
is just filming what you're doing.

192
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,720
But by being able to
organize what we're filming

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
and how we're filming, we're able to keep

194
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,670
a very healthy balance

195
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,150
so that the boys don't feel like

196
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,120
they're being, like, vlogged constantly,

197
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,510
or that we're only hanging out with them

198
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,343
when we're vlogging.

199
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:05,540
And then do I think that
the boys will stop being...

200
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,650
stop wanting to be in the vlog?

201
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,790
I don't think so, I mean, like I said,

202
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,360
we really try not to make them feel like

203
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,490
they're constantly being vlogged.

204
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,550
I mean, if they ever were like,

205
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,679
I just don't wanna be in the vlog,

206
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,240
that would be totally fine.

207
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,780
But do I think they ever will?

208
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,559
Not necessarily, but I guess we'll see.

209
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,058
(upbeat pop music)

210
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,980
Alright, next question comes from Rosey,

211
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,550
and she asked, "I have always
wondered about Gabriel.

212
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,920
"I know you still think of him every day,

213
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,196
"but how do you keep so positive?

214
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,809
"100% understand that
this is highly personal,

215
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:38,950
"but I want to hear your
thoughts six years later."

216
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,950
So, as some of you may know,
and some of you may not know,

217
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,921
before we ever started
vlogging or YouTube,

218
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:49,100
I actually was about 20 weeks pregnant

219
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,230
when we lost our
pregnancy, and it was a boy

220
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,810
and his name was Gabriel.

221
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,760
It's something that we
kind of started on YouTube

222
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,420
talking about a lot, it was obviously

223
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,730
what I was going through at the time.

224
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,910
Six years later, it is obviously something

225
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,150
that still affects me to this day.

226
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,120
When I think about pregnancies,

227
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,750
I get a little nervous and scared,

228
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,100
because of, you know, all the
things that I've been through

229
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,130
before having Oliver and Finn.

230
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,160
And as far as how I feel,
it's still really hard.

231
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,840
Like, I have a very, very
hard time talking about it.

232
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,530
It definitely changed
me, it changed who I am,

233
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,110
and not all for bad, I
mean some of it for good.

234
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,912
Some of it made me just realize

235
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:29,740
how much every single thing matters.

236
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,230
Every time, every moment that
you spend with each other

237
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,570
matters because you never
know when it's gonna be gone.

238
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,809
I do try and stay positive

239
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,029
because I have such an amazing family,

240
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,010
and I have two amazing kids
that I love with all my heart.

241
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,440
My heart breaks for the other
pregnancies that I've lost,

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,550
but I just try really
hard to stay positive,

243
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,800
I really love my children,

244
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,060
and that's what I get
to look at every day,

245
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,510
and I'm so thankful for that.

246
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:52,887
(upbeat pop music)

247
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,360
- So Mariana said, "How
crazy is it to look back

248
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,010
"and see how many people you've touched

249
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,620
"and how many years you've
been a part of their lives for?

250
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,410
"You really are a huge part of our life

251
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,660
"and you brighten up my days.

252
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,800
"Here's to five more, I
love you guys so much."

253
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,620
Thank you so much, Mariana.

254
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,040
This is a photo that we all took in London

255
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,840
when she saw us there,
which was so much fun.

256
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,950
Hey Ollie, come here, look,

257
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,830
do you remember taking
that photo in London?

258
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,663
- [Ollie] Yeah.

259
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:22,340
- Look at your little
face, you look so cute!

260
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,500
- [Missy] Look at you
Finn, you're just a baby!

261
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,750
- [Bryan] That was so fun, huh?

262
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,930
Thank you for sharing this
photo, that's adorable.

263
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,640
It honestly is amazing
when you think about

264
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,170
how many people watch these vlogs,

265
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,600
and how many people subscribe,

266
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,120
and it's really kind of humbling

267
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,500
to have so many people be inspired by you.

268
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,960
- When we think back of like all the lives

269
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,880
that we seem to have somehow
bring some happiness to,

270
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,220
it is, honestly, like it doesn't
really comprehend with us.

271
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,350
And I think that's a good thing.

272
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,710
I mean, we just love what we do

273
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,478
and it amazes us when people come up to us

274
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:56,270
and say that we somehow
gave them happiness,

275
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,810
or brought them out of a depression, or...

276
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,600
It's just the craziest thing,

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
and I'm glad that it's
just by just being us,

278
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,980
we don't have to pretend or do
anything crazy or different.

279
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,210
- I think as a YouTuber
it's also really easy

280
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,130
to get wrapped up in
the numbers of things,

281
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,830
and we've gotten to a point where

282
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,210
we don't really check to see

283
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,500
how many new subscribers we got,

284
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,180
we don't check to see how many views

285
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,550
a video got necessarily,

286
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,040
I don't go actively looking for that.

287
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,880
It's kind of just
something we've kept doing,

288
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,930
and it keeps growing, which is amazing.

289
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,580
But yeah, being hyper-focused
on all those numbers

290
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,070
isn't really what we wanna do,

291
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,360
because we wanna make content
regardless of those numbers,

292
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,609
and that's kind of the
mindset we've always had, too.

293
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,108
(upbeat pop music)

294
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,770
Alright, so our next question
comes from Christine,

295
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,820
and I thought it was a
question better suited

296
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,900
for Ollie himself.

297
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,446
Alright Ollie, Christine asked,

298
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,240
"Do the boys want another sibling?"

299
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,625
So, do you want another
brother or a little sister?

300
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,680
- Yeah.

301
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,790
- [Bryan] Yeah?

302
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,370
How many more?

303
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,287
Just one more?

304
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:02,420
Would you rather have a little
brother, or a little sister?

305
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,090
- I want a little sister.

306
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,923
- [Bryan] What?

307
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:05,809
A little sister?

308
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,519
Why do you want a little sister?

309
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,345
- Because I want to dress
her like a princess.

310
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:13,913
- Aw, you can dress her
up like a little princess?

311
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:15,770
And then you guys can play,

312
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,831
and you could be the big, strong knight.

313
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:21,355
And Finn can be a big, strong knight, too.

314
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,330
- Yeah.

315
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,163
- [Bryan] Would that be cool?

316
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:24,604
- I could be a wizard.

317
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,397
- [Bryan] You could be a wizard!

318
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:27,230
- Yeah.

319
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,063
- [Bryan] Yeah, alright,

320
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,314
so Ollie wants a little sister, right?

321
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,150
- Yeah.

322
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,500
- [Bryan] Okay, we'll try.

323
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,232
(upbeat pop music)

324
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,536
Alright, Sophie sent us this video.

325
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,990
- Hey Missy, Bryan, Ollie and Finn.

326
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,010
I'm Sophie from Australia,
and I was just wondering,

327
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,700
what's the funniest moment
you've caught on camera

328
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,860
over the past five years?

329
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,181
- The funniest moment
we've caught on camera.

330
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:53,556
There have been

331
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:55,250
so many.

332
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,650
- [Missy] Come here, get it!

333
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,599
(techno music)

334
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,710
- [Missy] Where is my eyeliner?

335
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,450
It's on your face!

336
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,560
- [Bryan] Holy (bleep), oh my God.

337
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,393
- [Bryan] I kid you not,

338
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:24,160
he did this on his own volition you guys.

339
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:27,359
Work it!

340
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,459
(screams)

341
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,048
(screams)

342
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:31,881
(screams)

343
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,840
All those moments were so funny,

344
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,080
we've been so lucky to
catch things like that

345
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,160
of our kids and of our family on camera.

346
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,500
I think that's definitely a perk

347
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,046
of just always having cameras accessible.

348
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,130
But I would have to
say the funniest moment

349
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,700
we ever caught on camera
was Ollie rescuing Finn

350
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,150
from his crib, and it went crazy viral.

351
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,220
It was on World News, ABC News,

352
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,640
FOX News, all over the Internet.

353
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,770
A bunch of people stole the video

354
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,960
and uploaded it as their own,

355
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,890
it was one of those
first experiences for me

356
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,280
of a video going ultra, crazy viral.

357
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,580
I think it's up to over a hundred
million views on Facebook.

358
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,005
Here's a little clip from that.

359
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:12,171
(quirky music)

360
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,840
(soft electronic music)

361
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,000
- The boys have been begging
to do this for like weeks.

362
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,361
- [Bryan] They wanna throw water balloons!

363
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,430
- And it's freezing cold outside,

364
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,750
so we're not throwing
them on each other, right?

365
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,605
- [Boys] Yeah.

366
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:08,046
- Okay.

367
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,320
- We still have a couple
more questions left,

368
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,870
this should keep the boys busy.

369
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,410
Water balloons!

370
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,199
Throw it!

371
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,724
Nice!

372
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,230
Whoa, good throw Finn!

373
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,312
(upbeat electronic music)

374
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,790
So Bridget asked, "How
would you say your style

375
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,270
"of vlogging has changed over the years?"

376
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,950
Well, I will definitely say
it has changed in some areas,

377
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,490
and it hasn't changed in others.

378
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,480
We've always vlogged even
the most mundane life things,

379
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,240
making breakfast, driving in the car,

380
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,850
running errands, stuff like that.

381
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,410
But I will say that
we've gotten pretty good

382
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,130
at making it a lot more interesting.

383
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,440
And that's kind of like what
our life is all about, right?

384
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,220
- Yeah, I love the fact that our vlogs

385
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,264
can be just us, you know us,

386
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,080
but you also know that we're really fun.

387
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,310
You can see both of
that through our vlogs.

388
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,698
- We always try to say,
stay fun and positive.

389
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,970
And I think it's a good
thing for the vlog,

390
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,880
but it's a good thing as a family also.

391
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,330
- I think it's really good as a family

392
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,200
because we get to stay happy,
and like we're having fun.

393
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,210
But you also do see us in our sad moments,

394
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,270
you see us struggling,

395
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,467
you see us having bad days or whatever,

396
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:24,720
but you know what?

397
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,900
That's what everyone deals with.

398
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,920
But we love being positive, too.

399
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,511
- [Bryan] Alright, should
we do more water balloons?

400
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,997
- [Boys] Yeah!

401
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,599
- [Bryan] Whoa, there's lots of 'em!

402
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,765
- [Finn] Yeah!

403
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,310
- Alright, Kayla asked,

404
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,190
"What do you hope the next
five years will bring you?"

405
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,290
- Phew, next five years, so we
just accomplished five years.

406
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,204
- Yes, I mean, I hope at
least one more kid, maybe?

407
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:52,250
- I think maybe one more kid,
I think maybe a new business.

408
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,010
I think there's gonna be some
new goals crushed as a family.

409
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,300
Missy and I have definitely been talking

410
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,250
about what the next five
years of our life look like.

411
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,560
We just accomplished a ton in five years,

412
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,565
to even try to match
that would be amazing,

413
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,110
and we're gonna try.

414
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,100
- Obviously we're a young family,

415
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,133
and so our goals were,

416
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,900
you know, we wanna buy a house,

417
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,120
we wanna have kids,

418
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,909
we wanna, you know, do all these things.

419
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,680
I feel like the next five
years will be a lot different.

420
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,740
- I think the next five
years are really important

421
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,770
because I want these
next five years to define

422
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,934
what we are remembered for on YouTube.

423
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:26,767
- For sure.

424
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:29,140
- And as a family, as business owners,

425
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,540
I want people to look
at these next five years

426
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,400
we're gonna do and I wanna
look at it and be proud of it.

427
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,430
- Mmhmm, and we are proud of
what we have accomplished.

428
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,602
You know, I mean, as a young family,

429
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:40,610
to be able to accomplish
this much in five years

430
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,940
is absolutely insane.

431
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,490
But now we want to look
a little bit further,

432
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,280
a little bit deeper, and
we're really excited.

433
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,560
- Alright, last question
comes from Hannah Joan,

434
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,250
she said, "What is the message
you want your subscribers

435
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,170
"to take away from watching your videos?"

436
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,740
I think the message I
want people to take away

437
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,888
is that families are a
place of joy, and comfort,

438
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:07,119
and acceptance, and love,

439
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,789
and if you are in a family where
you don't get those things,

440
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,460
you can watch us, and you can find it,

441
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,970
and you can know that it is possible.

442
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,130
- Yeah, and know that, I
mean, life isn't always easy.

443
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,430
You know, you've seen our struggles,

444
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,869
you've seen what we've been through.

445
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,699
We try and just show a
lot of the positivity,

446
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,920
and you guys can have that, too.

447
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,380
Even if your life is hard, and struggling,

448
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,849
and you're having difficulties.

449
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,130
- So, seriously, huge
thank you to everyone

450
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,379
who tweeted questions with the hashtag

451
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:31,930
#FiveYearsOfDailyBumps.

452
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,421
I cannot believe we've been
doing this for five years.

453
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,610
- Yes, and we just want to say thank you

454
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,900
to all of our viewers,

455
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,240
and everyone that has been
watching us and supporting us.

456
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,730
Whether you've watched us in the beginning

457
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,640
and then have taken breaks and come back,

458
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,630
or have just started watching.

459
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,140
We have so much about us

460
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,722
that even you guys still don't know.

461
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,910
- I feel like Olive
Garden took our tagline,

462
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,865
it's when you're here, you're family.

463
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,199
- Yes, and we used to
love Oliver Garden, huh?

464
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,032
- We love our Oliver Garden.

465
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:00,857
- We do love Oliver Garden.

466
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:04,170
(upbeat pop music)

467
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,700
- [Bryan and Missy] We're
getting a real vacation!

468
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:11,900
- Yes, so Missy and I are taking
a very well-deserved break,

469
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,471
we're giving ourselves a week,

470
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,270
be sure you're following us on Instagram

471
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,370
so you know where we're going.

472
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,852
We're not gonna be vlogging or editing

473
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:20,407
or anything like that.

474
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,620
- But you guys aren't even gonna notice.

475
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,120
- Yes, we've been working really hard

476
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,360
to make sure that we
still have awesome content

477
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,650
laid out for you guys, and
we get a little vacation

478
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,473
of our own, and we are so excited.

479
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,514
I can't imagine a time
in the last five years

480
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:36,750
where we've got to not
think about the vlog.

481
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,040
- No, I mean, we have always
vlogged every single day,

482
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,090
and if anything, we have
always had to you know, edit,

483
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,090
make thumbnails,

484
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,930
do everything that's
involved with YouTube,

485
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,903
and it's, it can be...

486
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:48,736
- It's a lot of work.

487
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:49,910
- A lot.

488
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,743
Especially on vacation,

489
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,110
it can almost be more difficult,

490
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,489
because uploading can be
very difficult through Wi-Fi

491
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,500
and stuff, and we're gonna go somewhere

492
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,190
where we don't even care
if the internet works.

493
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,769
- I know, I was like, that's so amazing.

494
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:02,030
We can go anywhere.

495
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,540
- We're trying really
hard to make this happen,

496
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,310
and we are so excited, and again,

497
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,231
thank you guys for even
making this possible.

498
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,197
We do not complain that we work everyday.

499
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:10,030
- No, I love it.

500
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,543
- But we're gonna take a break!

501
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:12,376
(laughs)

502
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:13,910
- Yeah, we're gonna take a little break.

503
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,940
So make sure you're following
Missy and I on Instagram

504
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,120
so you can see where we're headed,

505
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,650
we are gonna have a blast.

506
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,980
Hey boys, you wanna end the vlog with us?

507
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,871
Alright, thank you guys
for watching this video,

508
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,570
thanks for five years of Daily Bumps,

509
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,930
give this video a thumbs up,

510
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,520
comment below with your favorite thing

511
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,580
in the last five years,

512
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,280
and we will see you mañana, right Finn?

513
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,590
Say bye!

514
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,423
- Bye!

515
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,006
Boo!

516
00:19:37,006 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat pop music)
