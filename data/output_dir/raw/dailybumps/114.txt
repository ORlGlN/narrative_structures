- Happy Thanksgiving you guys!

00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:05,771
I am so excited, we have
such a fun family day

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,359
coming up for you guys.

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,035
But before the vlog starts,
I wanted to let you know

5
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:12,802
that we have signed
calendars back in stock.

6
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:15,544
We completely sold out,
but I was like, "We can not

7
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:17,552
"sell out before Christmas."

8
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:18,616
So we've added a couple more.

9
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:20,291
We're gonna be signing, our
hands are gonna be cramping,

10
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,735
but that's okay, it's all for you guys.

I did wanna let you guys know,

Happy Thanksgiving babe!

33
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:08,872
- Happy Thanksgiving.

34
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:09,806
- [Bryan] What are you doin'?

35
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:11,618
- I'm setting the kids' table with these

36
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:14,695
cute little kids' forks,
and knives, and spoons.

37
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:15,889
- Aw.
- They're so cute.

38
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,201
- Yeah.
- I don't know how CJ

39
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,599
is gonna feel about them,
but I think they're adorable.

40
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,297
- This is our first year with
an official kids' table, huh?

41
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:23,695
- Uh huh.
- So it's gonna be so cool,

42
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:26,595
so all the kids are gonna be
situated on the kids' table,

43
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:29,286
which is directly adjacent
to the adult table,

44
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:30,119
which we're also gettin' set up.

45
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,750
- It's like a kid friendly fancy dinner.

46
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,054
- Yes.
- They get their own

47
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,700
little place settings,
- Check this out.

48
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,330
This is where Finn's gonna be sitting.

49
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,163
(laughs)

50
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:41,974
And it is not going to look
like this for very long.

51
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:42,811
- Yeah (chuckles).

52
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,478
(upbeat instrumental music)

53
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,260
- Happy Thanksgivin'!

54
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,333
- [Bryan] Happy Thanksgivin' buddy.

55
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,063
What do you got there?

56
00:01:58,063 --> 00:01:59,291
(electronic swishing)

57
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,458
Whoa, a sword?

58
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:03,052
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

59
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,547
Happy Thanksgiving guys.

60
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:07,024
You guys excited to eat some yummy food?

61
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:08,338
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

62
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:09,170
- [Bryan] Yeah?

63
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,003
You guys all just playin'?

64
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:12,212
(laughs)

65
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:13,045
All right, keep playin' guys.

66
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:16,218
(Finn talking loudly)
Good morning, Finn.

67
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:17,487
Or should you be saying,

68
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,444
"Ho ho ho?"
- Ho.

69
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:21,410
- You look like Santa Claus.

70
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,118
Aw, gettin' cuddles from
little baby Santa Claus,

71
00:02:24,118 --> 00:02:24,951
you guys.

72
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:27,251
Finn is gettin' in the spirit
of Christmas, aren't you?

73
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:28,968
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

74
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:31,802
(upbeat instrumental music)

75
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:35,111
- [Bryan] Happy
Thanksgiving boys and girls.

76
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,778
(upbeat instrumental music)

77
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:01,976
Ollie, what sound does a horse make?

78
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:04,688
(neighing)

79
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:06,551
Okay Bailey, what sound does
the unicorn make, though?

80
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,916
- Yee yee yee.

81
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,208
- Are you sure?

82
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,574
(laughing)

83
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:12,324
Alright you guys, we're
still cookin' all our food

84
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,663
and I think some more family's coming.

85
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:18,830
But, I wanted to prank the
kids with this turkey mask

86
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,180
and see what they think (chuckles).

87
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,808
It makes it look like there's
an actual turkey on my head.

88
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:24,835
Check this out.

89
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:27,085
(laughing)

90
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,639
Look at it, it even has
two little eye holes

91
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,222
down by the breast.

92
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,372
Let's go see what the kids think.

93
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:36,480
Happy Thanksgiving you guys.

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,665
It's been a good day.

95
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:39,498
Rawr!

96
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,455
Ollie, can you help me?

97
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,119
I have this turkey stuck on my head.

98
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,507
Can you help me take it off?

99
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:49,078
(crying loudly)

100
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,409
(laughs)

101
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:51,326
Help, help!

102
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:55,322
This turkey's stuck on my head, Bailey!

103
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,668
- Is that a real turkey?

104
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:58,221
- Yes, it's stuck on my head.

105
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:59,604
Feel it.

106
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:01,522
See, it's a real turkey.

107
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:02,355
(Bailey laughs)

108
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,876
It's stuck on my head you guys.

109
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,325
Karma, help me!
- Come here!

110
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:09,492
- I know how to get it off.
- You know how to get it off?

111
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:11,819
- Ahh!

112
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,049
- I got it off!

113
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:16,523
- Freedom!

114
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,940
(laughs) Thanks Bailey boo.

115
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,773
Ollie, it was just Dada.

116
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:23,685
Aw, he's scared.

117
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:24,518
It's okay.

118
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:25,890
Ollie.
(whining)

119
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,316
It was just Dada, buddy.

120
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:28,544
Did I scare you?
- Yeah.

121
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,615
- Yeah (laughs).

122
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,194
Well, if you thought a
turkey was on my head,

123
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:36,207
why didn't you help me get it off?

124
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:37,514
Huh?

125
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:40,140
- Because.
- 'Cause (laughs).

126
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,942
Daddy didn't get a
turkey stuck on his head,

127
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,979
although that would be quite funny.

128
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,145
(growls)
(woman shrieks)

129
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,614
Hey, I got a turkey stuck on my head.

130
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:52,163
Can you help me take it off?
- And, and, um.

131
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:54,121
- Can you help me take it off?

132
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:55,788
Help me take it off?

133
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,139
So far, you're not that good at it.

134
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,530
Bailey could do it.

135
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,085
Oh, okay.

136
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,435
Should have put more butter on it.

137
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:05,909
(laughs)

138
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:08,115
- You want that turkey?
- No.

139
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:09,836
- [Bryan] I really scared Ollie.

140
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:10,808
He was so scared (laughs).

141
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:11,831
- Oh really?

142
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:12,664
- He was crying.

143
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:13,497
I felt bad.

144
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:15,666
Alright you guys, as you
know, it's Thanksgiving

145
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,857
and what is Thanksgiving without a turkey?

146
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,797
We need to cook a turkey tonight.

147
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:21,390
We're having a lot of people come over.

148
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,400
We're feeding about 20
people, so we need to find

149
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,979
a big turkey bird, and I think I heard one

150
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,322
runnin' around the house.

151
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:30,418
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.
(gobbling)

152
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:31,251
- Gobble gobble.

153
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:32,084
Gobble gobble.

154
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:33,156
Gobble.
- You guys, there's a turkey

155
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:34,292
loose in the house.
- Gobble gobble.

156
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,966
(gobbling)

157
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,175
- [Bryan] There's a turkey
loose in the house you guys!

158
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,149
- Oh no!
- There's a turkey!

159
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,856
- [Bryan] Randy, grab the turkey, come on!

160
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:45,331
You guys, we need a
turkey tonight for dinner.

161
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:46,701
Oh we got a turkey--

162
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:48,884
(gobbling)
- Gobble gobble.

163
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:51,163
- We got a turkey runnin'
around the house, you guys.

164
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:51,996
- We have to get her!

165
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:54,264
- We gotta get that thing so we can put it

166
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:55,597
in the oven, CJ!

167
00:05:57,842 --> 00:05:58,853
Oh no!

168
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,523
- Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble!

169
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:01,627
(gobbling)

170
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,883
- [Bryan] You are a good lookin' turkey.

171
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:05,770
It's time for dinner.

172
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,245
(growls)
Ah!

173
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:09,082
The turkey's eating me!

174
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:12,710
Thanksgiving has taken a
turn for the worst everybody!

175
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,190
Ah!

176
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,467
(happy squealing)

177
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:17,880
- Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

178
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
- [Bryan] Get back here!

179
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:22,347
Get back here, turkey!

180
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:25,514
(kids talking loudly)

181
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:28,137
Get 'em Baily, get 'em!

182
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,479
Get 'em, bring 'em down!

183
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,244
Bring 'em down!

184
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:32,713
Ah!

185
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:34,474
- We caught our turkey,
(Bryan sighs)

186
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,934
and we are cookin' him up right now.

187
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:37,834
- Check this out you guys.

188
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:40,032
Ooh, he is lookin' good!

189
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,544
(gobbling)
Oh, was that a gobble?

190
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:42,894
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.

191
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,561
(laughing)

192
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,326
- Are you hungry for turkey, Finn?

193
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,326
- No.
- Yeah.

194
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:52,020
Finn is teething hard core you guys.

195
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,001
Poor little guy is so sad
and his teeth are hurting him

196
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:58,277
so much, he's been in his
mouth, he's had a runny nose,

197
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:00,528
and it's kind of ironic that
his teeth are hurting him

198
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,207
on Thanksgiving.

199
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:04,283
This is the day you need your teeth dude.

200
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:05,835
- Yeah.
- Yeah, 'cause we're gonna eat

201
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:06,931
lots of food.

202
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:07,950
By the way, babe, I love your apron.

203
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,378
- Thank you.

204
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:10,808
- It's like a little Mrs. Claus apron?

205
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:12,701
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're so cute.

206
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:16,368
(upbeat instrumental music)

207
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:21,683
Alright, what are we doin' here babe?

208
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:23,614
- We're playin' the No Thumbs Challenge!

209
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:26,149
- [Bryan] Oh, so Bailey's
got her thumbs down,

210
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,619
and what does she have to do next?

211
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:29,784
- We have to make the best ice cream cone.

212
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:30,617
- Oh cool.

213
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,353
Out of the--
- Out of clay, yeah.

214
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,665
- [Bryan] Alright, you guys, one minute.

215
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:34,608
- Ready?

216
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:35,441
Go!

217
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:36,622
- [Bryan] No thumbs or no big toes?

218
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,847
What would you do babe?

219
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:38,680
- You mean any?

220
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,030
If you don't have big toes,
you can't walk very well.

221
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,495
- Yeah (laughs).
- So I think

222
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,720
it'd be no thumbs.
- You're already clumsy.

223
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,273
- I think I would do--
- What about you, CJ?

224
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:47,962
- No thumbs or no big toes?
- Um,

225
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:49,593
no thumbs.

226
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:50,696
- You'd rather have no thumbs?

227
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,252
(laughs)

228
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:55,919
(upbeat instrumental music)

229
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:05,986
- Down, thumbs down!

230
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,078
- Okay, um,
- Missy, that's actually

231
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:09,511
super impressive

232
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,196
ice cream cone.
- It's a cherry flavored

233
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:12,170
ice cream cone.

234
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,967
- They got it done quick.
- Yeah, they did, huh?

235
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,514
- [Missy] Show us your
ice cream cone Bailey.

236
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:17,347
- [Bryan] Let's see yours Bailey.

237
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:18,246
Whoa!
- Wow!

238
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:20,185
- What flavor is that?
- Strawberry.

239
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:21,574
- [Bryan] Strawberry.

240
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:23,824
(laughing)

241
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,758
Jessie's swingin' the boys.

242
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:30,591
Are you okay?

243
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:32,431
(squeals happily)
Whoa!

244
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:33,287
(laughing)

245
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:35,639
They're both dizzy now.

246
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,239
Wow, that is a good
lookin' turkey right there.

247
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,832
That looks perfect.

248
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:43,484
Suzanne always makes the best turkey.

249
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:45,883
- Luck.
- It's the luck of the Mimi.

250
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:49,239
(laughs)
- She always does it perfect.

251
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:52,906
(upbeat instrumental music)

252
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,499
- [Missy] Alright,
everyone's standin' around

253
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,535
and we are carvin' the
turkey now, well, not me.

254
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:13,414
- I love how there's this
paper towel, just like,

255
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:15,214
shoved everywhere.
(laughing)

256
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:17,477
- Gotta be moist.
- Yeah, he cut

257
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,415
this giant breast off.

258
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:20,724
This is the other breast he's cuttin' it

259
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:22,444
into slices now.
- I never cut it like this.

260
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:24,114
- [Missy} It looks so good.

261
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:24,947
- It looks so good.

262
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:26,971
- [Missy] I did try a little
piece of it and it is amazing.

263
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,969
You're gonna die.

264
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,233
- Yeah, it's always

265
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,259
incredible.
- I mean, mom always wins.

266
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,808
Because she's just like,
even though she kind of

267
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,407
took it out too soon,
- I took it out way too soon.

268
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:36,428
- [Missy] In the end
it's gonna be perfect,

269
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:37,749
and look what I did.

270
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:39,875
(laughing)

271
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,941
I made 'em black.

272
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:41,774
- Look at this breast.

273
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:43,477
This is one side.
- I know!

274
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:44,463
Yeah, this is just the other side of it.

275
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:45,321
- Wow.

276
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:49,211
The kids are all gettin'
situated at their kids' table.

277
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:51,031
- Hey don't call me a kid anymore.

278
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:54,471
- [Bryan] Oh, we already got one, okay.

279
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:56,714
Ollie, you helpin' Finn?

280
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:58,551
Are you excited to eat
Thanksgiving dinner?

281
00:09:58,551 --> 00:09:59,982
- The buds are still cooking!

282
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,912
- Oh geez!
(laughing)

283
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,992
The buds are still in the oven!

284
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:07,990
- [Woman] You probably should
have set that on timer--

285
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,821
- She says we're good, okay.

286
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,622
We're starting to sit down and eat dinner.

287
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:13,581
Luna's like, "You guys are crazy.

288
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,628
"Y'all need to calm down, it's just food."

289
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:19,295
(upbeat instrumental music)

290
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:28,176
Hey babe, I have created a
Thanksgiving volcano palette.

291
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,664
This is the technique,
ladies and gentlemen.

292
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,838
You start with the mashed
potatoes in the middle,

293
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:36,642
and you just work in a circle,
and then you pour your gravy,

294
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:37,876
and it's just like...

295
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,202
- It's pretty good.
- center of awesomeness.

296
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:41,952
Finn, are you eatin'?

297
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,388
- Yeah.
- Is it yummy?

298
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:46,388
- Yes.
- Yay.

299
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:51,421
(upbeat instrumental music)

300
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:15,505
- You guys, Thanksgiving is over.

301
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:16,906
It is such a mess in here.

302
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:19,689
Finn's plate is still there (laughing),

303
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:24,059
and I'm in my onesie because
it is definitely getting late.

304
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,895
It is such a mess, like my whole house

305
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,980
is just like (groans).

306
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,869
Crazy house, huh?
- Yeah.

307
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,708
- But anyways, everyone's basically left.

308
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,198
Just got a few people left over.

309
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:35,708
Karma's still here, huh?

310
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,420
Did you have a good Thanksgiving?

311
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,637
Did you have a good Thanksgiving, Luna?

312
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:40,704
We're gonna go ahead
and end today's video.

313
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:44,230
We had such an awesome day,
I'm so thankful for my family.

314
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,309
I just love my family so much,
and you and your brother,

315
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,618
and I'm so thankful for you.

316
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:50,644
Did you know that?

317
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,005
- Yeah.
- You are like

318
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:53,806
the best little boy ever.

319
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:55,728
Did you know you're the
best little boy ever?

320
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,242
(laughs)

321
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,995
I'm just so thankful for
all my family, and I'm just

322
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:01,915
so glad that we're able
to all attend together.

323
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:03,643
And it may not always be
like this, where we can

324
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:05,026
all get together and stuff.

325
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:06,500
So anyways, make sure you give this video

326
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,804
a big thumbs up, and let
us know in the comments

327
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:09,643
what are you thankful for this year?

328
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,608
- Big thumbs up.
- But big thumbs up,

329
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:12,441
you're right.

330
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,860
And we'll see you guys tomorrow!

331
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,693
Bye!
- Bye!

332
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:18,916
Boop.
- Boop.

333
00:12:18,916 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat instrumental music)
