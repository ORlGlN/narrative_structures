1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,857
- So, we have been having a
pretty rough night tonight.

2
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:07,804
After we got back from dinner, we got home

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:10,407
and realized that Luna wasn't in the house

4
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:13,374
and then when we checked the Nest cameras,

5
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:14,477
it actually showed her leaving

6
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:17,923
the property through
the gate around two PM.

7
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:20,321
So we didn't get back home til super late

8
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:24,549
and so she's been gone,
alone for six hours now

9
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,674
and we have no idea where she is.

10
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:27,863
♫ This is our life.

11
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:29,042
♫ This is our fun.

12
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:31,453
♫ This is who we are.

13
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:32,595
♫ This is our dream.

14
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:33,842
♫ This is our team.

15
00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:36,273
♫ Shot among the stars.

16
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:38,529
♫ Take the shield and you'll be fine.

17
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:41,036
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine.

18
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:43,163
♫ This is our life.

19
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:45,190
♫ Let's live it.

20
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,362
♫ Live it forever.

21
00:00:47,362 --> 00:00:49,416
- [Both] Good morning.

22
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,421
(laughs)

23
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:53,838
- You guys, it is officially October 30th

24
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,073
and it is cold outside,
it's so chilly, huh?

25
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:01,051
Yeah it feels amazing.

26
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:03,551
You definitely need a sweater
if you wanna be outside.

27
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:04,922
And it's supposed to.

28
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:07,530
(rooster crowing)

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,776
That's my rooster, it's
supposed to stay chilly

30
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:13,783
at least for the next like ten days.

31
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:16,390
I've even seen a lot of cloudy
and even a couple of rainy

32
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,506
days, so yay, maybe we'll actually

33
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:20,549
see some fall weather now, huh.

34
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,834
'Cause last week it was 100 degrees

35
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,468
and it was hot, hot, hot.

36
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:26,455
I think we might actually
go to like a corn maze

37
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:28,344
or do something fun since we can

38
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:32,536
be outside and we won't be
sweating, so that's nice.

39
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:34,820
That's both my roosters, wait,

40
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,596
that sounded like two roosters,
do I have three roosters?

41
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:41,513
(roosters crowing)

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,500
Oh my gosh, you guys I think I have.

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,318
I have the red rooster and I'm

44
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,264
thinking I have two other roosters.

45
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:55,097
(rooster crowing)

46
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:04,497
See.

47
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:07,414
(roosters crowing)

48
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:13,200
Both of you are roosters, oh my gosh.

49
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:17,828
(rooster crowing)

50
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,542
I have three roosters, oh my gosh.

51
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:29,129
Dang it, these, both these
silkies are roosters.

52
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,579
I thought just this one
was but I just heard him.

53
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,719
(rooster crowing)

54
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,636
Dang, oh and you are
totally broody aren't you.

55
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:39,695
I don't know if you guys remember

56
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:41,451
but Pam a few months ago went broody

57
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:45,618
and I had a bunch of chicks,
and I think this one is too.

58
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,919
She keeps laying on my eggs, dang it.

59
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,113
Look at that monster rooster right there.

60
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:53,946
- [Ollie] Get the eggs.

61
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:57,807
- You're a monster, well I
officially live on a farm.

62
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:01,281
Yeah I've got three roosters
and these eggs are very warm.

63
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,449
Which means that I'm pretty sure,

64
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,472
'cause that's the second time

65
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:05,586
I've saw her just sitting on eggs.

66
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:06,419
- [Ollie] Luna.

67
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,634
- Luna's like what's going on.

68
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:10,887
Pretty sure that means that she's broody

69
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:13,040
and she is trying to fertilize

70
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,085
these eggs that are probably fertile

71
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:17,302
'cause I have three roosters.

72
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:19,097
Speaking of the chickens a little

73
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:20,575
time has passed and I have made

74
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,390
the chickens a little fruit salad.

75
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,056
I actually just did my grocery

76
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,419
shopping online which was so convenient.

77
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:30,684
And they will be here in a few hours.

78
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:31,903
And so in the meantime of doing

79
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,610
grocery shopping I was able to clean

80
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,463
out all of the food that is not

81
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,683
necessarily bad but just
like we're not gonna eat it.

82
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:39,913
So this is actually a lot of mint.

83
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:42,798
I'm hoping my eggs don't turn minty.

84
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:45,507
But we've got mint, strawberries,

85
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:48,817
grapes, I think there's a tomato in there,

86
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:52,984
banana, a few other things,
those roosters, hello.

87
00:03:58,746 --> 00:03:59,782
- [Ollie] Ow.

88
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:00,615
- [Missy] I don't know if I've

89
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,661
ever given them mint before though.

90
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,744
Alright start giving them their food.

91
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,039
Grapes, ooh there's even watermelon,

92
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,449
oh yeah there's pineapple in there too.

93
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,029
Should we just dump it out, 'kay ready.

94
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,862
- [Finn] Banana, nana.

95
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,395
- [Missy] Oh yeah and some
tortillas that were crunchy.

96
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:26,955
Alright, have fun
chickens, that's a feast.

97
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:30,164
You guys, check out our calendar boys.

98
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:33,064
You guys have eaten all the candy

99
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,814
except two days, we have this day

100
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:40,441
and then tomorrow is Halloween.

101
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,639
Should we eat this one, alright the boys

102
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,663
are excited, alright let me open it.

103
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:47,996
Pink one for Ollie, Orange one for Finn.

104
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:53,259
One day left til Halloween,
tomorrow is Halloween.

105
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,939
- Then we go, go trick or treating.

106
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,379
- [Missy] Yeah tell me, show me your best

107
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,296
trick or treat, say trick or treat.

108
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,705
- Trick or Treat, smell my feet,

109
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:05,205
give me something good to eat.

110
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,716
- [Missy] Alright say trick or treat.

111
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:09,550
(Finn mumbles)

112
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,451
(Missy mumbles back)

113
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:13,939
You're learning huh, say trick.

114
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:14,772
- Trick.

115
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,490
- [Missy] Or treat.

116
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,462
- Treat.

117
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:18,726
- [Missy] Treat.

118
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:19,977
- Trick or Treat.

119
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:20,968
- [Missy] Trick or treat.

120
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:23,989
- Hey Finn did you see
what I put up in the house?

121
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:28,156
You wanna see it, ahhhh, what
do you think of the spider?

122
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,562
(Ollie mumbles)

123
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:36,146
- [Missy] It's pretty cool, huh Finn.

124
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:39,457
- Now whenever we walk
by it, just comes down.

125
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:41,511
- [Missy] Yeah, it's actually pretty fun.

126
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:42,778
- Creates all that cool (mumbles).

127
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:43,978
- [Missy] What do you think of that Finn?

128
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:44,862
- Is that neat?

129
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:47,723
- [Missy] Is it scary or funny?

130
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,354
- Are you boys excited to go
trick or treating tomorrow?

131
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:50,622
- [Ollie] Yeah.

132
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:51,933
- It's almost Halloween for us.

133
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,464
It's Halloween for them right now.

134
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:54,671
- [Missy] Say Happy Halloween.

135
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,432
- Happy Halloween.

136
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:58,175
- Ready, where are we at Ollie.

137
00:05:58,175 --> 00:05:59,685
- We are at the corn maze.

138
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:00,855
- [Missy] Yeah.

139
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:01,748
- Yay.

140
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,879
- Finn just woke up he's so tired.

141
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,346
We are at a corn maze today, we've

142
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:07,432
been really wanting to do a corn maze

143
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:09,648
and it's been so hot so we kinda

144
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:11,682
wanted to wait til it was cooler weather

145
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:14,152
and it's cooler weather so we're going.

146
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:15,226
And this is one of my personal

147
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:17,531
favorite pumpkin patche, patches.

148
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:20,034
It's got pig races and some winery

149
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:22,012
and it's just super cute
and it's got a corn maze.

150
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:24,346
So let's go check it out, look who's here.

151
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:25,402
- [Both] Hey.

152
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:28,225
- [Missy] June's here, hi.

153
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:29,319
- [Bryan] Say hi Finn.

154
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,256
- Not gonna lie it's a little chilly.

155
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,926
- It is, see we've turned
them into Californians.

156
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:35,826
- Little cold.

157
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:37,154
- I'm wearing a sweater and I'm cold.

158
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:38,278
- I know it's chilly.

159
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:39,719
- [Bryan] I'm wearing a hoodie.

160
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,212
- Can you believe last week
it was like 100 degrees.

161
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,488
- You mean two days ago?

162
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:44,343
- [Missy] Yeah.

163
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:45,680
(everyone laughing)

164
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,973
We're officially in fall weather yay.

165
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,390
(soft music)

166
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:52,894
- Boo.

167
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:27,139
- [Missy] Ollie.

168
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,070
- What?

169
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,153
- [Missy] Look at the pigs.

170
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:30,239
- [Ollie] Pigs?

171
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,701
- [Missy] Yeah they got
little piggies in there.

172
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,980
Soon they're gonna let them
out and they're gonna race.

173
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,397
(soft music)

174
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:48,915
- [Bryan] Alright kiddos you're

175
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:51,326
gonna pan for some gems okay?

176
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:52,572
- Is this how you do it?

177
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,513
- No, so what you're gonna do is

178
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:57,680
dump the sand into here and
then you gotta find your gems.

179
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,734
- [Bryan] 'Kay dump
your sand in here buddy.

180
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:03,067
There you go, that's Finn's.

181
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,012
- [Ollie] What's this?

182
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,929
- [Bryan] You gotta shake it, here.

183
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,395
What do you see Ollie?

184
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:14,180
- I see all my gems.

185
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,716
- [Bryan] Nice, dude, ooh
look at this green one.

186
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:23,110
That's cool, got some
really pretty ones, huh.

187
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,637
Let me see what you got Finn.

188
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,634
- [Missy] Ooh look at that
it's a purple one don't eat it.

189
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:29,388
- [Bryan] He's like I just
wanna know what it tastes like.

190
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:31,805
(soft music)

191
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:47,163
- (mumbles) I am a robot ew.

192
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:50,340
- [Bryan] Is that how
the robot talks Ollie?

193
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,338
- Yeah.

194
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:52,382
- [Bryan] What else would it say?

195
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:54,256
(Ollie mumbling)

196
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:55,141
Oh really?

197
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:56,116
- Yeah.

198
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:56,993
- [Bryan] Check out this cool

199
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,942
garden they have here you guys.

200
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,304
And they have like signs of when

201
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:02,927
everything's gonna be ready like

202
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:06,836
October and May, tomatoes they're growing.

203
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:09,253
(slow music)

204
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,356
And the tractor ride has
started, bye you guys.

205
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:19,773
- [Everyone] Bye.

206
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,827
- [Bryan] Bye June, bye Ollie, bye Finn.

207
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:24,660
- Bye.

208
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,135
- Are we going in a tunnel?

209
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:29,968
- Yeah.

210
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:31,801
- Yeah, was that cool?

211
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,263
June what do you think of this?

212
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:39,180
- She's like I love it.

213
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:43,777
- [Missy] It is pretty cool
look at the sunset so nice.

214
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:46,410
- [Bryan] Look at those
cotton candy clouds.

215
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,187
- Check out our double stroller.

216
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,318
- [Bryan] This is safe right?

217
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:51,719
- Heck yeah, totally.

218
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,917
- Candy clouds.

219
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,569
- Ollie's got him, he's like a seatbelt.

220
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,069
- [Bryan] Hang onto him Ollie.

221
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,980
(soft music)

222
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:14,476
- [Missy] Did you just draw an H?

223
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:15,638
- Yeah.

224
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:16,471
- [Missy] Yeah.

225
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:17,304
- [Bryan] That's a good H, Ollie.

226
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:19,699
- That is such a good
H, we are at dinner now.

227
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:22,453
Me and Bryan have plans to go out

228
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,922
after the dinner, we're
gonna do something fun.

229
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,351
And so we thought it would be super easy

230
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:29,173
to take the kids to get some food

231
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:30,373
and then we'll put them to bed.

232
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:32,428
So we're getting some yummy comfort food.

233
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:35,290
Finn that burger is about as big as you.

234
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,573
Are you gonna take a bite?

235
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:38,026
- [Bryan] (mumbles) I don't need this.

236
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,253
- [Missy] He's like take this off.

237
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:43,420
- [Bryan] There you go buddy,
that's our eater right there.

238
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:45,942
I love that he eats cheeseburgers now.

239
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:47,297
- [Missy] I know, so cute.

240
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:48,303
- I don't think Ollie has had

241
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:50,560
a stitch of red meat ever.

242
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,337
- [Missy] Yeah, ever, he doesn't

243
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:56,062
like red meat, but he likes a quesadilla.

244
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,895
A random dance party after dinner.

245
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,864
Finn, don't do it.

246
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:11,556
- So we have been having a pretty

247
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:13,650
rough night tonight after we got

248
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,105
back from dinner we got home and realized

249
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:18,478
that Luna wasn't in the house.

250
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,734
And then when we checked the Nest

251
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,047
cameras it actually showed her

252
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,966
leaving the property through the gate

253
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:27,125
around two PM, so we didn't get back home

254
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,269
til super late and so she's been

255
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,049
gone alone, for six hours now.

256
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,682
And we have no idea where she is.

257
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:36,131
Well babe, we have a lead.

258
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:38,311
- Yeah I think so, I'm so stressed

259
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:41,499
out this has been like
the worst two hours.

260
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,672
- [Bryan] Poor Kelsey and Corbin

261
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:44,226
were like hoping to go to a haunted maze

262
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:45,762
and we're like our dog is lost.

263
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,555
- More than happy to look for Luna.

264
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:50,335
- (mumbles) if this was
Paris like, obviously.

265
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,442
- Oh my gosh.

266
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,961
- [Bryan] So we got a text with

267
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:56,514
a random post in the
area on Facebook right?

268
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,107
- I'm still not exactly
sure what's going on.

269
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:59,788
- [Bryan] We don't know if he has our dog.

270
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:01,773
But he's got a picture
that looks like her.

271
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:04,675
So that's definitely her, but she

272
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,085
has a collar on with our number

273
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,417
so we were hoping they'd call us.

274
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:11,202
- I'm very confused why they haven't

275
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:14,214
I don't know maybe the collar fell off.

276
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:16,357
I still don't know I'm very
confused at this point.

277
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:17,314
- [Bryan] We're hoping it's Luna.

278
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:19,035
- We need his address and
I need to go pick her up.

279
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,658
- [Bryan] And hopefully it's Luna.

280
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,779
- Yeah hopefully it's Luna I guess.

281
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,496
- [Bryan] 'Kay grabbing shoes,

282
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,035
we're gonna go see if that's Luna.

283
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:27,483
This whole night has been really weird.

284
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,481
Weird calls and texts and stuff.

285
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:33,252
I'm just hoping that this
isn't like a dead end.

286
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,252
(suspenseful music)

287
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:42,972
Look who's here, Luna-Loo, you okay Luna?

288
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,280
She went far you guys.

289
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,603
- She went so far.

290
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:49,601
- [Bryan] She was like three, four

291
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,078
miles away from the house.

292
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:52,693
- And she was so scared and everyone

293
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:53,969
was calling her and she like went

294
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,708
to this one girl we've literally

295
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,020
been calling her for hours.

296
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,973
- [Bryan] We were so confused because

297
00:12:57,973 --> 00:12:59,701
we were like she's got our collar on.

298
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,506
Just it should have our
info, but it does not

299
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:05,110
have the tag, it's the collar
but the tag is off, yeah.

300
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,520
- It must have fallen off 'cause

301
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,574
she's got her collar but the tag is off.

302
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:11,837
- [Bryan] Poor thing, hi baby,
at least we have her now.

303
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,201
- Oh girl I was so scared.

304
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,036
- [Bryan] And the boys didn't know.

305
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:16,003
- I know, we have literally been

306
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,994
screaming her name for hours.

307
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:18,856
- [Corbin] For hours.

308
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:20,231
- [Bryan] She didn't hear it babe.

309
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,112
- Calling all the neighbors.

310
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:22,293
- [Bryan] She was inside
this person's house.

311
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:24,013
- [Corbin] She was like way far yeah.

312
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,574
- She was like cuddling and eating food

313
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:27,996
and like totally fine, were you so scared?

314
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:29,482
- [Corbin] Hi girl.

315
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:31,220
- [Missy] Were you so scared?

316
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,511
Well that is our night, Luna is home.

317
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,887
At least you're home, that was probably

318
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:37,200
my biggest fear was that like,

319
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,178
she was just out there like trying

320
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:41,704
to like rest and there's just coyotes.

321
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:42,770
I mean while we were out there

322
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,697
on the Polaris, three coyotes ran past us.

323
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:47,433
And I just thought that's not good.

324
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,607
'Cause even though she's bigger

325
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:52,550
than a coyote, packs of
coyotes are a little scarier.

326
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,730
And I was just so nervous,
she's like guys I was fine.

327
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,563
But anyways we are gonna try and figure

328
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:00,464
out a solution for her, we've looked

329
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,535
at a couple options even before

330
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,869
'cause she's done this one other time.

331
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:05,983
If you guys have any ideas on

332
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,683
how to keep your dog in the yard.

333
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:09,576
We want her to be like in the yard

334
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:10,964
we don't want her just sitting in

335
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,797
the backyard but I don't know yet.

336
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:17,826
She's such a good dog.

337
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:20,909
- She's looking at me like I'm sorry okay.

338
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:24,680
- Can we just stop
talking about it now geez.

339
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,739
By the way if you're wondering where

340
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,769
Karma is, he's with Ollie, asleep.

341
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,711
- [Bryan] Did he even
know that she was gone?

342
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,342
- Like, yeah he's probably like

343
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:34,001
let me know when you find her.

344
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,007
Anyways we're gonna go
ahead and end the video.

345
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,162
So make sure you give this video

346
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:40,162
a big thumbs up, Luna say thumbs up.

347
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:44,303
Thumbs up, thumbs up, licks up.

348
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:48,954
Alright we'll see you guys
tomorrow say bye, boop.

349
00:14:48,954 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
