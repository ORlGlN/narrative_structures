41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,945
Aw he wants to give them some bark.

Look at her like standing up

46
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,215
Oh my gosh, so cute.

47
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:15,075
(laughs)

48
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:17,034
There's Moana.

49
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,698
All of the chickens are doing so good.

50
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:21,642
We are a little low on
eggs for some reason.

51
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,475
- Yeah.

52
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,012
- Do you think it's like the hot weather?

53
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:25,260
- Could be like maybe
- Too hot?

54
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,372
- the change of the weather.

55
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:29,749
Could be that actually their
on like chick starter food.

56
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,929
So their not able, their not
getting as much nutrients

57
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,103
as they normally do.
- Oh yeah.

58
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:34,384

59
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:35,217
- [Bryan] Yeah.

60
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:36,590
Once these little ones start laying eggs,

61
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,786
we're gonna have so many eggs you guys.

62
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,190
It's gonna be ridiculous.

63
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,768
- [Bryan] Hey get out
of our black berries.

64
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:44,952
Missy, they're eating
our black berry bushes.

65
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,904
Alright you guys, so all of the boys

66
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:48,949

pool and they're swimming.

67
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:49,782
(shushes)

68
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:51,508
And we have a little bit of a secret.

69
00:02:51,508 --> 00:02:53,555
We're gonna play a prank on them.

70
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,973
If you guys didn't know,
around Christmas time,

71
00:02:55,973 --> 00:03:00,140
Elf On The Shelf filled this
playroom 25,000 ball pit balls.

72
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,619
We are going to fill this playroom

73
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:05,639

76
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,252
- Let's do this.

77
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:12,150
- [Bryan] Alright we are

78
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,218
trailing through the house right now.

79
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:15,184
This is gonna be perfect.

80
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,017
(chuckles)

81
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:17,291
- It reaches the whole way in.

82
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,683
- [Bryan] Yeah.

83
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:20,570
Bring it right to the playroom.

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,153
Check out all of these
Wubble Bubble Balls.

85
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:28,433
We have pink ones and we have blue ones.

86
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,231
It's kinda like we're
doing a gender reveal.

87
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:32,330
But not really, we're
just filling up a playroom

88
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,207
with a ton of Wubble Bubble Balls.

89
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:37,124
I love the feeling of these though.

90
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,518
- [Bryan] Ginger's getting her vacuum on.

91
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:41,351
- Hell yeah.

92
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,810
- [Bryan] Just so the kids
don't step in anything gross

93
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,643
when they claw through here.

94
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:44,868
- I've been trying to
pick up all the popcorn

95
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:46,528

96
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:48,028

This is so cool.

183
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:29,499
(upbeat playful music)

184
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,106
- Time to open doors.

185
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:34,689
- [Bryan] Let's open the doors.

186
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,637
(screaming)

187
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:39,887
(laughing)

188
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,905
- [Bryan] Bubble party.

189
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:48,705
(screaming)

190
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,455
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

191
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,462
- Oops. Oops.

192
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:56,284
(screaming)

193
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,674
- [Bryan] You like this Ollie?

194
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:03,507
- Yeah.

195
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:07,323
- [Missy] We just filled our whole house

196
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:08,879
with Wubble Bubbles.

197
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,445
(yelling)

198
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:13,445
- Oh my goodness, what!?

199
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:20,405
(indistinctive chatter)

200
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:25,940
- [Missy] He's riding a horse
through the Wubble Bubbles.

201
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,252
- This is amazing.

202
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:31,546
But you have to give credit,
where credit is due you guys.

203
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:35,240
Missy and Ginger blew all of these up.

204
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,941
- Yup it was hard work, I
could not do it without her.

205
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:38,774
(laughs)

206
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:41,534
- And we're basically
Wubble Bubble pros now.

207
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:43,875
- Yeah.
- Yeah we're pros.

208
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,021
- [Bryan] This is so cool, babe.

209
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:49,719
The things we do for youtube, right?

210
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,867
(screaming)

211
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:51,827
(laughing)

212
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:53,994
I honestly could not
believe this happened.

213
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,391
This is amazing.

214
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:57,568
Our entire house is full of his-

215
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,610
I'm not really sure what we're gonna do

216
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,904
at this present time with all
of these Wubble Bubble Balls.

217
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:04,411
But all I know is we're basically

218
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,877
trapped with all of them now.

219
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:07,906
They live among us.

220
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:08,818
- (mumbles) Wubble Bubble house.

221
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,098
- [Bryan] Yes (laughs).

222
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:12,541
How do you get them to move like that.

223
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,414
They're crazy.

224
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:17,372
They look so cool all the time.

225
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,722
(popping)

226
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:20,530
Go Ollie go, go, go, go.

227
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,663
Drumming, bubble drumming,
bubble drumming, bubble drumming!

228
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:25,496
(banging)

229
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:30,151
- [Bryan] Make em jiggle, make
it jiggle, make it jiggle!

230
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:30,984
Bubble!

231
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:35,192
(upbeat music)

232
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,279
(laughs)

233
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,112
(popping)

234
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:43,500
- [Carl] Oh, care with bud.

235
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,727
- [Bryan] Is that, it popped?

236
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:45,560
- No it just popped right there.

237
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,560
- [Bryan] Uh oh, we lost one. Oh no.

238
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:54,400
(upbeat music)

239
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,733
(relaxing upbeat music)

240
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:04,865
If you guys wanna watch more
fun videos like this one

241
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,243
of things we've done with crazy stuff.

242
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:09,198
Be sure to check that
iCard for fun playlists.

243
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:10,998
This was crazy (laughs).

244
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:11,958
This was really cool.

245
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,387
It was almost as cool
as filling the playroom

246
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:14,391
with ball pit balls.

247
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:18,131
Finn's a wakey gets to join in on the fun.

248
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,446
- [Bryan] What's going on Finn?

249
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:22,446
Look at all these balls.

250
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,908
What did we do Finn?

251
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:28,324
Are these bubble balls?

252
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:29,170
Isn't that so cool?

253
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,205
Do you wanna touch one?

254
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:31,473
Oh, touch it.

255
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:34,035
- I can get Wubble Bubble aligator.

256
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:37,054
- [Boy] Go boop boop boop boop boop.

257
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,068
- Isn't that cool? Do
you wanna play with it?

258
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:41,991
- [Bryan] Finn your hair
is so staticky (laughs).

259
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,241
(babbling)

260
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:49,619
He is so happy. Look at his hair (laughs).

261
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:55,130
(upbeat pop music)

262
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,052
- Aw thank you.

263
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,227
- That is so sweet.

264
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,165
- Smells so nice.

265
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:04,742
- [Bryan] Did you get Ginger a flower?

266
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:05,705
- Yeah.

267
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,969
- You're my favorite.

268
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:08,802
(laughing)

269
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,635
- [Bryan] He's like,

270
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,017
"Okay, I'm gonna eat these Pringles now."

271
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:12,077
(laughs)

272
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,639
- So we had a ton of fun today.

273
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,119
And we've kinda just been chillin'

274
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,637
and chatting and hanging out.

275
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:20,033
But I just saw on the Nest Cam

276
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:21,532
something really cute in the playroom.

277
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:22,604
I wanna show you guys.

278
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:25,648
(door slides)

279
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:27,255
(babbling)

280
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:29,635
- [Bryan] What happened?

281
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:31,722
Ollie fell asleep?

282
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:32,832
- Yeah.

283
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:34,154
- [Bryan] Yeah.

284
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:35,399
(children playing)

285
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,976
He fell asleep with his stuffed animals.

286
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:37,809
Let's leave him alone.

287
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:40,695
No, Finn, come on. Let's leave him alone.

288
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:42,370
(laughs)

289
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,351
That is so cute, Ollie fell
asleep on his stuffed animals.

290
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,691
I love that kid.

291
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,280
I think, what are the boys
doing, playing video games?

292
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,113
- Hey.

293
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:51,946
- [Bryan] What are you guys doing?

294
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:52,779
- We're playing One Two Sitch.

295
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,404
- [Bryan] Oh nice.

296
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:55,757
- It's hard.

297
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,812
- He, what, he went, "Agh!".

298
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:00,062
(laughing)

299
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,833
- Oh it's been so fun.

300
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,166
(upbeat relaxing music)

301
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:20,591
(upbeat country music)

302
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,961
(upbeat country music)

303
00:12:42,140 --> 00:00:00,000
(drum banging)
