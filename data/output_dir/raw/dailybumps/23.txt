1
00:00:00,824 --> 00:00:04,491
(gentle instrumental music)

2
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:25,999
- You guys, welcome to year five!

3
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:28,062
- Welcome to year five!

4
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,729
(upbeat instrumental music)

5
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,180
- We've been vlogging every
day for five years, you guys.

6
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,100
It honestly is amazing, when you think

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,940
about how many people watch these vlogs,

8
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,260
and how many people subscribe, and it's

9
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,493
really kind of humbling
to have so many people

10
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:57,129
be inspired by you.

11
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,796
(upbeat instrumental music)

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,740
We've always vlogged even
the most mundane life things,

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,480
but I will say that we've gotten

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,880
pretty good at making it
a lot more interesting.

15
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,573
(upbeat electronic music)

16
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:41,170
And that's kind of like what our life

17
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,150
is all about, right?

18
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,700
- Yeah, I love the fact that our vlogs

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,970
can be just us, you know us.

20
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,010
But you also know that we're really fun.

21
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,810
You can see both of
that through our vlogs.

22
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,477
(gentle instrumental music)

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,950
- We always try to stay fun and positive.

24
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,610
And I think it's a good
thing for the vlog,

25
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,520
but it's a good thing as a family also.

26
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,970
- I think it's really good as a family

27
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,627
because we get to stay
happy, and we're having fun.

28
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:10,627
- [Bryan] Yeah.

29
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:14,128
(upbeat electronic music)

30
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:06,860
- [Missy] But you also do
see us in our sad moments.

31
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,720
You see us struggling, you
see us having bad days.

32
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,960
But you know what?

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
That's what everyone deals with.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,932
♪ And I saw some sad ♪

35
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:16,378
♪ Big blue eyes ♪

36
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,547
♪ But I've been sad ♪

37
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:23,680
♪ This is home ♪

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,500
- I think the message I want people

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,790
to take away is that families are

40
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,010
a place of joy, comfort,
and acceptance, and love.

41
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,950
And if you are in a family where you don't

42
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,560
get those things, you can watch us,

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,250
and you can find it, and you
can know that it is possible.

44
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,769
(upbeat electronic music)

45
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,510
- Life isn't always easy.

46
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,980
You've seen our struggles, you've seen

47
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,820
what we've been through, we try and just

48
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,460
show a lot of the positivity, and you

49
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,210
guys can have that too, even if your life

50
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,686
is hard, and struggling, and
you're having difficulties.

51
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:06,186
(upbeat electronic music)

52
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:08,395
(family cheers)

53
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:09,228
- [Bryan] Three million!

54
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:10,610
- And we just wanna say thank you to

55
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,400
all of our viewers, and every one

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,060
that's been watching
us, and supporting us.

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,093
- [Bryan] We couldn't be more grateful.

58
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:19,593
(upbeat electronic music)

59
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,360
Thanks for five years of daily vlogs!

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,438
We will see you manana.

61
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:29,522
- Bye!

62
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:30,522
- Bye.
- Bye!

63
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,590
- [Finn] Boop.
