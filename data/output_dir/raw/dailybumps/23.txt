1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,800
- Can you please let mama sleep past 5:30?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,633
- No.

3
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:04,466
(deep sigh)

4
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:07,030
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
- Good morning guys, it is time for school

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,430
and it is such a beautiful day.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,410
It's cold, it's chilly, it's windy

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,690
but it rained which is always nice.

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,000
So we're headed to school, huh?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,833
- Yeah.

11
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:21,666
You look so cute.

12
00:00:22,702 --> 00:00:25,250
(upbeat music)

13
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,260
- I am home, Ollie is
dropped off at school

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,900
and now I'm hanging out
with my other little dude.

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,162
How you doing?

16
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:31,995
- Good.

17
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,750
And Karma's like oh my gosh, oh my gosh,

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,750
we're vlogging, we're
vlogging, we're vlogging.

19
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,090
Hey, guess what?

20
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,200
Nuna's getting groomed
right now in the yard

21
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,160
and your next.

22
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,580
If you guys don't know,
we're actually trying

23
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,750
to grow out his fur in a nice way

24
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,180
and maybe get it back to where it was

25
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,100
before we shaved him years and years ago.

26
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,000
Cause the lady that I'm working
with right now she's like,

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,230
"I think we can get it back,
we just have to be patient."

28
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,650
Alright, I'm at the barn now
hanging out with my little guy.

29
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,110
Hi, dude, how's it going Nacho?

30
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,060
Life with my horse has been amazing.

31
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,160
It's been a hard month.

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,950
We've definitely had our struggles.

33
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,000
He had hives for a long
time, which are now gone.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Foot was hurting, which is all better.

35
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,890
And he had some pain issues in his back

36
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,900
and he's feeling great.

37
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,733
Huh guy?

38
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:15,566
Oh, I was going to give him a treat.

39
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:16,820
I bought these treats the other day

40
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,090
and they're so cute.

41
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,450
This is the brand, right.

42
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,980
And it's basically an oatmeal cookie.

43
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,730
And it smells like an oatmeal cookie

44
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,500
and I even ate some.

45
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,610
I read all the ingredients.

46
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,610
It's just like oats, and like,
cinnamon, canola oil, agave.

47
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,190
So it's low sugar and low carbs,

48
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,270
so it wasn't like super sweet

49
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,420
but it was actually pretty good.

50
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,740
And I think he loved them,

51
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,628
he's like, "Uh, are you going
to give me one of those?"

52
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:44,057
Ugh, they smell so good

53
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:45,690
and they're like smooshy like a cookie.

54
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,523
You want one?

55
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,700
What do you think of that?

56
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,199
He's like, "It's so chewy."

57
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,616
(calm music)

58
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,180
Alright, Nacho is all saddled and yep,

59
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,840
I'm riding english again.

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,673
I'm going to tighten this up.

61
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:40,000
Actually have a new bit in for him.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,090
Actually just gave him a new treat

63
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,570
so he's chewing, but I got a new bit.

64
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,936
It's something that I thought
he actually used previously

65
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:47,340
before I owned him but it's
a little bit different.

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,340
It has a roly thing in it.

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,310
Alright, I'm going to
do a little trotting.

68
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,770
Mainly what we really are working on,

69
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,560
obviously my own posture and stuff

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,750
but for sure him, his head.

71
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,940
He doesn't put his head down

72
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,053
so we are kind of
working on that together.

73
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:02,720
(calming music)

74
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,570
We just got done trotting
for about 10 minutes

75
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,490
and he did really, really good.

76
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,150
I do have a couple things
working against me.

77
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,950
One, the wind, he doesn't like the wind.

78
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,410
It's scary to him and
when he hears the wind

79
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,160
he starts kind of
trotting a little faster.

80
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,360
Which is totally fine,
I can like handle him

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,620
and tell him to slow down his trot.

82
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,280
It actually rained last
night so the ground

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,440
is a little slippery.

84
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,880
Not super slippery, I don't want a canner

85
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,970
but I have felt him, like oops

86
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,445
that was slippery, like just now.

87
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:48,397
(laughing)

88
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:50,000
Nothing to bad but it is
good to be really careful

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,270
if you're in the arena after it rains.

90
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,470
But I don't know if you guys noticed

91
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,710
but he definitely did start

92
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,430
to relax his head towards the end.

93
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,530
So I had to lower it a bit

94
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,210
and I've just been
continuously working on that.

95
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,970
When his head is down it means
he's relaxed and submissive.

96
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,710
Actually when his heads up
it kind of means he's like,

97
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,080
"What's going on, what's going on?"

98
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,780
and he's like looking
around at everything.

99
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,680
So right now, he's doing good,

100
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,100
and I love when his head is down.

101
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,459
I like to massage his
neck, tell him good boy

102
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,249
so that he knows it's good
to keep your neck down

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,120
because then you get massages.

104
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,490
Overall doing really good.

105
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,200
I think I'm going to keep doing stuff

106
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,110
but I'm going to stop vlogging now.

107
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,290
So I actually just rode for about an hour

108
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,330
and then I was just like,

109
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,830
"I want to ride him without the saddle."

110
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,570
And now I'm riding him bareback,
it's actually pretty fun.

111
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,688
So I'm going to record a little bit of it.

112
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:42,355
(calming music)

113
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:51,890
I'm going to attempt to take a nap on him.

114
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,580
Hopefully I don't fall
off or get kicked off.

115
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,413
Here we go.

116
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,708
(nervous yelling)

117
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:08,610
That was so much fun

118
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,210
and I'm going to have
to do that more often

119
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,710
and he was so good.

120
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,090
Good boy, Nacho.

121
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,210
(loud boom)

122
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,460
So I just did all this
riding and I actually left.

123
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,879
And as I was leaving I
looked down at my ring

124
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,120
and I am missing my entire diamond.

125
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,030
I'm totally stressing out.

126
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,050
So I don't know if you guys know

127
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,100
but Bryan got this for me years ago

128
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,710
and we actually vlogged
it, it was for Christmas.

129
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,600
He just upgraded my ring,
it's super special to me

130
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,840
and the entire diamond is literally gone.

131
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,590
So as you can see, it's
not even just the diamond,

132
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,950
it's like the prongs and everything.

133
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,220
It must've just got ripped off.

134
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,900
So lesson learned on wearing
rings with diamonds down here,

135
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,610
I'll probably not be doing that anymore

136
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,350
but I'm just looking everywhere

137
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,810
for where it could've possibly fallen off.

138
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,050
The truth is, I got here, I
immediately put my gloves on.

139
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,190
So, I check my gloves,
they're not in there.

140
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,040
Gosh, if it fell in here,

141
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,640
she was literally sweeping
as I was doing stuff,

142
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,470
it literally could have just been swept up

143
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,350
and been put into the big pile of poop.

144
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,990
Or it could have fallen off in the arena.

145
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,300
I did take my gloves off in
the arena for a little bit

146
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,330
to just ride without them.

147
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,840
If it's in the arena, it's gone.

148
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,540
Maybe it actually fell off before.

149
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,420
I wonder if this footage
actually shows whether or not

150
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,810
my diamond was on.

151
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,272
You guys go back in the
vlog and look to see

152
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:26,423
if in the past, when I got
here, if my diamond was there.

153
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:28,400
That will be good information to know.

154
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,680
I feel like it was, I feel
like I would have noticed it.

155
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,890
If I had got here and there was no ring on

156
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,890
or no diamond on it.

157
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:35,750
I've got some investigating to do.

158
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,523
Actually, I'm going to
look at the footage to.

159
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,676
I'm going to need some candy.

160
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:42,170
I'm so bummed, this
totally stresses me out.

161
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,930
I cannot believe I lost my diamond.

162
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,899
So I just looked at the
footage as quickly as I could

163
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,770
while I was sitting here and
I think when I was talking to

164
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,540
Karma I think I saw it
cause it wasn't like this.

165
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,812
It looked like the diamond was there

166
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,690
so I'm sure I must've lost it here

167
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,610
and I don't see how I could possibly

168
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,760
find it here at the barn again.

169
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,670
Especially if it fell off in the arena

170
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,380
but even if it wasn't the arena

171
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,190
even if it was just anywhere in the barn,

172
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,630
she sweeps that constantly.

173
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,470
It's gone if so.

174
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,584
(sigh)

175
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,200
I'm so bummed, this seriously sucks.

176
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,540
I mean honestly, lesson learned.

177
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,970
I probably should've
known not to bring a ring

178
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:18,170
that is pokey down here.

179
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,087
You are just so rough and
you don't even realize

180
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,150
it sometimes when you're moving your hand

181
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,981
and doing things, you
don't even realize that

182
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:27,230
you're probably going to
hit something or whatever.

183
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,600
Just really bummed because
that diamond obviously

184
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,030
really meant a lot to me.

185
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,620
I don't even want a new diamond,

186
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,200
I just want that diamond.

187
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,670
I am home now and I have
to break the news to Bryan.

188
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,290
Hey Bryan.

189
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,180
- Yes.

190
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,699
- So, I went riding.

191
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,833
- Tell me all your
problems, lay it all on me.

192
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:51,510
- I went riding on my horse
today and I lost my diamond.

193
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,820
(laughing)

194
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,373
- It's like a black hole
in the middle of your ring.

195
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,164
- I know, isn't that so sad?

196
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,870
- That is a tragedy.

197
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,810
- I looked everywhere.

198
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,780
- I'm sorry.

199
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,810
- And I even had Maria,
she's checked the arena.

200
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,440
Like all over, since the arena isn't dusty

201
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,130
because it rained, it's pretty firm.

202
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,610
So I was like, "Oh well
maybe it could just

203
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,475
"be sitting on top of the dirt."

204
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:17,890
But she didn't see it anywhere.

205
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,453
- This is so sad.

206
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:22,905
- I know, it's my ring.

207
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:24,450
It's so sad.

208
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:28,160
Ugh, that's such a bummer.

209
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,190
I mean honestly, it's
pretty crazy that I can lose

210
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,520
such a giant ring, or a giant diamond

211
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,240
and now it's just somewhere.

212
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,274
Like someone could literally just find it.

213
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:38,282
- They could literally find a diamond,

214
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:39,429
and it would make their day.

215
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,873
- They could find a diamond
in the middle of a haystack.

216
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:45,720
(laughing)

217
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,967
- Nursery rhyme coming to life.

218
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:48,820
- Yeah.

219
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,653
- That's pretty sad.

220
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:50,486
- I'm so sad, I know.

221
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,324
I'm going to have to wear
some of my other ones

222
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,157
so no one hits on me.

223
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,142
Cause ya know, I gotta
show them I'm married.

224
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:55,975
(laughing)

225
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:57,838
- Yeah, for sure.

226
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:58,671
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sad.

227
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,745
- It's okay.

228
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:02,360
- Honestly, I've also even lost my watch

229
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,330
while riding the horse.

230
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,390
So clearly I need to
not have anything on me

231
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,560
while I'm taking care of my horse.

232
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,000
Now that I'm home I'm continuing a project

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
that I started a couple days ago

234
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,650
and it is a mess.

235
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,390
And that is my closet.

236
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,060
So I'm just kind of going
threw and getting rid

237
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,420
of all the clothes I don't wear anymore.

238
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,990
If I haven't worn it in two years,

239
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,730
I probably just get rid of it.

240
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,700
So I got rid of a lot of my
sweaters, a lot of my shirts.

241
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm actually gonna have my mom go threw it

242
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,081
and Kelsey go threw it and
then once they go threw it

243
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:33,914
and get everything they want,
I'm going to donate it all.

244
00:09:33,914 --> 00:09:36,600
And then I'm also getting rid
of a lot of my old T-shirts.

245
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,090
So if you don't know, I'm
a very sentimental person

246
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,090
when it comes to my clothing especially.

247
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,350
And I just had to show
you some of the very,

248
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,020
very old merch from Daily
Bumps that I still have.

249
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,520
And while I do this, Finn is
watching some YouTube videos.

250
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,860
Babysitter YouTube.

251
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,890
- He's watching videos of
people vacuuming on YouTube.

252
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,988
That apparently is a thing now.

253
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:58,810
- Yeah, that kid's doing chores

254
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,941
you should do chores to, okay?

255
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:01,774
- Ha.

256
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:02,607
- Bryan you wanna see
some of our old merch

257
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:03,641
that I still have?

258
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:04,474
- Yes, yeah.

259
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:05,307
- Okay.

260
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:06,950
- I actually have a ton of shirts myself

261
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,253
that are shirts I've kept from the past.

262
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:10,112
- Like sentimental?

263
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,170
- Yeah.

264
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,298
- There are a couple in there
that are from high school

265
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:15,465
and I'm, "Don't get rid of it."

266
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:16,950
Because I remember him
in it, in high school.

267
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,168
Anyways, here's one of the
very, very first shirts

268
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,790
that we ever released

269
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,884
and that is "HEY!"

270
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:24,800
- Yes, the "HEY!" Shirt.

271
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,660
We had them printed
locally in a print shop

272
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,530
and we packaged every
single one of them up

273
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,034
and shipped them out to you guys.

274
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:32,264
- Packaged every single one.

275
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,035
I mean we didn't sell a ton

276
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:35,585
but there was enough that I was like,

277
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:36,837
"Okay, never doing that again."

278
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,550
- Yeah, I know, let us
know down in the comments

279
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,460
if you have a "HEY!" shirt
from the good-old days.

280
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,980
- So this one's really old

281
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,870
and some people have
mixed feelings about it,

282
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,004
here we go.

283
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:47,550
- Oh, is it, the Ollie pop?

284
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,209
I liked the Ollie-Pop.

285
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:51,650
I liked it, I thought it was cute.

286
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,700
But looking back at it is a little weird.

287
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:56,399
- Yeah, so if you don't know,

288
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,232
we use to sing Ollie

289
00:10:57,232 --> 00:11:01,090
♪ Ollie Pop, Ollie Pop,
Oh Ollie Ollie Ollie Pop ♪

(laughing)

292
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,124
- Yeah, it was a little weird.

293
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:08,105
We actually sold these,
I'm sure people have them

294
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:10,000
Here's our old Daily
Bumps merch without Finn.

295
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,290
- Oh yeah, that was with
the littles without Finn.

296
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,550
- There's no Finn, just us.

297
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,870
Oh, this is a good one.

298
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,220

00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:23,690
- Sometimes you just got
boring adult things to do.

301
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,523
- We haven't said that in so long

302
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:27,552
but if you guys know this,
let us know down below.

303
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:28,385

- Yeah, we use to say it all the time.

305
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:31,354
We'd be like we're doing
"boring adult things," bleh.

306
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:34,190
I'm doing boring adult
things right now, actually.

307
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,880
Oh, and then we've got this of course.

308
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,850

- Yeah.

312
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,324
- That's a cool one, we
should bring that one back.

313
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:43,157
- I know.

314
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:45,414
- Oh babe, you're even
rocking my music merch.

00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,490
- I know, I've got...

316
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,480
- I've got a true fan

317
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,290
she's even got the lion shirt.

318
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,240
- I know I've got them

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,680
I even have some SO CASSIE.
- Oh, CASSIE.

321
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:57,346
- CASSIE merch.

322
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:58,751
- We're going to go through
these quickly, ready?

323
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,584
Dank as Junk.

324
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,606
- Oh, we got Dank as Junk merch!

325
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:03,320
- Steps to Wander.

326
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,658
- There we go.

327
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,491
(laughing)

328
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,870
She's repping everyone in our closet.

329
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,520
- Oh this from DBECK Summer vacay.

330
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,409
- Oh, that's right, we
had those shirts made.

331
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:12,450
That was a blast.

332
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,325
- Yeah, they made these for
us, they're really cool.

333
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:15,158
- Oh, that's so cool.

334
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:16,560
- Oh, Winter Vacay.

335
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,750
- And then Jared did
the Winter Vacay shirts,

336
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,010
that's so cool.

337
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,591
- Look at this, old Ellie and Jared.

338
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:25,144
- Oh, look at the giraffe.
- The giraffe.

339
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,059
That was from when Jackson was a baby.

340
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:28,212
- Yeah, classic.

341
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,180
- And here's an old Ellie and Jared.

342
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,050
- Check it out Ellie and Jared,

343
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,150
we got your first merch
here, that's awesome babe.

344
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,110
- Yeah, I have so many.

345
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,210
I'm like, "I can't get rid of them."

346
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,210
- Yeah.

347
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,140
- Have to keep them all.

348
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,330
- I probably have a ton on my side to.

349
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,740
We'll have to save that for another vlog,

350
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,270
I'll have to show you my merch.

351
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,550
Oh, I have another one, I
have another one you missed!

352
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,620
I have the anchor.
- Oh my gosh,

353
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,685
I don't remember that one!
- With the HEY! Shirts,

354
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,002
- I do remember it.

355
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:52,457
- We sold them with the HEY! Shirts.

356
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:53,858
- That was before Ollie was born

357
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,050
because I remember wearing that

358
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,390
before Ollie was born, I think.

359
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,630
- I had these printed locally to,

360
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,200
we packaged them up, I designed it.

361
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,710
- Oh, those are so cute.

362
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,131
- Established 2013, DB.

363
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:05,471
- I really like that one, I
want that one to come back.

364
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:07,174
Because I really love the 2013.

365
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:10,099
- Yeah, cause 2013, that's
when we started to vlog.

366
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,740
- Yeah, I mean, we've done it five years.

367
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,081
- That's amazing.

368
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:16,870
- Wow, that is so cool, I love that one.

369
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,180
- Oh and of course I've got this one.

370
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,930
- Oh yeah, and I do have
all the new merch as well

371
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,515
but it's hanging in a different closet.

372
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:25,888
(excited yelling)

373
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,670
Oh, no I have that, I
do, I actually forgot it.

374
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,500
- If you guys don't know
what Fresh Snips is,

375
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,740
it's a song that I wrote with
Jared and Collin, my buddies.

376
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,320
And we did a music video
for it I'm going to have

377
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,403
it linked to the I-card.

378
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,522
- It's so cool.

379
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:41,355
- Because it was just so much fun.

380
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,213
And that was a long time ago.
- Yeah.

381
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:44,040
- That's a good little
flash back right there.

382
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,013
Going threw our closets today, I guess.

383
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:47,250
- Oh, we have so many cool merch.

384
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,310
I can't believe we've been doing merch

385
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,210
for that long, honestly.

386
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,060
There actually is more.

387
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,140
I even have playlist shirts,
I have VidCon shirts,

388
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,680
I have multiple sizes of all those shirts.

389
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,450
Like, it's kind of ridiculous.

390
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,910
Anyways, I have to get back to work.

391
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,025
I am going to finish doing
this, look here's all my hair

392
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:02,147
and I'm watching Steps to Wander actually.

393
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:06,260
Okay I have to show you one other thing

394
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,330
and this one is actually going
to be little bit of a quiz.

395
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,320
I'm also a little sentimental
about certain clothing

396
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,410
that I've worn in the
past and I want to know

397
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,410
what very, very special
video did I wear this in?

398
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,100
Can you guys see what it is?

399
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:27,700
That's what it looks like,
that's actually the front

400
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,580
and that's the back.

401
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,010
Let me know down in the
comments if you know

402
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,680
what video I wore this
in and if you don't know,

403
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,850
probably check the comments

404
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,850
because I'll try to pin the
person who said it right

405
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,050
and you guys can go watch it.

406
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,760
Because it's very, very special
and it's a very old video.

407
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,690
Let me know down below if you know

408
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,910
which one I'm talking about.

409
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,050
Well I think this is all I'm
going to be able to do today.

410
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,610
Oh my gosh, I'm getting rid
of all this, all of this.

411
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,818
I've gone through all my closets.

412
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:56,651
I'm going through all my jewelry right now

413
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:58,790
which has been a disaster.

414
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,290
Oh look, this was my grandmas.

415
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,830
Bryan got this for me for
Christmas, he found it for me.

416
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,670
But anyways I still have
to go through all this

417
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:10,240
and just few more things but
I'm finally getting close

418
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,170
and then I have to do my bathroom.

419
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,310
Oh my gosh, I am such a pack rat guys.

420
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,710
It's ridiculous but yay for
cleaning out your closet.

421
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,780
Ya know what and not a
lot of trash, ya know.

422
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,150
This is as much trash as there was.

423
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,090
Just a lot of clothes
that I don't need anymore.

424
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,070
Don't need to keep around.

425
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,570
A lot of stuff I'm like,
"Oh, it's so hard."

426
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,990
Like I loved wearing
my little Tiger onesie.

427
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,090
I'm sure I have tons of videos in it

428
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,170
but I just can't keep everything.

429
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,040
Alright, I'm off to go pick up Ollie now.

430
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,170
You want to come help me get Ollie?

431
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,003
- Yeah.

432
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,490
- I got to get you dressed, okay?

433
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,745
No more YouTube babysitter, okay?

434
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:41,933
(laughing)

435
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:44,530
- Look how handsome these dogs are.

436
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,706
Well handsome and pretty.

437
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:47,539
(laughing)

438
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,040
They are so cute.

439
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,350
And these boys are having
a little snacky poo.

440
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,790
They already actually had their dinner.

441
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm hoping that having a
little snack right before

442
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,720
they go to bed, of course
they'll brush their teeth first,

443
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,640
will make them sleep a little bit longer.

444
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,070
Ollie has had his fair
share of sleeping issues.

445
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,900
With waking up at night
and coming into our room

446
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,640
but he has always been
very good at sleeping in

447
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,990
or at least sleeping to a decent time.

448
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,290
Finn on the other hand,

449
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,810
he wakes up in the middle of the night

450
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,330
but then he doesn't go back to bed.

451
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,101
He likes to wake up at
5:30 every single day.

452
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:25,150
No matter what I do, whether
I bring him into my bed

453
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,690
or go into his bed and
try to cuddle with him,

454
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,600
he does not fall asleep.

455
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,530
Maybe he's like waking up from hunger,

456
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,637
that I never feed him at that time,

457
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:33,920
like no, it's the middle of the night.

458
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,190
It's still dark out, we're not eating.

459
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,870
So I'm hoping with a little bit of a snack

460
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,300
will keep him feeling full
through out the night.

461
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,760
Can you please let mama sleep past 5:30?

462
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,922
- No.

463
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:46,190
(deep sighing)

464
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,720
I may end up having to end up putting Finn

465
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,851
in a different bed, ya know.

466
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:50,684
- Mhm.

467
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:52,196
- Would that make you sad or happy?

468
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:53,360
- Sad.

469
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,193
- Sad.

470
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:55,850
You guys really like
sleeping together, huh?

471
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,830
- Yeah.

472
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,950
- Well, we'll see, we'll
see if we can fix it, okay?

473
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,783
- Okay.

474
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:00,960
- Hugs good night.

475
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,958
Hugs good night, I love you.

476
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,436
I love you boys, sleep good okay.

477
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:06,269
- Okay.

478
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,829
- Alright the boys are going to bed

479
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,869
which means we are not far off.

480
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,549
And look at this little
girl, she just loves

481
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,950
hanging out with me.

482
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,270
Before I end today's
vlog I wanted to mention

483
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,740
that Missy may have called me earlier

484
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,810
to tell me that she lost
the diamond in her ring

485
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,430
and I was super sad for her

486
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,830
but at the same time, I was
so worried when she called,

487
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,400
because she was like really
flustered and talking fast

488
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,150
and I was thinking, "oh
my gosh, are you okay,

489
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,970
"did someone get hurt?"

490
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,910
That's immediately where my mind goes

491
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,370
and so when she tell me, "I
lost the diamond in my ring."

492
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,783
I'm like who cares because
you are healthy and happy

493
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:51,500
and that's always what's important.

494
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,880
And I want to just let you guys know that.

495
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,090
Things can be replaced and people cannot

496
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,750
which is why it just doesn't really matter

497
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,390
at the end of the day.

498
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,900
It's a bummer and I
feel really bad for her

499
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,090
and maybe she'll have good
luck and be able to find it

500
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,020
but it's a bummer.

501
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:10,882
Also, for those of you wondering
about our upload schedule

502
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:11,950
I wanted to give you a
little bit of insight,

503
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,500
we announced about a month ago

504
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,440
that we were going to be making
some changes to the channel,

505
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,210
taking a couple days off a week.

506
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,240
I think we are going to stick
with taking off Tuesdays

507
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,310
and Thursdays, not
uploading on those days.

508
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,790
And just to clarify we
may not be uploading

509
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,050
on Tuesdays and Thursdays
but we are always

510
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,920
filming cool things around this house.

511
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,080
I guarantee you guys aren't
missing much of anything.

512
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,890
Two days a week off has
just been so incredible

513
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,050
for our family and we have been able to be

514
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,440
so much more productive with our time

515
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,420
because we are actually
working on some really cool

516
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,390
big things that will hopefully
be able to go up on days

517
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,920
where we don't put a normal vlog.

518
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,770
I think you're going to start to see some

519
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,810
other cool things on this channel.

520
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,410
So we're working really hard at that

521
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,910
but I just wanted to say a huge thank you

522
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,290
to each and everyone one you,
