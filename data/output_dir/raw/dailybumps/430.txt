1
00:00:00,613 --> 00:00:01,852
- Good morning.

2
00:00:01,852 --> 00:00:03,102
- Good morning.

3
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:06,388
- Hey, Santa came.

4
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:07,221
- What?

5
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:08,087
- Santa came.

6
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:08,920
- He did?

7
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,351
- Yes, Santa came.

8
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:12,060
- You're so cute, always.

9
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,397
Merry Christmas.

10
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:14,941
- Merry Christmas.

11
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:16,148
- [Bryan] Do you know for sure Santa came?

12
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:16,981
- Yes.

13
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:17,814
- [Bryan] Did you hear him?

14
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:18,647
- Yes.

15
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:20,954
- I think we should definitely see

16
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,551
if the reindeer ate our carrots.

17
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:24,384
- Yeah.

18
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:27,240
- And we should see if
Santa ate our cookies.

19
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,073
- Yeah.

20
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:28,906
- And drink or milk.

21
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:29,739
Should we go look?

22
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:30,576
- Yeah.

23
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:34,743
("This Is Home" by Bryan Lanning)

24
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,601
- Good morning, guys.

25
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,492
It's very early.

26
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:11,325
Everyone's awake.

27
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:12,158
(Oliver speaking loudly)

28
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:12,991
Guess what?

29
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,687
Fin's still sleeping?

30
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:15,520
I love you.

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,353
- I love you too.

32
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:17,186
- Merry Christmas, buddy.

33
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:18,709
- Koda!

34
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,542
- Koda!

35
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,160
Hi, good morning, Koda.

36
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,836
- Let's check and see
if we see the reindeer.

37
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:25,669
The kids.

38
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,502
- [Bryan] Oh, Ollie.

39
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:27,460
Let's check and see if they ate

40
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,210
that carrot out here.

41
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:32,859
- [Missy] Look.

42
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,442
- There's one more.

43
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:38,057
- [Bryan] Whoa.

44
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,112
- It's just one more.

45
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:41,833
- [Bryan] There was a lot
more carrots last night, huh?

46
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,496
- Yeah.

47
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:46,163
(midtempo jazz)

48
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:49,077
What's that?

49
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:50,225
(laughter)

50
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:51,394
- [Bryan] "What's that"?

51
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:53,644
That means that Santa came.

52
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:55,687
- [Missy] See the car?

53
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:57,498
What did he bring you?

54
00:01:57,498 --> 00:01:58,773
- [Oliver] I don't know.

55
00:01:58,773 --> 00:01:59,606
(Missy laughs)

56
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:00,439
- I don't even know if he knows how to

57
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,272
play the words.

58
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:02,105
What's going on right now?

59
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:02,938
- I don't know.

60
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:03,771
He's like what?

61
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:05,344
- [Bryan] What do you
think about this, dude?

62
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:06,845
- Look at all of these.

63
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,753
- [Bryan] Whoa.

64
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,586
Oh and look who's here.

65
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:10,790
Did you say good morning?

66
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,791
- Good morning, Meme and Papa.

67
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,455
- Good morning, merry Christmas.

68
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:19,050
Merry Christmas, I'm so happy to see you.

69
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,646
- I want all these presents.

70
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:21,479
- I know.

71
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,697
- I wanna open my presents.

72
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:23,530
- So many.

73
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:25,507
- [Bryan] Holy cow, you guys.

74
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:26,424
Santa came.

75
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,337
That's a nice car.

76
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:32,899
Santa knows how to pick them.

77
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:35,208
Look at this dune racer, Ollie.

78
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,710
Hope in it.

79
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,977
Here, I'll put Santa
as your sidekick there.

80
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:41,373
You could sit right there.

81
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:42,206
You know what, Ollie?

82
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:43,750
You remember that time
we were playing Pokemon

83
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,149
in the park and we found one of these?

84
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:46,982
- Yeah.

85
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:49,084
- I think this is the same exact one.

86
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:49,959
- It can go.

87
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,283
- [Bryan] No, I don't
think it can go inside.

88
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:53,181
Look at this, Ollie.

89
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,014
- A red?

90
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,052
- [Bryan] It's a wagon

91
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,026
for you and Fin.

92
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,300
- And there's a present in it.

93
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,132
- [Bryan] And there's
a present in it, huh?

94
00:02:59,132 --> 00:02:59,965
- Yeah.

95
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:00,824
- [Bryan] Alright, we'll have to open it.

96
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:01,657
- It's a toy.

97
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:03,479
- [Bryan] Yep, it is toy's huh?

98
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,466
Hey Ollie, we have to go
through all these presents

99
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,299
but guess what?

100
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,132
- [Oliver] What?

101
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:07,965
- We probably should start the day

102
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:08,798
with some chocolate milk, huh?

103
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:09,631
- Yeah.

104
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:10,464
- You want some chocolate milk?

105
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,297
- I see something.

106
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:12,857
- Oh, you see other toys?

107
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:14,192
Whoa!

108
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,850
There's so many cool toys, huh?

109
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,353
- Look at the basketball?

110
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:19,213
- [Bryan] Whoa, a basketball?

111
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,809
- That's actually for Fin.

112
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:21,642
- That's so cool.

113
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:22,904
Alright, Ollie, let's go
drink some chocolate milk.

114
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:24,209
Missy and I are very prepared.

115
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,642
We have premade this chocolate milk

116
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:28,903
so that we don't have to do it.

117
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:29,736
Here you go, buddy.

118
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:30,569
- Thank you.

119
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:31,402
- [Bryan] You're welcome.

120
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:32,305
- Are you ready to open presents?

121
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:33,138
- [Oliver] Yeah.

122
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:33,971
- Merry Christmas.

123
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,110
- It's a wagon and a present.

124
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,483
(laughter)

125
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,316
- That's for you.

126
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:38,453
- [Oliver] Yeah.

127
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,060
- Can I have a kiss?

128
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,578
That's not a kiss.

129
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:42,957
Thank you.

130
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,097
- [Bryan] What did you find, Ollie?

131
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:47,251
- [Molly] It's a bike and
it says to Ollie from Santa.

132
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:48,224
- [Bryan] Whoa.

133
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:52,374
Whoa, Santa's got some fancy handwriting.

134
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:55,207
(soft jazz music)

135
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,634
- It's your turn.

136
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,467
- It's my turn?

137
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,300
- [Bryan] It's your turn.

138
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,192
You have to do it now.

139
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,199
- Whoa.

140
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,449
(laughter)

141
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:22,737
(soft Christmas music)

142
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:34,487
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie, while
they're cooking breakfast,

143
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,752
let's put some socks on your feet.

144
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:39,291
Does daddy look like a Christmas tree?

145
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,093
- [Oliver] Yeah.

146
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:44,866
- [Chuckling] It's pretty funny, huh?

147
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,045
- Oh my God!

148
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,093
- [Bryan] What!

149
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:48,926
What happened in here?

150
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:51,304
- I don't know.

151
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:54,746
- What is all that?

152
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:55,638
- [Oliver] Oh it's food.

153
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:59,025
- It's food and a sink and a stove.

154
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:00,760
- [Bryan] Ollie, I think Santa gave you

155
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,077
your very own kitchen.

156
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:03,910
- [Oliver] Yeah.

157
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,077
- [Missy] Wow.

158
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:07,063
- [Bryan] Ice cream?

159
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:08,156
- Yeah.

160
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:11,053
- Can I have some ice cream?

161
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:13,189
- [Oliver] Look at the pumpkin!

162
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,022
- [Missy] A pumpkin?

163
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,780
You love pumpkins!

164
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,613
- [Oliver] Yeah.

165
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,181
- [Missy] Look what's in your fridge.

166
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:19,918
- [Bryan] Whoa.

167
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:20,751
- [Missy] Milk?

168
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,340
- [Bryan] Lots of different foods.

169
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,261
- [Missy] There's donuts and waffles.

170
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,223
- Donuts and waffles.

171
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,519
We need to eat those this morning.

172
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,531
We need to get our fuel
for opening presents.

173
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,669
- [Missy] You've got a little
table to eat your food.

174
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,339
- [Oliver] I'm going to eat some chips.

175
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:34,621
- [Missy] Oh my goodness, what's that?

176
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:35,661
- What's this?

177
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:36,668
- I don't know.

178
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,814
- I think it's a cheeseburger.

179
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:40,035
- I don't need that.

180
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,601
- [Bryan] No?

181
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,144
- [Missy] And it's chocolate milk.

182
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,188
- Yeah, look.

183
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:46,100
- That is crazy, Ollie.

184
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,214
So Santa got you your
very own kitchen to play

185
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,543
with you and Peg probably huh?

186
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:51,673
- Yeah.

187
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:52,506
- You're gonna love it.

188
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:53,339
Look, Ollie.

189
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,172
Ready?

190
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:59,649
- [Bryan] Ah she's eating a cheeseburger.

191
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:00,864
- [Missy] Oh it's so yummy.

192
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:01,847
- [Bryan] So you have a sink.

193
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:02,680
- [Oliver] Yeah.

194
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,988
- [Missy] You can do your dishes.

195
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,102
- [Bryan] And look at this.

196
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:07,672
You can even cut the bread.

197
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:08,737
- [Missy] Do you want some bread?

198
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:10,531
- [Bryan] Hey, do you wanna
try and cut it, Ollie?

199
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:11,364
- [Oliver] Hold on.

200
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:12,880
- [Bryan] What do you see?

201
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,120
Oh you want to cut the watermelon?

202
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,469
- [Missy] Put it on the cutting board.

203
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:17,507
- [Bryan] Here, sit it
on the cutting board.

204
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,578
And then you cut it.

205
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,411
- Okay.

206
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,244
- [Missy] The other way.

207
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:21,827
Yeah, there you go.

208
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:23,599
- [Bryan] Whoa!

209
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:24,849
- [Missy] Okay!

210
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,010
There you go.

211
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,496
- [Bryan] Wow, Ollie, that's so cool.

212
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:30,499
See under the sink, Ollie.

213
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:33,606
And look down here, you have storage.

214
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:35,601
And then you have your stove top.

215
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,446
You can cook some eggs.

216
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:38,279
- [Missy] Look, Ollie.

217
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,907
You can wear an apron and make us dinner.

218
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:42,106
Carrots!

219
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:43,125
- [Bryan] Carrots.

220
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:43,958
That's cool.

221
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,678
And look, you can turn on the stove.

222
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:47,750
And the oven.

223
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,273
Whoa, what's in the oven, Ollie?

224
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:50,194
- [Oliver] I don't know.

225
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:52,318
- [Bryan] Looks like cupcakes and pizza.

226
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:53,151
- [Oliver] Yeah.

227
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:57,271
- [Missy] Ooh, you should eat a cupcake.

228
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:58,116
- [Bryan] Are those yummy cupcakes?

229
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,523
- [Oliver] Yeah (unclear murmur).

230
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:02,018
- [Bryan] Okay. (giggles)

231
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:02,851
- [Missy] Hey Ollie,

232
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:06,055
look at this cute little puppy dog apron.

233
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,876
- Whoa, cool.

234
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:08,709
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh, that's adorable.

235
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:09,725
- [Missy] Now you can make the food

236
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:11,762
without getting your shirt dirty.

237
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:12,595
- Yeah.

238
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,236
- [Missy] So can I have some pancakes?

239
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:15,149
- [Oliver] Yeah.

240
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,374
- [Missy] I think this
is pancakes in here.

241
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:20,445
And then you can put the syrup
and the strawberries on it.

242
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:24,078
I'll take syrup and
strawberries on a pancake.

243
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:26,745
(midtempo jazz)

244
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:39,356
- Santa just eat all his cookies.

245
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:40,518
- [Bryan] He did?

246
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:41,351
- Yeah.

247
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,184
- [Bryan] I didn't even check.

248
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:43,090
And he drank all his milk?

249
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,735
- [Oliver] There's one more cookie.

250
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:46,568
- [Bryan] Wow, he must not have been able

251
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,016
to eat them all, huh?

252
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:48,860
- Yeah.

253
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,911
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie, guess who's up?

254
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:50,746
- What?

255
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:51,811
- [Bryan] Your brother.

256
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:52,644
- Fin?

257
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:53,477
- [Bryan] Go get him.

258
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:54,310
- Okay.

259
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,445
(Oliver exclaiming wildly)

260
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,778
Merry Christmas.

261
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:01,990
Fin.

262
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,514
- [Bryan] Merry Christmas, buddy.

263
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:07,228
Merry Christmas, Fin.

264
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:08,108
- He didn't cry.

265
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:08,941
- [Bryan] No he's in such a good mood

266
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:11,274
because it's Christmas, huh?

267
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:15,605
Hey Fin, guess what?

268
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:17,325
Santa Claus came.

269
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:18,773
So excited.

270
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,393
And we have breakfast.

271
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:23,665
- Merry Christmas, Fin.

272
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:25,027
(baby talk)

273
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:28,164
(light jazz music)

274
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:30,120
There's a present.

275
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,445
- [Bryan] Look at all those presents, Fin.

276
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,778
(crosstalk)

277
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,683
- Oh good morning.

278
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,596
- [Oliver] I wanna open it.

279
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:40,429
- [Bryan] I know, buddy.

280
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,894
We're gonna eat some
breakfast first, okay.

281
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:44,043
- I don't want to.

282
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:47,146
- [Bryan] That's quite a stocking, Jim.

283
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:48,830
You fit your whole foot in that?

284
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,830
- Oh my God.

285
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:52,700
- [Bryan] Buzz Lightyear PEZ?

286
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,635
- Yeah.

287
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:54,824
- Alright, before we open presents,

288
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:58,440
we always have to open
all of our stockings, huh?

289
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,921
You got a pterodactyl in your stocking?

290
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:00,781
- Yeah.

291
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,698
- You wanna see a trick?

292
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:02,531
- Yes.

293
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,860
- Perfectly balanced.

294
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,655
Whoa, you're perfectly balanced.

295
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,464
It's flying on your finger.

296
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:10,640
- Yeah.

297
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,557
(light jazz music)

298
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:27,153
- [Bryan] Karma, what's that, what's that?

299
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:28,473
What's that?

300
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:29,728
Is that for you?

301
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:30,561
Open it.

302
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,195
Karma loves opening presents

303
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:36,468
and he opens them very meticulously.

304
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,301
Get it, Karma, get it.

305
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:38,179
Open it.

306
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,012
Get it.

307
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,198
Come on, rip it open.

308
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:41,031
- [Missy] Get it.

309
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,198
Get it, Karma.

310
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:45,985
- [Bryan] Whoa, a big bone.

311
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,750
It's like, oh, just what I wanted.

312
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,533
Just what I get every year.

313
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,828
- [Missy] Wanted an iPad.

314
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:54,530
(laughter)

315
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,875
I see something.

316
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,458
- [Missy] Do you see something?

317
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:01,144
What is it?

318
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,042
It's a big truck.

319
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,615
A Tonka truck.

320
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,442
- [Meme] You can put all the dirt in it.

321
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,275
- Yeah.

322
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,129
- [Missy] That is so cool.

323
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,671
- [Bryan] What did Fin get?

324
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:14,687
- It's a--

325
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,142
- I got one.

326
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:18,501
- [Bryan] Whoa, cool.

327
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,416
I think he's reopening his stocking

328
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,495
and saying another one.

329
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:23,511
- Another minion?

330
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:24,344
- Yeah.

331
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,697
- [Bryan] This is cute.

332
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:29,493
So Fin got this little
bike thing from Santa,

333
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,924
and it's the same one
that Jackson uses, huh?

334
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:32,899
Or Calvin.
- Yeah, Calvin.

335
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,982
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

336
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:37,410
Whoa.

337
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:42,769
You got a truck too, Fin.

338
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:43,602
That's so cute.

339
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,271
Now they both have trucks.

340
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,312
Alright, the presents are passed out

341
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,812
and opening has now commenced.

342
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,272
Is that Beauty and the Beast?

343
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:55,689
- [Meme] I hope it is.

344
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,845
For that reaction.

345
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:59,095
(laughter)

346
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:03,155
(Missy cooing)

347
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:06,369
(Bryan sings theme from
Beauty and the Beast)

348
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:09,093
- I love Beauty and the Beast.

349
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:09,926
Wow.

350
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,357
- Well, apparently this is done by

351
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:13,886
a very famous indie artist.

352
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:16,512
His name is Jim Shore.

353
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:17,503
And Disney works with him.

354
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:18,336
And he's--

355
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,317
- So pretty.

356
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,114
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

357
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:24,114
- I love it.

358
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,804
- [Bryan] Cassie's
opening one from the boys.

359
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,637
What'd they get you?

360
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:31,970
- They got me...

361
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:36,012
What is it?

362
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:36,845
I can't--

363
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,421
- [Bryan] Okay, if you
don't know what it is,

364
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,430
maybe you--

365
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,659
- I know what it is.

366
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,648
It's a Manfrotto.

367
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:45,697
(laughter)

368
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:48,428
- [Bryan] It's a tripod.

369
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:49,375
- Where does it say tripod?

370
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,862
It's a tripod?

371
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,070
- [Bryan] Yeah.

372
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,358
- Thank you.

373
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:54,652
- You're welcome.

374
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:56,256
(crosstalk)

375
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,006
- Oh, there goes Fin.

376
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:02,052
- [Missy] Is that a new game?

377
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:02,885
- Yeah.

378
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,182
- [Meme] A crocodile game?

379
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,015
- [Missy] Oh my God.

380
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,118
- [Meme] Oh my goodness, how cool.

381
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:08,785
You love crocodiles.

382
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:13,498
- Drop the Hook is not a board game.

383
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:15,301
(Jim awes)

384
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,128
- [Missy] I love how
it's exactly like mine.

385
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:18,711
No this is exactly.

386
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,605
- [Bryan] Oh whoa.

387
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,193
- It's a leather apron
for when I'm working.

388
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:23,276
I get filthy.

389
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:25,627
- Yeah, I really like it.

390
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:26,460
- [Bryan] It's really cool.

391
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,293
- I had a black one.

392
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:31,460
- [Bryan] I bet you Jesus
wore something like that.

393
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,617
(whooping)

394
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:38,867
- [Bryan] So you can make us spaghetti.

395
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,775
- [Missy] And it folds right up.

396
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,025
- [Bryan] Whoa.

397
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,372
(crosstalk)

398
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,855
- [Missy] Come on, Fin.

399
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:55,795
Put it in.

400
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:57,379
Put it in, honey.

401
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,951
(Missy whoops)

402
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:02,368
(Bryan wees)

403
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,129
(Missy cheers)

404
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:08,462
- [Bryan] Future Kobe Bryant right here.

405
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:12,186
Oh yeah.

406
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,209
Oh my God, he loves that.

407
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,939
Ollie, what did you get?

408
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:18,772
- Skateboard.

409
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:20,117
- [Bryan] That's so cool, you like it?

410
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:21,406
- This is my skateboard.

411
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,906
- [Bryan] That's so neat.

412
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:25,255
Jimmy just got Missy this.

413
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:26,551
Can you explain this.

414
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:28,597
They're cat ears and then

415
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:31,893
it reads your brainwaves
and then they go down or up

416
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,736
and they move around
based on your brainwaves.

417
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,190
- I am so excited.

418
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,788
(laughter)

419
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:38,242
- [Bryan] You know her so well.

420
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,025
So there's lots of things
in different languages

421
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,608
that we don't know.

422
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,327
- We'll have to figure out
what each of these mean.

423
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:47,198
- [Bryan] That is so funny.

424
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:48,031
- That is so cool.

425
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,167
Thank you, Jimmy.

426
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,000
- [Bryan] What is is, Ollie?

427
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,529
- I don't know.

428
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:55,227
- [Missy] He's opening it.

429
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:57,203
- [Meme] You get one of those.

430
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,382
Oh my goodness.

431
00:13:58,382 --> 00:13:59,516
- [Bryan] Where'd you get that?

432
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:01,612
- You got a Hatchimals?

433
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:02,642
- Yeah.

434
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,915
- It's a giant egg, Hatchimal?

435
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,012
- I wanna open it.

436
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,978
- [Bryan] Oh it'll open.

437
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,380
- [Jimmy] Give him a hammer.

438
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,737
- Did you watch this on YouTube?

439
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:11,570
- Yeah.

440
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,403
- Do you know what this is?
- Yeah.

441
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:13,236
- What's in it?

442
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,069
- A birdie.

443
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,902
- A birdie?

444
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:15,735
- [Bryan] It could be a birdie.

445
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:16,959
It could be lots of different things.

446
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,792
- [Meme] A little animal.

447
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,697
- How did you know that?

448
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,557
- [Bryan] That is so neat.

449
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:22,390
- I wanna open it.

450
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,663
- Okay, we're gonna put it in the kitchen.

451
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,746
Alright, Bryan's opening one from me.

452
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,395
- Fancy.

453
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,066
- [Missy] Yeah.

454
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:34,605
Look at me.

455
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:36,149
- [Oliver] Mama, I opened it--

456
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:36,982
- Coach.

457
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:39,445
Does Coach make men's things?

458
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,695
- [Missy] Yeah.

459
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:46,944
- There's so many wrappers and bags.

460
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:50,342
- It's a belt?

461
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:51,175
- [Missy] Yeah.

462
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:52,922
- That is so cool.

463
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:54,521
- [Missy] And it's the reversal kind too.

464
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:55,569
- It's reversible?

465
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:56,402
- [Missy] Yeah, like you can--

466
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:57,292
- Oh my gosh.

467
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:58,169
That is seriously so cool.

468
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,030
- [Missy] Isn't that cool?

469
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,863
- Thank you, babe.

470
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:00,696
- You're welcome.

471
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:01,813
He's a wears a belt every single day

472
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:04,776
and I thought I think I'm gonna
get him a really nice one.

473
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:05,652
- It smells real yummy.

474
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:06,874
- [Missy] Yeah.

475
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:07,707
- [Oliver] Look it.

476
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:08,937
- What is it?

477
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:10,187
- [Bryan] Whoa.

478
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:11,970
Pound Patrol?

479
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,365
- [Missy] It's Pound Patrol.

480
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,971
- [Bryan] Fin, open yours, open yours.

481
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:16,804
- What's this?

482
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:18,570
- Thank you, Meme and Papa.

483
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,705
- That's actually from Santa.

484
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:22,935
- You're welcome (laughing).

485
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:24,853
- [Jim] We'll take credit.

486
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:26,020
- [Bryan] Ooh.

487
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:30,591
(music plays from toy)

488
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,946
- Wow.

489
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:33,226
What do you think of that?

490
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:35,400
- [Oliver] Mama, I open it.

491
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,307
- Um, we're caught up under the wagon,

492
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:37,188
we've got so many toys to open later.

493
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,713
- [Bryan] Ollie, that is so cool.

494
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:40,706
- [Missy] It's a Pound Patrol.

495
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,951
You can play pretend all day long.

496
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:45,119
- [Bryan] It has monkeys, Ollie.

497
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,141
(unclear speech)

498
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:47,850
- Sometimes, I don't even know.

499
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,263
- I don't know what's in there.

500
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:50,821
- [Bryan] You don't know what's in there.

501
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:53,699
- [Meme] It's a Popsocket.

502
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,032
(crosstalk)

503
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:00,433
- [Bryan] It's a flashlight.

504
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,918
Don't mess with Cassie.

505
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:02,751
- Go dad.

506
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:06,591
(crosstalk)

507
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:09,923
- Every year, dad will
get you something useful.

508
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:11,602
(laughter)
Useful.

509
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:15,519
- [Bryan] Alright, Missy's
opening one from me.

510
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:19,568
- Really.
(Bryan laughs)

511
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,009
You got me a Spectacle?

512
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,132
I got you Spectacles.

513
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,136
(Missy exclaims)

514
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,536
Isn't that cool?

515
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:28,106
- You gotta turn up that Snapchat game.

516
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:28,939
- I know.

517
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:29,772
- [Bryan] You love Snapchat

518
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:30,982
and you haven't been doing it in a while.

519
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:32,884
But I figured these might.

520
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:34,056
- That is so funny.

521
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:36,173
- [Bryan] I wanna see the
world from your point of view.

522
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,584
- (laughing) Thank you.

523
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,917
(baby talk)

524
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:45,153
- You guys actually did it?

525
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:46,403
It's the ADD-1.

526
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:48,409
- [Bryan] Yeah.

527
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,624
- Oh my gosh.

528
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:50,457
Thank you so much.

529
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:51,290
- [Bryan] Subscribed to So Cash.

530
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,052
She's gonna get some premium content.

531
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:53,885
- It's so Cassie.

532
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:56,264
- [Bryan] It's so Cassie.
(laughter)

533
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,318
- Thank you guys so much.

534
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:58,372
- [Bryan] You're welcome.

535
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:02,587
- [Missy] Alright, this one
is to dada from your boys.

536
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,502
Karma picked it out especially.

537
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:05,460
- This is from you?

538
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:06,294
- Yeah.

539
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:08,071
- Thank you.

540
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:10,988
I'm so excited to see what's in it.

541
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,752
Harry Potter Magical Beast board game.

542
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:19,681
- [Missy] It's a board game.

543
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:20,866
- That's so cool.

544
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:22,779
I thought it was gonna be
Monopoly or Life or something.

545
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,722
- [Missy] No, it's just
like their own board game.

546
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:25,555
- It's their own board game.

547
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:26,567
Thanks.

548
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,597
Thank you, Ollie.

549
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:28,779
- Welcome.

550
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:29,631
- [Missy] You're gonna play with daddy?

551
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,981
- You're gonna play with it with me?

552
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,142
- Yeah.

553
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,889
- This is from Meme and Papa.

554
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:36,415
- [Bryan] There you go.

555
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:37,785
He knows how to do it.

556
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:39,337
(crosstalk)

557
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:40,837
What you got, Fin?

558
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,282
Look at that.

559
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,860
That's awesome.

560
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:49,684
- [Oliver] Legos.

561
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:51,859
- [Bryan] What you got, Ollie?

562
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,192
It's Lego Duplo.

563
00:17:54,351 --> 00:17:55,347
Batman.

564
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:58,771
You're not gonna play
with that together, okay?

565
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:01,287
What did Ollie and Fin get you?

566
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:03,728
- [Meme] What did they get me?

567
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:04,815
(whooping)

568
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:05,732
A new robe.

569
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:08,707
- [Bryan] Comfy.

570
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:09,613
- Comfy.

571
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,165
Thank you, Ollie.

572
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,263
- Welcome.

573
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:13,781
- I love it.

574
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:14,614
- [Missy] Okay, it's from Jimmy.

575
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:15,929
He always gives the best gifts.

576
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,939
- Jimmy does give really good gifts.

577
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:18,772
Sparklz.

578
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:21,200
Kikkerland.

579
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,774
- [Missy] What is it?

580
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:24,899
- Jimmy, could you just explain it?

581
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:25,732
- [Cassie] Get it out.

582
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,798
It's really cool, get it out.

583
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:28,631
- It's like a--

584
00:18:28,631 --> 00:18:29,723
- Spin it.

585
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:30,556
- This way?

586
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:32,473
- Alright, set it down.

587
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:34,469
- Whoa!

588
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:35,719
- [Missy] Whoa!

589
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:39,238
- [Bryan] Keep that away
from the Christmas tree.

590
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:41,245
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

591
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,078
- Dude, where do you
find all this cool stuff?

592
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,848
(laughter)

593
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:50,181
- [Missy] That's so cool.

594
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:52,625
- That is really cool.

595
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,407
- To mama, love Ollie and Fin.

596
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:57,442
- [Bryan] Ollie, did you get mama

597
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:59,002
a pretty blue box?

598
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:00,571
- What is it?

599
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:03,218
- [Bryan] I saw him
scrounging around for pennies.

600
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:05,800
- They're always the best.

601
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,883
- So nervous.

602
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:10,431
Aw.

603
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,487
It's a little arrow.

604
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,320
- [Bryan] Yeah it's sterling silver.

605
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,187
It's a cool little arrow pin necklace.

606
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:18,020
- Yeah, I love it.

607
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,201
Thanks, Ollie.

608
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,447
- Welcome.

609
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,280
And Fin.

610
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,046
Fin picked that one out too.

611
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,362
(laughter)

612
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:28,739
Fin's like, oh yeah, I was
browsing Tiffany forever.

613
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:30,073
No one would help him because

614
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:31,665
he was a baby, he was just walking around

615
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:34,315
that store for like an hour.

616
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:35,148
- I love it.

617
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:36,376
It's so pretty.

618
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,197
- [Bryan] What is it, Ollie, what is it?

619
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:39,278
- I don't know.

620
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,510
It's tools.

621
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,689
- [Bryan] Tools!

622
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:42,907
- It's a construction bench.

623
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:43,958
- [Bryan] He's like, that's the one

624
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,843
I almost wrapped for Fin.

625
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:46,921
- I know, I thought it was Fin,

626
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,146
but it was Ollie.

627
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:49,979
- [Bryan] So now you can be like papa

628
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:50,894
with all your tools, okay.

629
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:52,227
- Yeah.

630
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:54,217
- [Bryan] Whoa, Fin.

631
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:55,050
- Wow.

632
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:58,509
(car sirens)

633
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,477
- [Bryan] That's cool.

634
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:09,727
To Jimmy, from Missy and I.

635
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:12,402
What is it?

636
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:13,891
- I don't know.

637
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:14,724
- [Bryan] He knows.

638
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:15,557
He knows.

639
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,599
- HTC Vive.

640
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,002
- [Bryan] VR, baby.

641
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:21,614
- He's never gonna come
out of his room again.

642
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:22,447
- You know what?

643
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:23,280
That's the box he has left over from this?

644
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,496
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, that's
actually in my bedroom right now.

645
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:26,329
Yeah.

646
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,843
This one is sick.

647
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:30,823
It's got room sensors.

648
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:32,264
- You put in the sensors in your room,

649
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,343
and you can walk around your room.

650
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:34,176
- [Bryan] That's so cool, dude.

651
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,426
You're gonna be entering another world.

652
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,148
- A new little ring stand.

653
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:43,981
- [Bryan] Yay.

654
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:46,762
- I really, really wanted one of these and

655
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:47,678
I'm so excited.

656
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,115
- [Bryan] Cassie came through.

657
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,334
- It's so pretty.

658
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,287
It's much prettier than the Popsocket.

659
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:53,120
It's the same thing.

660
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,384
You put your finger in and
it stands your phone up

661
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:56,821
and it's really cool.

662
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:58,724
- [Bryan] What is that, Ollie?

663
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,724
- I don't know what yet.

664
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,007
Whoa!

665
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,732
- [Bryan] It's a Dinopet, Ollie.

666
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,190
So it's a big glass dinosaur
that goes in your room?

667
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,023
- Yeah.

668
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:11,610
- [Bryan] And it glows different colors.

669
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,443
Really.

670
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:15,817
It's a living bioluminescent pet.

671
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:16,835
- [Missy] Alright.

672
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:18,648
I got you something really cool.

673
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:19,481
- Really cool, huh?

674
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:20,422
- [Missy] Just for you.

675
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:21,517
- Is it really cool and manly?

676
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:22,774
- [Missy] Yeah.

677
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:24,941
(giggles)

678
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,379
- It's new tools.

679
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:32,603
- [Missy] He's been asking
for an organized tool box

680
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,022
with all the tools that we need

681
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:35,293
for household stuff.

682
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,928
- [Bryan] This is a good size too.

683
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:37,761
- [Missy] Yeah it's kinda perfect.

684
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:39,261
It has everything.

685
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:41,667
- [Bryan] Is that the ratchet drill?

686
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,543
- [Missy] Yeah.

687
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:45,030
- Yeah, that's the nice
drill that your dad has.

688
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,850
Okay, I know I don't do a lot but

689
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,802
around the house it's nice--

690
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:51,073
- But you know, we're
always looking for something

691
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:52,348
and our stuff's always everywhere.

692
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:54,145
Oh, maybe in that cabinet or that drawer

693
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:54,978
or over there--

694
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:55,811
- Do you need a screwdriver?

695
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:56,865
'Cause I've got a bunch.

696
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,060
- [Missy] (giggling) I know.

697
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,090
That was dad's idea.

698
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,108
He's always like, oh trust me,

699
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:03,157
he needs all of these.

700
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:06,070
- Well, it's annoying when you need

701
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,669
a hammer, but you can't find a hammer

702
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:08,502
and then you look for two hours

703
00:22:08,502 --> 00:22:10,814
and it's in the top of
the closet somewhere.

704
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:11,727
- [Missy] Yeah.

705
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:13,354
Yep, yep.
- Now I have a place for it.

706
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:14,753
- [Missy] And then go ahead and open that

707
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:16,693
bag over there.

708
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:17,651
- The bag?

709
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,026
- [Missy] Yeah.

710
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:20,590
- A blanket.

711
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,053
- [Missy] So this will stay
on top of your tool set.

712
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:26,220
And it's a very organized.

713
00:22:27,695 --> 00:22:28,528
- [Bryan] Oh it's so heavy.

714
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:31,106
- [Missy] With all the things you need.

715
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:32,481
- All things I need to put together,

716
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,279
toys and furniture.

717
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,927
Oh, that's just really heavy.

718
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:38,541
- [Missy] Okay, go put it on top of that.

719
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,162
Dad, what'd you get?

720
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:41,002
- [Jim] I don't know.

721
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:42,502
- [Missy] Oh yeah.

722
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:46,252
(giggling)

723
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:47,085
- Oh yeah.

724
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:50,142
When I put the cars together,

725
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:52,483
I just stare at this the whole time.

726
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,871
- [Missy] (giggles) Yeah I know.

727
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:56,772
I don't know what that is but

728
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:58,311
apparently I think it--

729
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,599
- You know how I round
the edges of everything?

730
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,432
- [Missy] Yeah.

731
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:02,484
- Is that for your
router for your Internet?

732
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,206
- Rounded edge?

733
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:05,039
- [Missy] Yeah, yeah.

734
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,017
- It mounts in here.

735
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:06,850
- [Missy] Oh.

736
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,517
- That would mount inside my table.

737
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:11,705
- Does it make the wi-fi faster?

738
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:13,392
- [Bryan] What's that password?

739
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,714
- It's a router table.

740
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:19,107
I was literally like, I
have no idea what this is.

741
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:19,969
I hope he likes it.

742
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:21,280
(giggles)

743
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,589
- When I round the edges of stuff,

744
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:25,054
this is the thing you use.

745
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,039
- [Missy] Yep, there you go.

746
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,142
Well, I'm glad you like it.

747
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:31,475
(light Christmas music)

748
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,227
(playful music)

749
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,287
- [Bryan] Ollie is currently
looking for his chocolate milk

750
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:55,921
in this mess.

751
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:58,588
(playful music)

752
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,479
Okay, these things are
interesting for sure.

753
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,829
- Jimmy says that I'm focused and relaxed.

754
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,662
- [Bryan] Oh wow.

755
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:19,662
- He was like, seriously, it's true.

756
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:21,843
- Are you drunk on Christmas?

757
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:22,676
- Yeah.

758
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:23,921
(door bell rings)

759
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,867
- I think I hear someone at the door.

760
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:27,700
Do you hear someone at the door?

761
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,634
- Yeah.

762
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,551
- [Bryan] Fin, do you
hear someone at the door?

763
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,239
Who could be here?

764
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,777
(unclear murmur)

765
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:42,110
Do you want to get the door?

766
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:44,559
Go get the door.

767
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,392
Open it.

768
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:47,609
- [Santa] Ho, ho, ho.

769
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:49,109
Almost forgot one.

770
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:52,553
- [Bryan] Santa?

771
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:53,636
What is that?

772
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,216
- [Missy] What is that?

773
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:01,677
What is that?

774
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:03,174
Is that Santa?

775
00:25:03,174 --> 00:25:05,925
- [Bryan] Santa's leaving?

776
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:06,910
- Say bye, Santa.

777
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,455
- [Oliver] Bye, Santa.

778
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:11,494
- [Bryan] Did Santa just drop off a puppy?

779
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:12,577
- Oh my gosh.

780
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:14,993
Look at his face.

781
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:17,160
(giggles)

782
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:20,704
What is that?

783
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:22,700
- It's a puppy.

784
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,867
(giggles)

785
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:31,526
- Did Santa just drop off
a brand new responsibility?

786
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:34,030
- [Cassie] Y'all got a puppy?

787
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,889
- [Bryan] Fin, it's a new puppy.

788
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:38,234
Hey.

789
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:40,247
- [Missy] Oh she likes you.

790
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,255
- [Bryan] Hi, new puppy.

791
00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:44,196
- [Cassie] She likes you too.

792
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:45,970
- [Missy] Take this floppy thing off.

793
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,803
- [Bryan] So what did Santa say

794
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:47,636
when he sat her down?

795
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:49,109
(Oliver mumbles)

796
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:50,900
He said he forgot something?

797
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,567
- Yeah, he bring it.

798
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:56,461
- [Bryan] Hey, you.

799
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:58,783
It's a girl, Ollie.

800
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:00,287
Yeah.

801
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:02,221
We got a little puppy for Christmas, babe?

802
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:04,221
- Oh I love her so much.

803
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,499
- [Bryan] Aw.

804
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,666
- I love the puppy breath.

805
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:16,600
- Maybe there's another one out there.

806
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:21,277
- I need to get this in there.

807
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:22,110
- You think we can bring that in?

808
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,443
Is that her bed?

809
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:27,033
- [Bryan] She's so cute.

810
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,826
Ollie, you see her eyes are blue.

811
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:35,145
(Ollie exclaims unintelligibly)

812
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:35,978
- What'd you get?

813
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:37,606
- [Oliver] A puppy.

814
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:38,755
- Wow.

815
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:40,270
- Santa brought it?

816
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,594
Oh hello, puppy.

817
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:43,646
- [Bryan] Come sit down
so she can play with you.

818
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:46,112
She's gotta smell you and get to know you.

819
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:46,945
- No, puppy.

820
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:48,298
- [Missy] We'll move your
gun so that she doesn't--

821
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:49,715
- Oh it just hit me.

822
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:52,029
(laughter)

823
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,828
- [Bryan] Oh Fin's in love.

824
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:54,913
- [Missy] Ollie.

825
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:55,746
- [Bryan] She's so cute.

826
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,260
- I wish Tina was here.

827
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,432
- [Bryan] Do we really keep her.

828
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:01,337
- Of course, we're keeping her.

829
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:02,837
- Is that her bed?

830
00:27:04,412 --> 00:27:06,677
She got a little basket.

831
00:27:06,677 --> 00:27:08,379
That's where she can sleep, huh?

832
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:10,554
- [Missy] Ollie, what should we name her?

833
00:27:10,554 --> 00:27:11,758
- I don't know.

834
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:12,591
- [Bryan] She's so cute.

835
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:13,840
So what kind of dog is she?

836
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,193
- She's definitely an Australian shepherd.

837
00:27:16,193 --> 00:27:17,379
She used to lie like Karma.

838
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:18,820
She looks like Karma.

839
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,653
- [Bryan] She's so small.

840
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:22,399
She's just a little puppy.

841
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,910
Ollie, you wanna play with her?

842
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,743
- Yeah.

843
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,713
- [Bryan] Play with her.

844
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,931
- Go run, go run, go.

845
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:31,034
- [Oliver] Doggie, you
wanna see my bedroom?

846
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:32,123
- [Bryan] Oh let's go
show her your bedroom.

847
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:33,373
Go, go, go, go.

848
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:38,116
Show her your bedroom.

849
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:44,734
Look, she likes it.

850
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:45,817
- Look, puppy.

851
00:27:45,817 --> 00:27:46,650
- [Missy] Come here, puppy.

852
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,400
(Fin crying out)

853
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:55,073
- [Bryan] She's giving him kisses.

854
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,056
- [Missy] Come here.

855
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,139
- Oh my gosh.

856
00:27:59,152 --> 00:28:00,319
She's so cute.

857
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,326
This is crazy.

858
00:28:04,776 --> 00:28:08,221
I mean I always know we talked
about getting a second dog.

859
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,127
- Yeah, we have a lot of land,

860
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:13,855
and we've really been
wanting to fill it with dogs.

861
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,838
- [Bryan] Ollie, what
do you think about that?

862
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:17,437
- [Missy] Isn't she cute.

863
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:18,270
- [Oliver] Yeah.

864
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,318
- [Missy] Say come on puppy.

865
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:21,579
- [Bryan] Let's go play
outside with her, Ollie.

866
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,527
- Okay.

867
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:25,194
- [Bryan] Come on, come on, Fin.

868
00:28:26,736 --> 00:28:29,076
Ah she's getting you.

869
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:30,620
Let's go outside, puppy.

870
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,627
(Ollie exclaims)

871
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,627
(uptempo pop music)

872
00:28:38,237 --> 00:28:40,799
Ollie, your puppy is so cute.

873
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,132
- Yeah.

874
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:43,684
- [Bryan] Look at her.

875
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:45,678
Oh she's peeing.

876
00:28:45,678 --> 00:28:46,511
Good girl.

877
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,824
(giggling)

878
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:53,061
Come here, hi puppy.

879
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:53,894
Hi, puppy.

880
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:54,727
You want a belly scratch.

881
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:56,355
You want a belly scratch.

882
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:57,188
You want a belly scratch.

883
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:58,813
You're so fluffy.

884
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:01,434
You're so fluffy, puppy.

885
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:02,351
Go get him.

886
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,073
She's got you, Fin.

887
00:29:13,662 --> 00:29:15,245
She's got you, Fin.

888
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:18,871
We don't have a name yet do we?

889
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:20,446
What do you wanna name her, babe?

890
00:29:20,446 --> 00:29:21,279
- That's the truck Luna.

891
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,112
I thought Lunatic.

892
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:23,521
- [Bryan] Lunatic?

893
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,403
- I love the name Luna.

894
00:29:25,403 --> 00:29:27,134
- Luna's a cute name.

895
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,774
Come here, puppy.

896
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:29,941
She's so cute.

897
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:32,141
- [Missy] Oh you love her.

898
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:32,974
This is our little Luna?

899
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:34,505
- [Missy] Should we name her Luna?

900
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:35,621
- Yeah.

901
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:37,662
- If we call her Luna, we
can call her Lu-Lu or Lu.

902
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:38,495
- [Missy] Hi, Lu.

903
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:40,242
Do you want to be Lu?

904
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:41,178
- [Jim] I'd stick with Lunatic.

905
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:42,543
(laughing)

906
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:44,479
We're gonna have so much fun!

907
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,114
Look at this, Luna.

908
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:49,916
Everything the light touches is yours.

909
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,107
- [Missy] And Karma's.

910
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:52,176
- That's right, Karma.

911
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:53,429
You're gonna have to get the sheep.

912
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:55,939
- [Missy] Yeah, she's a sheep dog.

913
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:58,939
(uptempo pop music)

914
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,130
- [Bryan] Pop, I think you missed it,

915
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,563
but Santa showed up.

916
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:04,396
- What?

917
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:05,229
- [Bryan] Yeah.

918
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:07,240
He just showed up and
dropped this thing off.

919
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,326
- And I walk out and everybody's
screaming about Santa.

920
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:09,714
I go what did I miss.

921
00:30:09,714 --> 00:30:10,547
- [Bryan] Yeah.

922
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:11,380
Santa showed up.

923
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,178
I bet we can catch him
on the security footage.

924
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:16,635
Babe, because we have
a camera right there.

925
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:18,218
We could see Santa.

926
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:20,392
Leo.

927
00:30:20,392 --> 00:30:21,613
Karma, Karma.

928
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,369
Merry Christmas, we
have a new family member

929
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:25,917
and you guys are gonna get along so great.

930
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,750
I already know it because
you've got lots of

931
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,676
Australian shepherd in you, huh?

932
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:30,843
See the puppy?

933
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,072
Aw.

934
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:38,137
(unclear background speech)

935
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,896
So this is Luna.

936
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:41,336
- Luna.

937
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:42,669
Do we like Luna?

938
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,596
Should we call her Lu-Lu?

939
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:46,493
- Yeah.

940
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:47,372
- Can you say Lu-Lu?

941
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:50,372
(uptempo pop music)

942
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:01,484
Look how she lays.

943
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,728
It looks so cute.

944
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,061
- [Bryan] She literally
just falls out on the grass

945
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:07,561
with all her legs.

946
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:12,469
Oh thank you, Ollie, for
bringing her breakfast.

947
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:15,469
(uptempo pop music)

948
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,202
This is what she showed up in

949
00:31:24,202 --> 00:31:26,684
and oh, look at that.

950
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,517
My First Christmas.

951
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:29,437
That's her stocking.

952
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:31,939
And look, she's got a pillow.

953
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:33,071
Go give her her pillow.

954
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:34,547
And look at this cute little outfit.

955
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:36,091
- [Cassie] Aw.

956
00:31:36,091 --> 00:31:37,431
- [Bryan] That's cute.

957
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,448
Let's see what's in her stocking.

958
00:31:39,448 --> 00:31:41,293
Maybe she has something
she can chew on, huh?

959
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:42,126
Because she's a puppy.

960
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:43,050
- Look it's some food.

961
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:43,883
- [Bryan] Some treats.

962
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:45,874
Ollie, look at this.

963
00:31:45,874 --> 00:31:48,704
This is a really nice chew toy for her.

964
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:50,837
Looks like there are some cute bows.

965
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:52,622
Go give those to mama.

966
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:53,750
Some more cute bows

967
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,346
since she's our little princess now.

968
00:31:57,346 --> 00:31:58,596
And a chew toy.

969
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,565
Do you want to chew on this?

970
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:04,941
You can chew on this, okay?

971
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:07,263
I have a feeling we're
gonna lose a lot of shoes.

972
00:32:07,263 --> 00:32:08,096
- [Missy] Shoes.

973
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:09,410
They'll be some tears.

974
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,243
- Ooh, what are you showing there?

975
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:11,157
- [Ollie] A dinosaur egg.

976
00:32:11,157 --> 00:32:11,990
- Oh that's so cool.

977
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,150
Did you get that for Christmas?

978
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:13,983
- Yeah.

979
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:15,014
- From who?

980
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:16,764
- From Meme and Papa.

981
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:19,089
- [Bryan] That's fancy.

982
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:19,922
- Yeah.

983
00:32:19,922 --> 00:32:22,279
- Do you like dino eggs too, Luna?

984
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,362
- [Missy] She loves them.

985
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:28,681
(unintelligible speech )

986
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:32,974
- [Missy] Oh she likes longnecks?

987
00:32:32,974 --> 00:32:33,807
- Yeah.

988
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:35,022
- [Missy] Oh that's cool.

989
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:35,855
- Oh look at you.

990
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:38,355
You got a little jacket on.

991
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:39,234
She's got a little jacket on.

992
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:40,067
You see Cody.

993
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:41,780
She's like, I do not like that.

994
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,174
Oh, what you got for her?

995
00:32:44,174 --> 00:32:45,007
- A candy cane.

996
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:47,966
- [Missy] Oh that looks fun.

997
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,229
- And I got a bone.

998
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:51,700
- Oh what's this do?

999
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,313
(toy squeaks)

1000
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:55,941
- [Missy] She is not interested.

1001
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,016
- And look what I got.

1002
00:32:58,016 --> 00:32:58,933
- A cookie.

1003
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,326
- [Oliver] And we got another cookie.

1004
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:03,806
- Another cookie.

1005
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:04,639
- [Missy] Karma, can you share

1006
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:06,841
because I think those are yours?

1007
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:10,341
Are you willing to share with the new pup?

1008
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,023
- [Missy] Karma's like excuse me,

1009
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:16,755
these actually are mine.

1010
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,284
Not sharing right now.

1011
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:20,464
- [Bryan] Alright, we
are bonding with Luna

1012
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:21,702
on the trampoline.

1013
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:23,560
She's already got her candy cane, Ollie.

1014
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,294
- This is my new trampoline.

1015
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,498
- [Bryan] I know, it's so cool, huh?

1016
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:31,459
- (unclear speech) And
I got a big trampoline.

1017
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:32,292
No, no.

1018
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:33,125
- [ Bryan] No, no.

1019
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:33,958
She's okay.

1020
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:34,973
She's got a candy cane, buddy.

1021
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,286
- [Missy] Whoa.

1022
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:37,119
She's fine.

1023
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,577
Grab her bone.

1024
00:33:38,577 --> 00:33:40,312
(Fin screams)

1025
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,612
- [Bryan] She's so cute and fluffy.

1026
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:44,181
Hi, hi Luna.

1027
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,014
Hi, Luna.

1028
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,999
Luna, you want your candy cane?

1029
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,596
- [Missy] There you go.

1030
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:51,429
Good girl.

1031
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:55,100
- [Oliver] I ate candy canes.

1032
00:33:58,423 --> 00:33:59,427
(Bryan coos)

1033
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:00,260
- [Bryan] You want the ball?

1034
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,439
Go get it.

1035
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,439
You want the candy cane?

1036
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:08,355
(Bryan growls playfully)

1037
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,110
(laughter)

1038
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:15,514
Don't chew on me, huh?

1039
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:16,759
- She's crying.

1040
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,438
- She just likes to whine.

1041
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:19,830
She's a whiner.

1042
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:22,014
I bet she just wants to kiss you.

1043
00:34:22,014 --> 00:34:24,155
- [Bryan] Climb in the dune racer.

1044
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:26,335
- Fin wants to ride so you just...

1045
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:27,514
Can she ride with you.

1046
00:34:27,514 --> 00:34:28,347
- M hm.

1047
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:29,697
- [Bryan] Okay push the pedal.

1048
00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:31,557
- [Missy] Push the pedal, go.

1049
00:34:31,558 --> 00:34:33,632
- [Bryan] You gotta steer though.

1050
00:34:33,632 --> 00:34:34,465
Oh.

1051
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,306
I think we're gonna need to get

1052
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:39,120
Ollie some driving lessons.

1053
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,973
Right, Ollie.

1054
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:41,639
- [Oliver] Yeah.

1055
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,393
- Yeah, you gotta drive with both hands.

1056
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:44,226
He's like, I can do it.

1057
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:45,268
What's that?

1058
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:46,101
Oh, a big ol' fox.

1059
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:47,402
(toy squeaks)

1060
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:48,235
Hi, Koda.

1061
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:51,551
Hi, Karma.

1062
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:53,427
Yeah, all the dogs going to play.

1063
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:55,454
What do you think of Luna, Fin?

1064
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:56,619
Think she's pretty cool?

1065
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:57,994
Fin had a very good Christmas.

1066
00:34:57,994 --> 00:34:58,935
Let me tell you.

1067
00:34:58,935 --> 00:34:59,768
Everyone had,

1068
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:01,531
we had such a good
Christmas morning, you guys.

1069
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:02,364
(Fin exclaiming)

1070
00:35:02,364 --> 00:35:03,197
Yeah.

1071
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,885
Now it's time to just
play with all our fun toys

1072
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:10,720
and enjoy family and bond
with our new family member.

1073
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,272
We have a new family member now.

1074
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:15,878
Fin, that's our new family member.

1075
00:35:15,878 --> 00:35:16,711
(Fin exclaims)

1076
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:17,544
Yeah.

1077
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:21,457
(car revs)

1078
00:35:21,457 --> 00:35:22,601
Oh, careful.

1079
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:25,066
I gotta say, out of all this

1080
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:27,120
amazing delicious Christmas candy we got,

1081
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,282
I still love Crabbie Patties.

1082
00:35:29,282 --> 00:35:31,115
Gummy Crabbie Patties.

1083
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:31,948
And look at this one.

1084
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:32,781
It's a monster-sized one.

1085
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:34,109
What are we doing over here?

1086
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:35,285
We got a game?

1087
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:36,315
So Fin's favorite thing to do

1088
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:39,621
is take things and put things into stuff.

1089
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:41,530
- Which is why he likes
the basketball net.

1090
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,769
- It's like you put the ball in,

1091
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:44,749
and then it shoots it out,

1092
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:46,072
so he'll go get it and put it in.

1093
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:47,362
- [Bryan] Oh that's awesome.

1094
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:48,752
We'll have a baby game of fetch.

1095
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:50,819
- Yep, pretty much.

1096
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:51,652
- [Bryan] What are you eating?

1097
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:52,485
- This.

1098
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,318
- [Bryan] Oh put it in your mouth.

1099
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,600
It'll give you a funny nose.

1100
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,836
And then leave it.

1101
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:58,086
Move your hand.

1102
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:02,166
Look it, you're like a reindeer.

1103
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,466
You want a piece of gummy?

1104
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:05,708
Yeah you can have the lettuce.

1105
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,755
And Luna's honestly just
entertaining herself outside.

1106
00:36:07,755 --> 00:36:08,588
It's the cutest thing.

1107
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:09,516
She's playing with that little fox thing.

1108
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:10,782
Oh hi, Koda.

1109
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,183
She didn't like that one shirt we got

1110
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:14,223
but I think she might
like this one because

1111
00:36:14,223 --> 00:36:15,890
it's super thin.

1112
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,176
We happened to order a small dog one

1113
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:22,116
that matches all of our pajamas.

1114
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:24,094
So let's go see if she likes it.

1115
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:25,382
Alright, Luna.

1116
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:26,763
Let's put this shirt on you.

1117
00:36:26,763 --> 00:36:29,432
Let's see what you think.

1118
00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:31,160
Aw, look at that.

1119
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,435
Oh that's your back leg.

1120
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:34,498
(murmuring)

1121
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:37,817
Spoiler alert, she looks adorable.

1122
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:39,346
Look at her little shirt.

1123
00:36:39,346 --> 00:36:40,919
And it's got the same little reindeer

1124
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:43,012
on the back like the doggies do.

1125
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:44,133
And it makes her look fluffier.

1126
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,780
She's so fluffy.

1127
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,167
Okay, wanna run around?

1128
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:49,045
Can she walk in it?

1129
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:52,511
(giggles) She's good.

1130
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:53,588
Oh she hates it.

1131
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,258
(laughing)

1132
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:57,341
Yeah, I have a feeling she
doesn't like being dressed.

1133
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:58,704
You see I like to dress our puppies.

1134
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:01,027
Karma was wearing a Christmas mock sweater

1135
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:02,779
for most of the season, huh?

1136
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:03,612
What do you think?

1137
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:04,637
Oh she's getting used to it.

1138
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:07,795
Look at all these doggies matching.

1139
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,045
That's so cute.

1140
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:11,807
Alright we got this thing all set up.

1141
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:15,307
Look at them bouncing around there, Finny.

1142
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:19,446
Four?

1143
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,300
What do the number do?

1144
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Oh look at them go, look at them go.

1145
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:28,232
Okay, put it back in.

1146
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,642
Fin's like, just stay in there.

1147
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:34,975
(uptempo playful music)

1148
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,870
Okay, I'm wearing the ears, you guys.

1149
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,683
And I think I am focused or relaxing

1150
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:48,716
on something right now.

1151
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:50,428
At least that's what it tells me.

1152
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:51,980
Everyone's kind of napping right now,

1153
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,859
because we had a crazy Christmas morning.

1154
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:57,272
And I think Missy's
sleeping with the puppy.

1155
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:58,855
I look like a fool.

1156
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,413
(soft piano jazz)

1157
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,344
Okay, these are officially
the weirdest thing ever.

1158
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:19,177
Yeah, that's super cute.

1159
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:22,758
Missy's sleeping with the puppy right now.

1160
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,675
(soft piano music)

1161
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:32,246
Luna.

1162
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:34,816
Oh, she's going pee pee.

1163
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:36,455
Good girl.

1164
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:37,288
Good girl.

1165
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,584
You went to pee outside.

1166
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,680
Throw the ball for the doggies, Ollie.

1167
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,148
(unintelligible speech)

1168
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:44,363
Okay.

1169
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,794
Luna's like, I'm just waiting
to see what happens next.

1170
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:49,481
Hi, baby girl.

1171
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:50,314
Time to go.

1172
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:51,147
Alright.

1173
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,249
Everyone is awake from the naps.

1174
00:38:56,249 --> 00:38:57,380
Starting to get ready for the day

1175
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,454
although it's like one or two o'clock.

1176
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:00,468
We were up until 3:30.

1177
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:02,390
We were waiting for Santa.

1178
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,223
We weren't setting anything up

1179
00:39:03,223 --> 00:39:04,056
or putting presents under because

1180
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:05,254
that's what Santa does.

1181
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:06,252
But we were waiting for him.

1182
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:08,554
We fell asleep at like
3:30 waiting for him.

1183
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,387
So we never found him.

1184
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:10,502
So we were up late.

1185
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:12,574
- I like my new puppy dog.

1186
00:39:12,574 --> 00:39:13,634
- [Bryan] She's cute, huh?

1187
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:14,483
- Yeah.

1188
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:15,316
- [Bryan] You having lots of fun with her.

1189
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:16,447
- Where's my puppy dog?

1190
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:17,494
- She's right there.

1191
00:39:17,494 --> 00:39:18,327
- [Oliver] She's right there?

1192
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:19,160
- [Bryan] Go get her.

1193
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,993
- Okay.

1194
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:23,945
- [Bryan] Say hi, Luna.

1195
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,612
- [Oliver] Hi, Luna.

1196
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:28,888
She likes me.

1197
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:31,574
Do not bite me.

1198
00:39:31,574 --> 00:39:33,530
- [Bryan] Don't let her bite you, okay?

1199
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,537
Luna, look what I have.

1200
00:39:35,537 --> 00:39:36,692
Look what I have, look what I have.

1201
00:39:36,692 --> 00:39:38,240
Look what I have, look what I have.

1202
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,073
Go get it!

1203
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:44,217
(soft Christmas music)

1204
00:39:56,525 --> 00:39:59,392
- Look at my Toy Story shoes.

1205
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:04,241
- Ah, one thing we got the
boys was Toy Story Vans.

1206
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:07,043
And we got all three
styles for both of them.

1207
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:07,876
And I'm so excited.

1208
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,262
We didn't even wrap them
because I mean, they're shoes.

1209
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:11,645
Let's be honest.

1210
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:15,336
So we wanted some shoes that
he could slip into easily.

1211
00:40:15,336 --> 00:40:16,222
Is it these ones?

1212
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:17,310
Oh yeah, I think it's these ones, look!

1213
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,994
- I like these.

1214
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:20,153
(baby murmurs)

1215
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:21,724
- [Bryan] And then look
on the bottom, Ollie.

1216
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:22,741
It says Andy.

1217
00:40:22,741 --> 00:40:23,752
- Andy.

1218
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:24,960
- [Bryan] Yeah.

1219
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,793
(unclear remark from Missy)

1220
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:27,655
That's so freaking cute.

1221
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:29,180
Okay, let's put these shoes on, okay?

1222
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,041
Do you like 'em?

1223
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:30,874
- [Oliver] Yes.

1224
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:31,707
- Guess what, Ollie?

1225
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:32,540
- [Oliver] What?

1226
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,373
- [Bryan] They glow in the dark.

1227
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:34,783
- They glow in the dark?

1228
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:36,699
- [Bryan] Yeah.

1229
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:37,896
Pretty cool, huh?

1230
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,808
- Let me just go outside.

1231
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:40,775
- [Bryan] Okay.

1232
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:41,608
Aw, boy!

1233
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:43,558
Do you see his shoes?

1234
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:44,649
- Oh my God, they're cute.

1235
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:45,482
- [Bryan] They're Buzz Lightyear slip-ons

1236
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:46,529
and look at it.

1237
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:47,594
- Oh, Andy.

1238
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:49,795
(Bryan giggles)

1239
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:51,570
- [Bryan] It's awesome.

1240
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,015
What do you think about those fin?

1241
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:56,182
Fin's got a matching pair.

1242
00:40:57,072 --> 00:40:57,905
Let's put them on.

1243
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:00,205
They also say Andy on them.

1244
00:41:00,205 --> 00:41:02,148
- He likes me.

1245
00:41:02,148 --> 00:41:04,563
- [Bryan] Ollie, look
at your brother's shoes.

1246
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:05,396
- Whoa.

1247
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,464
- [Bryan] They match yours.

1248
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,547
- Buzz Lightyear.

1249
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:09,044
- [Bryan] Yeah, isn't that cool?

1250
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:12,044
(soft guitar music)

1251
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:20,271
Alright, we are teaching
Luna all about our backyard.

1252
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,229
Right, Ollie?

1253
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,062
- Yeah.

1254
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,585
- [Bryan] We've got to show her all around

1255
00:41:23,585 --> 00:41:25,137
so that she knows where everything is.

1256
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:27,506
So Luna, these are our rocks.

1257
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:29,171
Be careful though.

1258
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:30,506
You've got to be careful.

1259
00:41:30,506 --> 00:41:31,579
- [Missy] Luna, where are you going?

1260
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:32,776
- She is exploring already.

1261
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:34,408
Where is she?

1262
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,105
Oh she already went to the other side.

1263
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:40,766
And she's gone (giggles).

1264
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:43,766
(soft guitar music)

1265
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:07,483
What did you do, Ollie?

1266
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,698
You opened your dinosaur egg already?

1267
00:42:08,698 --> 00:42:09,531
- Yeah.

1268
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:10,575
- [Bryan] What you got?

1269
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:11,408
- I don't know.

1270
00:42:11,408 --> 00:42:13,467
- [Bryan] Oh I think I know what it is.

1271
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:14,662
I think it's a stegosaurus.

1272
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:15,813
- Okay.

1273
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:17,021
- [Bryan] What do you think it is?

1274
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:18,377
- I don't know.

1275
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:19,210
Look it.

1276
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,043
- [Bryan] What is it?

1277
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:20,876
- I don't know.

1278
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:21,993
Let me show you.

1279
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:23,777
It's a (murmuring).

1280
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:26,777
(soft guitar music)

1281
00:42:27,941 --> 00:42:32,108
(Missy imitates the
Lion King theme lyrics)

1282
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:37,484
- [Bryan] Alright, Luna,
go meet the chickens.

1283
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:38,905
- [Missy] Come here.

1284
00:42:38,905 --> 00:42:39,984
- [Bryan] Oh (giggles).

1285
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:42,151
- Marie, you like doggies.

1286
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:44,431
Where you been.

1287
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:45,372
- [Bryan] Well, Luna
doesn't have a problem

1288
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:46,205
with the chickens,

1289
00:42:46,205 --> 00:42:47,038
but the chickens have a problem with her.

1290
00:42:47,038 --> 00:42:47,871
Really.

1291
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:49,567
Don't worry, Luna.

1292
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,945
In time, the chickens will love you.

1293
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:52,038
- They love, don't worry.

1294
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:53,246
They love Karma.

1295
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:55,516
They know Karma helps protect them.

1296
00:42:55,516 --> 00:42:58,309
(Ollie speaking unintelligibly)

1297
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,981
- [Bryan] Oh yeah.

1298
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:00,814
Prime rib.

1299
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:02,555
Oh yeah.

1300
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:04,551
Oh yeah.

1301
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:05,522
- It looks delicious.

1302
00:43:05,522 --> 00:43:07,234
- [Bryan] We are sitting
down ready for dinner.

1303
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:09,093
We are eating at this big table.

1304
00:43:09,093 --> 00:43:10,989
Second time we've eaten at this table.

1305
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,417
Yeah we ate at this
table for Christmas eve,

1306
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,191
and now we have it all
setup for Christmas.

1307
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,056
(Ollie exclaims)

1308
00:43:15,056 --> 00:43:15,889
Yeah, Ollie.

1309
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:18,546
You're even eating on the fancy plates.

1310
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:19,617
You got your mac and
cheese and your banana.

1311
00:43:19,617 --> 00:43:20,617
What's that?

1312
00:43:21,756 --> 00:43:22,589
- A napkin.

1313
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:23,770
- [Bryan] You got your napkin, huh?

1314
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,093
(Ollie speaks unintelligibly)

1315
00:43:26,093 --> 00:43:28,073
- [Bryan] It's got a little napkin holder.

1316
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:28,906
- Really?

1317
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,739
- Yeah.

1318
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:32,006
Alright you guys, Fin has gone to bed

1319
00:43:32,006 --> 00:43:34,025
and we are now putting Ollie to bed

1320
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:38,661
and putting our amazing
Christmas day to rest.

1321
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:40,143
Luna's just watching us,

1322
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:43,066
like, oh, this is where Ollie sleeps?

1323
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:44,594
(giggling)

1324
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:47,548
She's been such a good puppy, you guys.

1325
00:43:47,548 --> 00:43:49,153
Her and Ollie kinda got
off to a rough start.

1326
00:43:49,153 --> 00:43:50,995
She was a little more rough, I think,

1327
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,039
than Ollie was anticipating.

1328
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:55,097
But I think, once Ollie got like,

1329
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:57,285
energy and confidence,
he was having so much

1330
00:43:57,285 --> 00:43:58,347
fun with her.

1331
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,243
- I think when she
realized that she really...

1332
00:44:00,243 --> 00:44:01,638
It is hard when she's a puppy.

1333
00:44:01,638 --> 00:44:02,831
She has sharp teeth.

1334
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:03,962
But when she realized he wasn't...

1335
00:44:03,962 --> 00:44:06,245
She's not being mean or anything.

1336
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:07,078
Then, he was like okay.

1337
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:09,367
I mean they ran around the
yard all day, those two.

1338
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:11,573
- Yeah, we've honestly
just been playing with her.

1339
00:44:11,573 --> 00:44:14,951
She hasn't had an accident
once in the house.

1340
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:18,056
We've been taking her out
every two hours, I think,

1341
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:18,889
to potty.

1342
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,238
And anytime after she wakes up.

1343
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:22,655
We're also giving her
lots of toys to chew on.

1344
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,518
We're not letting play
with our hands as toys.

1345
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:28,298
She's been so cuddly and just playful,

1346
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,131
all day, honestly.

1347
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:32,130
I don't think we could ask
for a much better puppy.

1348
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,516
- If she stays like this.

1349
00:44:33,516 --> 00:44:34,863
- [Bryan] I know (giggles).

1350
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:36,902
No, it's not going to be easy.

1351
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:37,776
Puppies are not easy.

1352
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:38,609
But it's going to be fun.

1353
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,996
- The puppy breath is
strong with this one.

1354
00:44:40,996 --> 00:44:42,633
(laughter)

1355
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:43,466
- [Bryan] Alright, Ollie.

1356
00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:44,765
Let's hope in bed buddy.

1357
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,598
- Okay.

1358
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:47,694
I like my new puppy.

1359
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:48,802
- [Bryan] Do you?

1360
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:49,729
- [Oliver] Yeah.

1361
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:50,963
- Look at her.

1362
00:44:50,963 --> 00:44:51,796
- [Bryan] Well climb in the bed.

1363
00:44:51,796 --> 00:44:52,629
She'll cuddle with you.

1364
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:54,002
- [Missy] She can sleep with you.

1365
00:44:54,002 --> 00:44:55,957
- [Bryan] Yeah once
she's all toilet trained,

1366
00:44:55,957 --> 00:44:56,790
or potty trained.

1367
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:00,290
That would be cool if she used the toilet.

1368
00:45:01,362 --> 00:45:02,326
- [ Missy] Don't get her riled up.

1369
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:05,184
- [Bryan] Say night, night puppy.

1370
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:06,212
Can you give her a hug.

1371
00:45:06,212 --> 00:45:07,045
- Yeah.

1372
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:09,262
- [Bryan] Give her a hug, Ollie.

1373
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:10,559
(cooing)

1374
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:11,855
Say, night night, puppy.

1375
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:12,688
- [Missy] Just be calm.

1376
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:13,892
Because it's night time.

1377
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:16,015
(Bryan giggles)

1378
00:45:16,015 --> 00:45:17,844
- Goodnight, night, puppy.

1379
00:45:17,844 --> 00:45:19,156
Well, you guys, I hope you really enjoyed

1380
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:22,444
the Daily Bumps 2016 Christmas special.

1381
00:45:22,444 --> 00:45:23,479

00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:26,072
and I hope you guys had an
amazing Christmas as well.
