1
00:00:00,936 --> 00:00:03,433
- Their noise isn't that terrible.

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,494
- [Bryan] Yeah.

3
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:05,510
(rooster crowing)

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,565
- Speaking of...

5
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:07,909
- [Bryan] We have to say goodbye.

6
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:08,933
♫ This is our life

7
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,353
♫ This is our fun

8
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:12,403
♫ This is who we are

9
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:13,707
♫ This is our dream

10
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:14,789
♫ This is our team

11
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,237
♫ Shot among the stars

12
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:19,473
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

13
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:22,317
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

14
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:24,178
♫ This is our life

15
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:26,298
♫ Let's live it

16
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:28,352
♫ Live it forever

17
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:29,519
- Good morning

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,984
(laughing)

19
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:32,996
It is morning time.

20
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,756
It's Saturday morning and we are watching,

21
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:35,756
what are we watching Ollie?

22
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:37,515
- The Grinch movie.

23
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:38,605
- [Missy] Yeah, we're watching The Grinch.

24
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,035
- [Ollie] It's my favorite movie.

25
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:42,701
- Who stole Christmas.

26
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:43,735
Hey Ollie,

27
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,034
do you think the Grinch
is gonna come to our house

28
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:46,208
again this year?

29
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,202
(laughing)

30
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:48,344
He's like I hope not.

31
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:49,318
Um yeah.

32
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:50,664
If you guys don't know last year

33
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:52,716
the Grinch came to our house
and he was not very nice.

34
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:54,104
He did all kinds of
crazy stuff at our house.

35
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:58,184
But anyways we were just having
a really fun lazy Saturday

36
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,402
morning.

37
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:00,407
It's been really, really nice.

38
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,247
I love mornings like this
where we get to all cuddle.

39
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:04,179
Bryan's actually already
getting ready for the day

40
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:06,198
so we think we're gonna
go ahead and do that next.

41
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:07,321
What should we do today, bud?

42
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,324
- Um...

43
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:09,373
Go to CJ Bailey's house.

44
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,831
- CJ Bailey's house?

45
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:12,001
(laughing)

46
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,432
That's a good idea.

47
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:14,429
We'll see.

48
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:16,512
Are you giving Luna love?

49
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:18,798
Finn you're being so sweet.

50
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:20,452
(baby laughing)

51
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:24,273
The truth is Finn can be
a little rough sometimes

52
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:27,071
but he also can be super sweet too.

53
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:29,224
Look we're dressed now.

54
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:30,700
Finn is all dressed,

55
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,462
Mama's all dressed,

56
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:33,464
Ollie's all dressed.

57
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:34,610
Ollie are you dressed?

58
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,624
- [Ollie] Um yeah

59
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:38,662
and I'm in the toilet pooping.

60
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:39,656
(laughing)

61
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:40,634
- I don't know if you heard him say

62
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,390
in the toilet poopin'.

63
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,734
All right you almost done?

64
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:44,704
- [Ollie] Yeah.

65
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,742
- Okay.

66
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:46,725
He's so cute.

67
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:48,317
You guys I was just looking
outside at the chicken coop

68
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,807
and I can see something
really cool in there.

69
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:52,015
Can you guys see that?

70
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:54,900
There's a little bird
inside the chicken coop.

71
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,917
I wonder how he got in there.

72
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:56,968
Let's see if I can get a closer look.

73
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:58,228
Do you see that little bird?

74
00:01:58,228 --> 00:01:59,690
Oh my gosh.

75
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,128
Oh my gosh it's like

76
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:02,370
I wonder what kind of bird that is.

77
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,084
It's got a pretty big beak.

78
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:05,348
I feel like it squeezed through the top

79
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:07,228
'cause the top is definitely open.

80
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,061
How cute.

81
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,958
I wanna keep you forever and ever.

82
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,060
(laughing)

83
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,603
Should we keep the birdie?

84
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:15,647
- Yeah.

85
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:16,649
(laughing)

86
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:17,651
- [Missy] Finn.

87
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,241
We were just so excited
to show you what we caught

88
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,729
and now it's gone.

89
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,497
(laughing)

90
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:23,914
Awww he's so sad.

91
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:26,975
Yeah we just ran inside to tell Bryan

92
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:29,143
and Finn to come outside come outside

93
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:30,735
and Finn came out and
he was so excited and

94
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,804
the bird's gone.

95
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,523
I'm guessing he like got out

96
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:35,972
got in through those little cracks

97
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:37,406
and then just like went back out.

98
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,063
But that was so cute.

99
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:40,038
It's okay.

100
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,724
The birdie it gets to go
find its mommy and daddy.

101
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,154
'Cause he was lost.

102
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:46,393
Yes and now he's back
with his mommy and daddy.

103
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:47,983
So that's a good thing, huh?

104
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:48,995
- Yeah.

105
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:49,979
- Yeah.

106
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:51,015
All right boys.

107
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:52,643
We have been cooped up in the
house getting the house clean,

108
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:54,021
working on stuff, huh?

109
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,025
- Yeah.

110
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,036
- Yeah.

111
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:57,866
And now we are on a little Polaris ride.

112
00:02:57,866 --> 00:03:00,477
Bryan is actually finishing getting ready

113
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:03,508
for a little special thing
that we're doing tonight.

114
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:04,890
So I thought I'm gonna take the kids out

115
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,470
'cause they've been
cooped up a little bit.

116
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,808
They're eating an apple snack

117
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:09,626
and we're headed out on the Polaris.

118
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:10,622
I did want to show you guys.

119
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:13,946
If you guys are wondering
what happened to the big tub

120
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:16,651
that was inside of our Halloween maze

121
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:18,815
we actually painted it.

122
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:20,959
It was all red and so now it's all white

123
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,545
and I think we're gonna use
it as like part of a garden

124
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:25,795
and kind of plant plants in it and stuff.

125
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:27,115
I thought it was kind of a cute idea.

126
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,932
So it's that and then there's
my tunnel of bugs right now.

127
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:31,496
I don't know what I'm gonna do with that.

128
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:34,556
I'm guessing my dad will take
it apart and use it for parts.

129
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:35,732
Here we go boys.

130
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:36,738
Let's go.

131
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,116
(screaming)

132
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:40,917
And there's my well down there.

133
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:43,071
Where Samara climbs out of

134
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:45,144
during the Halloween maze.

135
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:46,719
I wonder how long that
thing will be there?

136
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,871
(laughing)

137
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:50,413
You guys it is literally the nicest

138
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:51,887
most beautiful day.

139
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:54,759
It just feels so good
and I love riding around

140
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,466
with my pups and my kids on our property.

141
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,438
It's just so nice.

142
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:01,111
We're checking out our
little watering hole.

143
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:02,625
If you've been following our watering hole

144
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,755
since we moved in it was full of water,

145
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:07,376
it was emptied now it's like

146
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:09,654
a little bit of water and
we really are not sure

147
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:12,204
what the water is but it's
always fun to check on it

148
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:13,962
and there's a little water down there

149
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,484
so once again is it a broken pipe?

150
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,491
Is it a natural spring coming up

151
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,391
from the ground in Southern California?

152
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,409
I don't know.

153
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:23,826
(inspiring instrumental)

154
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:32,881
- Hey guys.

155
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,689
I have been working in
my office all morning

156
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:36,462
because I've been trying
to arrange something

157
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:38,296
really special for Missy and I tonight.

158
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:39,938
Completely last minute.

159
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:40,934
You guys know me.

160
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,052
That's just who I am.

161
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:43,351
It's how I roll.

162
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,379
These past couple of months
have been so busy for us

163
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,173
I feel like we have not really

164
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:51,239
had a good chance to get away
and we desperately need it.

165
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,249
(laughing)

166
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,252
We just kinda need a little break.

167
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,263
A little vacation.

168
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,531
Everyone needs a little
vacation every now and then.

169
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:56,622
You know what I mean?

170
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:58,035
So I've been in here booking everything.

171
00:04:58,035 --> 00:04:59,413
We're gonna stay at
this really nice resort

172
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,131
not too far away which is cool too.

173
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,733
But yeah booking everything last minute

174
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,409
is so annoying and I'm just like

175
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:05,674
why didn't I think ahead?

176
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:07,588
Why didn't I think ahead Luna?

177
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:09,116
Luna got a haircut yesterday.

178
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:10,254
She looks like a puppy.

179
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:11,830
I'm gonna go see what Missy's up to now.

180
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,831
All right.

181
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,581
Let's go see what Missy is up to.

182
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:19,672
(country instrumental)

183
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:22,926
All right babe.

184
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:23,920
What's going on out here?

185
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,715
- Well I feel like I've
hinted towards this

186
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:26,977
for a while.

187
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:28,112
- [Bryan] Oh really?

188
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,951
Something about to go down?

189
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,335
- Yeah.

190
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:33,973
I just can't have this many roosters.

191
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:37,042
So I have a lady who like
who gave me the fertile eggs

192
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,224
and she said if any of them
turn out to be roosters

193
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:41,414
that she'd take them back and
she has this cute little farm

194
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:44,195
she basically just like
raises chickens and

195
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:47,592
sells like chicks and
fertile eggs and stuff and so

196
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,783
I know they're gonna
be safe and happy there

197
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,693
and I'm really excited
about where they're gonna go

198
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,025
but they can't stay here anymore.

199
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,031
(laughing)

200
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:55,041
- Yeah.

201
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,048
You can't go home but you can't stay here.

202
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,384
Chickens.

203
00:05:57,384 --> 00:05:58,969
- So far they're not super aggressive.

204
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,621
Their noise isn't that terrible.

205
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:02,631
- [Bryan] Yeah.

206
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,636
- But...

207
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:04,640
(rooster crowing)

208
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,637
Speaking of.

209
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:06,640
(laughing)

210
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,650
- [Bryan] We have to say goodbye.

211
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
- But yeah they just,

212
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,784
they're eating all of the
food and they're picking on

213
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,758
my chickens and they're
like beating them up

214
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:12,786
(door rattles)

215
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:13,770
- [Bryan] Do you hear them?

216
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,780
Going crazy.

217
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,048
(rooster crowing)

218
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,084
All right.

219
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,092
- [Missy] Oh hey.

220
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:19,084
- [Bryan] Oh hey.

221
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:20,067
(laughing)

222
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,327
- [Missy] So yeah.

223
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:22,369
- What's up guys?

224
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,511
- [Missy] It's a little bittersweet.

225
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,950
- [Bryan] Nah they're gonna
go somewhere way cooler

226
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,373
honestly.

227
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:27,381
- Oh hi.

228
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:30,230
Speaking of I think this
is Kristoff right here.

229
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,218
- [Bryan] Huge.

230
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,108
Look how huge.

231
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:35,008
- I know I'm kinda scared of him.

232
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,466
Roosters have attacked me so
I don't really like roosters.

233
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,470
- That is a...

234
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,880
(rooster crowing)

235
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,893
Okay. Chill.

236
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:41,948
We're right here.

237
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:43,071
Honestly guys.

238
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,073
Come on.

239
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:45,368
Yeah that, he's huge.

240
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:47,244
I have not realized how big he's gotten.

241
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:49,133
- [Missy] He's a big chicken.

242
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,173
- [Bryan] Oh my gosh.

243
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:51,149
- Hey, hey.

244
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,167
Calm down.

245
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,189
Don't, don't.

246
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:54,253
- [Bryan] Oh this is gonna be interesting.

247
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:55,303
- Oh god. Oh god.

248
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:56,385
I am so scared.

249
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:57,383
(screams)

250
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,408
(laughing)

251
00:06:58,408 --> 00:06:59,582
I am not scared of any of my chickens.

252
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:01,938
Like not scared of any of them.

253
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,656
That one scares me.

254
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,922
- [Bryan] Yeah it's just a matter of time

255
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:06,940
before he gets your eyeball.

256
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,912
- Here we go.

257
00:07:07,912 --> 00:07:09,377
I'm gonna go through the other way.

258
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:10,350
- [Bryan] All right.

259
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,358
Closed this little door.

260
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:12,365
Now they can't get out.

261
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,282
Does the shushing help?

262
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,131
- No I don't know.

263
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:18,111
Helps me.

264
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:19,115
Helps calm me down.

265
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,081
(shushing)

266
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,927
(laughing)

267
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,367
Stop. Stop.

268
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:26,454
- [Bryan] He doesn't wanna leave.

269
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:27,543
Wow.

270
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:28,715
- No. Stop. Relax.

271
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,281
Okay.

272
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,286
- [Bryan] Got him.

273
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:32,290
- I got him.

274
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,264
- [Bryan] Good job.

275
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:34,270
- He's good.

276
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,282
He has big talons though I'm scared.

277
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:36,283
- Oh wow look at that.

278
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:37,286
Woo.

279
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:40,520
So we have to load the
chickens up into this crate.

280
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,928
(crate rattling)

281
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,580
This is actually Luna's crate.

282
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,714
All right.

283
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,909
Hang out in there.

284
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,919
Kay.

285
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:47,947
Got a couple more friends...

286
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,485
He is so angry.

287
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:50,573
Awwww.

288
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:53,405
He's gonna be so much happier
honestly at this new place.

289
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:54,796
- I know. He's gonna have
all the women he wants.

290
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:55,817
(laughing)

291
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:56,838
- Yeah. True.

292
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:59,707
Just a huge, huge farm like I
think we should try and visit

293
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:02,558
some day but she has so many chickens

294
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,234
and so much land.

295
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,258
So this was Cruella.

296
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:06,650
(chicken bawking)

297
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,669
- No.

298
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:08,680
This is,

299
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,684
this one is Elsa.

300
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:10,692
- [Bryan] Oh Elsa.

301
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:11,658
- We'll name her, 'cause that was Kristoff

302
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,698
this is Hans.

303
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:13,705
- [Bryan] Yeah.

304
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:14,671
(laughing)

305
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:15,984
Because Elsa is not a princess.

306
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:16,987
- Nope. Elsa is a...

307
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:17,971
- [Bryan] He's a prince.

308
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:18,955
(laughing)

309
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,729
So this was our last Silkie that made it.

310
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,126
Turned out to be also a rooster.

311
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:26,477
- And you know what this is Cruella DeVil

312
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,573
and let's keep her Cruella DeVil.

313
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,508
- [Bryan] Yeah.

314
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,758
- She's a Cruella for sure.

315
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,695
- [Bryan] Look at Luna right now.

316
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:43,698
She is so excited.

317
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:46,444
She's jumping up and down
staring at the chickens like

318
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,664
just let me play with them.

319
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:48,928
(laughing)

320
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,569
- We putted them in a cage.

321
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:53,643
- [Bryan] Yeah we gotta
say goodbye to them Ollie.

322
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:54,643
Did you say goodbye?

323
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:55,941
- Bye.

324
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:57,576
(laughing)

325
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:58,582
- [Bryan] Bye guys.

326
00:08:58,582 --> 00:08:59,687
Thanks for hanging out with us.

327
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,045
You're gonna really enjoy the new farm.

328
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,346
(laughing)

329
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:04,445
For sure.

330
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:05,885
- Bye chickens.

331
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:07,734
- [Bryan] Saying goodbye
to the chickens yep.

332
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:09,170
- Bye chickens.

333
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,186
- [Bryan] Yep.

334
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:11,272
Hew Ollie what are you holdin'?

335
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,458
- Some bread and some toys.

336
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,464
- Exactly.

337
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:16,100
That is all you need in life, huh?

338
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,632
Bread and toys.

339
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:19,334
This kid knows what's up.

340
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,531
He also invented a new game.

341
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:22,547
Ollie what's it called?

342
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:23,955
- A magic pumpkin.

343
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:26,090
- Yeah they think that
this new poof we got

344
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,972
for Missy's new nook area is a pumpkin

345
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,488
and so they stand on it and balance

346
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,641
and then jump off.

347
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:34,474
Whoa.

348
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:37,456
That was cool dude.

349
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:38,464
You did a spin.

350
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,653
Balancing on this thing
is not as easy as it seems

351
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:41,647
you guys.

352
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,419
I've seen Finn stand up on this,

353
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:46,169
wobble and like I see him get his balance.

354
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,269
It's so cool.

355
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,424
(Finn screaming into megaphone)

356
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:50,803
Speaking of Finn...

357
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:51,809
Hey dude.

358
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,259
Do you wanna try and
balance on the pumpkin?

359
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,263
- [Finn] Yeah.

360
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:55,262
- [Bryan] Stand up.

361
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,265
Let's see if he can do it.

362
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:57,259
- Get up.

363
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,232
The magic pumpkin.

364
00:09:58,232 --> 00:09:59,274
(laughing)

365
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:00,246
- [Bryan] Stand up.

366
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:01,245
Oh my gosh.

367
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:02,286
You did it.

368
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,250
Whoa.

369
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,254
Balance.

370
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,262
Balance.

371
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:06,266
Yeah.

372
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,274
Now jump.

373
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,415
Whoa.

374
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:09,683
(laughing)

375
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:10,933
That's so cool.

376
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,423
The boys love this.

377
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:14,953
It's so funny.

378
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:15,970
Okay.

379
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,931
What's going on?

380
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:18,615
- I'm gonna look like a vampire on this.

381
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:19,697
- [Bryan] A vampire?

382
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:20,911
- I'm a vampire.

383
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,744
- Whoa.

384
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:25,441
Yeah we've started getting
a couple different furniture

385
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,942
pieces for Missy's nook area.

386
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,364
I'm not gonna show you anything else.

387
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:30,711
I don't wanna give it
away but we have I think

388
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:34,222
designed a really cool space
for Missy to film videos

389
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:37,241
again so she's excited
to get started filming

390
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:38,881
and stuff like that.

391
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:40,490
You really like bread, don't you?

392
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,712
(Ollie mumbling)

393
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:42,756
Just like your mother.

394
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:43,766
(laughing)

395
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,146
Go. Go. Go. Go.

396
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,484
Go Finn. Go Finn.

397
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:47,566
Oh no he's wobbling.

398
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:48,574
Stand up.

399
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:49,800
(Finn screaming)

400
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,814
Stand up.

401
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:51,817
Stand up.

402
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,818
(Finn screaming)

403
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,248
Look at him wobbling.

404
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:55,232
(Finn screaming)

405
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:56,249
Stand all the way up Finn.

406
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:57,267
Oh no.

407
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,279
(laughing)

408
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,293
Oh.

409
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,276
You okay?

410
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:01,289
- Yeah.

411
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:02,269
(laughing)

412
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:03,291
- Everybody dance now.

413
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,291
(upbeat electronic)

414
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,422
- Mimi and Papa are here.

415
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:27,245
- Mimi and Papa have arrived
because they are going to

416
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:29,406
be watching the boys while Missy and I

417
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:31,933
get our little getaway going.

418
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,169
Hey Papa.

419
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,799
Ollie confessed to us
that you taught him what

420
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,558
blood-sucking vampires are.

421
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:39,911
- Me?

422
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,836
- [Missy] I said that there is
no way Papa taught you that.

423
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,834
(laughing)

424
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:46,316
- All of a sudden he just
kept talking about vampires

425
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:47,402
and how they suck blood

426
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,246
and I'm like how does he know that?

427
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,378
- How did you learn that?

428
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,386
And he goes Papa told me.

429
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:52,398
I was like no.

430
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:53,690
No he didn't.

431
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,782
- [Bryan] He always tells us it's you.

432
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,135
- Blames all the stuff on Papa.

433
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:57,192
(laughing)

434
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,453
'Cause it's totally true.

435
00:11:58,453 --> 00:11:59,507
- [Papa] It is not my mother-in-law.

436
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:00,589
(laughing)

437
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,298
- We've made it to our little place.

438
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:05,564
We are so excited for our weekend getaway.

439
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:07,951

00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,811

444
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,543
