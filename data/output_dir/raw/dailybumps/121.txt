1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:01,871
- [Missy] What'd you guys find?

2
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:02,704
- A frog!

3
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:04,555
- [Missy] Aww!

4
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:06,605
- Be very gentle.

5
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:08,438
Don't point him at me!

6
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:11,369
- [Missy] That is such a cool one!

7
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,766
(giggling)

8
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,819
It's crawling up Papa!
(children laughing excitedly)

9
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:18,194
- Slow down, slow, gentle with him.

10
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:19,162
You don't scare him.
- Grab him.

11
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:20,775
Good job Ollie!

12
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:24,506
(laughing)
- Oh, he was jumping on you!

13
00:00:24,506 --> 00:00:26,261
♪ This is our life ♪

14
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,311

16
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:32,051
- Good Morning!

17
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:32,884
Batman!

18
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:35,847
Oh my!

19
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:38,353
Jeez, what just happened?

20
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:40,103
- Batman mean.

21
00:00:40,103 --> 00:00:41,436
- Batman's mean?

22
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:47,082
Morning guys, I'm just hanging
out with Finn right now,

23
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:48,853
and Ollie's at school.

24
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:49,836
We need to pick him up soon.

25
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:51,306
You miss Ollie?
- Batman?

26
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:53,566
- You wanna be Batman or
you want Mama to be Batman?

27
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:54,399
Batman!

28
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:56,683
(screams)

29
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,176
Don't attack me!

30
00:00:58,176 --> 00:00:59,500
What are you, the Joker?

31
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,604
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:02,315
Hey bud, we gotta get you dressed, okay?

33
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,483
I've got your pants, and your shirt,

34
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:07,678
and it's time to get dressed, okay?

35
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:10,117
We had such a fun night
yesterday, it was Friendsgiving.

36
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:13,248
We had a lot of friends
over, we had a yummy dinner.

37
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:14,166
We just played some games

38
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,025
and had a really, really fun night.

39
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,054
So now it's back to reality.

40
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:19,586
Yesterday the whole day was just kind

41
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:22,267
of all about the party,
and cooking and baking.

42
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:25,041
Definitely was like a little pre-gamer

43
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,363
for next week, which is Thanksgiving.

44
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:30,576
Now it is back to life and
I gotta go get him ready,

45
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:33,673
and I gotta go get Ollie today.

46
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:35,540
And we have a few more things to do.

47
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,592
And he's dressed!

48
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:40,018
Are you being a crazy boy today?

49
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:42,924
Do you miss your brother, Ollie?

50
00:01:42,924 --> 00:01:45,154
- No, no, no!
(laughing)

51
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:46,154
- All right.

52
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:49,772
Let's go baby.

53
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:51,860
Karma, what have you been doing all day?

54
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,925
Have you been looking for your friend?

55
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,837
Where's Luna?

56
00:01:55,837 --> 00:01:58,153
He's like "Where is she?"

57
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:02,381
You guys, this morning we
had to say goodbye to Luna.

58
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,646
Where's Luna, Finn?

59
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:07,242
- Luna (babbling).
- Oh yeah?

60
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:11,222
Luna actually had a
spay appointment today,

61
00:02:11,222 --> 00:02:13,313
and so she had to go early this morning

62
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:15,938
to the doctor's to get
spayed, and I feel so bad.

63
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:18,093
She's been such a good
dog, and I feel like she's

64
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:21,079
gonna be like, "What the heck,
did I do something wrong?".

65
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,098
'Cause she just goes
there to get surgery done.

66
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:24,290
She's getting spayed, which I think

67
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,890
was really, really important for her,

68
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,824
but she's also getting a microchip.

69
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:29,379
Yay, although I will say this.

70
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,878
I feel like everyone also
thinks that a microchip

71
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:35,757
is so that you can track them
wherever they are, it's not.

72
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:38,450
It's that if they find her,
and they take her somewhere

73
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,048
where they can scan it, then
they can see her address

74
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:43,031
or her contact information.

75
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:44,604
But it's still a really awesome thing,

76
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:47,564
and I'm really glad that
she's gonna have that now.

77
00:02:47,564 --> 00:02:49,712
That's just a little bit more of security.

78
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,778
We've also taken a lot
of different actions

79
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:54,487
and we actually finally found a piece

80
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:57,849
that goes on her collar, so
that we can actually track her,

81
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,497
and see where she's at at different times.

82
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:02,222
It's hard because we kind
of in like a rural area,

83
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:05,583
and so it's hard to find
ones that work in this area.

84
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,964
But I think we might
have finally found one.

85
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:10,409
But anyways, we are headed
off today to do a few things,

86
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,974
and then we gotta go pick up Luna.

87
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,474
Ollie, how was school?

88
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:15,307
Good?

89
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,262
Were you sleeping in class?
- Yeah.

90
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:19,514
- Yeah, Ollie, your hair is all messed up.

91
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:20,741
You have bed head!

92
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:22,838
Isn't that funny?
(laughs)

93
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,723
All right, I'm glad
your home, I missed you.

94
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:29,056
All right, we are headed to go get Luna!

95
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,162
Did you know Luna was gone today?

96
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:34,020
- No.
- No, you didn't know.

97
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,298
He didn't know that we took her.

98
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,122
So she had a little operation,
she went to the doctors.

99
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:41,510
So she's gonna be a little groggy,

100
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,469
and a little slow today.

101
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:44,987
So we'll have to be really gentle

102
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,276
and take really good care of her, okay?

103
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:48,109
- Okay.

104
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:50,350
- Finn, sound good?

105
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,653
You still with mommy's babysitter?

106
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:54,116
(laughs)

107
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:55,440
All right, I'm gonna go get Luna.

108
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,912
My mom's here so she can

109
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:58,382
- Watch the kids.
- watch the boys,

110
00:03:58,382 --> 00:03:59,532
while I go in and get her.

111
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:01,199
I hope she's okay, I hope she's not sad.

112
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,879
Oh by the way mom, Karma has
been looking for her all day.

113
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,912
- Really?
- Yes!

114
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,545
I would go, "Where's Luna?",

115
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,779
and he would look around the house.

116
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:11,709
And then he runs off and
then he even cries sometimes

117
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,047
when he runs off, like "Where is she?".

118
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:14,942
- That's cute.

119
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:17,113
- [Missy] Ollie, are
you excited to get Luna?

120
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:19,140
Yeah, are you gonna take care of her?

121
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,808
Maybe you can be her doctor,

122
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:22,623
give her lots of hugs and kisses?

123
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:24,957
- I don't know how to be a doctor.

124
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:25,790
- [Missy] You're right.

125
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,347
Okay, then you can just be Ollie

126
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:30,564
and just give her lots of love, okay?

127
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,506
Here she comes!

128
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,589
There she is!

129
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,525
Hi, girlie.

130
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,811
- [Nurse] She's still a little drowsy.

131
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:41,478
- Aww, are you okay?

132
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:44,855
You wanna give her some hugs?

133
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,422
She just got a little owie
on her tummy but she's okay.

134
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,784
All right, come on girl.

135
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:52,299
She's so out of it.

136
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,241
- [Missy's Mom] Hi pretty girl, come on.

137
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:55,495
There you go.

138
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,857
- [Missy] Good job Luna.

139
00:04:57,857 --> 00:05:00,857
(light banjo music)

140
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:04,476
Karma, your friend is here!

141
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:05,309
Be gentle!

142
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,347
She's like "What did
they do to me, Karma?".

143
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:12,015
Karma you've done it too, you
can tell her all about it.

144
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:15,131
Aww, she's so happy to see you.

145
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,395
- I missed her honestly.

146
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,039
I dropped her off today, this morning,

147
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,382
and she was so scared

148
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:21,995
and she didn't know what was happening.

149
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:23,336
And then she just got home.

150
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:24,719
- [Missy] Yeah, and she saw you,

151
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:26,908
and started wagging her little nub.

152
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:29,898
(laughs) She was so happy to see him.

153
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:31,899
- You okay, girl?
- You got your guy?

154
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,899
(light banjo music)

155
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:48,764
- [Bryan] I have here in my hands

156
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:52,514
the first official Daily
Bumps 2018 calender.

157
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:58,287
Look at that babe.
- This is so cool.

158
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,642
- [Bryan] It's so much
nicer than I thought.

159
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:05,043
It's super nice quality and
the color looks so good.

160
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,652
- It's so creative.

161
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,827
Like there's so, it's just I love it

162
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,056
because I feel like every
picture is so different.

163
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:13,408
- [Bryan] Yeah, and we've
worked so hard so this.

164
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,795
- It's so vibrant and life to it.

165
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:18,443
I love pictures that
have movement in them,

166
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:21,012
and you can see something
happening in them.

167
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:22,778
And that's almost every
single one of them.

168
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:23,967
- [Bryan] Yeah, totally.

169
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,105
I thought I would give you
guys a really quick sneak peak

170
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:27,121
because we really can't
give away too much.

171
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,837
- I know, it's so good though.

172
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:31,155
- But we're gonna show you
guys the very first month

173
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:33,172
of the Daily Bumps calender, okay?

174
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:35,464
There's the intro page, which is cute.

175
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:37,052
You ready, you ready for it?

176
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:38,066
You ready for it?

177
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,326
Boom.

178
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:40,390
- January.

179
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,005
In January we eat
breakfast in bed everyday.

180
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,672
- [Bryan] Apparently, yes.

181
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:47,587
Look that is the very
first picture of the month.

182
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,910
We're not gonna give away anything else.

183
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,754
Yeah, that was such a fun
shoot in the bed like that.

184
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:55,286
- It has your birthday on it.

185
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:58,598
- Yes, it's full of
special dates and reminders

186
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:00,033
throughout the whole year.

187
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:02,564
If you guys have not
ordered your calender,

188
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:04,403
go order one right now.

189
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,533
Link is down below, in the description.

190
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:08,610
We are signing a very
limited amount of these

191
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,265
and we're gonna get the kids in on it too.

192
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:11,290
Just really proud of this.

193
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,899
We worked really hard
on this, it was cool.

194
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,513
- Yeah, this was a lot of
work, but it was so worth it.

195
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:18,699
And I will say, that you better believe,

196
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,423
that every one of my family
members is getting one

197
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:22,325
of these for Christmas.
- Totally!

198
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:24,021
Christmas present, we have it!

199
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:28,529
- All my cousins, like, oh,
I've got my daily calender.

200
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:31,250
- I think it's cool and
the boys are so cute too.

201
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,725
So yes, link down below
in the description.

202
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,086
Go get your calender!

203
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,636
Look what we have, Ollie!

204
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,552
It's our calender!

205
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:38,705
- [Missy] Isn't that cool?

206
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:41,530
- Wait, that's our cereal!

207
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,634
- [Missy] That's cereal.

208
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:44,073
- [Bryan] That's us in bed, huh?

209
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:45,792
- Pancakes!
- Pancakes!

210
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,115
- [Bryan] Yeah, isn't that cool, Ollie?

211
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,803
It's our first calender.

212
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:51,261
- Hey guys, we should go swimming.

213
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,357
- You wanna go swimming?

214
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:55,452
- You wanna do the polar plunge again?

215
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:56,925
- Just go swimming.

216
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,496
- If you guys didn't see yesterday's vlog,

217
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:02,486
Ollie jumped in a freezing
cold swimming pool, didn't you?

218
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:03,793
That was crazy.
- How cold was it, Ollie?

219
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:04,962
- Yeah, how cold was it?

220
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,247
- Really cold!

221
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:07,828
(Missy laughing)

222
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,249
- [Bryan] There you have
it, you heard it first.

223
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:12,833
- [Missy] All right, showing
my parents the calender.

224
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,954
- It's so pretty!

225
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:15,912
- [Missy] So cute, right?

226
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,443
You're getting one for Christmas.

227
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:18,276
- [Bryan] Yeah, you guys are putting that

228
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:19,199
in your bedroom, right?

229
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,262
Or your kitchen?

230
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:22,127
- Well, yeah.
- Hallway, both?

231
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,112
- All over the house.

232
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,851
- [Missy] Every room will have a calender.

233
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,253
- It's so cute, look at that.

234
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:30,038
- The colors are amazing,
they're so vibrant.

235
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:31,110
These are the cutest people ever.

236
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,001
- You managed to work a
chicken in to it, huh?

237
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,765
You managed to work a chicken in?

238
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,597
- [Missy] Our chickens are there.

239
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,550
- [Bryan] And my cactus.

240
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:37,384
(laughing)

241
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,467
- Oh, look at that!
- Isn't that cool?

242
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,162
- Wow!
- Is that you?

243
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:45,874
- [Missy] Okay you gotta keep it like this

244
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:46,880
so they won't see it.

245
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,593
- All right, it's a surprise.

246
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:50,902
- [Missy] What do you think of that one?

247
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:52,782
- That's so cute.

248
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,652
- Is that you?

249
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:55,151
Who's that?
- Dada!

250
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,681
- Yeah, who's that?
- Mama!

251
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:58,764
- Who's that?

252
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:01,448
- Chick.

253
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,707
- Chickens!

254
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:03,856
Now you guys know there's a chicken.

255
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,438
- [Missy] Yeah!

256
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:07,938
What'd you guys find?
- A frog!

257
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:12,085
- [Missy's Dad] Be very gentle.

258
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,085
- [Missy] What, are you scared, Finn?

259
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:16,926
Oh my goodness!

260
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:19,843
Are you gonna hold it?
- No, no, no!

261
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:22,854
- He'll jump right in your
face if you're not careful!

262
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,199
- [Missy] I know!

263
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,776
- Don't point him at me!

264
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:27,070
(laughing)
(dog barking)

265
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,792
- [Missy] That is such a cool one.

266
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,042
(laughing)

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,393
(yelling excitedly)

268
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:37,082
Finn, Finn hold it!

269
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,050
It's crawling up Papa!

270
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,315
- Slow down, slow, gentle with him.

271
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,148
Don't scare him.

272
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:44,161
- [Missy] Grab him, good job.

273
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:46,274
- Oh!
(laughing)

274
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:48,373
He was jumping on you!

275
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:49,422
He gave you kisses!

276
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,601
(Missy laughing)

277
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,321
- I'm not gonna hold that!

278
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,337
I'm gonna run away!

279
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,497
- You kissed a frog!

280
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,404
He looks kind of like a tree frog.

281
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:01,297
- [Missy] Wow, he's a jumper.

282
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:02,130
- He is.

283
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:05,689
(screams in surprise)

284
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,459
(laughing)

285
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:08,817
Don't point him at me!

286
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,810
(boys laughing)

287
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,244
- [Missy] Oh gosh, I'm pretty
sure you kissed the frog.

288
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,391
Did it kiss you?

289
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,310
Finn, can you pet him?

290
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,143
- No.

291
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:19,303
- [Missy] Can you give him a little pet?

292
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:21,470
(screams)

293
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:24,695
- It scared him.

294
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:25,705
- [Missy's Mom] Is that a tree frog?

295
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:26,538
- [Missy] Yeah.

296
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,132
- Oh, it's a tree frog.

297
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:29,472
(screams)

298
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,283
He almost got me!

299
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:33,493
- [Missy] Look at him crawling up.

300
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,861
- [Ollie] He's climbing,
he's climbing, he's climbing!

301
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:37,539
- [Missy] He is climbing, huh?

302
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,061
He's like Spiderman.

303
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,358
Show it to daddy.

304
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,754
Grab it.

305
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:43,195
- [Bryan] That's a big frog.

306
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:44,869
- [Missy's Mom] That's a tree frog.

307
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:47,313
- Aw, look at how cute he is.

308
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,907
Oh my gosh, look at that!

309
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:51,557
Why is he wet, is he peeing on me?

310
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,837
- No!
- No, he already peed.

311
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:54,996
(laughing)

312
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:56,163
Earlier today.

313
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:58,931
- He's so cute.
- Aww, I know!

314
00:10:58,931 --> 00:10:59,764
I wanna take a picture.

315
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:03,124
- You want him on your spoon?
- Oh no, don't eat him!

316
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:04,507
- I'm not gonna eat him!

317
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:08,299
- [Missy's Dad] All right, don't eat him.

318
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:09,132
(laughing)
- Stop!

319
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:10,595
- Just kidding.
- You're so funny, Ollie.

320
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:11,512
Oh my gosh.

321
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,872
- [Missy's Dad] He's gonna
jump right in your mouth man.

322
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:17,047
Slow down!

323
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,068
- He's like oh I don't want
him to jump in my mouth.

324
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,954
- I do not want that to happen.

325
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:22,643
- Let's put him up on the.
- Look he can sit right there.

326
00:11:22,643 --> 00:11:24,069
- [Missy's Dad] In his own trees.

327
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:25,729
- [Missy's Mom] He's like,
"These are the driest trees

328
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:26,745
"I've ever touched."

329
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:29,878
- What a cool looking frog.
- Yeah, he's really cool.

330
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:32,445
- [Bryan] Oh, that was quite a jump!

331
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:33,755
Wow, he really does jump.

332
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:36,338
(upbeat music)

333
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,713
- All right guys, something just happened.

334
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,728
Finn has been saying
he needs to go poo poo,

335
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:44,620
and so I figured he did go poop,

336
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,570
but I just checked, and he hadn't.

337
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,942
And so Ollie is trying to
show him the big boy potty.

338
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,369
You gonna go check it out, Finn?

339
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,025
- [Ollie] Hey Finn, let me show you.

340
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:52,964
- [Missy] Go turn the light on.

341
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:56,298
- Like that.
- Oh that's how you sit on it?

342
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,277
Turn the light on so he's not scared.

343
00:11:58,277 --> 00:11:59,702
All right, show him how to sit on it.

344
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,499
So basically you put that down,

345
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:04,056
the little seat, and then you just sit.

346
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,125
You think you can do that?
- Yeah.

347
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,531
- [Bryan] You can do that Finn, go ahead.

348
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:08,846
- Go ahead.
- Just go, just go!

349
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,755
- I'll help you.

350
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:11,588
All done!

351
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:12,956
- Mama's trying, you wanna try?

352
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:14,115
- [Missy] You wanna try?

353
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:16,697
- No.
- It's so comfy, are you sure?

354
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:19,494
- He's tried it a couple
times, he sits on it.

355
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:21,747
Oh is that what you do?

356
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:25,320
- (laughs) Yeah!

357
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,407
- All right, kids are finally asleep.

358
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:31,422
Usually bedtime is not a big deal at all,

359
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:35,339
but both kids were just
not feeling it tonight.

360
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:40,112
- I laid Ollie down, and he
put his arms around my neck,

361
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,349
so I was laying him
down, and I just let go

362
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:44,135
and came back up and he
was still attached to me.

363
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:45,266
I was like, okay.

364
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,099
(laughs)

365
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,772
- Yeah, it's really not usually that hard,

366
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:51,222
but they were just not gonna sleep tonight

367
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:54,256
and so Finn was super tough
and Ollie was really hard

368
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,770
and I don't know, I guess it
was just one of those days.

369
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,604
- I feel like it's mostly school days

370
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:00,410
when Ollie doesn't see me a lot.

371
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,243
- [Missy] Yeah.

372
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:04,582
- At night he just clings to me.

373
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:06,928
- It could be that, he
also did nap at school

374
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:08,515
which I think he never naps,

375
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:10,329
so when he naps at
school you better believe

376
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,273
he's probably not gonna want
to sleep at night, at bedtime.

377
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:16,182
And Finn, actually, didn't
sleep well the night before,

378
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,646
but he took a two hour nap today.

379
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:20,955
So I think he also, I think
we just both were like,

380
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:22,635
"Oh cool, they both got naps,"

381
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,567
but now they're not gonna sleep.

382
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:27,289
So kind of a bummer, but
they're finally asleep.

383
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,020
We win, we always win boys.

384
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,526
I don't know why you fight us.

385
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:35,355
But yeah, we are so ready
to just relax for the night

386
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,020
and just watch some T.V.

387
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,408
We're actually hanging
out in Bryan's office.

388
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:42,046
Luna is chilling right over there.

389
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:43,553
She's not even gonna poke her head up.

390
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:44,720
She's so out of it.

391
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,717
I feel so bad for her.

392
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:49,816
She's still just totally
loopy and kind of just like

393
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:51,763
"What's going on", so I feel so bad.

394
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,916
But hopefully she starts
to feel better by tomorrow.

395
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,197
But anyways, I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video

396
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:59,368
and don't forget to get
one of these calendars.

397
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:01,151
- Get yourself a calendar
before they're gone.

398
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,789
- Aren't they so cute?

399
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:06,047
Make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up

400
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:09,614
if you enjoyed it and we'll
see you guys tomorrow.

401
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:10,447
Bye, boop.

402
00:14:11,681 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat bright music)
