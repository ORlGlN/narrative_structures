1
00:00:00,546 --> 00:00:02,546
- It is Finn's birthday!

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:06,410
(Missy cheers)

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,945
- That was so sad.

4
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:09,979
He's always so happy to be there,

5
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:12,038
he always gives me a hug and a kiss,

6
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:13,386
and then he's off playing with

7
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:15,028
his friends, and it's always so cute.

8
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:17,419
But this time, he was crying.

9
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,111
- You have a decision to make, right here,

10
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:23,017
on the first day of being
two years old, okay?

11
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:24,638
Are you gonna be terrible, or are

12
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:25,959
you gonna be a good two year old?

13
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,065
♫ This is our life, this is our fun

14
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:31,883
♫ This is who we are, this is our dream

15
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:35,440
♫ This is our team, shot among the stars

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,823
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

17
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:40,782
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

18
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:42,352
♫ This is our life

19
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:44,345
♫ Let's live it

20
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,045
♫ Live it forever

21
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:46,878
- Cheese!

22
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:49,741
Good morning!

23
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,041
- [Missy] What are we doing?

24
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,670
- Going to school!

25
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,255
- [Missy] Yay, are you excited?

26
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,387
- Yeah.

27
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:58,053
- Yep, it's another day, and that means

28
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:01,861
it is school time, and we're excited!

29
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,980
Are you excited to see your
teacher, and all your friends?

30
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,605
He only goes to school two days a week.

31
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:07,756
On those days, he is very excited.

32
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:10,986
He usually misses all his friends
and teachers so much, huh?

33
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:12,221
Alright, let's head to school.

34
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:13,850
That was so sad.

35
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,898
I have always dropped off Ollie,

36
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:18,288
and he's always so happy to be there,

37
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,267
he always gives me a hug and a kiss,

38
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:21,645
and then he's off playing with

39
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:23,247
his friends, and it's always so cute.

40
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:26,857
But this time, he was crying
and he was so sad, and

41
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:29,195
it's so weird, because literally
going into the classroom,

42
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:31,752
he was like, oh I'm so
excited to see my teacher,

43
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:35,301
and then I dropped him off and
he was just clinging to me,

44
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:37,721
was like, I don't want you to
leave, and he started crying.

45
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:38,627
And it was so sad.

46
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:42,363
He's never ever like that,
so I don't know if something

47
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:46,880
is going on in his classroom,
that he hasn't told us.

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,441
And then maybe he forgot, and then

49
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,983
he got there, then he just realized it.

50
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,794
But he said his teacher and
it's never really like that,

51
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:53,992
and that he did cry last Thursday

52
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:55,280
when my Dad dropped him off,

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,361
because he didn't hear my Dad say bye.

54
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:00,985
So maybe he just kind of
remembered that feeling?

55
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:03,137
I'm not really sure, but it kind of sad.

56
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:05,407
I felt really bad, but I
think Payton just got there,

57
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:06,990
and Payton's always like his best friend,

58
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,752
and I think he'll be happy to see her,

59
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,691
and they can kind of hang out together,

60
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:13,422
and it will feel like home I guess.

61
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:17,571
- So today is a special day,
if you guys do not know,

62
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,404
it is Finn's birthday!

63
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:23,725
(Missy cheering)

64
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,791
He's two babe!

65
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,369
- He's two; he's officially two!

66
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:30,272
- Officially, it is
terribly two's, huh Finn?

67
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,105
- [Finn] Uh huh.

68
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:32,627
- Uh huh.
- Are you gonna be terrible?

69
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,692
So this one it's two!
- Two!

70
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:36,025
- Take that one!

71
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,054
- We're still teaching him
how to hold up two fingers.

72
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:42,387
Yes, that's right, you're two years old.

73
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,299
And what are you.

74
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,060
What's in your mouth right now?

75
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,893
- [Missy] Gum.

76
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:48,156
- You're chewing on gum?

77
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:51,239
You're not old enough to chew on gum!

78
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,149
I love you so much buddy!

79
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:59,732
This kid has so much
life and love to give,

80
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:03,540
and he just loves exploring and playing

81
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,477
and I just love the little
boy that he's turning into.

82
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,195
It's so cute, huh!

83
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:09,028
- [Missy] Cute.

84
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:10,661
- [Bryan] Oh look at this,
adventurous right there.

85
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,851
- [Missy] He has birthday
presents to open.

86
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:13,503
- [Bryan] You got some
birthday presents to open?

87
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:14,543
- Ah!

88
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:18,046
- I know, I see you chewing
gum; terrible twos have begun.

89
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,516
The terrible twos, do
you guys remember that,

90
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:20,848
with Ollie?
- Yeah, with Ollie.

91
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:21,936
- There were some definite moments,

92
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,096
when Ollie was two years
old, I was like, wow!

93
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:24,929
- Yeah.

94
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,542
- [Bryan] They do not
prepare you for this.

95
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:27,701
- [Missy] He is already, definitely--

96
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:29,477
- He's definitely feisty, huh?

97
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,228
Are you feisty?

98
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:32,906
You have a decision to make, right here,

99
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:36,802
on the first day of being
two years old, okay.

100
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:38,429
Are you gonna be terrible, or are

101
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:39,763
you gonna be a good two year old?

102
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,732
- Um, ba ah ah!

103
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:42,827
- He has so much to say right now.

104
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,843
He's telling you guys a story right now.

105
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:47,171
- [Missy] Are you gonna
be terrible, or good.

106
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,004
- Good.

107
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:48,991
- Good?
- Good!

108
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,068
- Good.
(Missy cheering)

109
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:52,402
- Alright, we're gonna hold
you to that birthday boy!

110
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:53,803
(laughing)

111
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:56,372
So today, on Twitter, we
asked you guys to share

112
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:58,543
some of your favorite moments
from Finn, on the vlog,

113
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:00,055
with the #happybirthdayfinn.

114
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:03,235
We got so many good ones,
and I have a feeling

115
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:05,070
we're about to get
emotional right now, but,

116
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,916
before you guys watch
this awesome montage,

117
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,710
leave in the comments below,

118
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,043
what is your favorite moment of Finn,

119
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,343
and be sure to wish him
a very happy birthday.

120
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,836
Shall we run the montage?

121
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:16,451
- [Missy] Say hit it!

122
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,284
- Hit it!

123
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:18,824
(laughter)

124
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,407
(somber music)

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,901
- [Bryan] Uh oh you
guys, the terrible twos

126
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,293
have officially begun!

127
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:23,177
Finn is screaming crying, because
he wants a Batman cupcake.

128
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,300
You really want one?

129
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,146
- Yes!

130
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:26,402
- [Bryan] And it has to be Batman?

131
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:27,472
- Yes.

132
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,490
- [Bryan] Okay, happy birthday!

133
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,505
I love you.

134
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:31,474
- Dah dah.

135
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:33,348
- [Bryan] What do you say?

136
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:34,420
Say thank you.

137
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,491
- Thank you dada.

138
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:39,113
- His speech is getting so much clearer,

139
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:41,114
like he just said thank you dada.

140
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:43,810
That's so cute, but yes, I do fear

141
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,782
that the terrible twos
have begun with Finn.

142
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:48,878
It was a little crazy with
Ollie, and I have a feeling

143
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:50,312
it's gonna be the same with him too.

144
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:52,660
So, it's gonna be a fun year, honestly.

145
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,782
Can you get it?

146
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:55,543
- I took this off, and he's really mad.

147
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:56,436
Do you want me to take it off?

148
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:57,269
- No!

149
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:58,127
- Okay, you do it!

150
00:05:58,127 --> 00:05:59,126
(Finn crying)

151
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,483
He's trying to stick it back on.

152
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,768
- [Bryan] You have to
take it off to eat it bro!

153
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:05,271
Do you see how conflicted he is?

154
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,861
- Now we have to give him a new one.

155
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,040
- [Bryan] It is soiled.

156
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,935
(rhythmic music)

157
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,316
- Look what came you guys!

158
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:17,740
I got samples of the
brand-new Tribe shirts.

159
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,563
Look at this all over color print.

160
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:24,097
I love it, and it's got
the Tribe logo on it.

161
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,318
And then we also have them in youth sizes,

162
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:28,760
and I believe onesies, as
well, just with the Tribe logo.

163
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,761
We weren't able to do the whole color

164
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:34,936
all over the youth sizes, but
the adult ones look amazing.

165
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,363
Look at that you guys, that's so cool.

166
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,214
So if you guys want to nab
yourself a Tribe shirt,

167
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:41,164
head on over to dailybumpsmerch.com.

168
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,318
Check out what we got,

169
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,585
we got some cool stuff there for you guys.

170
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:44,974
- [Aunt] What's up dude?

171
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,057
- [Missy] Oh my goodness!

172
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:48,908
- [Aunt] How are you?

173
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,457
- [Aunt] Hi, I'm the aunt.

174
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,080
- So me and my Dad just ran into

175
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,248
a thrift store, and we
got a bunch of goodies,

176
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,088
for our haunted maze that we're doing

177
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:00,080
for our Halloween party,
and I'm so excited.

178
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,862
And look what I had to
buy, about 40 VHS's.

179
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:04,965
I guess you're gonna have to find out

180
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:08,427
later what this is for, but
I am super excited about it.

181
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,750
It was actually kind of
funny, and I don't know why,

182
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,857
what the lady was thinking
when I was buying 40 of these,

183
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:15,491
but she was like you're about to have

184
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:17,704
a really cool movie night.

185
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:21,650
I tried to buy as many
dumb movies as possible.

186
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,743
Sometimes you just have to get a good one,

187
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,892
like Liar, Liar! (laughing)

188
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:27,644
No, there are some good ones in here too.

189
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:28,900
- We may rescue a couple.

190
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,733
- Yeah.

191
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,674
- Maybe have a few rescues in there.

192
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:31,979
- Maybe, maybe.

193
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,594
- What's up dude?

194
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:34,525
How was school?

195
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:35,358
- Good.

196
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:36,406
- Good, you eatin' one of the cupcakes

197
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,584
from Finn's superhero birthday party?

198
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,417
- Mm-hmm.

199
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,250
- How's it taste?

200
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,139
- Good.
- Good?

201
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,620
How was school,
- Good.

202
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,633
good, did you take a nap?

203
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:44,566
- No.

204
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,004
- No, you didn't take a nap today?

205
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:46,837
- Mm-mm.

206
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:48,128
- Alright, but you had fun?
- Mm-hmm.

207
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,028
- What'd you learn about?

208
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:50,208
- The letter U.

209
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,341
- U, oh that's so cool!

210
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,294
Like umbrella?

211
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:54,127
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:55,023
- And unicorn?

213
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:56,778
- And underpants!

214
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:58,069
(laughing)

215
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,811
- So Finn got this birthday card

216
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:02,048
at his birthday party, from the Johnson's,

217
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,258
and I don't know if he's seen it yet.

218
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:04,091
Hang on.

219
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:08,841
♫ To the right, to the right,
to the right, to the right

220
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:11,030
Look at these farm
animals, they're dancing!

221
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,986
(laughter)

222
00:08:12,986 --> 00:08:14,601
- Is that cute?

223
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,098
Ollie picked this card out for you.

224
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:17,100
Do you want to open this one?

225
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,407
- This is from me.

226
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:21,527
- [Bryan] Yep, Ollie picked
this card out just for you Finn.

227
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,571
Oh, look at him opening it, that's cute.

228
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,404
(Bryan laughs)

229
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,584
- Da thank you!

230
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:26,492
(laughter)

231
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:27,749
- Da thank you!

232
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,672
- [Bryan] What'd you get
Finn, what'd you get?

233
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:30,505
Who is it?

234
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,751
Ollie, he loves it!

235
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,602
- Birthday hugs to you,
let's see what it says.

236
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,457
Mickey Mouse has come to play,

237
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:43,349
and have some fun with you today.

238
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,704
And something else he's coming to do,

239
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:47,948
is bring a birthday hug for you.

240
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:50,437
- [Bryan] Ah, so you've got
to give him a big hug Ollie!

241
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:51,810
- Happy birthday, Finn.

242
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,066
- You want me to take this off for you?

243
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,470
- It's so cool, Ollie,
picked this out, all himself,

244
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,882
and it's a card that
has a little bracelet,

245
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:00,277
that he can wear, and then it

246
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:02,065
plays the Hot Diggity Dog song.

247
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:03,475
I was like, that's so cool!

248
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,096
And those dancing animals, huh?

249
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,271
Ah, that's so cool.

250
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:10,039
All these crazy cards now
days, I think it's so funny.

251
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,960
Look it, he can't even
focus, he's so loving this.

252
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,256
Ollie, you did a good job dude!

253
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:16,946
- Hey, is that a bracelet?

254
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,772
- Yeah, he wears it and it
plays the music from the card?

255
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:20,640
- [Missy] Look at momma's.

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,988
- [Bryan] Oh, you guys are matching!

257
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:24,167
- [Missy] Look at this!

258
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,220
- [Bryan] Hey Finn, guess what!

259
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,228
We have more presents; you
wanna open some more presents?

260
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,061
There they are!

261
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:29,894
- [Missy] You want to open it?

262
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:32,354
- [Bryan] Yes, Finn is
obsessed with Batman,

263
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,118
so they're all wrapped in Batman.

264
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,778
Here you go buddy, do you want to open it?

265
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:39,278
There you go; what is it, Finn what is it?

266
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:43,985
He needs his music, so he can
dance and unwrap his present.

267
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:45,772
Are you kidding me right now?

268
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:48,216
Karma's gonna help, Karma's gonna help.

269
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,567
Grab this right here, there you go.

270
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,538
- [Missy] Ollie, you want to help too?

271
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:51,371
- [Bryan] Go ahead.

272
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:52,612
How many humans and animals

273
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:54,388
does it take to open a birthday present?

274
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:55,721
Whoa, Finn look!

275
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,778
It's Cars Thunder Hollow, that's so cool!

276
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:05,622
We got another one; this is from Ollie.

277
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:06,455
Who is it?

278
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:07,475
- [Missy] What is it?

279
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:08,894
Batman!

280
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:13,845
- [Bryan] Whoa, Finn, punch
him, punch him in the chest.

281
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,390
Hard!

282
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,855
(toy growls)

283
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:20,886
(laughing) Isn't that so funny, Finn.

284
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,513
- I think he's done with it.

285
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:27,411
- He's like yay, a toy I
can actually wrestle with.

286
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,879
Go for it Finn, open him up, open him up.

287
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,369
What do you see, what do you see?

288
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,250
What do you see, what do you see?

289
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,752
Whoa!

290
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:35,585
- Cars!

291
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,136
- [Bryan] More cars,
from the Cars 3 movie.

292
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:44,584
That's so cool, and a
storage case for them all.

293
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:45,905
- [Missy] Yay.

294
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:49,574
- Aha, the boys love the new Cars 3 movie.

295
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:50,896
Finn was watching it this morning.

296
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:51,850
Ollie was watching it this morning.

297
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,995
It like just came out.

298
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,079
What'd you get, what'd you get?

299
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:55,996
Let me see!

300
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:59,651
Whoa, that's so cool!

301
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:00,734
What'd you get Ollie?

302
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:01,600
- Mater!

303
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,517
- Ah, cool!

304
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,605
That's gonna be so fun for them.

305
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:07,453
They love cars and racing and stuff.

306
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:08,286
It's so cute.

307
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:09,425
- Yay!

308
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,268
- [Bryan] Happy birthday
Finn, I love you buddy.

309
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:15,638
- We love you so much,
huh, can I have a kiss?

310
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:17,504
(upbeat music)

311
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,889
- Alright, we've got the whole fam,

312
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:21,291
and we, well besides Kathy, auntie,

313
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,703
we are are headed into a
super fun pumpkin patch.

314
00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:24,957
It's a lot different
than the pumpkin patch

315
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:26,574
that we went to the other day.

316
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:29,092
It's more of like a bouncy house, fun one,

317
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:32,471
and the boys are so excited, huh Finney?

318
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:34,733
I told Bryan, we have to
go to this pumpkin patch,

319
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,220
because this is the one we've
been taking the boys to,

320
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,387
and they always have a picture
called How Tall This Fall.

321
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:42,791
It's so cute, I love it, I love.

322
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,922
We took Finn when he
was just a few days old,

323
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:50,278
for the How Tall This Fall
picture, and now he's two.

324
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,945
(lighthearted guitar music)

325
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,738
- So we're at Hunter's Pumpkin patch.

326
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:03,474
We come here every year, and every year

327
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:07,058
they have the coolest blow-up jumpers.

328
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:09,808
Look at this giant crocodile one.

329
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,926
Ollie, have you ever seen a huge

330
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:18,978
crocodile, bigger than our house?

331
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:19,868
- No.

332
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,201
- [Bryan] Well look at this.

333
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:26,070
Isn't that crazy?

334
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,064
- Can you jump in it?

335
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:28,306
- [Bryan] I don't know.

336
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,826
That's a huge gator though, huh?

337
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,805
- Yeah, he's got sharp teeth.

338
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:34,314
- [Bryan] Yeah, he's got some sharp teeth.

339
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,736
Look it, he keeps him clean too, huh.

340
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:37,569
- Yeah.

341
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:38,402
- [Bryan] Do you think
he brushes his teeth?

342
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:39,235
- No.

343
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:42,485
- [Bryan] No? (laughs)

344
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,749
Nice!

345
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,332
How tall this fall.

346
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:56,244
- [Missy] Whoa.

347
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:58,508
- [Bryan] Wow Ollie, you're
almost six feet tall!

348
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:00,008
How bout you Finn?

349
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:13,663
- Am I a bird?

350
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:16,622
- [Bryan] You're a scarecrow! (laughs)

351
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:17,591
- A scarecrow?

352
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:20,841
- [Bryan] Yeah, now Finn's a scarecrow.

353
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:40,067
- [Missy] Alright, Finn is
about to do the obstacle course.

354
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,067
Go Finn go, go Finn go!

355
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,728
He's gotta climb up the ladder.

356
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:45,645
Go Finn go!

357
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:48,924
Up the ladder, down the slide.

358
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,674
Come on Finn, woohoo!

359
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:53,274
Where is he?

360
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:59,150
Finn, where are, there he
is, he's coming through!

361
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,192
You did it!

362
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,642
Do you wanna go again?

363
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,475
- Yeah.

364
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,975
- [Missy] Okay, one more time.

365
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:47,437
- [Bryan] Look at this big
kid we have now you guys!

366
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:49,033
He's doing so good.

367
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:49,930
- [Female] Watch where you're going!

368
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,615
- [Bryan] Whoa!

369
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,282
You're so good dude!

370
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:56,956
- And that's a wrap!

371
00:14:56,956 --> 00:15:01,123
The boys are in bed, we had
such a fun day, it was so good.

372
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,611
Finn is absolutely in love with

373
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:07,038
his cars, and he hasn't even opened

374
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,337
the main part of it.
- The main one.

375
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,724
I bet they would love Hot Wheels.

376
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:11,557
- Oh yeah.

377
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:12,390
- They're really cool, I was always

378
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,543
into Hot Wheels growing up too.

379
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:14,439
- So was I!

380
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,272
- Really?

381
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:17,348
- Yeah, we always had to get
Hot Wheels when we were kids.

382
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:18,181
- Yeah.

383
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:20,341
- They are gonna be so excited,

384
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:21,783
well especially Finn, but even Ollie,

385
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:24,874
is gonna be so excited when
we put it all together.

386
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:26,199
Then they can actually race and stuff.

387
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,593
The kids are in bed, so
I think we're gonna go

388
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,580
ahead and--
- They got a good workout at

389
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,779
that pumpkin patch.

390
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:30,962
They both went to bed.

391
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:33,063
- Yeah, they were exhausted. (laughing)

392
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:34,552
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

393
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:36,574
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did,

394
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:38,410
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

395
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,243
Bye!
- Bye!

396
00:15:40,083 --> 00:00:00,000
(soft fun music)
