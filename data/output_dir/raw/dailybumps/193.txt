00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:18,940
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be

2
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:23,458
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset

3
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:27,981
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

4
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:31,020
♫ This is home

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,997
♫ Just running around
you never looked so cute

6
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:38,586
♫ Hugging you tight
cuddling all I could singing

7
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:41,647
♫ I am home

8
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:45,480
♫ Home forever you're with me

9
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,742
- That's right, good morning guys.

10
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:52,575
We have got--

11
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:55,325
- That's right good morning guys.

12
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:58,897
- We've got a really
fun vlog for you today--

13
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:02,843
- We've got a really
fun blog for you today.

14
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:04,982
- Okay, can you stop copying me please?

15
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,726
- Can you stop copying me please.

16
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,585
- I asked you first.
- I asked you first.

17
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:12,449
- No you didn't.
- No you didn't.

18
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,599
- Stop copying me.
- Stop copying me.

19
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,073
- I have to start the vlog,
you're slowing things down.

20
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:20,755
- Start the vlog, you're
slowing things down.

21
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,085
- Think you're funny, do ya?

22
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,394
- Think you're funny, do ya?

23
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:26,334
- Well you're just a dumb hamster.

24
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:29,001
- Well you're just a dumb human.

25
00:01:30,697 --> 00:01:32,197
- That's so weird.

26
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:35,997
- Morning.
- Good morning.

27
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:38,064
What are you doing today?

28
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,621
- I'm eating a peanut butter and jelly,

29
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,621
and having this crystal.

30
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:47,167
- Oh, this is the inside
of a fidget spinner.

31
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,354
Did you know that, so you
can put it in your fingers

32
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:49,248
and you can spin it.

33
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:52,463
- I'm pretending (mumbles)
to be the crystal.

34
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:53,868
- Oh, you're pretending it's the crystal?

35
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:54,701
- Yeah.

36
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:58,052
- That is so cute, I love
watching him play with his toys

37
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,706
and like make up little voices and like

38
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:03,326
scenes and stuff with all
his toys, it's so cute.

39
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,917
Are you having fun?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,448
- [Bryan] So we have Woody and Buzz

41
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:09,839
in a Paw Patrol car, right?

42
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,672
- [Oliver] Yeah, this is the --

43
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,835
- [Bryan] We have the Popup Pirate guy.

44
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,449
- [Oliver] This is the bad guy.

45
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:16,427
- [Bryan] We have a Minion working out.

46
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,775
- [Oliver] This one's a bad guy too.

47
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:18,640
- [Bryan] Oh, that's the bad guy?

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,473
- [Oliver] Yeah.

49
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,328
- [Bryan] And then we have a dinosaur car.

50
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:24,174
- This is a good guy too.

51
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:26,451
This one's a good guy and
this one's a good guy.

52
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:27,729
- [Bryan] You are such
a cool four year old,

53
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,636
do you know that?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:31,640
- It's also so weird
calling him a four year old.

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,881
He's four years old now
you guys, it's crazy.

56
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:35,714
You know that?

57
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:38,412
He's like, dad, can you stop
getting emotional please?

58
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:41,526
- Alright, it has been
kind of a crazy morning

59
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:44,573
but it is now time to
go shopping for dinner.

60
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:46,060
I really wanted to make
something yummy tonight

61
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,241
because me and Kelsey are so excited

62
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,343
for Outlander tonight.

63
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:51,126
- I know, I cannot wait.

64
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:52,712
- If you guys don't know I
am obsessed with Outlander,

65
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:54,158
I've talked about it for years now,

66
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:55,598
they're starting their
third season tonight

67
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:57,055
and I thought it'd be really fun

68
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,962
to make like, a yummy like meal that--

69
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,411
- We're making this an event, okay.

70
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:02,796
- Yeah, it's an event.

71
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:04,886
It's not probably like, a
Scottish meal or anything

72
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,746
but I thought it sounded yummy

73
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:09,472
so we're gonna get the
ingredients for dinner.

74
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:12,634
Yeah, hopefully I can make
something good to eat.

75
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,109
We'll se how it turns out.

76
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,964
- Hey Ollie.
(laughing)

77
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,174
What are you doing?

78
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:20,585
- Playing with toys you silly squirrel.

79
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:23,259
(laughing)

80
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,832
- Alright, we went to the store,

81
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:27,429
I think we got all of the ingredients.

82
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,316
I've never made this meal before

83
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:30,746
so I don't know how it's gonna turn out

84
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,747
but now we are definitely
in need for Starbucks.

85
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:37,003
So we're gonna run in
and get some Starbucks.

86
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:37,836
Sounds so good.

87
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:39,333
I actually haven't eaten lunch today,

88
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,273
probably should do that.

89
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:42,587
But--
- It's too late.

90
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:45,561
- Starbucks sounds good,
I'll just have dinner later.

91
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:49,728
- (garbled singing) This is home.

92
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:58,841
- Filming for a new episode
of our Facebook show today.

93
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,644
We are reacting to a very,

94
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:04,503
well actually, Ollie is
reacting to a very old,

95
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:05,422
funny video of himself.

96
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:06,474
- It's gonna be really cute.

97
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:07,307
- It's gonna be really cute

98
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:08,756
and it's gonna be for Episode Two of

99
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:09,896
The Fantastic Family Time Machine

100
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,558
and we'll let you guys
know when that's up.

101
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:12,866
But that's what we're working on today.

102
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,175
Ollie, what did you do to your foot?

103
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:17,128
- Oh my god, blood.

104
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:18,245
- [Bryan] You got some blood on it?

105
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,125
Did you hit it on something?

106
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,879
- [Oliver] On the chair, I falled.

107
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,319
- [Missy] Oh, that's when
you fell off the chair?

108
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,910
- [Bryan] It's not that bad though.

109
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,172
Momma's gotta put on just
a little band aid, okay?

110
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:33,022
- He's actually, typically a
pretty afraid of band aids.

111
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,776
- [Bryan] Pretty anti-band aid?

112
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:35,906
- [Oliver] I like this one,

113
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:37,820
I don't like other band aids.

114
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,766
- [Missy] Oh yeah, I like when
they have characters on them.

115
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,053
- Yeah.
- Okay.

116
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,825
Also I'm like, um, you have a band aid

117
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,311
because I don't want you to get
blood all over my stuff, so.

118
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,932
(laughing)
- There you go buddy.

119
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:48,799
- [Missy] Here, let me put one more

120
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:51,020
so it can go all the way around your toe.

121
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,404
- [Bryan] It'll make
you feel better, okay.

122
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:54,808
Don't be afraid, it's okay.

123
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:59,261
- [Missy] Okay, so we'll
just put this there,

124
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,299
bring it around.

125
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,191
- [Bryan] There you go.

126
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,561
You gotta put band aids on
when you cut yourself, okay.

127
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:07,261
Because it'll help.

128
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:08,377
- All better, okay.

129
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:09,448
- [Bryan] Now go play dude.

130
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,302
- He's like (gasping).

131
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:13,102
(incoherent baby talk)

132
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:14,489
- You need a bib aid?

133
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:15,513
Let me see your toe.

134
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,312
- [Oliver] (mumbles) have an owie.

135
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,145
- [Missy] You know he doesn't

136
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,652
but we can just put a
little something on there.

137
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,609
You want it down there?

138
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:21,733
- Yeah.

139
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,593
- Finn always has to
have whatever Ollie has

140
00:05:23,593 --> 00:05:24,915
so we're in this stage right now

141
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:26,653
where if we buy Ollie something

142
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:29,540
you better buy the same
exact thing for Finn.

143
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,475
Do not buy anything different.

144
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:33,655
- Yeah, he always wants
what Ollie has, huh?

145
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:36,043
Alright, let's get it on there.

146
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,025
There, all better.

147
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,723
(kissing noise) That better?

148
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:40,758
- Yeah.

149
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,258
- Yeah, can Momma have a kiss?

150
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,421
- [Bryan] Wow, Missy.

151
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:52,588
Such technique and art and
beauty and pie crust making.

152
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,809
- [Missy] I'm honestly
impressed with myself, you know.

153
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:57,124
- [Bryan] This is
beautiful, look at the way

154
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,526
it flows in the pie pan.

155
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,783
Yeah, your pie crust
looks beautiful, babe.

156
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:05,373
Looks amazing and homemade.

157
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:06,643
Put so much work into it.

158
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:08,487
- [Missy] I worked so hard on it.

159
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:09,560
- [Bryan] I know.

160
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,108
- Bryan.
- I know.

161
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:14,968
- So officially I am
making chicken pot pie,

162
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:17,417
which I have never made but I'm excited.

163
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:18,250
I think it's gonna be good.

164
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,557
Bryan was like, I really wanna
try to make chicken pot pie

165
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:23,050
and I was like, I think my
mom's made it a few times

166
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,421
and it was really good.

167
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,027
So I think it's pretty simple.

168
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:29,149
You basically just mix a bunch
of vegetables with chicken

169
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:31,122
and cream of chicken, put it into a pie,

170
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:34,279
pop a pie crust on it and there you go.

171
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,537
Hopefully, I'm gonna
experiment with a couple

172
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,381
different recipes.

173
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:42,030
I really wanna use
Bisquick as the pie topping

174
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,082
because I think it'll be like
a really yummy, crispy top,

175
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:47,316
but kind of like, bready
that sounds good to me.

176
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:49,863
So, gonna cook up some chicken now,

177
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:51,715
and mix it all together.

178
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:54,465
(soothing music)

179
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,323
- Spotted these boys
playing in the fountain.

180
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,272
Did you pick Momma flowers?

181
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,513
Alright, I have something
to say about the flowers.

182
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,188
I think it's super cute
that you pick flowers

183
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,137
for girls and stuff, but those
flowers are really gross.

184
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:41,829
They smell, they have the grossest smell

185
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,199
and they bring them inside the house.

186
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,356
- [Oliver] Oh yeah.

187
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:45,265
- [Bryan] You smell it?

188
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,515
Smell it.
- Yep.

189
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,263
- [Bryan] They're yucky, huh?

190
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:51,402
- Uh huh, I'm gonna throw it on top.

191
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:53,414
- [Bryan] Okay, you can
throw it, it's okay.

192
00:07:53,414 --> 00:07:56,653
Let's go find some flowers
that don't smell, okay.

193
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:58,012
Look at this random flower.

194
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,094
Actually that's kind of beautiful.

195
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:01,322
I didn't know I had a flower there.

196
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:03,325
Ollie, I think Momma would
really like this one.

197
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:07,528
I got some scissors,
let's cut this one, okay.

198
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,738
It's a pretty cool looking flower.

199
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:12,093
And we have a bunch over here too, huh.

200
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,253
Should we pick a couple?

201
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:14,963
- This one looks good.

202
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:15,796
- [Bryan] That one looks good?

203
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:16,691
- Yeah.
- Okay.

204
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,697
- Oh my gosh, there's a big bug.

205
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:22,000
- Whoa, Ollie, do you know
what kind of bug that is?

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,594
- What, I don't know.

207
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,673
- That's called a preying mantis.

208
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:29,840
- Yeah, he get all the, he get
rid of the bugs I don't like.

209
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,173
- Really?
- Yeah.

210
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:33,193
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

211
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:34,705
- [Oliver] But you can't squish him.

212
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:36,081
- [Bryan] He is huge you guys,

213
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:38,313
Oh my gosh, lookit, he's
looking at us right now.

214
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:40,663
That is incredible, good find Ollie.

215
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:41,886
- [Oliver] He doesn't talk.

216
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:44,010
- [Bryan] He blends in with
that flower pretty well, huh?

217
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,761
(soothing music)

218
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,545
- What, are those from our yard?

219
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,676
- [Oliver] Yeah.

220
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,278
- Did you pick these?
- Yeah.

221
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:09,214
- These are so pretty.

222
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,381
- And I found a preying mantis-saurus.

223
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:14,666
- Preying mantis--

224
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,921
- [Bryan] A preying mantis.

225
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:17,816
He kind of looks kind of like a dinosaur

226
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:21,074
so he calls him a preying
mantis-saurus, it's huge.

227
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,742
- That's cute, this is so pretty.

228
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:25,092
I can't believe you got it from our yard.

229
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:25,925
- [Bryan] Yeah, I know.

230
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,675
(soothing music)

231
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,811
- (mumbles) coming.

232
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:36,228
- [Bryan] Paris, look at you.

233
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,823
Did you get a cut?

234
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:41,244
You look so fresh, so clean, don't you?

235
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:43,261
We actually have a mobile
dog groomer here today

236
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,058
doing all three dogs today

237
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:46,932
and I guess Paris really needed a cut.

238
00:09:46,932 --> 00:09:49,568
He looks so cute with his floppy ears.

239
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:52,540
- Alright, the boys told me
about this preying mantis-saurus

240
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,536
and I thought, let's catch it,

241
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:55,967
that's what I used to do
when I was a little kid

242
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,268
and then we'd just look
at him for a little bit

243
00:09:58,268 --> 00:09:59,673
and let him free.

244
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:00,506
- [Bryan] Yeah.

245
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:01,819
- So let's see if he's still there.

246
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,288
- [Bryan] Where is he?

247
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:05,788
Oh I see him, yep.
- He's huge.

248
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,646
- [Bryan] Nice work Momma.

249
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:13,347
- Look at him, he's
climbing his little thing.

250
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,074
- I wanna see, I wanna see.

251
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,422
- [Bryan] Come look, Ollie.

252
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:18,720
- [Missy] He's big.

253
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,391
- [Bryan] Isn't that neat?

254
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:22,102
- [Missy] Be really careful with him.

255
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:23,722
Isn't he cute?

256
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:24,604
- He's real.

257
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:25,879
- He's so cool looking, huh,

258
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,400
because he's like, all green,

259
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,839
here, let Mommy hold him, all green,

260
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,277
he almost looks like he's
got like leaf textures

261
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,204
on him, huh?
- He does.

262
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:34,069
- He looks like a leaf.

263
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:36,652
(gentle music)

264
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,607
Okay, we're gonna set him free.

265
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:43,440
Say bye.

266
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,739
- Bye.
- Bye.

267
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,134
(laughing)

268
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:46,967
Bye.

269
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,267
- Here boys, let's take a picture.

270
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,577
- [Bryan] Oh shoot, he jumped, oh my gosh.

271
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:52,775
Scared the crap out of me.

272
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:53,622
(laughing)

273
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:54,782
- Bye.
- Bye.

274
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:56,320
- [Missy] Look at him like looking around,

275
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,787
he's like, did you catch me?

276
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:01,302
Or did you, did you, or
you, it was you, or you.

277
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:03,885
(upbeat music)

278
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:16,285
- So while we're finding some
amazing creatures outside

279
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:17,733
there's also some amazing things happening

280
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:18,813
inside the house today

281
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,621
and I wanted to show you guys

282
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:24,852
this amazing cactus plant that
I got at the farmer's market.

283
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,594
Check out this star flower
that is blooming on it.

284
00:11:28,594 --> 00:11:31,025
I am blown away by this

285
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,445
and I didn't even know this was a thing.

286
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:35,866
This is like an actual flower,
it's like really furry,

287
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:39,380
wow, it's actually really
rough too, that's crazy.

288
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,427
It's blooming from these
two cactuses right here

289
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:43,749
and actually there'll
be two more right here.

290
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:44,968
Check out these buds right here.

291
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,685
This is so cool.

292
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,869
So I found this at the farmer's market,

293
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,555
I've got it on my desk.

294
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:52,578
Next on my other little plants

295
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,493
and an SD card, of course.

296
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,720
Yeah, but that is that
little string of pearls too

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,300
that we're hoping takes
off, that'll be really cool.

298
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,947
Seriously though, I think
nature is just amazing

299
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:03,457
and I love being able to like

300
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,318
share it with our kids
and stuff on our property.

301
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,985
It's pretty amazing.

302
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,850
(growling noises)

303
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,183
(screaming)

304
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:20,456
- What is that?

305
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:24,845
- [Bryan] It's a skeleton
of a scorpion, obviously.

306
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,612
- Obviously, this is so creepy.

307
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,041
- It's a toy one.
- It's a toy one.

308
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,632
It's pretty crazy looking though.

309
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:33,417
- [Corbin] It is really cool.

310
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,633

00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,935
- I'm gonna get you, I wanna eat you.

319
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:54,730
