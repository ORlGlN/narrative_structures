- Good morning.

20
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:57,151
- What have you been doing this morning?

21
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,880
- Just eating breakfast.

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,763
- Eating breakfast and looking for Fred.

23
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:01,626
- Yeah.

24
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:04,418
- Have you seen anyone
who looks like this?

25
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:05,643
Right? (laughs)

26
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:09,076
Ollie says he thinks Fred
is running late again.

27
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:09,952
What's that noise?

28
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:11,975
Is that us singing?

29
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:13,058
Let's go see.

30
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:19,764
That's our song from
our new Christmas album!

31
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:20,597
That's so weird.

32
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:21,675
We just woke up.

33
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:22,799
I've got ready for the day.

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,482
But there's like music playing on in here.

35
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:27,130
Who started the music?

36
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,001
Let's keep a look out.

37
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,549
Where's Fred, Finn?

38
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,252
- Where is it?

39
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:32,524
- [Missy] You don't know?

40
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:33,415
- No.

41
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:34,352
- [Missy] Hmm.

42
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:35,840
'Kay, let me know when you find him.

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,752
- Fred!

44
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:37,585
- What?

45
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:38,967
I just stopped recording.

46
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:40,276
You see him?

47
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:42,314
Oh my goodness, he's up here.

48
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:43,147
Okay.

49
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm gonna go look.

50
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,962
Let's see what he's doing.

51
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:46,272
Oh my goodness.

52
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,319
I think this explains a lot guys.

53
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,714
He's wearing headphones
and listening to music.

54
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:54,599
And it says jingle bells rock.

55
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,363
He's been listening to our music guys,

56
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:57,683
our new album.

57
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:58,516
How cool.

58
00:01:58,516 --> 00:01:59,864
Do you like it Fred?

59
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:00,927
I don't know if you can tell,

60
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:02,829
but he looks pretty happy.

61
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,807
And I'd say he's enjoying the new album.

62
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:06,680
- I wanna see him a bit closer.

63
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,775
- A little bit closer?

64
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,972
Here we go, standing on top of a table.

65
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,524
Picking up a child.

66
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:12,901
What do you think?

67
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,476
He's gonna sing to our song.

68
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:17,749
He's probably listening to
you sing Christmas carols.

69
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:19,975
You're singing Jingle Bells and stuff.

70
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,635
How cool.

71
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:23,338
Don't touch him.

72
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:24,390
You wanna see Finn?

73
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,557
- [Finn] Yeah.

74
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:29,443
- Oh my goodness, is
he listening to music?

75
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,191
- Yeah.
- Aw.

76
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:32,528
How cool.

77
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,114
Alright, well you tell Santa, Fred,

78
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,055
that we have a new Christmas album out.

79
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,509
I mean I think it's pretty cool.

80
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:40,409
I think it's a pretty good
Christmas music, right?

81
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,834
Do you like our new album?

82
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:46,128
If you guys want to listen
to our new Christmas album,

83
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:47,584
just like Fred,

84
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,982
make sure you guys click
the link down below

85
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:51,837
and go ahead on over iTunes

86
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:52,969
and look up Daily Bumps.

87
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,351
We all have a huge part in the new album.

88
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,784
And it's really special.

89
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:57,399
Like I'm so excited about it.

90
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,890
I was so nervous about it.

91
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,020
And I actually feel like
it turned out pretty good.

92
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,017
No, I'm not a singer, no
I'm not amazing or anything,

93
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:07,019
but I feel like it turned out to where

94
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,081
you don't have to plug
your ears if I'm singing.

95
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:10,980
So that's good.

96
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,678
- Because I have a dinosaur.

97
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,470
- [Bryan] Whoa, where did you get that?

98
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,083
- From Kelsey and Corbin, 'cause
it was my pirate birthday.

99
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,222
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

100
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:22,972
- Whoa, he's walking.

101
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:26,234
That's so cool.

102
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,288
He walks a little bit slow.

103
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:29,773
I bet he'll walk a lot
better on the table.

104
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:31,263
Look at him go, see?

105
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,572
(laughs)

106
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:36,385
That is a very loud toy.

107
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:40,368
Thank you Kelsey and
Corbin for the amazing toy.

108
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:42,847
(laughs)

109
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,653
Oh hey Finn.

110
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:46,136
Oh, you're not Finn.

111
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:47,628
You're Emma.

112
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:48,461
Hi Emma.

113
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:52,540
So our cousin Rose dropped
off her two little girls,

114
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,909
Alivia and Emma.

115
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:54,964
And this is Emma.

116
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:55,797
How old is she?

117
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:57,304
- She's about six months.

118
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:01,419
- [Bryan] Six months and
she's so sweet and calm.

119
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,590
And yeah.
- I know.

120
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,836
She's like the easiest baby.

121
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,655
Even her mom says she's the easiest baby.

122
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,902
So I'm like, yeah I'll
babysit the easiest baby

123
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:08,735
in the world.

124
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:09,784
- Are you a good baby?

125
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,609
Are you a good baby?

126
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,315
- She says that she
doesn't really cry a lot.

127
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:17,041
I didn't have to feed her
'cause she won't really whine.

128
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,043
I's like oh my goodness.

129
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:19,961
It's gonna be easy.

130
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,680
- [Bryan] It's so weird seeing
you with a little baby girl.

131
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,256
'Cause you're such a boy's mom.

132
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:24,783
- I know it's so weird
seeing such a bright color

133
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:25,870
on someone.

134
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,586
- [Bryan] I know, that's true.

135
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,419
- They're so fun.

136
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,252
- [Bryan] Hi.

137
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:31,498
And then Alivia's here

138
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:34,020
playing with good ole
Buzz Light year, huh?

139
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,470
That's so nice of you Ollie and Finn

140
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,387
to share your toys with Alivia.

141
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:38,937
Is that baby Jesus?
- Yeah.

142
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:40,957
- [Bryan] It's like a cute,
little kids' nativity scene.

143
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:42,644
You gonna set it all up?
- Yeah.

144
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:43,491
- Okay.

145
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,370
So you put baby Jesus right there.

146
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,122
That's Joseph, his dad.

147
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:49,465
Oh, he's right there, he's not in there?

148
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:51,335
- Yeah.
- And then the wise men.

149
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:53,175
Oh the wise men gets to
stand next to baby Jesus,

150
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:54,229
but his dad doesn't?

151
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,062
Oh there's Mary.

152
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,102
Okay, that's his mom.

153
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:57,725
More wise men.
- This one.

154
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:00,100
- [Bryan] There we go.

155
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,307
And the angel goes on top?
- Yeah.

156
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:04,549
- Oh that's cute.
- Yeah.

157
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:07,399
And then animals go right here.

158
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,036
- [Bryan] Oh, how cute.

159
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,786
("Silent Night")

160
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,537
- Yay, toesies.

161
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:23,860
(Bryan laughs)

162
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,899
- [Bryan] Is Ollie kissing your feet?

163
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,045
Oh hey Emma.

164
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:29,146
You gonna come play with us?

165
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:29,979
- You wanna play?

166
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:32,231
- So this is so fun
watching Alivia and Emma.

167
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,444
Because it's not only
like we have four kids,

168
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:38,755
and two girls, but also like
the boys have two sisters.

169
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,084
That they have to like
behave with and take care of

170
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:43,525
and share with.

171
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:44,642
I'm like, I don't know.

172
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:46,069
Would they like to have a sister?

173
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:48,542
- I don't know, 'cause
he was like so excited

174
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:51,831
to show Alivia his dinosaur,
but she was scared of it.

175
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:52,757
No.

176
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:55,457
Finn is getting some of
the cutest big brother,

177
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:58,860
oh Ollie too. (laughs)

178
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,610
You guys, when mommy has another baby,

179
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,787
are you gonna be the
best big brothers ever?

180
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:04,182
- Yeah.

181
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:06,899
- Finn is like so sweet.

182
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,681
Like he just loves her.

183
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:10,793
He's like gimme a hug.

184
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:13,431
(laughs)

185
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,522
Oh my goodness.

186
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:17,532
Our next one better love cuddles, huh?

187
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:18,424
I'm so excited.

188
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:20,503
When we have another one,
I think both the boys

189
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:22,039
are gonna be the sweetest.

190
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,916
I feel like with Ollie,
he wasn't super into Finn

191
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,487
when he was born, 'cause he was just like

192
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,990
in a different stage in life,

193
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,993
like had always just been on his own.

194
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:32,103
And it's just different,

195
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:33,815
depending on like their age and stuff.

196
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:36,029
But now they're both like at that age

197
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,418
and even Finn it's just
because he's had other kids

198
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:39,621
in his life a lot,

199
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,125
I think he could be so
happy to be a big brother.

200
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,708
It's so cute watching
him do this with Emma.

201
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,978
He loves you, doesn't he?

202
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:50,065
- [Bryan] Hey Finn, is that your bottle?

203
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:50,898
No.

204
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:53,022
- You're not gonna try it.

205
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:54,269
You're gonna give it to the baby.

206
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:55,573
You wanna feed her?

207
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:56,790
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay,

208
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,806
let's go sit down.

209
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,215
- [Bryan] Finn is so excited to feed Emma.

210
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:01,933
We have no idea if this is gonna work.

211
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:03,657
- I know.
- But we're like,

212
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,427
okay, we'll let you try.

213
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:08,427
- Okay, put the bottle in her mouth.

214
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:11,147
You gotta hold it up for her.

215
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:12,699
- Yay.
- You gotta hold it like this.

216
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,697
- [Bryan] You're doing it buddy.

217
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:17,071
Oh, (laughs) he's like,
I'll keep that warm for you.

218
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,571
- That's so funny.

219
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,027
You are not a baby.

220
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,838
- [Bryan] We're just practicing
for a baby sister, huh?

221
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:26,785
Oh my gosh, you are adorable Finn.

222
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,610
- No, no mister.

223
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,612
Oh my goodness.

224
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:32,354
He's going back a few years.

225
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:35,198
- [Bryan] Finn is doing such a good job,

226
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:37,750
practicing for a baby sister maybe?

227
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,951
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

228
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:41,678
(laughs) He's so cute.

229
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,253
Alivia and Ollie are also having

230
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:44,658
so much fun playing together.

231
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,416
They are currently raiding the pantry.

232
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,232
You finding any good snacks guys?

233
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:50,865
- Yeah, I'm getting a snack for Alivia.

234
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:52,391
- That's so nice of you.

235
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,014
- By the way, it may be
confusing to some of you,

236
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:57,651
but yes, Ollie has two little
cousins, both name Olivia.

237
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,808
One is spelled with an O.

238
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:02,549
and Alivia spelled with A.

239
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,132
(bright music)

240
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,650
Oh, Finn's got some too.

241
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,437
- He got spacey ones.

242
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:15,930
- [Bryan] These are sour cream, yeah here,

243
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,143
hold it and I'll open it.

244
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,341
There you go buddy.

245
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,174
- Thanks.

246
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:21,455
- [Bryan] That's for all
your hard work you did

247
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:23,143
taking care of the baby, 'kay?

248
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:24,803
Oh you want it all the way off?

249
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:26,141
- Yeah.
- Okay.

250
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:27,158
There you go.

251
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,329
- [Missy] Did you guys
have so much fun today?

252
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:30,529
- Yeah, but look.

253
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:33,394
- [Missy] Playing with, yeah,
she's crawling under you.

254
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,086
Alivia, you were so good.

255
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,019
And Emma you were so easy.

256
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,034
- [Woman] Say thank you.

257
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,799
- Thanks for coming over girls.

258
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,089
It's a race to the toys.

259
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,631
It's a race to the toys.

260
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:44,715
Go, go, go!

261
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:48,001
Did you have fun pretending
that we had little sisters?

262
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,088
Yeah.

263
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,235
How fun.

264
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,532

- Peanut butter time.

289
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:45,687
- If you guys don't know,

290
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,361
every year I make peanut butter balls.

291
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:48,289
It's a very special recipe.

292
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:51,467
I think there's a recipe
up online that I did.

293
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,952
I'm thinking on my channel.

294
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,024
You guys can check it out,

295
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,802
look for like Missy Lanning's
peanut butter balls.

296
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:56,635
I love them.

297
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:57,633
Every year we make them.

298
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,776
It's a little overwhelming,
'cause we make a lot

299
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:00,761
of peanut butter balls.

300
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:01,791
- Yes!

301
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,560
- (laughs) How many peanut
butter balls do we make, Ollie?

302
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,783
- 400 balls.

303
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:06,616
- [Missy] That's right.

304
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:10,493
We make 400 balls out of
all this peanut butter, huh?

305
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:11,326
- Yeah.

306
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:13,194
- But anyways I'm starting it now.

307
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:16,263
We just put three pounds
of butter in there.

308
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:18,173
- And it smells like peanut butter.

309
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:19,395
- My hands are gonna
smell like peanut butter

310
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:22,341
for the next two weeks because
after I start rolling stuff,

311
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:24,120
I feel like it just seeps into my skin.

312
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,645
And I'm just like, still
smells like peanut butter.

313
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,375
Alright, let's get started!

314
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,958
(bright music)

315
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:40,440
Alright, we've just mixed all
the melted butter in here.

316
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,607
And now we have to put in two
pounds of powdered sugar huh?

317
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:48,516
I think Ollie's like a little,

318
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:50,484
like this does not look good Mom.

319
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,317
I don't want that.

320
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,424
But, I think you're gonna be
amazed when it's done Ollie.

321
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:54,778
It's gonna be delicious.

322
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:56,621
This is like where it gets messy.

323
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,543
And kinda crazy.

324
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,930
Gotta have taste testers huh?

325
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,807
Just a little bit.

326
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:03,038
No no, okay.

327
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:03,871
Here.

328
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,704
Yeah, there you go.

329
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:05,537
Just like that.

330
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:07,163
Lick your finger.

331
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:10,496
Oh my goodness, you can't even try that.

332
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,354
Oh my goodness, you don't like it?

333
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,140
Alright, go wash your hands then.

334
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,433
Alright your turn Finn, try it.

335
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,724
Tell me if you like it, try it.

336
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,021
How is it?

337
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,784
- Good.
- Is it good?

338
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,772
- Yeah.
- See your brother's crazy.

339
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,340
It's sugar you silly.

340
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,926
- Mama, what are we doing?

341
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:31,366
- We're making peanut butter balls.

342
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,635
- Yes sir.

343
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,220
- Are you ready, should I turn it on?

344
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,420
- Yeah!

345
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,278
- Okay, you gotta point
it right at the machine,

346
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,062
so you can see what happens.

347
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,462
We're gonna put the sugar in.

348
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:45,077
We've already put a lot
in, but it gets messy.

349
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:46,808
- Okay, I'm not gonna do this.

350
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:49,214
I don't want to get it on the camera.

351
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:50,241
- Okay, just hold the camera back.

352
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,520
There you go.

353
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,171
What do you think?
- Good.

354
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,004
It's getting all powdery up here.

355
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,113
- Yeah, we have a lot of smoke guys.

356
00:11:58,113 --> 00:11:59,621
- It looks like smoke in the air.

357
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,379
I don't know if you guys can see it but.

358
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,314
- I can see it.

359
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:03,989
- You can see it, huh?
- Yeah.

360
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,186
- Where did Finn go?

361
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:06,519
Finn, come here!

362
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:10,700
Get it in there, get it in there, hurry!

363
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,294
(laughing)

364
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:16,309
We've got a bunch of
peanut butter all mixed.

365
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,496
You gotta point it here.

366
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:18,378
- [Ollie] Look at all that guys.

367
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:20,126
Oh it's fall.

368
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:20,959
- (laughs) It's fallen.

369
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,792
Here, hold it back.

370
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,204
There, see how they can see it now?

371
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:24,593
- Yeah.
- Wow.

372
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,975
This is a lot of peanut butter.

373
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,807
- [Ollie] Now they don't
see the smoke anymore.

374
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,077
- Yeah, the smoke all went away.

375
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:31,011
It's not really smoke,

376
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:33,072
it's just like the powder
that was poofed up.

377
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:35,502
- Yeah, but I think it is smoke guys.

378
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:38,124
- [Missy] You are filthy!

379
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,023
- Got a little on my face.

380
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,532
- [Missy] Oh yep, it's all over your face.

381
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:44,751
And it's all over your
pants and the counter.

382
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,122
Is it all over you?

383
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:47,229
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

384
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:50,260
Okay Finn, you gotta try
some of that peanut butter.

385
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,927
Here, I'll help you.

386
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,480
How is it?
- Good.

387
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,781
- Is that good?
- Yeah.

388
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:58,197
- You try it.
- You love it?

389
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:00,114
Okay, I'm gonna try it.

390
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:04,079
Um, that is so good.

391
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,581
Oliver, gotta try it.

392
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:08,786
(laughs)

393
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:11,872
Okay boys, it's all
mixed up and packaged up.

394
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:15,384
Now we gotta put it in the
fridge so it can chill.

395
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:17,140
And while it chills, I
think we should chill

396
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,377
and watch a movie.

397
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:20,659
We're gonna get this nice and hard

398
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:23,230
and then probably either
tonight or tomorrow,

399
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,378
I'll start rolling.

400
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,352
And that is like the longest process.

401
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,274
Actually I really don't know
if that's the longest process

402
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,854
or then dipping all the
balls is the longest process.

403
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:32,810
I'm guessing dipping is the worst.

404
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,534
So anyways, we have a
lot of work to do still.

405
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,648
But we got the first part done.

406
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:39,318
Close refrigerator.

407
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,259
Whew, okay.

408
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,622
Let's go watch a Christmas movie, okay?

409
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:42,489
- [Ollie] Okay.

410
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,225
(bright music)

411
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,899
- [Bryan] So I wanted to show
you guys what I did tonight.

412
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,726
I got this locket for
Missy for her birthday

413
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,023
back in October.

414
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,002
And I just finally got around to putting

415
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,312
pictures in it for her.

416
00:13:56,312 --> 00:13:58,031
'Cause getting pictures to fill a locket

417
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:59,625
is very, very difficult.

418
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,791
They are very, very small.

419
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,296
Smaller than you may think, even.

420
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,463
So I wanted to show you guys.

421
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:06,530
Check that out you guys.

422
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,872
You can see us.

423
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,004
We're very tiny, but you can see us.

424
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:12,046
I got a family photo on that side

425
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:15,893
and a really cute photo of
Ollie and Finn on that side.

426
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,260
Look at that.

427
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,330
It's so cool.

428
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,831
You guys getting ready for bed?

429
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,236
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

430
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,761
Advent calendar time?

431
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,478
How many have you put together tonight?

432
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:25,723
- Just one tonight.

433
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,352
But I'm still doing it.

434
00:14:27,352 --> 00:14:30,151
- [Bryan] Oh the instructions
are inside, that's cool.

435
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:32,294
- Well it's not instructions though,

436
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,359
'cause literally looking at it,

437
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,659
I'm like okay that goes there,

438
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:35,699
that goes there.
- Oh it's not?

439
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:36,796
Okay.
- But it is really hard.

440
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:38,220
- [Bryan] You're right,
it is kinda doing it

441
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,331
with no book huh?

442
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:42,021
As the kids just wait patiently
for it to be finished.

443
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:42,873
- Yeah we did it.

444
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:44,731
- [Bryan] Oh what's the new
Tsum Tsum you got Ollie?

445
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:45,636
Or is that Finn's?

446
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,219
Oh that's so cool!

447
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,052
- That's mine.

448
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:48,938
- [Bryan] Do you know who that is Ollie?

449
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:50,114
- What?
- It's Sully.

450
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:51,744
From Monsters Inc.

451
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:53,408
He's kinda like a reindeer, huh?

452
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:56,047
Anyway I think that's
all for today's video.

453
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,632
I did wanna give you guys a little update.

454
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:00,486
We signed all the rest
of the calendars today,

455
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,373
so they're all shipped
off to distribution,

456
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:03,802
so if you haven't
received your calendar yet

457
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,756
you should be getting it very, very soon.

458
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:07,512
So I wanted to fill you guys in on that.

459
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,707
But as for that, I think
that's all for today's video.

460
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,100
But if you enjoy it you
should give it a thumb's up.

461
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,206
Subscribe.

462
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:15,706
- Hey Gbo, how many sleeps 'til Christmas?

463
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:19,447
- 12 nights.

464
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:22,331
- 12 days of Christmas, just started!

465
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:23,680
Get ready!

466
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,770
Thanks for watching guys.

467
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,162
Bye!

468
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,034
Oops.

469
00:15:27,034 --> 00:00:00,000
(bright music)
