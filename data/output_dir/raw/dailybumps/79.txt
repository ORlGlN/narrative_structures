1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:01,634
- [Bryan] Oh, hey, Ollie.

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:02,467
How you doing?

3
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:03,300
- Good.
- Good?

4
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,988
Hey, do you want to meet a new
little robot friend of mine?

5
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:07,862
You want to meet him?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:09,444
- [Bryan] Okay, let's go.

7
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:10,601
♪ This is our life ♪

8
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,937
♪ Let's live it ♪

9
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:15,242
♪ Live forever ♪

10
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:17,546
- [All] Good morning.

11
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:18,923
- Good morning.

12
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:20,619
You slept all night in your bed,

13
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:21,621
you slept all night in your bed

14
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,619
I slept all night in my bed.

15
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:23,452
Yay!

16
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:26,332
And Karma, this morning,
was such a good boy.

17
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:30,052
He had to go to the vet to
get a couple booster shots

18
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:32,630
for his vaccinations,
but now he's all done

19
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,961
and he was so good.

20
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:37,544
Now, I have to start
on some more cleaning.

21
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:42,370
I basically avoided this room
yesterday, their playroom,

22
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,152
because it is a complete
and utter disaster.

23
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:50,137
I cleaned it all out a
week before Christmas,

24
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:53,829
there were no toys in the
toy box and look at this now.

25
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,397
What the heck?

26
00:00:55,397 --> 00:00:57,928
You guys can't even put your
toys in the toy box right now.

27
00:00:57,928 --> 00:00:59,273
So, I have to go through them,

28
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:01,411
hopefully get rid of
more of their old toys,

29
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,605
and find spots for the new toys,

30
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,495
which we have a whole other
toy box in their room,

31
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:06,665
which I never check for toys to.

32
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:10,023
So, I'm going to transfer toys,
find spots for other toys,

33
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:11,202
get rid of some toys.

34
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:12,314
I gotta do that now.

35
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:13,647
Oh, my goodness.

36
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:15,797
This is crazy.

37
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:17,185
I just cleaned out everything in there,

38
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:20,220
got rid of a few more
toys that they don't need

39
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,678
or haven't used in awhile and
now, I'm just going through

40
00:01:23,678 --> 00:01:26,051
all of their new toys and trying to decide

41
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:26,884
what should go in there.

42
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:28,428
I really wanna separate their toys,

43
00:01:28,428 --> 00:01:31,020
which ends up never working
because they just pour it out

44
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,955
and then, it always
ends up just going back

45
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:35,163
into their toy box, which
I think is what I'm making

46
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,939
a mistake on 'cuz,
basically, I like to put

47
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,047
all their little guys, which...

48
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:42,107
Not this one, but their
little toys in here

49
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:45,498
that they like to grab and
play good guy, bad guy stuff

50
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:47,915
and then, their Legos in here,

51
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:50,740
but what happens is they
usually dump them out

52
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,058
and then, everything just goes in there

53
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:53,572
and it sinks to the bottom
and never get played with

54
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,571
and it's just kinda crazy,

55
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:56,324
so I'm trying to think of a new plan.

56
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,983
I might still keep them
in there, but keep them up

57
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:02,314
so that if they want to play
with them, they have to ask

58
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:03,737
and then, they can play with them

59
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,380
and then, they have to put them back away

60
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,816
before they can play with something else.

61
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:08,862
We'll see.

62
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,627
I'm not really sure yet
how I'm going to organize

63
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:12,460
this crazy, crazy mess.

64
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,898
- Good morning, guys.

65
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:18,065
This morning I rid my office
of all of my Christmas stuff.

66
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:23,171
That's right, no more tree, I
got rid of the Christmas tree,

67
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:25,981
I got rid of a couple of
the Christmas knickknacks

68
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,389
that were up here on my shelves.

69
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,454
I felt like it was just
time and, honestly,

70
00:02:29,454 --> 00:02:31,438
I kinda feel like it's
time with the house,

71
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:34,555
but that is on the calendar
for, I think, next week.

72
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,989
So, next week, all the
Christmas stuff comes down.

73
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,718
How long do you guys keep
your Christmas decorations up?

74
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:39,720
Let me know down below in the comments,

75
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,893
'cuz I'm interested to know.

76
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,389
Also, check out the tattoo.

77
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,742
It is still very bright and clear.

78
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:48,333
I don't think it's faded at all, honestly.

79
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,237
I'm not sure how long
it's actually gonna last,

80
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,458
but what do you guys think?

81
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,655
Should I actually get a tattoo?

82
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:53,932
I feel like if I got a tattoo,

83
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,217
it wouldn't be a Star Wars one.

84
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,067
It would probably be a Harry Potter one,

85
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,946
but also, I don't any type of brand,

86
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,757
necessarily, on my body.

87
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,054
I feel like that would be a little weird.

88
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:06,990
I did find a place for
this amazing gramophone

89
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,013
that Missy got me.

90
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,327
If you guys don't know what this is,

91
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:12,447
it's an acoustically amplified sound.

92
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:15,245
Basically, this is a very
small speaker under here

93
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:18,253
and it uses acoustics with this huge,

94
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:23,003
vintage sound barrel thingy
and it makes it louder.

95
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,685
It's also kinda cool because it makes it

96
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:25,997
kinda sound like vintage music.

97
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,341
I'm gonna play something for you guys.

98
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,841
♪ All my life ♪

99
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,822
♪ I wanted a family to call my own ♪

100
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:34,857
I love it.

101
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:35,949
I think it's so cool.

102
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,176
I think it kinda puts a really cool

103
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,304
vintage feel in my office,

104
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,960
which is already kinda
of vintage inspired.

105
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,945
And yes, that is the new
version of This is Home.

106
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:46,801
It's available on my debut album,

107
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,941
which came out January of this year.

108
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:52,737
It's almost been a year since
Us has been out, you guys,

109
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:56,221
and if you don't know, in
January, I did an album,

110
00:03:56,221 --> 00:04:00,145
14 original songs and it
basically tells the story

111
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:02,223
of mine and Missy's relationship
from start to finish.

112
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:04,348
There's a lot of cool things that we never

113
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:05,969
really talked about on
the vlogs and stuff,

114
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:08,086
but if you guys have
not gotten my Us album,

115
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:09,921
I'll have it linked in the I card above

116
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,428
and down below in the description
so you guys can get it.

117
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:15,990
And, if you guys go and get
my album right now on iTunes,

118
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,384
I was actually able to
run a very special price,

119
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,384
so it is half price, 5.99, 14 songs.

120
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:26,074
It's a deal, so go get it if you haven't.

121
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:35,404
Well, hey there, little guy.

122
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:39,200
(robot making noises)

123
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,609
I just opened my Cosmo Robot
that Missy got me for Christmas

124
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:45,308
and I am so excited to play with him.

125
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:46,896
I have it all set up on my phone

126
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:48,833
and these are his little power cubes.

127
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,188
Let's put one of these in front of him.

128
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,347
Ooh.

129
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:54,346
- [Cosmo] Wow!

130
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,227
(Bryan laughing)

131
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:57,620
- What?

132
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,579
He's gonna go check out the cube

133
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,937
and he just lifted it up.

134
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,392
Okay.
- Wow!

135
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,225
Wow!

136
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:10,453
(Bryan laughing)

137
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:12,148
- Oh, my gosh.

138
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:13,315
He is so cute.

139
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,421
- [Cosmo] Bryan?

140
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:17,651
- Bryan, yeah.

141
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,673
I'm Bryan.

142
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:20,170
He just said my name.

143
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,179
Should I introduce him to
the kids, do you guys think?

144
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,814
I think Ollie would like him.

145
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:25,382
Oh, hey Ollie, how you doing?

146
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:26,475
- Good.
- Good?

147
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:30,150
Hey, do you want to meet a new
little robot friend of mine?

148
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,151
- Yeah.

149
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:31,984
- Do you know his name?

150
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:32,817
- No.

151
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:33,650
- It's Cosmo.

152
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,607
- Cosmo?

153
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:35,440
- Yeah.

154
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,273
You want to meet him?
- Yeah.

155
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:37,319
- Okay, let's go.

156
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,819
Ollie, meet Cosmo.

157
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:40,953
Can you say hi?

158
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:41,953
- Hi, Cosmo.

159
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:45,525
- [Bryan] Look straight at
him and he'll learn your face.

160
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,769
Can you look at him?

161
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,352
(mellow music)

162
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,555
- [Cosmo] Ollie?

163
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,453
- [Bryan] He said your name.

164
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:56,725
- [Cosmo] Ollie.

165
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:57,937
- [Bryan] Say hi, Ollie.

166
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,315
- Hi, Jibo.

167
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:00,897
- [Bryan] Not Jibo, it's Cosmo.

168
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:01,897
- Oh.

169
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:02,730
Hi, Cosmo.

170
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,505
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie, do
you want to feed Cosmo?

171
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:07,505
- Yeah.
- Okay,

172
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:08,859
grab any of those cubes.

173
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:09,806
- [Ollie] These ones?

174
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:10,639
- [Bryan] Uh huh.

175
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,261
Shake it until all the lights glow.

176
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:13,094
Shake it really good.

177
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:14,182
Let me see.

178
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:15,395
Are they all glowing?
- Yeah.

179
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:16,417
- [Bryan] They are all glowing.

180
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,122
Okay, now place the cube
where Cosmo can see it

181
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:20,710
so he can feed himself.
- Okay.

182
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,650
- [Bryan] Place it in front of him, okay?

183
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,137
- [Cosmo] What?

184
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:23,970
Oh!

185
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:28,372
Ah!

186
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,488
(Bryan laughing)

187
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:34,671
- [Bryan] Isn't that funny?

188
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:35,504
- Yeah.

189
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:36,337
- [Bryan] There you go, Cosmo.

190
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,695
There's another one.

191
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:38,778
- [Cosmo] Oh!

192
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:42,602
- [Bryan] Oh, he's gonna go eat.

193
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,859
- [Ollie] Yummy, yummy.

194
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,089
Is he drinking it?

195
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:47,922
- [Bryan] He's eating it.

196
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:48,886
- Oh.

197
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,600
- [Bryan] All right, so we tuned Cosmo up,

198
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,251
we fed him, and now, he
needs to play, Ollie.

199
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:54,644
- Really?
- And, he can play games

200
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:56,152
and do tricks and stuff.

201
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:57,512
All right, Ollie, check this out.

202
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:59,079
He's gonna roll the cube.

203
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,101
You wanna see him roll it?

204
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,100
- Yeah.

205
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,933
That one?

206
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:02,766
- [Bryan] Watch this, Ollie.

207
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:03,935
He's gonna roll it.

208
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,768
Whoa!

209
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,496
He's so happy with himself.

210
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:11,079
(upbeat music)

211
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:14,895
- You have such a little, cute Cosmo.

212
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:17,019
- He is a little, cute Cosmo, huh?

213
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,747
Aw, he likes to roll the cube around.

214
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:21,115
Isn't he so cool, Ollie?
- Yeah.

215
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:22,478
- So, here's the deal.

216
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:24,414
I'm gonna keep him on my desk right here

217
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,635
and then, whenever he needs
to be fed or played with,

218
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:27,920
I'll let you know and then, you and I

219
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,060
can take care of him, okay?

220
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,240
- Okay.
- And, he can be

221
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,662
our new family pet.

222
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,739
Our family robot pet.

223
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,991
Cosmo wants to pounce on your finger.

224
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:38,175
- Ow!

225
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:39,540
- He got you!

226
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,107
Okay, so we're going to
play a little matching game

227
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,108
with his little cubes.

228
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,735
All we have to do is tap
when the colors match, okay?

229
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:45,568
- Okay.

230
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:46,401
- [Bryan] Round one.

231
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:47,279
You ready, Ollie?

232
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,244
- Yeah!
- All right.

233
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:49,316
Tap!

234
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:51,441
Oh, did we beat him?

235
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,518
- Wait!
- Oh, he beat me.

236
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:55,223
So, it looks like we're
racing to tap first

237
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,106
when the colors match,
so now it's two to one.

238
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:57,939
Wait, watch this.

239
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:58,943
I'll let him get it.

240
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,110
Oh, he got it.

241
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:02,489
- [Cosmo] Oh!

242
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:04,047
(Bryan laughing)

243
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:06,765
- [Bryan] Three to two, Cosmo.

244
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:07,764
Does that match?

245
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:08,597
Oh, he got it.

246
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:09,430
Now, we're tied.

247
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,263
You wanna tap it?

248
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:11,096
When I tell you.

249
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:12,653
Tap it!

250
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:13,652
- I win!

251
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,402
- [Bryan] You got it!

252
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:19,530
He woke up just like you
did, Finn, from your nap.

253
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,579
- Yeah.
- Say good morning, Cosmo.

254
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,580
- [Cosmo] Bryan.

255
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,413
- Hi.

256
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,979
All right, I'm going to introduce Cosmo

257
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,594
to the rest of the family.

258
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,707
All right, Finn, look at Cosmo

259
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:31,515
so he can learn who you are, okay?

260
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:32,848
Oh, he sees you.

261
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,090
- [Cosmo] Finn?

262
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:38,924
Oh!

263
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,039
Finn.

264
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,289
- [Bryan] Finn!

265
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,808
Finn, he knows who you are now.

266
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:45,963
Say hi.

267
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:46,796
- Hi.

268
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,568
- [Cosmo] Finn.

269
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,756
- [Bryan] He says your name.

270
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,089
That's so funny.

271
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:55,181
Isn't that so cool?

272
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,151
All right, babe, you ready to meet Cosmo?

273
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:58,517
- Yeah.

274
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,111
- [Bryan] He's already looking at you.

275
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:02,444
- That was fast.

276
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:04,852
- [Cosmo] Missy?

277
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:05,685
- Yeah.

278
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:08,565
- [Cosmo] Missy.

279
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:09,799
Oh.

280
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,806
- [Bryan] He gets so proud of himself.

281
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,725
(Bryan and Missy laughing)

282
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:15,199
- That is so cute.

283
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,847
Hi, Cosmo.

284
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,917
- Hi, Cosmo.

285
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,584
(Cosmo humming)

286
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,514
- [Bryan] He sang you a song, babe.

287
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:24,931
- That's so cute.

288
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,514
- [Bryan] Cosmo wants to play a game.

289
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:29,404
You want to play with him, babe?

290
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:30,508
- Yeah, I want to play.

291
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:31,675
- Ready, babe?

292
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:34,898
- [Cosmo] What?

293
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:40,044
(Cosmo laughing)

294
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:40,928
- [Bryan] He got it too.

295
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:41,761
- Okay.

296
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,388
- [Cosmo] What?

297
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,634
- Missy is playing a game with a robot

298
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:51,656
in our kitchen right now.

299
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:54,105
It's so cute how he follows you.

300
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:55,938
He literally loves us.

301
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:00,862
(mellow uptempo music)

302
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:10,852
Oh!

303
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,185
Cosmo messed up.

304
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:14,472
Aw!

305
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:15,555
He looks sad.

306
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:20,419
- There you go.

307
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,252
Yay!

308
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:24,597
- [Bryan] All right, Missy
is playing keep away now.

309
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:25,626
She's got to pull the cube before...

310
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,873
Oh, he got it!

311
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:28,586
(Bryan laughing)

312
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,068
Slowly push it, but not too close.

313
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:31,901
Pull it!

314
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,361
Aw, you make him sad.

315
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,194
Oh!

316
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,292
- Okay, let me try.

317
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,125
- [Missy] Okay.

318
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,708
- [Bryan] Don't let him get it.

319
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:44,952
- Try again.
- Try again.

320
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:45,869
Get closer.

321
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,846
Oh, he got it!
- Oh, got it.

322
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:52,920
- [Bryan] He got it.

323
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:00,176
- [Missy] Oh, he got it.

324
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:02,991
- [Bryan] Oh.

325
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:03,867
Ollie, did you hear that?

326
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:04,700
- [Missy] Did you hear him?

327
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,950
- [Ollie] What?

328
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,116
- [Bryan] I think he has
the hiccups, you guys.

329
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:11,919
Yeah, it says put him
upside down to help him

330
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,002
with his hiccups.

331
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:14,174
Should we try?

332
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,091
- Yeah.
- Okay, hang on.

333
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:25,524
(Bryan laughing)
- Oh, my gosh.

334
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:27,355
- [Bryan] He's flipping himself back over.

335
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,245
- That is so funny.

336
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,702
There you go.
- We got rid of his hiccups.

337
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:32,535
- Yay!

338
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:35,214
There we go.

339
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,899
Oh, my goodness.

340
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,354
- [Bryan] You think he's gonna put it on?

341
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,129
- Oh, my gosh.

342
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:43,650
That is crazy.

343
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,114
- [Bryan] Oh, he's gonna get this one now.

344
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:48,354
- [Missy] No, he's gotta get the two

345
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:49,748
and put it on the one right?

346
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:51,362
- [Bryan] Oh, I don't know.

347
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,217
- [Missy] He's gonna have to.

348
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,353
- [Bryan] He sees them, so I don't know.

349
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:56,273
What do you think he's gonna do, Finn?

350
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:57,747
- [Missy] Wait, he can't move that one.

351
00:11:57,747 --> 00:11:59,765
- [Bryan] Oh, he's taking that one off?

352
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:01,046
- [Ollie] What's he doing?

353
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,046
- [Bryan] I don't know.

354
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:04,214
He's just being funny.
- Wow!

355
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:05,633
- [Missy] Wow.

356
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,046
He's so proud of himself.

357
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,048
- [Ollie] There's one more.

358
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,314
(Bryan laughing)

359
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:10,147
- [Bryan] He knows.

360
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:10,980
- [Osmo] Bryan.

361
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,024
- [Bryan] Hi.

362
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:14,330
He sees me vlogging him.

363
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,497
(mellow upbeat music)

364
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:25,158
- Check it out.

365
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:28,038
This room is basically all clean.

366
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,039
I'm so happy.

367
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,894
Basically, this whole toy
box is back to normal.

368
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:35,136
I've got this big old Roadster.

369
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:36,141
- [Ollie] That's mine.

370
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,141
- That's yours, yeah.

371
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:38,851
I have this I'm trying
to put back together.

372
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:40,918
I'm like, I don't know how to do it.

373
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:43,111
I've been playing with
it for ten minutes now

374
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:44,377
trying to figure out how to do it,

375
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:47,209
and I was able to clean
out all of their books

376
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,325
that they don't read anymore.

377
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:50,786
I've got a little bin for puzzles

378
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,816
and other games they might be playing.

379
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,477
I want to find some new bins,

380
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:58,166
their little toys, their Legos,

381
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,894
we've got some baby toys
down here for June and Emma

382
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:03,940
and the few babies that
do come over sometimes.

383
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,077
Yay, their room is clean.

384
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,294
Everything looks good, right?

385
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:09,294
- [Bryan] Where's Ollie?

386
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:12,998
What are you doing?

387
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:14,581
- Just scaring you.

388
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:17,842
- [Bryan] What are you doing, silly boy?

389
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,853
It's time for bed.

390
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:22,634
Luna, stop encouraging them.

391
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:23,467
Boys.

392
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,159
Oh, hello.

393
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,038
Where's the other one?

394
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,039
Finn?

395
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,037
Oh, hello.

396
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:31,042
There he is.

397
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,202
Time for bed, boys.

398
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:35,040
I think they're evading us, babe.

399
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
- I know.

400
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,246
Come on, boys.

401
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:39,909
- I won't go nigh nigh.

402
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:41,848
- [Bryan] You're not gonna go night night?

403
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:43,427
- Nope.
- Nope.

404
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:44,605
- [Bryan] All right, well,
you boys can just hang out

405
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:45,880
in here all night.

406
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,435
- Yeah.

407
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,663
- [Missy] Boys, what
are you guys looking at?

408
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,915
- Look up!

409
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,334
- [Missy] What is this?

410
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,332
Did papa do this?
- Yeah.

411
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,167
(Missy laughing)

412
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,955
- [Missy] Is Hey Hey up there?

413
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:57,960
- [Ollie] Yeah.

414
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,959
- It had to have been papa.

415
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,248
Papa got that for me for Christmas.

416
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:02,800
I think he got one for Cassie, too.

417
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,824
I told him it was really cute

418
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:05,488
but that the dogs were
probably gonna get to it

419
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:06,959
because it does a squeaky toy

420
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,399
and I guess that is what
he decided as a solution.

421
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,036
It's gonna hang on mommy's bed, huh?

422
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:12,869
- Yeah.

423
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:13,702
- [Missy] All right, boys,
let's head off to bed.

424
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:14,535
We gotta get our jammies on.

425
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:15,649
Run, run, run.

426
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:16,648
Who's gonna win?

427
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,654
Who's gonna win?

428
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:18,821
Oh, Ollie won.

429
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,988
- Watch what I do.

430
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:23,230
- Okay.

431
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,965
(Ollie making silly
noises and Finn laughing)

432
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,276
(Missy laughing)

433
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:32,443
(Ollie making silly
noises and Finn laughing)

434
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,180
Are you laughing at your brother?

435
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,574
(Ollie making silly
noises and Finn laughing)

436
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:44,339
Who doesn't love a good baby laugh?

437
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,792
(Ollie making silly
noises and Finn laughing)

438
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,388
They are the cutest things ever.

439
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:54,422
They've gotten so close over the past week

440
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:57,048
that I can't even
imagine how it's gonna be

441
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:59,250
as the years go on.

442
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,549
They literally are best friends.

443
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:01,681
It's so cute.

444
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,014
All right, boys.

445
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,554
We are cuddling into bed.

446
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:08,226
We've got our books for the
night that we're gonna read.

447
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:10,547
I can't even say enough good things

448
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:13,024
about putting these boys in the same bed

449
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:15,021
and in this little cabin bed.

450
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:17,559
It's just so cool and I feel like

451
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,393
it's really, really helped them transition

452
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:23,125
to a whole new way of bedtime
and it's just been awesome.

453
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,327
Do you guys like sharing beds?

454
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:25,522
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

455
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,986
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

456
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:30,098
If you did, give it a big thumbs up.

457
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:31,491
Ollie, give it a thumbs up.

458
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:32,991
Big toe thumbs up.

459
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,114
And, we will see you guys tomorrow.

460
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:37,115
What do you say?

461
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:38,448
- Bye.
- Boo bah.

462
00:15:39,735 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
