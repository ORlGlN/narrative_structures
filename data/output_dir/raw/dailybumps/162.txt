1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,447
- Emily asked, "Will we
be having any more kids?"

2
00:00:03,447 --> 00:00:05,342
- It's funny, because
Missy and I actually,

3
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:08,124
last night, were just talking about this.

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:09,874
We have decided that,

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,006
♫ This is our life this is our fun

6
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:16,446
♫ This is who we are

7
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:18,782
♫ This is our dream this is our team

8
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:21,343
♫ Shot among the stars

9
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:23,458
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

10
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,306
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

11
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:28,253
♫ This is our life

12
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,077
♫ Let's live it

13
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:31,798
♫ Live it forever

14
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,762
- Hey guys, we got
something cool to tell you.

15
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:37,679
- [Family] Our merch store is open!

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,386
- Yes, it has been a long time coming.

17
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,545
We've been working on this
for a long time for you, guys

18
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:45,750
and we're so excited
to share with you, guys

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,532
all of our new merch.

20
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:48,365
- Yup

21
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,574
- So cool, we're wearing it right now.

22
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:52,300
We're wearing it.
- Yeah.

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,204
- That's so neat.

24
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:54,592
- Aren't they so cute?

25
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:55,425
Look at him.

26
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:56,262
Look at Finney.

27
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:57,688
- [Bryan] Finns even got a little shirt.

28
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:59,855
Oh, cute Finn's face.

29
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:01,503
Hey, Ollie, want to show 'em your shirt?

30
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:02,336
- Yeah.

31
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:03,542
- [Bryan] All right, what is it?

32
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:05,125
- It's me and Finn.

33
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:09,088
- [Bryan] And what are
you guys dressed as?

34
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:10,364
- Dinosaurs.

35
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:11,767
- [Bryan] Dinosaurs?

36
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,790
And it's got the special,
Daily Bumps dinosaur logo.

37
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,884
Isn't that so cool?

38
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:16,717
- Yeah.

39
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:17,746
- [Bryan] Is that your
favorite shirt ever?

40
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:18,579
- Rawr.

41
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:21,644
- [Bryan] Hey, Finn.
Look at your new shirt!

42
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:23,629
What do you think dude?
- What does it say?

43
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:26,257
- [Bryan] Finn is wearing
a Daily Bumps onesie.

44
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:27,580
Check out that logo, bro.

45
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,699
- [Missy] Isn't that cute?

46
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,834
- Looking slick.
- Rawr!

47
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,623
- [Bryan] Ollie's really excited
about the dinosaur shirt.

48
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:36,847
- We got backpacks and lunch boxes.

49
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,621
- [Bryan] That's right, we do!

50
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:40,173
New backpacks are in,

51
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:43,662
so that you, guys can
look stylish at school.

52
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:47,731
So they have the dinosaur
Daily Bumps logo all over them.

53
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,896
- It's got Ollie and Finn
dressed as dinosaurs.

54
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:52,188
- [Bryan] So cute, all over.

55
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:54,196
And then, check out
this orange on the back.

56
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:56,783
I love that, that bright,
bright orange color.

57
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,754
It's really, really cool.

58
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:58,937
- I feel like this is cool,

59
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,036
because it's very, like gender neutral.

60
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:02,399
It's fun, its cute

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,397
and of course, it's Daily Bumps.

62
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,301
- [Bryan] Yeah, and it's a good backpack.

63
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:06,795
Just like the backpacks we sold last time.

64
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,811
And we also have lunch boxes.

65
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,055
Finn's going to show it off.

66
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,847
What's on the lunch box, Finn?

67
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:13,131
Is that you and Ollie?

68
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:15,165
- Yeah.
- Isn't that so cool?

69
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:16,588
- Can I take this to school?

70
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:17,580
- [Bryan] You sure can, buddy.

71
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,319
We're going to start packing your lunch

72
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,219
in this awesome Daily Bumps lunchbox.

73
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,045
- [Missy] So cute.

74
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:25,051
- [Bryan] Do you like it?

75
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:25,884
- Yeah.

76
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:26,717
- [Bryan] What's your
favorite part about it?

77
00:02:26,717 --> 00:02:28,135
- I'm a dinosaur.

78
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:29,281
- [Bryan] Yeah, you and your brother are

79
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:31,238
both dressed as dinosaurs.

80
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,632
- That's me and Finn.
- Yeah.

81
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:35,248
All right, I'm going to
have Missy walk you guys

82
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:37,116
through the rest of
the stuff that we have.

83
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:37,949
Really cool stuff.

84
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,782
- Yeah, okay.

85
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:40,013
So we've got a hat.

86
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,332
You guys, know how much I love hats.

87
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:42,472
It says Daily Bumps.

88
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:43,857
- [Bryan] Look at these colors too.

89
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:46,358
It's like a neon blue and a neon red.

90
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,263
It's embroidered, so you can feel it.

91
00:02:48,263 --> 00:02:49,665
All right, what else do we got?

92
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:53,295
- We've got PopSockets, which
I'm really excited about.

93
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:56,414
It says Daily Bumps and it's so cute.

94
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:58,002
- [Bryan] What's cool about PopSockets,

95
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:00,272
is that you can use it to
hold your phone, better.

96
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:02,814
You can also use it to
stand up your phone.

97
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:04,202
It's pretty awesome.

98
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:07,493
- And I've even got one
on mine and I'm addicted.

99
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:09,445
- So, something that we're
doing this time around

100
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:10,317
with our shop, is,

101
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:13,253
we are accommodating the entire family

102
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:15,243
and I'm going to have Missy
walk you guys through all that.

103
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:16,076
- So, as you guys can see,

104
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,563
we have basically, two designs,

105
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:20,238
we've got the dinosaur design,
which is super, super cute

106
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:21,645
and really fun and we've got the one

107
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:25,516
Bryan's wearing, right
now, which is Daily Bumps.

108
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:28,516
And then, we've got sizes in adults,

109
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,242
we've got them in youth

110
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:34,108
and we've got them in babies or toddlers,

111
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:34,941
which are super cute.

112
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:35,774
- [Bryan] Check these out.

113
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:38,152
So, these onesies come in both designs

114
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,381
and they're super comfy.

115
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,021
They're just like, the three
button closure on the bottom,

116
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,229
so, they're easy

117
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,359
and I love all the youth sizes shirts,

118
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,114
so, Ollie can get in on the fun

119
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:48,246
and of course, we've
got the adult sizes too.

120
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:51,234
- Yeah, so, we've got both
designs on all the sizes,

121
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:52,686
which is really awesome.

122
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:54,847
Everyone can wear a Daily Bumps shirt.

123
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:56,986
- So head on over to dailybumpsmerch.com

124
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,006

00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,157
to get yourself some new swag.

126
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:05,364
You guys, like all the new stuff, so cool.

127
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:07,367
I'm so excited, we finally
have merch for you guys.

128
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,821
So, go check it out.

129
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:11,093
- Good morning, guys.

130
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:14,010
I am just getting my hair all done.

131
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:17,043
Me and Kelsey worked out this morning

132
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:19,774
and we had an awesome workout.

133
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,411
- Love you.

134
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,245
- [Missy] Huh?

135
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,241
- Love you.

136
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:24,074
- I love you.

137
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:25,694
You guys having fun?

138
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:26,772
You guys, if you know,

139
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:31,001
we had to cut a dreadlock out
of Finn's hair, the other day.

140
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:34,217
If you haven't seen it,
I'll have it linked up here.

141
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:35,365
And it was actually really sad

142
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:37,121
because I had to cut his hair

143
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:40,079
and he has just made another one.

144
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,343
It's not as bad yet, but look at this.

145
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:44,341
There it is right there.

146
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:46,266
It's a little blurry, hang on.

147
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,553
Yeah, it's just a little piece.

148
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,199
He is such a little stinker.

149
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,035
I can maybe, hopefully,
I can get it out tonight,

150
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:55,589
if I put some conditioner in
it while he's taking a shower

151
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,579
but I'm worried, because it really looks

152
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,554
like he already wound it pretty tight.

153
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:02,137
(upbeat music)

154
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:05,308
- Well hello, guys.

155
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,713
My name is Bryan.

156
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:08,779
Yeah, just your normal, average,

157
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,723
daily vlogger dad, if you will.

158
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:14,624
Hey, you're not Bryan, I'm Bryan.

159
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:17,388
Sorry guys, gnome's trying
to steal my thunder.

160
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:20,153
I found both of these,
sitting in my office today

161
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,855
because apparently, the boys
were playing in the courtyard

162
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,554
and let's just say, that
their safety was compromised.

163
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:28,132
So, we brought them inside,

164
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:29,892
so that the boys couldn't break them.

165
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:32,030
Got this fun surprise in the mail.

166
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,629
It is Zach King's new
book, My Magical Life.

167
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,624
Super awesome for him to send this to us.

168
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,118
I think the boys are going to love this.

169
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:40,810
He also included some stickers

170
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,057
and I'm really excited
to read this to the boys.

171
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:44,669
I think it's going to be super fun

172
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,169
and the illustrations are
like, really, really cool

173
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,570
and bright and colorful.

174
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,912
So, thanks, Zach, for thinking of us.

175
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:51,086
We've always been a big fan

176
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,407
of all the things that
Zach does on the interwebs.

177
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:55,990
(upbeat music)

178
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,734
I am so excited, Ollie.

179
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,259
Do you know why I'm so excited?

180
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,072
- Because it's almost Halloween.

181
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,640
- That's right, it's
almost Halloween, you guys.

182
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,320
I feel like today we have been focusing

183
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,538
on getting everything ready for Halloween,

184
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,196
because we have some big plans, you guys.

185
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,280
Right?
- Oh yeah.

186
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,266
- Yeah, so we've been
planning Halloween party,

187
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:20,229
Halloween special, making
sure we have all our costumes,

188
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,607
making sure everything's ready.

189
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:23,915
- Not to mention, Finn
turns two this month.

190
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:24,994
- Oh my gosh, yes!

191
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:28,640
Finn turns two and we're
throwing that party,

192
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,190
like before the Halloween party,

193
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,916
so, there's just so much that
we're planning for this month.

He's so excited for Halloween.

197
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,670
He's so cute.

198
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,271
So, we've been kind of cooped
up in the house all day,

199
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:41,810
getting things done, making phone calls,

200
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,130
making appointment, scheduling everything,

201
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,708
so, these boys need to play.

202
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,679
So we're gonna take 'em to play.

203
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:48,512
Hey, look.

204
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:49,345
You guys, can see yourself in

205
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:52,012

206
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:55,240
- Let's play!

207
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,200

where we live, Ollie?

208
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,404
- [Oliver] Where?

209
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:04,485
- We live all the way
over here, in California.

210
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,866
Leave a comment down

- Okay, you're going to go
down the big slide, okay?

218
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:26,634
Say, whee.

219
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,300
- [Bryan] Look at this cool rock wall.

220
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,470
Can you do it?

221
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,871
Whoa, dude.

222
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:40,940
Can you go higher, Ollie?

223
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,773
Woah!

224
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:45,404

- This place, is so
overwhelming, you guys.

228

There is so much to do.

229
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:08,011
It's really crazy how much

230
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,645
there is to do here for all the kids.

231
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:11,671

232
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,410
Oh, Finn just went down the slide.

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,132
Finn just went down the slide.

235
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:17,632
That was so funny.

236
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:19,764
Good job, Finn.

237
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,358
- We're going down the slide.

238
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:26,191
(Ollie screaming)

239
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:37,991

241
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,270

245
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:48,490
That is not how you do it, Finn.

246
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,150
Bounce.

247
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,490

248
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,031

something out in my back.

249
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:54,989

250
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:55,822

- Boo!

255
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:02,350
- Oh my gosh, that scared me.

256
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,763
Whoa!

257
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:07,552
So, Ollie and I just watched
the new Star Wars trailer.

258
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,815
You excited for the movie?

And I asked him, should we dress up?

261
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,392
and what did you say Ollie?

262
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:17,035
- I want to be Darth Vader.

263
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,062
- Are we gonna be bad guys?

264
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:20,273
Yes?

265
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,412
I bought 10 tickets tonight for Star Wars,

266

little piece to our family

331
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:30,560

332
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,729

and I'm so excited.

338
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:40,704
It's going to be awesome.

339
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:43,140
(Bryan howling)

340
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,973
- All right, Ollie.

341
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:46,649
Sam asked you, "How do you feel about

342
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,701
"being so popular around the world

343
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:51,001
"and does it affect your
friendships in school?"

344
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:51,977
You know how people know your name

345
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:52,944
when we're in public?

346
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:53,777
- You know how you're like,

347
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,205
oh, that kid knows me!

348
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:56,362
Do you think that's cool?

349
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:57,254
- Mhm.

350
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:58,087
- Yeah.

351
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,067
I don't know how it affects

352
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,306
his friendships at school exactly

353
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,368
but I think, if anything,
it just makes the kids

354
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,399
feel like they know
Ollie and Ollie's like,

355
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,619
cool, let's be friends.

356
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,630
All right, well that is all for this Q&A.

357
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,257
