1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,530
- Hey Ollie, I have a question for ya.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,363
- What?

3
00:00:02,363 --> 00:00:05,672
- What is your favorite food of all time

4
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,451
in the history of the world?

5
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:08,628
- Pancakes.

6
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:09,545
- Pancakes!

7
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:14,275
What if we create some
crazy things with pancakes?

8
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,120
That sound fun?

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,953
- Hmmm mmm

10
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:22,534
♫ Wherever you are

11
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,992
♫ That's where I wanna be

12
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,706
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset

13
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:33,433
♫ Big blue eyes looked up inside

14
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,579
♫ This is home

15
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,345
♫ Just running around,
you never looked so cute

16
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:41,846
♫ How can you tell, I
(mumbles) all I could

17
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:44,312
♫ Take you

18
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:47,311
♫ I am home

19
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:51,394
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,213
(toddler laughs)

21
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:03,963
- [Bryan] Good morning Fin.

22
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:06,052
Hey buddy.

23
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,915
- [All] Good morning

24
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:13,595
- It's a perfect Saturday
morning, you guys.

25
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,023
We are watching Saturday morning cartoons.

26
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:18,912
We're eating pumpkin spice pancakes.

27
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,128
Missy made us pumpkin spice pancakes

28
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:23,260
and now she's like you guys go eat those

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,044
and I'm gonna run and work
out and be healthy and stuff.

30
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:26,877
- I will be fine.

31
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:29,741
I'm gonna go on my first
run outside the gym,

32
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:30,593
not using a treadmill,

33
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:32,657
which I'm actually, have
a lot of anxiety over

34
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:35,306
cause I'm very
- she's just gonna run.

35
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:37,013
- Like something's chasing her, you guys.

36
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,770
- Yeah, I'm trying to,

37
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,632
I'm really starting to enjoy running.

38
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,392
So I'm excited about that
- Cool.

39
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:43,225
- [Bryan] I'm glad.

40
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:44,199
- Yeah I'm gonna
- and you're using

41
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,499
- [Bryan] your headphones I got you.

42
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:46,570
- These, I love.

43
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,607
I found this in my backpack.

44
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,440
It's Kelsey's.

45
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,273
I stole it.

46
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:50,646
- [Bryan] That's funny.

47
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:51,479
You won't need that anymore

48
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,689
once you get your new Apple watch.

49
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:53,522
- Yeah I know.

50
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:54,694
- [Bryan] Just listen
to your music like that.

51
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:55,907
- And I got like an app on my phone.

52
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,669
Okay cause mainly, I'm addicted
to the treadmill numbers

53
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:00,502
and I feel like
- The stats

54
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:03,210
- you can get very addicted to those.

55
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,043
But I still have..

56
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,543
I downloaded a little app so.

57
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,376
- [Bryan] Oh it tells you it all.

58
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,487
- Yeah.

59
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,636
- [Bryan] Alright well, have fun.

60
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:13,803
- Just going on a quick
run and I'll be right back.

61
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,655
I am back from my run

62
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:19,746
and I gotta say guys,
it was pretty brutal.

63
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:20,908
I did not run that far.

64
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,000
I ran three quarters of a mile

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,439
which is really not far at all

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,851
and it was just so hard.

67
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,701
I was like why is this so hard.

68
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,704
I can so good on a treadmill.

69
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:32,991
Obviously I know why.

70
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:35,708
I was going uphill almost the entire way

71
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,118
and that is something
I'm not used to at all.

72
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:41,016
And it was just, I don't know
it was very, very different.

73
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,812
I think the treadmill
even keeps you motivated

74
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,093
cause you can't really stop

75
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:45,787
because the thing's still going

76
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:47,967
and I'm just like I'm gonna stop now

77
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,041
because I'm done.

78
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,328
This kind of is uncomfortable.

79
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:52,144
I don't know, I definitely
wanna keep doing it,

80
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:54,744
so I can get used to it

81
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:56,923
because it's something I need to do.

82
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,968
I can't just run on treadmills,

83
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:01,118
especially if I wanna do 5K's and stuff.

84
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:02,443
But anyways, it was still fun.

85
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,146
It was good for me to do the first time

86
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:06,765
and now, I'm just hanging
out with these boys.

87
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:08,463
We're excited to have a fun day today.

88
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:10,948
- So I thought I would talk
about my experience yesterday

89
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:13,858
because I was not allowed
to blog or take pictures.

90
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:17,340
So I actually took yesterday
to just get to enjoy it.

91
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,780
But yesterday, I had a
really cool opportunity

92
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,383
with the Grammy Association,

93
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:23,150
which I am now a member of,

94
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,551
which is kind of cool.

95
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:28,911
I got to go to a private
Harry Styles Q&A and show.

96
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:31,618
So he got to talk with the producer

97
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:33,086
about making his album

98
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:34,833
and then he played a song

99
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,588
and it was seriously so
encouraging and inspiring

100
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:40,325
because it was just all about the music

101
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:41,630
which is really, really cool.

102
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,417
Daniel, my producer, who I went with,

103
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:46,084
we walked away feeling super
encouraged ad inspired.

104
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,763
We have some really big
plans for music for myself

105
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:50,780
and for the famiLy, which is really neat,

106
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,903
that we've been working on.

107
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:53,249
So it was just one of those things

108
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,522
where it was like Cool, like
yes, this is what I wanna do.

109
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:56,355
I love singing.

110
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:57,540
I love writing music.

111
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,462
I love music, so.

112
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:00,754
But yeah, it was really, really, cool.

113
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,895
We got to hang out in a
room with Harry Styles

114
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,438
and there was probably
a hundred people there,

115
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:06,647
maybe less.

116
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,002
It was a super small theater.

117
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:10,067
It was a really, really
awesome experience.

118
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,677
So I thought I'd vlog
and let you guys know

119
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:13,750
cause a lot of you were begging
me to me to talk about it.

120
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,873
But yeah, they didn't allow
any pictures or video.

121
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:17,286
Of course, a ton of people broke the rules

122
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,202
but I didn't want to be disrespectful

123
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:20,393
to the Grammy Association

124
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,007
and not follow that rule.

125
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,060
Still waiting on this
guy to bloom, by the way.

126
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,220
That one is almost all shriveled up.

127
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,409
Ooh and it's actually
really hard and crispy

128
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:29,283
and could probably cut it.

129
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:31,817
This one is, hopefully about to open.

130
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:33,085
I wanna see it open.

131
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,438
Hey Ollie, I have a question for ya.

132
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:35,271
- What?

133
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:38,598
- What is your favorite food of all time

134
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:40,336
in the history of the world?

135
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:41,553
- Pancakes.

136
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:43,255
- Pancakes!

137
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:47,151
What if we create some
crazy things with pancakes?

138
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,084
That sound fun?

139
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:48,917
- Hmmm mm

140
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,244
- Yes, as you guys know,

141
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,973
we made a rainbow pancake stack.

142
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:54,114
I'll have it in the icards,
so you can watch it.

143
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:55,611
Ollie loves pancakes so much.

144
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:56,444
Look at him, he's getting ready.

145
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:58,135
He's like 'I'm ready' huh?

146
00:04:58,135 --> 00:04:58,968
You ready?

147
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:00,456
So we're gonna see what cool things

148
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:01,897
we can make out of pancakes today.

149
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:04,064
(screams)

150
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,047
Alrighty.

151
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,864
I think we are prepared for
some fun pancake art, you guys.

152
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:14,072
- We have all the colors.

153
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:14,974
- [Bryan] Look at all these colors.

154
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:17,889
We've got purple, brown, green, black,

155
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,139
red, white, yellow, orange.

156
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:22,159
Isn't that so cool?

157
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:22,992
- I'm so excited.

158
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,157
I did this a little bit yesterday,

159
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,232
so I feel like I'm really prepared.

160
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:27,065
- [Bryan] Yes.

161
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,677
- And I'm excited to
make some really cool art

162
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:29,761
and I think what we're gonna start with

163
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,786
is just a really simple emoji.

164
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:34,091
So Ollie, what emoji should we do?

165
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,924
- This one.

166
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:35,757
(gasps)

167
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:37,104
- This one?

168
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,380
This is
- Tongue out emoji.

169
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,263
- A good one.

170
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:41,808
Has some detail but I think we can do it.

171
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,218
(laughs)

172
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,160
- [Bryan] Hey Ollie, can
you stick your tongue out

173
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,410
like the emoji?

174
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,398
(laughs)

175
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:49,231
Alright, let's try it.

176
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,767
- Okay let's do it.

177
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,267
(chill music)

178
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:23,697
- Babe, that is pretty good.

179
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:26,906
- That's very beautiful color, actually.

180
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:29,323
- We'll see how it turns out.

181
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:34,635
(screams excitedly)

182
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:35,885
- Look at that.

183
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,483
That looks so cool.

184
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,451
- [Bryan] Beautiful.

185
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,595
- Isn't that cool?

186
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:45,666
- [Bryan] That is pretty dang good, babe.

187
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,499
- [Missy] Oh yeah.

188
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:49,588
- [Bryan] For the first time,
simple emoji pancake art.

189
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:51,104
Look at that.

190
00:06:51,104 --> 00:06:52,400
- Yaay.
- Is it hot?

191
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,202
- Alright, next up, I'm going
to do a very simple emoji.

192
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,324
I'm going to do the pow emoji,

193
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:00,179
cause I haven't done any pancake art.

194
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,838
We'll see how this turns out.

195
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,421
(upbeat music)

196
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,868
- Why is all red over?

197
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:23,487
- Well, I did my white layer

198
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,283
and then I did a yellow
and an orange layer

199
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:27,138
and I did a red layer on top.

200
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:28,574
(Missy laughs)

201
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,328
- [Missy] How do you think you did?

202
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,394
- It looks pretty good.

203
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:34,197
It looks like the pancake
is settling a little bit,

204
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:36,194
so it's spreading more than I want.

205
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:37,819
What do you think's gonna happen Ollie?

206
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:38,843
When we flip it?

207
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,294
- [Missy] Do you think
it's gonna look cool?

208
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,127
- Yeah.

209
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,100
- It's gonna be like a pow huh?

210
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,817
- [Missy] Do you think
it's gonna look like that?

211
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,230
- Let's see.

212
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,313
Three, two, one.

213
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:50,678
Pow!

214
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:54,834
Yeah I think I burnt it a little.

215
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:56,390
- [Missy] Oh no.

216
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,223
It looks cool.

217
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,222
I like the edging.

218
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:00,055
Like it has.

219
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:02,349
- [Bryan] Look at the little
red things that came through.

220
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,079
- [Missy] It looks good.

221
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,573
- (mumbles) because it's pretty cool.

222
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:08,406
- Yeah.
- Thanks buddy.

223
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:09,924
- High five.
- It is pretty cool.

224
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,507
(upbeat music)

225
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:17,336
- Emojis are cool and all

226
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:19,608
but I think I need a little
bit more of a challenge babe.

227
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:20,441
- Let's do it.

228
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:23,571
- I think I want to make a pancake

229
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,759
that looks like a cheeseburger.

230
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,352
I just wanna stack it.

231
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:30,186
So I'm gonna make all of
the cheeseburger parts

232
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:32,124
out of pancake and stack them all together

233
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:36,895
and see if we can make a
giant pancake cheeseburger.

234
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:37,750
Almost like a Big Mac.

235
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,188
Like a McDonald's Big Mac.

236
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:40,227
- I think that's a good idea.

237
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,706
- [Bryan] Do you think we should do that?

238
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:42,628
- Yeah.
- Okay.

239
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:44,164
- Alright, we're going
to start with the bun.

240
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:46,650
So I'm using just pancake batter here.

241
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,550
There is no color in this.

242
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,517
It's gonna give us just
a nice solid circle

243
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,610
and it's gonna be like a golden brown.

244
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,183
It's gonna be cool.

245
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,191
I think this is perfect.

246
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:59,008
Alright, I got some brown,

247
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,500
which is a beautiful color
to make a hamburger patty.

248
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,333
- [Missy] Yeah.

249
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,180
- Which is also pretty easy.

250
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,013
It's mostly just a circle.

251
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:04,846
- [Missy] I think this will be fun

252
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:06,846
cause it's like mostly the texture.

253
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,507
- [Bryan] Yeah.

254
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,942
And this one we don't
need to be super fluffy.

255
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,473
We can go for this.

256
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:16,414
(upbeat music)

257
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,260
- [Missy] That looks like a
hamburger patty if you ask me.

258
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,770
- I think so.

259
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,848
Should I season it up?

260
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:21,681
Put a little salt and pepper.

261
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:22,592
- [Missy] Yeah we should put
a little salt and pepper.

262
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,759
(giggles)

263
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,020
- Cheese time.

264
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,892
This should be pretty simple.

265
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:32,679
It should be just an orange square.

266
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,663
- [Missy] Thin square really.

267
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,080
Oh it looks nice.

268
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:38,982
What do you think Ollie?

269
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:40,443
Does that look like cheese?

270
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:42,505
(giggles)

271
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,660
Thumbs up Bryan.

272
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,341
- Lettuce time.

273
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,504
I'm using the green, you wanna see?

274
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:47,337
- Hmmm mm

275
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,283
- Alright, so excited.

276
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:50,033
He's like yaay green.

277
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,093
Tomato time.

278
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:07,835
Ketchup and mustard.

279
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:08,761
I mean this basically looks like

280
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:10,285
ketchup and mustard right now.

281
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,118
You know what I mean?

282
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:12,368
- [Missy] Yeah.

283
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:28,016
- And last but not least, the top bun.

284
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:28,985
Got this for sesame seeds

285
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,002
and this for the bun.

286
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:31,903
I'm gonna put our bottom bun right here

287
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:34,806
so that I have it as a size reference.

288
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:38,992
So we want to get as close
to that size as possible.

289
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:39,825
That good?

290
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,556
- [Missy] Yeah, looks good to me.

291
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:44,139
(techno music)

292
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:02,940
- [Bryan] Now for the final touches.

293
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,972
- Alright, we are all done
cooking each of the pieces

294
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:08,219
and now it's time to build the burger.

295
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:09,052
Are you ready?

296
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:09,885
- Yeah.

297
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:11,432
- [Bryan] And Ollie, you're
gonna do the taste test?

298
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:12,353
- Yup.

299
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,686
- Alright, first we need our bottom bun.

300
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:19,867
Okay, now we need the patty.

301
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:20,908
Do you know what the patty is?

302
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:21,741
- [Ollie] What?

303
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:22,574
- [Missy] Meat.

304
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:24,974
- [Bryan] It's an all beef Angus patty.

305
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:25,933
- Yeah

306
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,537
and of course, this is
not just a regular burger,

307
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:30,454
this is a cheeseburger.

308
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:32,637
So we gotta put the cheese on that.

309
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:34,099
- [Bryan] Oh my god, this
is just looking so cool.

310
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:35,363
- Okay ready?

311
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,783
Now you gotta add the lettuce.

312
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,493
Do you like lettuce in real life?

313
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:40,326
No?

314
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,809
- [Bryan] He's going to like this lettuce.

315
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,441
- Oh look how cool that is.

316
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,523
Alright, next we gotta add the tomatoes,

317
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:48,450
which I gotta say,
that's like my favorite.

318
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,486
- [Bryan] Thanks babe.

319
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,085
I did a pretty good job huh?

320
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,911
- [Missy] Gonna add those tomatoes.

321
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,438
- [Bryan] And then you
gotta have your condiments.

322
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,309
You got ketchup and mustard squiggles.

323
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:59,441
- You like ketchup and mustard?

324
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,495
- No.
- No?

325
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:01,695
- [Bryan] You're gonna like this one,

326
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:03,741
it's made out of pancakes.

327
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,822
- Yaay.

328
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:07,405
- Alright, ketchup and mustard.

329
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:09,958
- [Bryan] And last but not least,

330
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,559
Ollie is going to place the top bun

331
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,726
on top of our pancake burger.

332
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,242
- That is pretty cool huh?

333
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,075
- Yeah.

334
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,575
- [Bryan] Do you wanna try it?

335
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,350
And it is now taste test time.

336
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:36,370
Ollie is going to try
the cheeseburger pancake.

337
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:39,212
You ready dude?

338
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:43,359
- [Missy] Oh my god, all the
condiments are coming out.

339
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,192
How is it?

340
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,315
Yaay.
- Good.

341
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,126
- I want some syrup on it.

342
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:49,971
- [Bryan] So this is kinda funny

343
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:53,823
because Ollie will not eat
cheeseburgers in real life.

344
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:54,656
- Nope.

345
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:56,653
- But he's ready to eat it like this.

346
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:57,486
- I wouldn't eat a cheeseburger

347
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,723
with that much condiments on it either.

348
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:00,325
- I know.

349
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:01,158
Woah!

350
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:04,770
That is some taste test.

351
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,911
He just took taste test
to a whole other level.

352
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,053
What do you think?

353
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,494
And there you have it you guys,

354
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:13,021
a giant cheeseburger made out of pancakes.

355
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:13,939
That's pretty cool, huh?

356
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:15,666
Be sure to check out
the iCard in the corner

357
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,959
so you can watch our
rainbow pancake video.

358
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,159
I'm also going to link Cassie's video

359
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,349
that she just did with Missy

360
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,243
doing pancake art on her channel.

361
