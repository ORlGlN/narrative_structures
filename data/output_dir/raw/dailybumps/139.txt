1
00:00:00,304 --> 00:00:02,646
- I'm having a prank being
set up at the house right now.

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:04,351
If you don't know,
yesterday's vlog we showed

3
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:05,673
that we caught a snake.

4
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,770
A really scary looking snake
that we've never seen before.

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,318
My dad bought us a snake
that looks exactly the same.

6
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:11,151
It's huge.

7
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:12,814
It's definitely the mama.

8
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:13,958
- I wonder if there's more,

9
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,385
like, if this is a baby.

10
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:16,233
- Where's the nest?

11
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:17,450
♫ This is our life

12
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,516
♫ This is our fun

13
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:20,918
♫ This is who we are

14
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:22,106
♫ This our dream

15
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,335
♫ This is our team

16
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:25,959
♫ Shot among the stars

17
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,139
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine

18
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:30,490
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

19
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,756
♫ This is our life

20
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,752
♫ Let's live it

21
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:36,716
♫ Live forever

22
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:38,608
- Good morning!

23
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:39,441
Arg!

24
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,384
- Arg!

25
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:43,051
Good morning, my little pirates.

26
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:47,883
We're doing some early
morning boat work, right?

27
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:49,559
Trying to fix this boat.

28
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,791
- Yeah, it's a birthday party.

29
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,624
- It is?

30
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:53,457
- Yeah.

31
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:54,290
- Is that why you guys are

32
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,727
all dressed up like pirates?

33
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:57,919
Whoa!

34
00:00:57,919 --> 00:00:59,419
Can you do a spin?

35
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:01,749
That's a good looking pirate.

36
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:04,994
Finn, he's got his pirate onesie on.

37
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,644
- He's a bad pirate.

38
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:08,005
- [Bryan] And you're a good pirate?

39
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:08,838
- [Ollie] Yeah.

40
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:09,958
- [Bryan] And you guys have to battle?

41
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:10,868
- Yeah.

42
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:12,439
- Good morning, guys.

43
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,882
Today is Olivia's birthday,

44
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:17,574
which is another one of Ollie's cousins.

45
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:20,515
He's got two cousins names Olivia, huh?

46
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:22,074
And it's mermaid themed,

47
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:23,934
so we thought we would dress the boys up

48
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:25,581
in their pirate costumes,

49
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:27,736
so they can kinda fit
the theme a little bit.

50
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:29,815
All right, boys, you ready?

51
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:31,328
We're getting ready to leave right now.

52
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:33,396
Hey, Ollie, do you know where
the birthday party's at?

53
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:34,229
- Where?

54
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,551
- [Bryan] It's at the bouncy place.

55
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:37,218
The trampoline park.

56
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:39,308
You didn't know that?

57
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,380
- That's awesome!

58
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,810
- [Bryan] Okay, well,
let's go have fun, kids.

59
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,877
- Okay.
- Yeah.

60
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:45,170
- [Bryan] Yeah, you ready too?

61
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,030
- Yeah.

62
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,020
- [Bryan] Ooh, we've got a
sexy mermaid in the kitchen.

63
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,277
She's all dressed up, too.

64
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,143
Ready?
- I basically just

65
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:54,193
found another reason to wear
my mermaid tights again.

66
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:55,026
- Yes.

67
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:55,884
- CJ!

68
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:56,717
- Hi, CJ.

69
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:01,222
The kids are playing in the ball pit.

70
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:03,589
Aw.

71
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:04,594
Save him!

72
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:05,677
Save him, CJ!

73
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,894
They're headed up.

74
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:10,477
Go, go, go, go, go!

75
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,887
There's Bailey and Ollie.

76
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,686
Oh, my gosh, Finn is way up there.

77
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,877
Finn, what are you doing up there?

78
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:22,460
(upbeat music)

79
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,076
You got it, Ollie.

80
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:04,909
Whoa!

81
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:05,742
Nice.

82
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:09,181
Ollie is playing some ski ball with uncle

83
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:10,764
here at the arcade.

84
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,204
Nice!

85
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,279
Missy was just playing this hoop game

86
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,644
and I was telling her we need
one of these in our house.

87
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:19,842
How cool would that be, you guys,

88
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:21,717
to have a hoop game in our house?

89
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:23,156
We're not huge basketball fans,

90
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,269
but we do love playing these
in arcades all the time.

91
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,456
It's fun versus, too.

92
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,039
(upbeat music)

93
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:37,009
Go!

94
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:40,639
Oh, did you?

95
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,606
Oh! No!

96
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,272
No!

97
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:44,105
No.

98
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:45,997
Sorry.

99
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:49,786
You're gonna try this time, Ollie?

100
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:51,809
- [Missy] I think he did it!

101
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:52,757
- [Bryan] Oh!

102
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:53,590
No.

103
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:58,016
- They do it on purpose.

104
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,349
- He's so upset.

105
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:01,755
- [Woman] They make it so they won't grab.

106
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:02,877
- [Missy] Yeah.

107
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:04,448
- [Bryan] Ollie, it's okay.

108
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:06,297
We'll try again.

109
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,912
This is, like, the tenth try.

110
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,587
We've spent way too
much money on this game.

111
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:11,521
Try and get it, babe.

112
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:12,437
Come on.

113
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:15,100
Don't let the machine win.

114
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,209
Don't let the machine win.

115
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,713
Oh, what is that?

116
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,096
- It almost had it.

117
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,224
I'm done.

118
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:21,058
Done.

119
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:24,045
- [Bryan] Six dollars down the drain.

120
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:25,903
We're trying to get a ball, Jessica.

121
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:27,650
- I'll buy you a bouncy ball.

122
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,303
Go to the Dollar Store.

123
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,437
- [Bryan] Okay.

124
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,354
(crowd singing Happy Birthday)

125
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:37,856
She's hiding.

126
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:39,506
Where's that little mermaid?

127
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:40,589
There she is.

128
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,347
- Happy birthday, Olivia!

129
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:45,930
(upbeat music)

130
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,132
- [Bryan] Hey, Ollie,
did you have so much fun?

131
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:52,651
- Yeah, look at what I got.

132
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,513
- Ooh, you got a Ring Pop

133
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:56,836
and what else did you get at the party?

134
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:58,503
M&Ms and candy bars.

135
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah.

136
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,621
That was a fun time, huh?

137
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:05,936
Ollie's like, I wanna eat peanut
butter and jelly for lunch

138
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:08,705
so that I can eat all my candy afterwards.

139
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:11,465
That's been his favorite
thing to eat for lunch.

140
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:13,311
That's a Ring Pop, Ollie.

141
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,843
Remember, you had those at your party.

142
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:15,676
- Oh, yeah.

143
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,575
It was the pirate party yest--

144
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:18,535
- [Bryan] Yeah.

145
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:19,621
You doing okay back there, babe?

146
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:20,454
- Yeah.

147
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,620
It's a stinky one.

148
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,123
- Finn had a little poopy

149
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,188
and we just had our car cleaned out,

150
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,207
so we had no diapers stashed away.

151
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:30,901
So, he is now wearing
cousin Olivia's diaper,

152
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:33,516
which has sheep and
clouds and moons on it.

153
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:34,623
- Yeah, it's so cute.
- It was

154
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:36,389
actually really cute.

155
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,909
- All right, we had a blast
at Olivia's birthday party,

156
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,862
but now, we are getting some air and sun

157
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,860
and now, we are shopping.

158
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,693
- Look at this.

159
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:44,760
- [Missy] And the boys are pretty excited.

160
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,682
- They're in the police
cart shopping cart.

161
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:48,899
Police car shopping cart.

162
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,235
- [Missy] Are you guys in trouble?

163
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:51,068
- Nope.

164
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:53,386
- [Missy] Or are you the policeman?

165
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,608
- We're two policemen.

166
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:57,901
- Oh, so you guys are the policemen.

167
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:00,344
I thought you guys were being arrested.

168
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:01,790
I think me and daddy are the policemen

169
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,475
and we're taking you guys to jail.

170
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:04,740
- [Bryan] Yeah, we're taking you guys in.

171
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,078
- Probably for that weapon you have.

172
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:08,142
We've gotta grab some food for the house.

173
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:09,123
- You know what we really need to grab?

174
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:09,956
- [Missy] What?

175
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:10,789
- Candy.

176
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:11,832
- [Missy] Oh, my gosh.

177
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,144
- [Bryan] Yep, it's that time.

178
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:15,117
- I hate when candy's in the house.

179
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:16,521
- I love candy in the house

180
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,721
and I've been craving it.

181
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:18,843
- I do like candy,

182
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:22,777
but when there's candy, this
guy can't even think straight.

183
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:23,720
- Look at this.

184
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,373
- [Missy] Oh, my gosh.

185
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:26,389
- That's pretty cool.

186
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,222
- Yeah.

187
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,412
- [Missy] How neat is that?

188
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:29,850
Jack Skellington.

189
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,983
(singing the Nightmare
Before Christmas theme)

190
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,150
- Put it back.

191
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:39,004
- [Missy] This cart is filling up fast

192
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:41,497
and I think a lot of the reason is 'cuz

193
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:44,043
it's mostly filled with two kids.

194
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:44,876
- Yeah.

195
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,651
You guys are cutting in
on our storage, here.

196
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:49,604
- Yeah, but you know what?

197
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,545
It's pretty nice 'cuz they
have been really enjoying

198
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,354
driving around in the police car

199
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:54,937
and it's kept them very well entertained

200
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:56,414
and contained while we shop.

201
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,938
Okay, guys, me and Bryan
are shopping right now,

202
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:00,638
but what he doesn't
know is that I actually

203
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:02,075
convinced him that we need to go shopping

204
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:03,769
because we need to stall.

205
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,638
I'm having a prank being set
up at the house right now.

206
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,071
If you don't know,
yesterday's vlog we showed

207
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:09,312
that we caught a snake.

208
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:11,528
A really scary looking snake
that we've never seen before.

209
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:12,825
I'll have it linked up here so you can see

210
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:13,750
what it looks like.

211
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,319
My dad bought us a snake
that looks exactly the same.

212
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,152
It's huge.

213
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:18,580
It's definitely the mama.

214
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,701
- Okay, Missy.

215
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,800
Don't show this video to Bryan,

216
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,550
but I just bought this on Amazon.

217
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:27,055
He's hiding.

218
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,395
- And so, my parents
are setting up the prank

219
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:29,865
right now so when we get home,

220
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:32,639
he's going to hopfully grab a package

221
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,315
and the snake's gonna
slither out and get him.

222
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:36,811
Let's see how it goes.

223
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm nervous.

224
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,956
Hopefully, he doesn't find out.

225
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,250
- [Mom] So, this is the package that

226
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,983
was down by the gate.

227
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,751
It has fresh flowers in it.

228
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:46,668
Normally, it is sitting by the gate

229
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,096
or by the front door.

230
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,485
Maybe Luna got a hold of it.

231
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:54,614
I don't know, but it's
gonna be over by the steps.

232
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:57,197
(sneaky music)

233
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:02,086
Okay, so here's where
the package is gonna be.

234
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:05,488
Here's where the snake is gonna be.

235
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:08,071
(sneaky music)

236
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,721
That pretty good?

237
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:17,304
(sneaky music)

238
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:20,657
- All right, we made it out,

239
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,135
but not without two carts.

240
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,169
- Yeah.

241
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,248
Big trip this time.

242
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:25,669
- We ended up needing two.

243
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:29,031
This is just a little cart, okay?

244
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,165
But now we've got all the
snacks, all the food, huh?

245
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:32,486
You guys ready to go home?

246
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:33,597
- We got this!

247
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,806
- [Missy] Oh, yeah, and candy.

248
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:36,905
Daddy really wanted candy, huh?

249
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:38,068
- Yeah, I like these ones.

250
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,112
- He likes those ones.

251
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:40,918
All right, guys, we're locked and loaded.

252
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,121
He's headed for the box
that's out in the thing.

253
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:45,330
It's got flowers in it

254
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,584
and so, he's pretty excited
to grab his flowers.

255
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:48,800
Here we go.

256
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,717
(mysterious music)

257
00:08:58,874 --> 00:08:59,730
- Holy (beep)

258
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,956
Oh, my gosh.

259
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,539
(upbeat music)

260
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,659
(laughing)

261
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:17,199
- You are the worst!
- What was it?

262
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:18,415
What was it?

263
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:20,665
(laughing)

264
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:24,794
Oh, my gosh.

265
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:28,702
I've been waiting all day
for you to get this box.

266
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,292
- Whatever!

267
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,165
(laughing)

268
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:35,290
- [Missy] It's really scary.

269
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,729
- That this is really freaking scary.

270
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:37,861
- [Missy] That's the mama.

271
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,159
The mama's here.

272
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,492
The mama came to get you.

273
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:41,663
It think we got him.

274
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:43,078
- Got him, oh yeah!

275
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:44,095
- He just got shut down.

276
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:45,616
- [Missy] Look, Bryan.

277
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:46,616
Look, Bryan.

278
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:48,914
- [Dad] Oh, it's still going.

279
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:49,747
Awesome.

280
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,124
I don't know if that one's still going.

281
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:54,179
- Dang it!

282
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,274
You were taking forever.

283
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:58,606
I was like, Bryan, I'll
put away the dishes

284
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:00,551
and I'll put away all the groceries.

285
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,313
He's like, what am I gonna do though?

286
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:03,146
I'm gonna be so bored.

287
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,444
I'm like, go get your freaking box.

288
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:07,861
- He said you'd take forever.

289
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,129
- [Missy] Little stinker.

290
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,637
- Am I really that blind?

291
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:14,931
Missy got me so good, you guys.

292
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,130
That was seriously a
very impressive prank.

293
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,510
Not only did she do that
while we were out shopping,

294
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,485
she got her mom and dad to join in on it

295
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:24,002
and even set it up.

296
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:26,471
- I know, I have never
been good at doing pranks.

297
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:28,452
There were a couple times
that even when in the store

298
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:30,113
I was, like, trying to
vlog without him knowing.

299
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:31,606
He's like, why are you being so weird.

300
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:32,848
- I know, she's like, I
need to go get medicine.

301
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:36,147
I was like, we're going
that way, let's go together

302
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:38,049
and she was being so annoying about it.

303
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,870
- Oh, I forgot the cream of chicken soup.

304
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,125
And then, I like ran down to go get it.

305
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,618
- Whatever.
- But it worked.

306
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:43,821
I did it.

307
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:44,916
Yes.

308
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,077
- [Bryan] Yes, she pranked me.

309
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:48,057
- It was really good,

310
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:50,405
but we did come home to some bad news.

311
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:53,390
- You guys know we got a couple
of clown fish the other day.

312
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,500
We got two of the normal ones

313
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,367
and then, we got a designer clown fish

314
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,329
that was actually bred

315
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:00,729
and when we put the three
of them in the tank,

316
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,866
I knew right away that something was wrong

317
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:04,686
with the designer one.

318
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,735
It was very, very aggressive and fast

319
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,582
and it would, like, hit the other fish

320
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:10,232
and I was like, what is going on.

321
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:13,268
So, that's the normal clown fish,

322
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:14,787
that's the designer one, the white one.

323
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:17,757
That one is very aggressive and it killed

324
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,423
our other clown fish, you guys.

325
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,543
I'm so sad.

326
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:24,001
We came home and we just
found him lying there

327
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:27,300
and look, she's even nipping at this one.

328
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,202
I'm so bummed and that means,
basically, she's a girl.

329
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:32,699
When the clown fish is aggressive,
that means it's the girl.

330
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:33,782
- I'm pretty sure it's a girl

331
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,831
and you can tell now,
like, she's got, like,

332
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:38,351
the Nemo one has, like, scuffs on it.

333
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:40,237
- Yeah, it looks really beat up and stuff,

334
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:42,625
so it's kinda sad 'cuz
we're probably gonna have to

335
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,091
get rid of that one if
she's gonna be eating

336
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:46,216
my beautiful clown fish,

337
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:47,893
which is sad 'cuz she's pretty, too,

338
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:50,220
but maybe we'll try another
designer clown fish,

339
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,050
but if they're aggressive at all,

340
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,608
then we can just take them back

341
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:55,747
instead of waiting for them to do damage,

342
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:56,580
you know what I mean?

343
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,889
- And we're already
worried about this one.

344
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,249
We can't really do anything
with her right now.

345
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,308
- [Bryan] Yeah.

346
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:04,490
I'm like, you better leave him alone.

347
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,360
- I think we're gonna try and feed them

348
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,792
a little bit of food.

349
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:10,311
Maybe she's just hungry or bored.

350
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:13,921
- [Bryan] I fed them
this morning, but okay.

351
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:16,733
That shouldn't be much of an excuse.

352
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,520
Get it, guys, get it.

353
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,986
Get it Pearl.

354
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:22,784
If you're friendly, we'll keep you, okay?

355
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,143
They're so happy.

356
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,370
Look at them.

357
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,331
- [Missy] Here comes Felix.

358
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,601
- [Bryan] Oh, there's Felix.

359
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:28,523
Felix is coming out.

360
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:29,356
He's like, hey, guys.

361
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:30,191
How's it going?

362
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,657
- [Missy] Oh, got myself a bloodworm.

363
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:33,773
Oh, and another one.

364
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:35,929
- [Bryan] Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

365
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,107
I love these fish, you guys.

366
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:38,348
They're so cool.

367
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:41,120
I'm so bummed we lost one of our Nemos.

368
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,729
We're gonna have to get
a couple more of those

369
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,674
'cuz they like to be in groups of three.

370
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:46,743
This is the culprit, I believe.

371
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:47,576
We'll see.

372
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:48,409
I'm gonna ask.

373
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:49,491
I'm gonna call the guys at the fish shop

374
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:51,322
and see if that's, like, something that

375
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:52,545
this fish is even capable of doing.

376
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,250
Hey! Get away from him!

377
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,716
Hey!

378
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:56,549
Hey!

379
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,030
See, she's naughty!

380
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,689
- We are now at my mom's house.

381
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,910
Although, I took her out on her birthday,

382
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,348
we went shopping and all that,

383
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:07,002
I did get her one more specific present.

384
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,678
I think she knows what it is.

385
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:12,519
- Well, not very many things are round.

386
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,796
- [Missy] This is her present.

387
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,993
Me and Bryan consider this
a more sentimental gift.

388
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,045
- It's a new microwave.

389
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:21,812
- [Missy] Yeah.

390
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:24,532
It's a very new, different
kind of microwave.

391
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:25,946
- New microwave.

392
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:28,660
- [Bryan] But me and Bryan
consider it more sentimental.

393
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,087
What is it, Ollie?

394
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:30,997
- I don't know.

395
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:33,518
- [Dad] It's an I don't know.

396
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:35,968
- It's that new kind of
paper that doesn't tear.

397
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:36,885
- [Dad] Oh.

398
00:13:41,224 --> 00:13:42,057
- [Missy] A clock.

399
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:44,129
A new giant clock.

400
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,140
- That's nice.

401
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,973
- Yeah.

402
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:46,868
The last one broke.

403
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,698
- [Missy] Yeah, we bought
them a giant clock in Idaho.

404
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:50,658
- That was in Idaho?
- Yeah, years ago

405
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:53,140
we bought that last one in Idaho.

406
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,029
- It was a long time ago

407
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,572
and I remember them being, like--

408
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:57,008
- Thanks for the giant clock

409
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:58,242
and then, you guys loved it.

410
00:13:58,242 --> 00:13:59,084
- Yeah.

411
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:00,361
We used it all the time

412
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,975
and when it wasn't
working, we were like, aw.

413
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:02,808
- And you know what?

414
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:03,745
It should go right there.

415
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:04,749
- [Missy] Yeah, that's
perfect right there.

416
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:05,863
- Yeah, that is a good spot.

417
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:07,128
- Yeah, this is pretty cool.

418
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,794
There was a bigger one

419
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:11,504
and we didn't go with the bigger one.

420
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:12,337
- It's nice.

421
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:13,364
I like London, England, too.

422
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:16,083
- Yeah, we went to London, so.

423
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,730
All right, we have had so
much fun at Mimi's, huh?

424
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,905
And we had so much fun.
- Yeah.

425
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:23,277
- Like, yeah, it's very late.

426
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:24,730
Are we tired?

427
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,825
Yeah.

428
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:26,658
Are you tired?

429
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,491
- Yeah.

430
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,329
- Yeah.

431
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:30,916
We had so much fun at Liv's birthday

432
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,545
and we just had a really, really good day,

433
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:36,114
but now, the boys actually
got to take a bath

434
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:37,564
and eat dinner here

435
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:38,924
and now, we're gonna head home, huh?

436
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:40,705
He's like, I'm so tired, mom.

437
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,083
All right, well, let's just go ahead

438
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,847
and give this video a big thumbs up

439
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:47,501
and I just gotta say, I'm still so excited

440
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:51,213
that I got Bryan, I pranked him so good.

441
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,948
Actually, my parents helped me a lot.

442
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:55,992
I could not have done it without them

443
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,195
and it was kinda my dad's idea.

444
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,417
So, we got you good.
- It was a group effort.

445
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,883
- Yeah.

446
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:03,367
So, anyways, we got you good,

447
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:04,862
but anyways, make sure you give this video

448
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,733
a big thumbs up, right, boys,

449
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:09,597
who are making a total mess right now?

450
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:12,465
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

451
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:13,798
What do you say?

452
00:15:18,626 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
