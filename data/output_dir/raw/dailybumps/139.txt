1
00:00:00,337 --> 00:00:01,569
- Hey can I hold your candy?

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,292
- No.
- Come on man.

3
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:05,992
Just let me hold it, I'll
hold your hand though.

4
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,919
- Finn can I hold your candy?

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,889
- No.

6
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:09,989
(laughing)

7
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,962
- [Missy] Finn can I hold your candy?

8
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:12,795
- No.

9
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:18,260
♫ This is our life, let's live it

10
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,028
♫ Live it forever

11
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:22,611
(spooky music)

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,370
- Happy Halloween!

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,880
It's Halloween you guys.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,691
- Yay! I'm already in costume.

15
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,822
- [Bryan] Missy's gonna be
dressed like this all day.

16
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:35,846
- I just wanna be comfortable.

17
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:37,391
- Yes good morning guys.

18
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:39,493
It is finally Halloween.

19
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:41,447
The boys are so excited
to go trick or treating.

20
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:43,907
Ollie is at school where they're
having a Halloween party.

21
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:45,340
- Yeah, Halloween party.

22
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,322
- [Bryan] So I have been
watching this little monster

23
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:50,155
all morning who is a little crazy.

24
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,021
Yeah, but yeah this is probably
a good thing for you to wear

25
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:57,196
all day babe because it's
freezing and it's actually

26
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:59,019
sprinkling right now on the camera.

27
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,300
- I have to make sure the boys
are gonna be warm tonight.

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,266
- Yeah.
- We don't normally

29
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,432
have to deal with this so much

30
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:04,712
but it's gonna be cold tonight.

31
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:06,479
- I know I love that California was like,

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,928
"oh it's almost November first
okay, I'll make it cold."

33
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:11,272
(laughing)

34
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,466
Yeah we're ready for the winter.

35
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:16,075
If you guys are looking for
our annual Halloween special

36
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,932
we do every single year as a family,

37
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:19,990
we put that up a couple
days ago because we wanted

38
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,972
to put it up early; so if
you check out the link in the

39
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:24,809
icard now, you can watch
our new Halloween special

40
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:26,226
where we did the
nightmare before Christmas

41
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:27,603
and it was so much fun.

42
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:31,319
Probably like our craziest,
best, Halloween special yet.

43
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,122
I am walking through the
courtyard and down here

44
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:34,698
because I wanna show you guys something,

45
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:36,067
but I don't know if you
got a real clear picture of

46
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,311
during our Halloween party.

47
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,846
Look what we have going on over here.

48
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:44,062
This is the well; we did a Halloween party

49
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,224
and we did a really cool
haunted maze and like

50
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:48,582
interactive adventure
that was Ring themed,

51
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:52,259
so this was the well and
it's just a bunch of bricks.

52
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,075
Look at all the tapes in
there; people had to throw

53
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:56,349
the cursed tapes in here
to like get rid of it

54
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,763
and then Samara was
like climbing out of it.

55
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:01,624
It was kind of nuts; there's
even like moss everywhere.

56
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:03,607
I love that; I thought
that was pretty genius.

57
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,475
Some people were like riding
through here on the Polaris

58
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,680
and then they look and they see Samara

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,649
coming out of the well.

60
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,431
We definitely love Halloween you guys.

61
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,205
It's one of our fun holidays
because the kids love

62
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:16,142
dressing up and pretending
to be other people basically.

63
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:18,494
By the way this is all
cleared out super nicely.

64
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:19,900
It didn't used to be like this.

65
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,377
We have plans to do like a little park

66
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:24,120
hopefully by early next year.

67
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,471
- Alright guys, I am
actually getting ready to

68
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:28,991
pick up Ollie and I am
dressed as a gorilla.

69
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:31,102
I told you guys I'm wearing
this gorilla suit all day.

70
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,762
It's not only just so
comfortable, but it's warm

71
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:37,574
and it's Halloween so I can
wear whatever I want right?

72
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,966
So I'm excited to see what he
thinks when I'm wearing this

73
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,051
in front of all his friends.

74
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,932
I hope he's not embarrassed.

75
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:45,321
Alright now that I'm out of the
car I'm actually embarrassed

76
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,302
so here we go.

77
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:47,135
Hi!

78
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,415
Happy Halloween.

79
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:52,683
Did you have a fun Halloween party?

80
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:53,944
You ready to come home with Mama?

81
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:54,922
- Yeah.

82
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:57,466
- I just missed you so much.

83
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:00,285
Alright Ollie what did you
think of Mommy dressed up?

84
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:01,144
- Good.

85
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:02,337
- Were you embarrassed at all?

86
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:03,604
No?

87
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:05,596
Did you think it was pretty cool?

88
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:07,353
- Yeah.
- You got a pretty cool Mama.

89
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,319
Everyone was looking at me
like, what is she dressed as?

90
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,140
Why is she wearing that, but it was fun.

91
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,245
I think he liked it.

92
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:15,293
Alright we got one more place to go into.

93
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,547
Are you ready to go
shopping with your gorilla?

94
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,407
- Um, yeah.
- Yeah.

95
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,661
We gotta get candy to pass
out for trick or treaters, so.

96
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,161
Let's go shopping.

97
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:26,611
I think that's enough candy.

98
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:29,194
(spooky music)

99
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:33,254
- Alright it is pumpkin carving time

100
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,112
and I'm not sure what I'm gonna carve,

101
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:36,297
but it's the perfect time to pumpkin carve

102
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:39,519
because Finn is taking a nap;
he needs to take a nap tonight

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,554
or he's not gonna be able
to go trick or treating

104
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,855
and he can't really carve pumpkins.

105
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,248
Ollie what do you wanna
carve into your pumpkin?

106
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:46,308
- I'm going to carve a bat.

107
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:47,191
- [Bryan] A bat?

108
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:48,954
- Yeah.
- Alright good luck with that.

109
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:51,735
This is the future; Ollie look at this.

110
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:54,103
Look at this pumpkin carver.

111
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:57,592
You just push this button,
automatic pumpkin carve.

112
00:03:57,592 --> 00:04:00,234
We did not have that growing up Ollie.

113
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,912
What what're you doing?

114
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:03,784
Don't stab your pumpkin.

115
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,280
Okay, this is what
happens when you let your

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,016
four year old carve a pumpkin.

117
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,625
Alright, I'm gonna help you okay?

118
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,208
(spooky music)

119
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,164
Alright Ollie I cut the
top, can you pull it?

120
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,829
Pull it super hard.

121
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,173
You got it, almost got it.

122
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:22,223
Oh, it's actually really in there huh?

123
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:24,033
Whoa!
- Whoa.

124
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:27,118
- See now you can take it off.

125
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:28,093
Look at those.

126
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,514
- Ew.
- Ew.

127
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,639
That's what the inside
of a pumpkin looks like.

128
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,283
- [Missy] Now we gotta
get all the seeds out.

129
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,273
- You gotta get all that out now, okay?

130
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:39,384
- He's like, ah--
- Don't worry.

131
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:42,625
It's the 21st century; we have
tools for this kind of thing.

132
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,766
- [Missy] He's so afraid of the gunk.

133
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,883
Ollie your hands are
going to get dirty okay?

134
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:46,853
- Yeah it's okay if your hands get dirty.

135
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,734
That's why it's fun, 'kay?

136
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:48,652
- [Missy] We'll wash our hands after.

137
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:49,777
- Do you wanna take your shirt off?

138
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:51,407
- [Missy] Watch Mama, ready?

139
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:55,200
- Hand going in the pumpkin.
- Oh look at all the guts.

140
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,603
- But you know what, he's a lot like me

141
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:59,288
because I do not stick my
hand in pumpkins anymore.

142
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:00,682
I did that when I was
a kid and I was like,

143
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:01,761
you know what I'm over that.

144
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,690
- Well he's a kid--
- This thing works amazing.

145
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,958
- [Missy] I know, and now we gotta save

146
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,962
all the pumpkin seeds so we
can eat them later, 'kay?

147
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:10,649
- Are you gonna eat those later Ollie?

148
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:11,482
- Um, no.

149
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,511
- He's like--
- So all you do is

150
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,749
you scrape the inside of your pumpkin

151
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:21,258
and then you take it out
and put it in the bowl.

152
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:22,130
Can you do that?

153
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,464
- Okay.
- There you go, kiddo.

154
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:26,047
(spooky music)

155
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:33,228
This is Ollie's bat, huh Ollie?

156
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:35,902
- [Missy] So Daddy drew out a bat for you.

157
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,246
- This is an easy part, okay?

158
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:38,310
See the wing?

159
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,500
Go ahead and try.

160
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,331
- [Missy] You gotta
saw it, back and forth.

161
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:42,714
- There you go, keep going.

162
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:44,797
Good job, just like that.

163
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:47,778
There you go.

164
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:50,395
- [Missy] It's hard.

165
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,380
- You wanna pull that piece out?

166
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,213
- Yeah.
- Oh one side.

167
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,100
Oo, that looks so good.

168
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:02,396
Wow!

169
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,025
- Hopefully it'll look like a bat.

170
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,870
Say hi.
- Hi.

171
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,609
- We're carving pumpkins.

172
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:11,307
Ollie's vlogging.

173
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,476
- What does it look like Ollie?

174
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:13,893
- Um, a pumpkin.

175
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:17,542
- You don't see anything specific?

176
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,920
Who is it?

177
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,170
- Um, a zombie.

178
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:23,946
- Oh my goodness.
- Jack.

179
00:06:23,946 --> 00:06:25,470
- [Missy] Yes.

180
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,303
- Mama's carving Jack.

181
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:31,801
Finn doesn't know to carve a pumpkin.

182
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:34,384
(spooky music)

183
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:50,983
- So we are over at Mimi
and Papa's house now

184
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,917
and the boys are getting
their costumes on.

185
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:57,304
The sky is starting to darken
which means it's almost time

186
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:58,366
to trick or treat.

187
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:02,045
Oh my goodness would you
look who just walked in.

188
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:04,174
Jack Skellington.
- It's just me.

189
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,481
- [Bryan] Oh it's just you, okay.

190
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,065
You ready to go trick or treating, buddy?

191
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,535
- Yep.
- Yep.

192
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:10,075
Finn's getting his ballet tights on

193
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:13,800
and he seriously looks like a
ballet dancer, it's so cute.

194
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,647
Look at him.

195
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,814
- Do a little twirl ready?

196
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,268
(screaming)

197
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,593
- [Bryan] You're gonna
have to catch that ghost.

198
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:23,426
Ah!

199
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,857
Costume going on.

200
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:28,116
Good job kiddos.

201
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:31,582
- Now we need your collar.

202
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,801
- That's so cool.
- He got chocolate on it.

203
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:38,191
- [Bryan] And look
we've got Jack and Zero.

204
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,151
- Is it on right?
- Is it on?

205
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:40,984
Yay!

206
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:44,840
Finn you look so cute buddy.

207
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,929
- Oh my gosh are you a dog?

208
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,012
Go bark bark.

209
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:51,128
- I'm the real Jack.

210
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:53,416
- Oh my gosh, you're the
real Jack, not the fake one.

211
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,959
- [Bryan] The real Jack
Skellington you guys.

212
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,221
- Say trick or treat.

213
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,628
- [Bryan] Yeah if you could
teach him trick or treat

214
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,161
that'd be great.

215
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:01,994
He just say, ba ba ba.

216
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:06,916
- Trick or treat
- Trick or treat.

217
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,962
You look so good Jack Skellington.

218
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:10,522
You ready to go trick or treating buddy?

219
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,486
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

220
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:14,872
So what're you gonna tell
people when you see 'em

221
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:16,622
as Jack; what does Jack say?

222
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,587
He says, "I'm the pumpkin king".

223
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:23,013
- I'm the pumpkin king.
- That's right.

224
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:25,234
And Zero you gotta work on your bark okay?

225
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:26,635
Say bark bark.

226
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,370
And we got their buckets for tonight.

227
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,697
Funny story, I actually
thought very much ahead

228
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:34,794
about like a month ago
ordered their buckets

229
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:36,762
so that they have 'em custom embroidered

230
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,894
and they came and they were
super cute and I was excited

231
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,683
to get them to them and then
we couldn't find them anywhere.

232
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:44,282
That's what we get for
ordering things early.

233
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:46,133
- I know I feel like anytime
we were like trying to be

234
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:47,733
extra prepared it doesn't work.

235
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:48,640
- [Bryan] Yeah.

236
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,023
- Hey Finn, um, who's that?
- Batman.

237
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,418
- [Ollie] That's the real Batman.

238
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:56,074
- [Missy] That is a real Batman.

239
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:58,028
- Does Batman need reading glasses?

240
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:02,834
- [Missy] Batman, what happened
to your eyesight Batman?

241
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,095
- I have eye problems.

242
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:06,178
Are you being a good boy?

243
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,486
- [Missy] What do you think of that?

244
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,195
Do you like that?
- Yeah.

245
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,028
- Give Batman a kiss.

246
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:14,128
[Missy] Give Batman kisses.

247
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:16,034
(laughing)

248
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,080
He's like scared of him.

249
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,386
Alright we're off to go trick or treating.

250
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,929
Oh my little boys look so cute.

251
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:26,343
And he's down, first one.

252
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:27,593
You okay buddy?

253
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:30,452
Alright boys.

254
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,630
My mom's a giraffe; we're
going trick or treating.

255
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,547
Here we go.

256
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,921
Finn are you gonna say trick or treat?

257
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:36,819
- Trick or treat.

258
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,277
- [Mimi] They haven't opened the door yet.

259
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,110
- Hello!

260
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,927
- [Missy] Stage fright.

261
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:44,863
- There you go sweetie.

262
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:45,696
Which one you like?

263
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:46,529
You like this one?

264
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:47,576
- Yeah.
- Alright.

265
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:48,409
- [Mimi] What do you say?

266
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:50,771
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

267
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,195
- [Missy] Say thank you.

268
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,028
- Bye.

269
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:55,339
- [Missy] Was that so cool?

270
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

271
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,365
I think he literally got a
stage fright and was like

272
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,496
oh my gosh there's candy in front of me.

273
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,246
I'm just gonna grab it and go.

274
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:03,666
Look at Luna's joining us.

275
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,774
- Luna's going trick or treating.

276
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,018
- Luna's first trick or treating.

277
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:10,388
I think um Karma has
come with us a few times

278
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:12,284
trick or treating so
this is Luna's first time

279
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,857
and Karma's taking a break this year.

280
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:17,251
(spooky music)

281
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,668
- Trick or treat.

282
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:21,519
- [Missy] You have to wait
until they open Ollie, 'kay?

283
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,986
- Hello.
- What do you say?

284
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,170
You gotta say trick or treat.

285
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,314
- Trick or treat.

286
00:10:26,314 --> 00:10:27,242
(laughing)

287
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,763
- [Missy] There you go.

288
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:29,910
Say thank you.

289
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,837
- Take a couple more.

290
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:33,032
Here, you guys are so cute.

291
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,638
What about you Batman,
you need some candy?

292
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:35,555
- I'm good.

293
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,577
- You guys I'm just so surprised that he's

294
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:42,429
wearing his costume
because it was a struggle

295
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:44,449
the whole time we were
filming our Halloween special.

296
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:47,507
I think he realizes if he keeps
it on, then he gets candy.

297
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:50,090
(spooky music)

298
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:04,015
Alright we are still
practicing our trick or treat.

299
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:05,964
Hopefully we get it right this time right?

300
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,131
- Okay.
- Okay.

301
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,046
Hi, what do you say?

302
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:13,618
- Trick or treat.
- Yeah!

303
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:17,000
- [Mimi] Oo that's a nice policeman.

304
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,561
- [Missy] What do you say now?

305
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:20,770
- Thank you.
- Good job.

306
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,430
- You did it Ollie; you
said trick or treat.

307
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,013
(spooky music)

308
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:37,346
Poor Ollie is like, um
that's a little scary.

309
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,345
(laughing)

310
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,598
- [Mimi] You know he's just
a toy from the store right?

311
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:44,181
(spooky music)

312
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:47,751
- Trick or treat.

313
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,641
- Hey can I hold your candy?
- No.

314
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:50,630
- Come on man.

315
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,313
Just let me hold, oh I'll
hold your hand though.

316
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,146
- Finn can I hold your candy?
- No.

317
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:59,768
- Finn can I hold your candy?
- No.

318
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:00,932
(laughing)

319
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:04,202
- So we are headed to a street
that we have been eyeing

320
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:07,982
since Halloween season started
and it is a Jack Skellington

321
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:11,239
house so the kids are
all in their costumes

322
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,773
and ready to meet Jack.

323
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:14,857
You excited?

324
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:16,347
- Ya!

325
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:19,117
- [Missy] Look Ollie it's Sally.

326
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,190
And there's Jack.

327
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,543
- There's Zero!
- And Zero's over there.

328
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,460
Alright get your candy.

329
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,480
Yeah, Finn get your candy.

330
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,375
They're obsessed with this right here.

331
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,375
- Thank you.

332
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:38,419
(upbeat music)

333
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:54,058
- [Missy] Alright boys how you doing?

334
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:56,805
- Good.
- Are you getting tired?

335
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:57,748
Yeah.

336
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:58,581
- Finn you're worn out.

337
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,970
You want me to hold your candy?

338
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,943
- He can barely walk, but.

339
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:04,711
Finn let's go.

340
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,204
The boys are exhausted to
so we're heading back now.

341
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,450
Their buckets are full, oh my gosh.

342
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,091
He just threw out all his little sticks.

343
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,477
Come on Finny.

344
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:15,913
By the way did anyone
find it ironic that my mom

345
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:16,975
is the giraffe?

346
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:18,913
She's like the shortest person and

347
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:22,734
she's like the tallest
animal so, kind of funny.

348
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:26,707
- [Bryan] Whoa, look at all
that candy you got dude.

349
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:28,352
- Yeah.
- What do you thinking

350
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:29,974
right now; are you pretty excited?

351
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:30,808
- Yeah.

352
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:32,866
- [Bryan] So I take it you
got your favorite candy,

353
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,876
Skittles covered, right?

00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,625

00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,673
Yes, daddy's favorite.

372
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:12,327
This is your Halloween tax.

373
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:13,954

374
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,116

Can you give auntie something?

376
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:18,187
Are you ready to share?

377
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,138
- That's not a lot of candy.

378
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:20,137

379
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,157

00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,324

381
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,824
- This is not that much
candy if you ask me.

382
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:29,323
- You're supposed to give 'em pillowcases,

383
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:30,801

384
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:31,799
- They have little legs.

385
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,344
There's only so far they can go.

386
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:36,177
Good job little ghost.

387
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,499
