00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:06,117
- Okay.

00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:07,127
Game over.

- Good morning, did
you guys take a shower?

17
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,321
Haven't brushed your head yet, huh?

18
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:36,460
Good morning guys, we
are all ready for the day

19
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,770
but we're a little bumped because

20
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,135
we haven't seen Fred yet, huh?

21
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:41,527
Where's Fred?

22
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:44,574
We've been looking everywhere
for him, we can't find him.

23
00:00:44,574 --> 00:00:46,387
He must just be still
busy with Santa Claus,

24
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:48,269
I'm sure he'll be here later, okay?

25
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:49,752
No one get too worried.

26
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:53,313
Also, it is actually
16 days till Christmas,

27
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:55,775
so, let's just change that real quick.

28
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:58,077
Oh my gosh, it's official,
16 days till Christmas!

29
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:58,910
Ah!

30
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,958
Oh, and 16 days till Christmas.

31
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,739
There, now we're ready for 16
days till Christmas, right?

32
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:06,880
- Hello guys!

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,016
And hello Karma, you hanging
out in the truck with us?

34
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:13,042
He is so funny, he's got his leg,

35
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,704
his back leg's up on the seat

36
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:16,504
and his front leg's in front of them

37
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:18,688
and he's like so happy now.

38
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,786
Karma's going to a little
check up with the vet.

39
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:25,126
- Yeah, we're hoping like, he's just been

40
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,881
gaining a lot of weight and
he's not normally like this.

41
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,298
I hope he's okay.

42
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:33,160
Maybe he needs to go on a diet,

43
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,622
maybe he needs a little more exercise.

44
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:37,077
- Yeah, I mean it happens to us all

45
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:38,555
around Christmas time right?

46
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:39,857
It's like...

47
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:43,715
- Well, keep in mind, he is
gonna be eight this year.

48
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:45,039
- Eight, wow!

49
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,526
- Eight years old, like that's
so old and it scares me.

50
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,616
- Yeah so, we're taking him in,

51
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:52,709
we're gonna see if he's doing okay.

52
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,760
He wants to be a kitty,
wants to sit in the...

53
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,916
The actual car seat.

54
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,741
Put that one that way.

55
00:01:58,741 --> 00:01:59,574
Perfect, just like that.

56
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:01,337
You wanna try, Finn?

57
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:02,170
- It's almost tall.

58
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,314
- Oh no, almost.

59
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:07,289
That should be like that
though, isn't that cool?

60
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,295
The kids are doing some tower
building with these blocks

61
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,579
that we left out there.

62
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,616
Oh, almost Finn!

63
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:13,866
I got it, oh...

64
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,254
It's okay.

65
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:18,254
I'll fix it.

66
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:22,380
It's okay, accidents happen.

67
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,448
Alright, keep going, Ollie.

68
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,765
How high can we make it?

69
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:26,598
- I don't know!

70
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:29,192
- Now it's got a little star on it.

71
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,025
- Ya.

72
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:34,143
- Other way, turn it.

73
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:36,339
Almost, you gotta go like
this and then like this,

74
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,922
and then like this.

75
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:42,002
Whoa, that's a cool looking tower, dude!

76
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:44,584
Yeah, so Fred has still
not shown up today,

77
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,025
we're thinking maybe he had to

78
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:48,909
run a couple errands before or...

79
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:49,908
He's running late.

80
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,638
Yeah, apparently.

81
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,471
- Oh no...

82
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:56,428
- [Bryan] Finn's so excited,
can you put in on right, Ollie?

83
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:59,678
There you go, that's a cool tower, huh?

84
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:07,053
- Guys, if you build this now,

85
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:09,531
and...

86
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,815
Okay, game over.

87
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,619
- You guys broke the tower.

88
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,619
Look who's here, it's CJ and Bailey!

89
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,178
Hey Ollie, guess what?

90
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,186
- What?

91
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:28,403
- [Bryan] CJ and Bailey are
gonna stay the night tonight

92
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,673
and hang out, isn't that cool?

93
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:32,340
(festive music)

94
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,454
(screaming)

95
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:46,451
What?

96
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:47,464
- [Missy] What do you see?

97
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:48,894
- [Bryan] What did Finn just find?

98
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,514
Finn just found something, you guys.

99
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:51,513
- The elf!

100
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,346
- [Bryan] Ollie, look!

101
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:55,974
Look what he found!

102
00:03:58,012 --> 00:03:58,845
Fred!

103
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:02,104
- Look, he said, sorry I'm late.

104
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:04,172
Aw, he feels bad...

105
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:07,309
- [Bryan] And he said, let's bake today!

106
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:09,152
You guys wanna do some baking with Fred?

107
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:11,010
- [All] Yeah!

108
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,099
- [Bryan] Yeah!

109
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:12,932
Hi Fred!

110
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:15,751
We missed you, dude.

111
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,401
What is he baking by the way?

112
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,654
Just a bowl of sprinkles, it looks like.

113
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:20,987
Isn't that cool?

114
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:24,793
- [Missy] I think he feels
really bad that he's late.

115
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:28,162
- [Bryan] Don't eat that,
that's just flour, dude.

116
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:30,276
Hey Ollie, what do you
think Fred wants to bake?

117
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:31,109
- Cookies!

118
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:31,942
- [Bryan] Bacon?

119
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:32,775
- Bacon?

120
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:33,894
- [Bryan] Cookies?

121
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,939
Cookies sound good.

122
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,124
- Cookies for Santa.

123
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,100
- [Bryan] We should do
cookie for Santa, Ollie.

124
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,251
- Oh yeah!

125
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,828
- We can have cookies for ourselves too.

126
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:43,841
- [Bryan] That's true, like we can

127
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,930
just pretend or practice, right?

128
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,763
- Yeah.

129
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,189
- [Bryan] I know, look, he's even got

130
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,580
little eggs and a little whisk.

131
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,247
(festive music)

132
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:16,119
Alright, next up, we need brown sugar.

133
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,490
Who's putting that one in?

134
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,323
Finn?

135
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:19,156
You wanna put it in?

136
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:20,152
- Yeah!

137
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,362
- [Missy] Put that in, okay.

138
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,157
- [Bryan] Brown sugar's the best, huh?

139
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,595
- I've never tried brown sugar.

140
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:27,876
- You wanna try it?

141
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:28,894
- [Bryan] There you go, Finn.

142
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,311
Dump it in, dude.

143
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:32,610
Yeah...

144
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,775
(festive music)

145
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,658
Alright, CJ's gonna mix it all up,

146
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:44,610
you know how to do this, man?

147
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,492
CJ's a little older, but he'll
need a little help though.

148
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:50,188
- Okay, we got that and
now you just go like that.

149
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:51,627
- [Bryan] Perfect.

150
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:54,626
Mix it up, all your
butter with your sugar.

151
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:55,742
It's the first thing you gotta do

152
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:57,466
when you're making cookies.

153
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,539
- [Missy] And now we gotta take pictures,

154
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,934
everybody look here and smile, say cheese!

155
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:02,292
- [Bryan] Smile!

156
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,205
- Cheese!

157
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,872
(festive music)

158
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:14,420
- [Bryan] Alright Bailey's adding vanilla!

159
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,419
- [Missy] Add all of it.

160
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,422
You can add all of it.

161
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:17,422
- [Bryan] Yep!

162
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:18,421
- [Missy] We don't have much left.

163
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:19,538
- [Bryan] The last drop of vanilla.

164
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:20,978
Fred really should have picked us

165
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:22,228
up some vanilla from the store.

166
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:24,114
- Fred, next time you're out.

167
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:25,530
- [Bryan] Fred, we're out of vanilla.

168
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,599
- Now we need the eggs,
we'll let CJ do the eggs.

169
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,458
Just one egg at a time, so go ahead and

170
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,773
- [Bryan] We're putting all your

171
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,190
skills to the test today man.

172
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,177
- Here, try the, maybe here.

173
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:41,296
- [Bryan] There you go, flat surface

174
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:44,035
on the counter, there you go.

175
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:44,868
- Got it.

176
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,900
- [Bryan] Good job dude!

177
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,076
Good job, dude!

178
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:57,077
- [Missy] Now let CJ,
you want to mix it, CJ?

179
00:06:57,077 --> 00:06:59,744
(festive music)

180
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,993
- CJ, I have to say, I am very

181
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:06,645
impressed with your baking skills man!

182
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,917
You're pretty good around
the kitchen you know.

183
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:09,804
- No, I'm not.

184
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,650
- No?

185
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,717
What kind of food can
you make on your own?

186
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:17,173
- I can only heat up stuff.

187
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:18,801
- You're good at heating up stuff?

188
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:19,806
- Yeah.

189
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,639
- Oh, that's good

190
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,914
- [Missy] You're next, Finn.

191
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:23,848
Okay Ollie, go ahead and add it.

192
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:24,931
- Oh my gosh!

193
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:29,679
- [Bryan] Alright, Finn is adding salt.

194
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:33,156
Gotta have good salt in your cookies.

195
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:35,519
Alright, we're adding flour now.

196
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,331
Things might get a little messy,

197
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,725
so we put on some aprons, show me yours.

198
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,700
Ooh, it's like Mrs. Claus,
that's cool, Bailey!

199
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,839
And Ollie, you've got puppy dogs!

200
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,958
- [Missy] I just start it really slow

201
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,651
cause we don't want it to
like, poof up everywhere.

202
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:52,114
- Poof, poof!

203
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:53,525
- Here, eat this!

204
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:54,358
- No!

205
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:55,881
- Eat this!

206
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:57,381
- They're so cute.

207
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,716
They're having so much fun baking.

208
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:03,299
(lively music)

209
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,062
How is it?

210
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,108
- I wanna try it!

211
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,269
- I want a big piece!

212
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,221
I want a big piece!

213
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,225
- Is it really good?

214
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:18,292
You want a little piece too?

215
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,614
- I want a big piece.

216
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:20,608
- Okay.

217
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,187
- Yum.

218
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:25,076
Best part about the holidays is baking

219
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,932
and you can't bake
without chocolate chips,

220
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:31,265
so it's time to add the chocolate chips!

221
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,680
Alright, dump them in.

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,833
Chocolate!

223
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,903
- It's like my favorite.

224
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:45,854
- It smells so good.

225
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:49,104
(upbeat festive music)

226
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:08,902
Cookies are coming out of the
oven and they look so good.

227
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:12,726
You guys all did such a
good job baking cookies

228
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,264
and now we're eating pizza!

229
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,097
- It was fun!

230
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,137
- [Bryan] It was fun, huh?

231
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:19,078
- I loved tasting it.

232
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,611
- [Bryan] Yum!

233
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:22,424
So you guys have an elf on
the shelf too right, CJ?

234
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:24,940
So what's your guys' elf's name?

235
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,107
- Super Zippy.

236
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:28,005
- [Bryan] Super Zippy?

237
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,005
That's cool.

238
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:33,700
- But his real name,
not full, is just Zippy.

239
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,635
- [Bryan] Oh, okay.

240
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:35,468
Got ya.

241
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:38,222
- We usually call him Zippy
because that's shorter.

242
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:39,868
So does your elf do cool things too?

243
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:40,877
- Yeah.

244
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:41,878
- What does your elf do?

245
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:45,651
- Well today he was sitting
on the fireplace mantle

246
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,568
and he ran a note saying,
I hid 10 candy canes.

247
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:53,722
- [Bryan] Oh, so you guys had
to search for candy canes.

248
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:54,815
That's so cool.

249
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:58,208
- We found 10, so CJ found
five and I found five.

250
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,538
- I know, those Elf on the Shelves

251
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,814
are always hiding things, huh Ollie?

252
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:03,788
Remember when he hid those
candy canes from you guys?

253
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:04,880
- How many?

254
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,297
- [Bryan] I think he hid six.

255
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:12,032
- Santa's gonna come and get us sledding!

256
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:14,238
- [Bryan] If you guys are
good, your elf on the shelf

257
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,260
is watching, Ollie, so you better be good

258
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,624
because he is taking
notes throughout the day

259
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:23,026
and he is headed home
tonight to tell Santa

260
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,839
how you've been, okay?

261
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,280
So you gotta be a good boy
if you want presents right?

262
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,282
Okay.

263
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:31,578
Good boys also eat their pizza.

264
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:34,485
- Alright, kids have finished their dinner

265
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:37,390
and it's now time for cookies!

266
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,363
Hey guys, we're missing
someone someone, where's CJ?

267
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:40,371
- Yeah.

268
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:41,372
- He's in a room.

269
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,645
- Oh, CJ, do you want cookies?

270
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:45,529
Oh, and there they go.

271
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,362
Finn, you just stay here like a

272
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:47,991
good boy and eat your cookie, okay?

273
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:48,824
- Okay.

274
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:51,398
- You guys, it is now cookie time

275
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:54,135
and I gotta say guys, we are
doing great on our schedule,

276
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,489
I was like, we're gonna have dinner

277
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,266
and we'll eat cookies and
then we'll watch a movie

278
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,525
and then we'll go to bed!

279
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,056
And we're right on time so I'm so excited.

280
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:02,149
Everything is going smoothly and the kids

281
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,338
are having a blast together
and definitely playing a ton

282
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:07,452
which means, we're gonna
be tired at bedtime.

283
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:10,287
- [Bryan] D-O-L-L.

284
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:11,289
- How do you...

285
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:14,456
- It's the O first and then the board.

286
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:17,785
That's how you do it.

287
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:20,030
- Bailey is working on
her letter to Santa Claus.

288
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,888
I know, she just went
straight into the list,

289
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:24,515
she's like, I want a Belle Doll.

290
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,908
- Good job, good job, we can
keep writing what you want.

291
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,885
- Bailey really wants a
Belle Doll for Christmas,

292
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:31,185
CJ, what about you?

293
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:33,625
Hey, look at me, you want
a napkin for Christmas?

294
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,072
Just kidding.

295
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:36,263
What does DJ want for Christmas?

296
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,698
- I want Call of Duty World War Two.

297
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,323
- Oh, dude!

298
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:43,530
I want that game too
actually, it looks so good.

299
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,856
Dear Santa, I have been
very good this year.

300
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,646
Alright, you better prove it,

301
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,249
make sure your penmanship
is good for Santa.

302
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:52,317
You doing okay over here?

303
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:53,431
- Yeah.

304
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:54,433
- [Bryan] Yeah?

305
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:55,432
Okay.

306
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:58,682
(upbeat festive music)

307
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,913
Alright CJ, pop your letter
in the special mail box.

308
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,338
That's special delivery, so it's sending

309
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:09,094
straight to the North Pole, okay?

310
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,344
(upbeat festive music)

311
00:12:22,285 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat outro music)
