1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,591
- We got a mini Firefly right here, dude.

2
00:00:02,591 --> 00:00:04,634
(laughter)

3
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:07,465
(sports announcer in background)

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:11,024
You met Firefly, dude.

5
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:12,108
♪ This is our life ♪

6
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:13,357
♪ Let's live it ♪

7
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:15,765
♪ Live it forever ♪

8
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,256
- [Both] Good morning.

9
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:18,466
- Good morning, buddy.

10
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:20,912
What are we doin' today, Ollie?

11
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:24,360
- We're going to the basketball player!

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,630
I mean the basketball game.

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,850
- So we were actually invited

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,200
to a Harlem Globetrotters game,

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,150
and I am so excited because
I have never been to one.

16
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,540
Ollie, you've never been
to one either, have you?

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,110
I don't think Ollie's ever been

18
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,040
to a basketball game

19
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,590
and I just feel like Globetrotters are one

20
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,956
of those things were a
boy needs to take his son.

21
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,640
So you and I are gonna go see

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,090
the Harlem Globetrotters today, okay?

23
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,923
- Yeah!

24
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:45,059
- [Bryan] And guess what?

25
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:45,892
- What?

26
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:46,725
- We get to meet the team.

27
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:47,558
- Team?

28
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:48,853
- [Bryan] Yeah, do you
think maybe you could

29
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:49,686
help 'em do some trick shots?

30
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:50,519
- Yeah.

31
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:51,352
- Maybe.

32
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:52,340
So Missy is running
errands with Finley today.

33
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,780
He's a little bit too young to bring,

34
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,780
so I'm bringing Ollie
and I'm actually bringing

35
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,048
a couple of my buddies and
they're bringing their sons too,

36
00:00:58,048 --> 00:00:59,920
so you're gonna have some friends to play

37
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,785
with too while you're there, okay?

38
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:01,618
- Yeah.

39
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:02,600
- Yeah, okay.

40
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,433
- Let's do this.

41
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,266
- Let's do dis.

42
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:05,653
All right you guys, we are on our way.

43
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:06,915
I got my buddy Dallas.

44
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,240
- Hello.

45
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,700
- We got Sean and Jude and Ollie.

46
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,730
Are you guys having fun?

47
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,136
- Yeah.

48
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:14,984
- What are you guys watchin'?

49
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:15,817
- Lion King.

50
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:17,570
- Lion King, nothin' like a
little emotional Disney movie

51
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,499
on the ride over, right?

52
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,410
We're almost there, guys.

53
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,243
Are you excited?

54
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:22,350
- Yeah.

55
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,293
- All right, we got Daniel
and Nico here as well.

56
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,027
You ready to see some trick shots, dude?

57
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:27,860
- Yep.

58
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,674
- [Bryan] Yep, these boys
are gonna have some fun.

59
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:31,435
Ollie's a little bit younger than you guys

60
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:33,997
but you guys'll also have fun, right?

61
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:34,830
- Yeah.

62
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,833
- Okay.

63
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,847
Hey Dallas, how many times have
you seen the Globetrotters?

64
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,648
- In my life, this'll probably
be like the sixth time.

65
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:41,652
- That's awesome.

66
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:43,304
- But I haven't seen them
in probably like 17 years.

67
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,640
- Okay, so it's been a while.

68
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,510
- It's been a while.

69
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,624
- So they're all gonna be 17 years older?

70
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:48,851
- Yeah, it's the same guys, easily.

71
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:49,979
It's gotta be.

72
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,812
A lot of knee braces.

73
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:51,645
- (laughing) A lot of knee braces.

74
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,796
What about you guys, have you seen 'em?

75
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:54,629
- No.

76
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:55,622
- [Bryan] You've never seen 'em?

77
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:56,455
- Never.

78
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,288
- [Bryan] You've never seen 'em?

79
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:58,121
- Never.

80
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:58,954
- I think we're in for a treat, you guys.

81
00:01:58,954 --> 00:01:59,787
It's gonna be dope.

82
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,156
What you got there, dude?

83
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:02,026
- Tickets!

84
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:02,970
- [Bryan] You got your ticket to the game?

85
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,803
- Yeah.

86
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:04,740
- [Bryan] All right, hang onto it, okay?

87
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:11,580
Whoa dude, look at that!

88
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,880
That is so cool, huh?

89
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,040
- [Ollie] Yeah.

90
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,130
- We just made it to the arena.

91
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,710
We gotta go down and get
you a basketball, huh?

92
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,950
Does that sound cool?

93
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,883
You guys, I am so excited
there's an actual player

94
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:25,527
from the Harlem Globetrotters
right in front of us,

95
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:29,070
number three, Firefly in the house.

96
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,340
What's up, dude?

97
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,246
- Good.

98
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:32,240
- You wanna show me
your basketball skills?

99
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,073
Show me!

100
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,030
Ollie had to get Firefly
because it has to do

101
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,200
with fire, right?

102
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,319
- Yeah.

103
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,330
- And then he got himself
an actual game ball.

104
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,280
So excited, huh?

105
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,113
- Yeah.

106
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:53,538
- Yeah.

107
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:56,121
(upbeat music)

108
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:04,100
Oh my gosh, Dallas,
that's the wrong jersey!

109
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,250
And he does not care.

110
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,650
Okay you guys, Dallas
is making me look bad,

111
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,751
making us look bad, so I had
to get a Harlem Globetrotters.

112
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:15,201
He's the only one rollin'
in the green right now.

113
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:18,629
Take it easy, bro, take it easy.

114
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:21,212
(upbeat music)

115
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:28,472
Globey is gettin' it, you guys.

116
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,222
- Crazy mascot Globey

117
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,774
of the Harlem Globetrotters!

118
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:40,152
(Bryan cheering)

119
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,176
- Is that me?

120
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,169
- No.

121
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:45,609
Ollie thinks they're cheering for him.

122
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,859
The lights went out, watch.

123
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:57,825
You're supposed to boo, Ollie, boo 'em.

124
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:11,482
- [Announcer] And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

125
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:15,065
boys and girls, it's
time to meet and greet

126
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,612
the greatest basketball team on Earth,

127
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:21,112
the world-famous, the original

128
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,446
Harlem Globetrotters!

129
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:29,683
- Harlem Globetrotters, let's go!

130
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,933
(cheering)

131
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,326
There they are, dude.

132
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:37,530
That's the Harlem Globetrotters, Ollie.

133
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,363
Yeah.

134
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:50,980
Good luck, guys, not that you need it.

135
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:56,059
This is crazy, bro.

136
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:57,068
We're literally sitting on the court

137
00:04:57,068 --> 00:05:00,263
with the world's most
amazing basketball team.

138
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,180
It's crazy.

139
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,807
Big Easy!

140
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,717
- Go Globetrotters!

141
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,417
(upbeat music)

142
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,050
- [Bryan] The Generals are warming up

143
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,883
right in front of us

144
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:49,060
and Dallas is the only
one cheering them on.

145
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:51,378
- Is that Firefly?

146
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,828
- [Bryan] We got a
mini-Firefly right here, dude!

147
00:05:57,654 --> 00:06:00,110
You met Firefly, dude!

148
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,860
That's whose jersey he's wearing.

149
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,850
That's so fun, check this out you guys,

150
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,850
we got Too Tall,

151
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,210
who's actually, ironically, pretty short.

152
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:14,894
Yeah, say yeah!

153
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:17,258
- Yeah!

154
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,836
- All right, let's see,
let's see him jump.

155
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,962
(Bryan laughs)

156
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:23,545
(upbeat music)

157
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,990
Apparently at the Harlem Globetrotters

158
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,630
they have a four-point shot,

159
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,922
did you know that?

160
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:42,037
These guys are shooting four-pointers.

161
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:44,120
That's how good they are.

162
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:48,200
- [Announcer] On courtside seats--

163
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,540
- Ollie really needed
a cotton candy break.

164
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:03,830
So for those of you who don't know,

165
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,130
Harlem Globetrotters is
more of a comedy game

166
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,414
than an actual basketball game,

167
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,370
but I think it's safe
to say it's a good one

168
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,614
to take Ollie to for the first time.

169
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:13,700
Are you havin' fun?

170
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,597
Those guys are funny, huh?

171
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:16,600
That guy's sitting over in

172
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,673
that lady's lap right now.

173
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:20,256
(upbeat music)

174
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,300
I am so confused.

175
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,834
The game clock is literally running

176
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:28,880
and they're running a bit

177
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,861
in the middle of the court.

178
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:32,991
This is the greatest
thing we've ever been to.

179
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:36,144
A lady lost her purse in
the middle of the court

180
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:37,570
and she had to come out and get it

181
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,126
and now they're harassing her husband.

182
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,470
Did you eat all that?

183
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:48,142
Firefly is probably one of
the coolest players ever.

184
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,940
All right Ollie, they got 25 seconds

185
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,310
to try to take the ball from Firefly.

186
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,010
Even on his knees, oh!

187
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,164
(Bryan laughing)

188
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:07,560
They're trying to get it,

189
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,069
they're trying to get it, guys,

190
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,319
look, trying to get it, oh!

191
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,353
Oh, she got it!

192
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,063
That is awesome.

193
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,080
- Go Globetrotters!

194
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,952
- Yeah, it is now third quarter,

195
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:34,820
which means that the Harlem
Globetrotters are now

196
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,309
on our side of the court,

197
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,989
so we're literally gonna
be right in the middle

198
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,163
of all the action, okay?

199
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:42,628
As he's stuffing his
face with cotton candy.

200
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:44,460
Ollie's enjoying himself.

201
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,293
- My cotton candy now.

202
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,500
- [Bryan] Oh, sit down.

203
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:07,808
- That was cool.

204
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:26,711
- Come on, man.

205
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:29,461
Clutch isn't on his A-game today.

206
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:01,784
I just learned I need
to teach Ollie the YMCA.

207
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:04,095
I need that to happen.

208
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:07,595
(dreamy electronic music)

209
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:24,474
I don't know if that's
where you're supposed to be.

210
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:25,860
- [Ollie] How did he even get up there?

211
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,460
- [Bryan] Now he's dancin' up there!

212
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,499
Did he climb?

213
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,749
- I don't know.

214
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,680
- [Bryan] Apparently this
is how Harlem Globetrotters

215
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
do an instant replay.

216
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,780
They just redo it in slow motion (laughs).

217
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,393
Nico's up!

218
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,430
- Where'd Nico go?

219
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,422
- Torch just took him onto the court.

220
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:51,255
- Really?

221
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:52,290
- Yeah, I think he's gonna do something.

222
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,414
You wanna see?

223
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:54,247
- [Ollie] Yeah.

224
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:55,527
- [Bryan] Dude, he looks so
little up there with everyone.

225
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:59,169
- [Announcer] It's time for the (mumbles)

226
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:03,252
official, authentic,
autographed Big Easy jersey.

227
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:10,270
(cheering)

228
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,947
- [Bryan] Can he do it?

229
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:12,960
- He can do it.

230
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,793
He practices everyday.

231
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:14,626
- [Bryan] He practices everyday.

232
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:16,290
He's been training for this, dude.

233
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:18,158
- Go Nico!

234
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:20,714
- [Bryan] You got this,
dude, you got this!

235
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,410
Here we go.

236
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,538
(cheering)

237
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:31,508
- Yay Nico!

238
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:34,169
- Good job, dude!

239
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,419
(cheering)

240
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:42,533
We got one minute left
and the game is tied.

241
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:45,283
(exciting music)

242
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:01,446
They won!

243
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:04,060
Yeah!

244
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,230
Nice, dude, he signed it.

245
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,410
He signed it.

246
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,586
That was seriously so much fun.

247
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:16,757
- Yeah.

248
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:18,632
- You got an autograph,
wasn't that cool, dude?

249
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:19,680
- And me!

250
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,757
- And you, look at you, dude!

251
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:23,680
You got them all!

252
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,182
That was awesome, give me five, bro.

253
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:26,840
That was pretty impressive.

254
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,949
Huge thanks to Harlem Globetrotters

255
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:29,137
for inviting us out.

256
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:31,380

- He knows how it's done, guys.

262
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:43,538
Wanna see something cool, Ollie?

263
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,456
- Yeah.

264
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:45,387
- Ready?

265
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:46,850
Oh, oh!

Ready?

267
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,693
One, two, three, go!

268
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:51,960
Aww, I'm not very good.

269
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,538
You're much better.

270
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:56,288
(Bryan laughing)

271
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,630
That was close, Ollie.

272
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,725
Did you have so much fun, dude?

273
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:04,558
- Yeah.

274
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:05,779
- He's so excited.

275
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,915
That's what they do out on the court, huh?

276
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:12,476
- I have wings because I'm Firefly.

277
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,780
- [Bryan] That's right.

278
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,471
We are now home and Ollie, did
you show your ball to Finn?

279
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:18,304
- Yeah.

280
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:19,230
- [Bryan] Show him your signed ball, dude.

281
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,568
- [Ollie] Look at my ball, Finn.

282
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:22,493
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

283
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:23,957
(screams)

284
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:25,354
- It's just a ball.

285
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:27,490
(screams)

286
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,520
- [Bryan] He's funny.

287
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,390
Hey, babe.

288
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,799
- Hey.

289
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,750
- Oh yeah babe, so Ollie learned some

290
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,616
new basketball moves.

291
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:34,613
- [Missy] Oh, really?

292
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,680
- [Bryan] And he's gonna
show some to you right now.

293
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,304
All right, show me your basketball moves.

294
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:40,024
- Ooh, that was actually cool.

295
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:42,220
- Oh, but it between your legs.

296
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,483
Whoa, pro!

297
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:49,820
Harlem Globetrotters material
in the future, maybe?

298
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,830
Sorry you couldn't come today, Finn.

299
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,903
Maybe next time, though, okay?

300
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:56,720
- Hey, how's my basketball moves?

301
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,870
- [Bryan] Okay, let's see
your basketball moves.

302
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,991
Oh, whoa, can you put
it between your legs?

303
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:01,565
- Yeah.

304
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:02,398
- Do it.

305
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:05,970
Hey Ollie, next time we should go

306
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,069
and we should take Finn, huh?

307
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:07,902
- Yeah.

308
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:09,277
- Do you think he'd like it?

309
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:10,276
- Yeah.

310
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:11,109
- I think so.

311
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,146
That is all for today's video.

312
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:13,393
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

313
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:16,627
If you did, be sure to
give it a big thumbs up.

314
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:19,283
Finn, thumbs up!

315
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,533
(babbling)

316
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,051
Thumbs up, subscribe,

317
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:26,840
and we will see you mañana.

318
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,410
I have a Harlem Globetrotter on my back,

319
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,657
that's what happens.

320
00:14:29,657 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye, boop.
