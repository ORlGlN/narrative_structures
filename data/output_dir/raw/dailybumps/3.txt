1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,330
- So that prank kind of backfired on me.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,200
I tried to Super Glue the
coins to the concrete,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,245
and I just got Super
Glue all over my kids.

where I think we have
our first prank starting.

30
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:04,023
(happy music)

31
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,343
(Finley shouts)
- Good morning!

32
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:07,743
- [Bryan] Good morning boys!

33
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,670
How are my boys today?

34
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,100
Did you catch some fish?

35
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,377
- Yeah.
- Whoa, that's amazing.

36
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:16,840
- I'm hungry.
- You are?

37
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,470
Well, it is time to eat breakfast.

38
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,870
Should we get our breakfast on?

39
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,173
- Yeah.
- Pound it.

40
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:23,850
(imitates explosion)

41
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,540
There was like a little
tiny explosion that happened

42
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,998
when you hit Dad, did you
know that? (laughs) (mumbles)

43
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:30,581
(upbeat music)

44
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:34,772
Alright we are getting the
boys some cereal this morning.

45
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:38,610
- Yeah they want Honey Nut Cheerios.

46
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,007
Gotta get the milk.

47
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,388
Are you guys excited for your cereal?

48
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:43,805
- Yeah.
- Me too.

49
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:47,420
Can't eat cereal without your spoons, yay!

50
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,336
- [Bryan] Alright boys.

51
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:52,453
- We've got cereal.

52
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,647
Dig in, dig in.

53
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:58,228
- [Bryan] Eat your cereal, okay boys?

54
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,580
(silly music)

55
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,340
What's wrong with it?

56
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,860
- [Missy] What happened?

57
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,880
- It's freezed!

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,220
- What?
- It's freezed?

59
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,060
No it's not.
- Take a bite--

60
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,419
- [Bryan] Ollie, we
just poured the cereal,

61
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,900
just grab your spoon.
- Fin just pick your spoon.

62
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,759
What the?

63
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,201
- What?
- What the heck?

64
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,330
What's happening?

65
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,213
- [Bryan] Fin what
happened to your cereal?

66
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:19,367
(Fin babbles)

67
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:20,930
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

68
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,090
- [Missy] Ollie, you can't take a bite?

69
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,090
- [Bryan] Is yours the same dude?

70
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,976
Pick it up.

71
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:25,809
- I just poured this, what happened?

72
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:27,900
Oh!
- Oh, there's some came out.

73
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,370
- [Missy] Oh good, we can eat some.

74
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,880
- [Bryan] I don't understand
what's happening here.

75
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,283
- Okay wait, what's today?

76
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:35,200
- Easter.
- It's Easter,

77
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,656
but it's also April Fool's!

78
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,502
- [Bryan] April Fool's!

79
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:42,368
- [Missy] April Fool's!

80
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:44,740
(Fin babbles)
- Yeah you guys can't eat

81
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,887
frozen cereal. (laughs)

82
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:47,720
- [Missy] Isn't that funny?

83
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,553
- [Bryan] Look at this you guys.

84
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:50,672
This is like for real frozen cereal.

85
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,580
(Fin babbles)

86
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,657
Fin's determined, he's like,

87
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:56,397
"I'm gonna wait til it
thaws and I'm gonna eat it".

88
00:02:56,397 --> 00:03:00,980
Aw, jokes on you, Mama's got
real cereal for you boys.

89
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,000
There you go Finny.

90
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,082
Alright take a bite of
your normal cereal Fin.

91
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:06,464
(kids babble and mumble)

92
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:07,823
Yeah, I know you have that one,
and you have that one, huh?

93
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:09,200
- [Oliver] But how did it get freezed?

94
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,168
- So last night Mommy and Daddy thought

95
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:13,250
it would be really funny to
make you guys a bowl of cereal

96
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,120
and then put it in the freezer,

97
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,341
and then pretend to give
it to you for breakfast.

98
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:18,578
(Fin babbles)

99
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:19,952
Isn't that funny?

100
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:20,820
(Bryan laughs)

101
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,810
- At this point, Missy,
we're just pranksters

102
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,211
teaching our little
pranksters how to prank us.

103
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,044
- Yeah, I know, right?

104
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:28,145
- So we really do need to be
careful today. (both laugh)

105
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:31,020
(happy music)

106
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,855
Hey Ollie, whatchya got here?

107
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:34,870
- A Venus flytrap.

108
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,470
- [ Bryan] No way, and what's in it?

109
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,350
- There's a spider and a fly.

110
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,110
- [Bryan] That's crazy.

111
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,880
Is he eatin' 'em?
- Yeah.

112
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,480
- Ollie is so excited
about Venus flytraps.

113
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,090
We found a dead fly in the windowsill,

114
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,341
which we put it in his mouth, huh?

115
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,174
- Yeah.

116
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:50,630
- And then we also put
a spider on top of it,

117
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,152
and then it closed and ate it, huh?

118
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:55,005
- Yeah.
- That's the spider.

119
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:55,838
- [Boys] Don't touch it!

120
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:56,830
- [Bryan] I won't touch it.

121
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,380
And then that's the fly.

122
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,755
What do you think about that Fin?

123
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:00,840
(Fin babbles)

124
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,661
You've gotta be careful,
do you know why Fin?

125
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:03,494
- Yeah?

126
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,330
- [Bryan] 'Cause the plant could eat YOU!

127
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,160
(Fin screams)

128
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,640
Mama broke out the chocolate.

129
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,873
She must be up to something, huh Ollie?

130
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,490
- Mom, what are you doing?

131
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,920
- Well, I also need a chocolate melter.

132
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,132
What should we do with melted chocolate?

133
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,870
- Make make chocolate chip cookies.

134
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,264
- I mean that's a good idea too.

135
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,480
(Bryan laughs)

136
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,313
- Look you guys.

137
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:28,740
It's our old Christmas
cage in the background.

138
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,980
For this next trick, or prank,
I'm about to do on the kids,

139
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,210
I'm gonna need some coinage.

140
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,280
I never carry actual coins,

141
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,150
but just found Missy's
purse, so I'm gonna raid it.

142
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,260
Come on babe, pull through.

143
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,683
Oh yeah! I knew it.

144
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:43,770
(coins clink)

145
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,240
Missy always has coinage.

146
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,073
You know what you guys?

147
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:48,463
It's April Fool's Day, no one is safe.

148
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:53,890
(laughs) She's gonna kill me.

149
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,150
Oh wait, I should put it
in the coin pouch too.

150
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,347
Just to make up for what I took, you know?

151
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:01,790
How's that you guys?

152
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,890
- Mom, where's your purse?

153
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,310
- Oh my gosh, Bryan, this
is a really nice purse.

154
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,510
- [Bryan] Well, I thought I
put really nice animal cookies.

155
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,398
Is that okay?
- No, no it's not okay.

156
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,293
- [Bryan] (laughs) April Fool's!

157
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,203
- See, you just do anything
you want on April Fool's Day.

158
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:22,479
And you just call it a joke.

159
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,340
- [Bryan] (laughs) I filled Mama's purse

160
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,723
with animal crackers, isn't that funny?

161
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:28,028
- Why?
- He's so confused.

162
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,200
He's like why would you do that, Dad.

163
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,440
- I've been trying to explain it to him.

164
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,910
He's like I don't get it.

165
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,300
- This is great actually,
because Ollie has no concept

166
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,290
of what a trick or a prank is right now,

167
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,200
I don't think, so he
will fall for anything,

168
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,370
and this next one I have
is gonna be a funny one.

169
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,120
Alright I'm gonna have
the boys come out here,

170
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,600
and I'm gonna show them this
new Spanish lavender we planted

171
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
but I want them to go for these coins,

172
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,440
so I'm gonna drop them, and
see how they fall naturally.

173
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,137
And now I'm gonna glue 'em.

174
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:57,240
(silly music)

175
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,900
Ollie, Fin, I have something to show you.

176
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,210
Daddy has new Spanish lavender
outside in the courtyard.

177
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,280
Do you guys wanna go see it?

178
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,113
- Yeah.
- You guys

179
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:07,470
like lavender right?

180
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,475
Okay, let's go check it out.

181
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:11,900
Alright, let's go boys.

182
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,780
Come check it out.

183
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,530
So we put 'em in both
of these pots down here.

184
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,290
Spanish lavender.

185
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,140
Does it smell good?
- Money!

186
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,267
- [Bryan] What'd you find Fin?

187
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,350
- Money.
- What?

188
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,863
Grab it!
- What?

189
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:27,530
How did it get here?

190
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:30,770
It's sticky!
- Oh, ah.

191
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,110
Oh is it stuck?

192
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,895
Oh it didn't work as much or
as good as I wanted it to.

193
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,390
(laughs) Daddy was trying
to play a prank on you,

194
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,370
and it didn't really work.

195
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,310
And Fin's like, "Yeah, it didn't work."

196
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,210
Oh Fin, don't rub your hands!

197
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,043
Come on, come on boys.

198
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:45,220
So that prank kind of backfired on me.

199
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,100
I tried to Super Glue the
coins to the concrete,

200
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,200
and I just got Super
Glue all over my kids.

201
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,730
So, babe, I tried to play an
April Fool's joke on the kids,

202
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,980
and the Super Glue did not stick
to the concrete and instead

203
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,884
it stuck to their hands.
- Oh my gosh,

204
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:02,655
so (mumbles) you got glue on you?

205
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,625
- Yeah.
- No, don't do that.

206
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,823
Are you sure?

207
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:07,540
- [Bryan] It was probably
just a little bit,

208
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,070
but we need to wash their hands.

209
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,630
There you go.

210
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,130
No more April Fool's jokes, okay Ollie?

211
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,110
- He's like, I don't get this day.

212
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,866
- We won't do any more today.

213
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,080
(dings)

214
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,100
Dry your hands off boys.

215
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,403
Sorry about that.

216
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,363
- Daddy's so silly, huh?

217
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,196
- Yeah.

218
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,750
- [Bryan] Yeah, I'm a little silly.

219
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,750
Alright, I think we are on
our second April Fool's fail.

220
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:34,970
(laughs)

221
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,803
- Yeah, I was like--

222
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,549
- [Bryan] The Easter Fail, what is this?

223
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:40,390
- I thought that this was
seriously gonna be so fun and easy

224
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,040
but I cannot get this chocolate.

225
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
- [Bryan] We're trying to
make giant chocolate eggs,

226
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,300
you guys, and we cannot get
it to pop out of the shell.

227
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,133
It's just broken.

228
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:52,960
- Like I've got a thick one,
I've got a thinner layered one,

229
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,350
and it's just nothing.

230
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,960
It doesn't, it just, this is what it says.

231
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,550
Just hold it over, and flex,

232
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,763
and it should just pop out easily.

233
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:02,590
No, it doesn't happen.

234
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,820
- [Bryan] So this is what
you're supposed to do

235
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
if you get 'em all made properly.

236
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,960
It's supposed to make a
giant chocolate Easter egg,

237
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,643
which it kinda does, that's kinda cool.

238
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:12,692
- I think I can save the day though.

239
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,275
(upbeat music)

240
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:20,624
(silly music)

241
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,521
(door creaks)

242
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,188
(playful music)

243
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,960
- Ollie, Fin, guess what?

244
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,310
Mom and I just saw the Easter
Bunny in our living room,

245
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,500
and he's got a job

246
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,940
for you guys.
- He left these

247
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,360
for you guys, look it's Mickey Mouse.

248
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,193
- [Bryan] That's so cool.

249
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,500
- Cat Boy!

250
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,350
- [Bryan] Cat Boy?

251
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,150
Fin. (Fin babbles)

252
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,420
So that's your Easter basket,

253
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,950
and you guys wanna go get some eggs?

254
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,593
- Yeah.
- Alright let's go.

255
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:11,593
- Okay, let's go find eggs.

256
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,561
You can't open 'em 'til we're all done.

257
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,252
You find 'em and put 'em in your basket.

258
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,752
(happy music)

259
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:20,598
(kids mumble)

260
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:22,300
- [Bryan] There you go.

261
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,163
- [Missy] Wow, you're making--

262
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:23,996
- [Bryan] Fin, come here.

263
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,190
Fin come here, come here.

264
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,040
Look at this one.

265
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,080
Careful.

266
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,380
What's going on in it Fin?

267
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,580
Don't open it, just put it in your basket.

268
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,672
Is it vibrating?

269
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:34,505
- Yeah.

270
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,678
- [Bryan] Ollie found a giant one.

271
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:39,178
(happy music)

272
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,170
Nice find, dude.

273
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,193
Ooh it's really in there.

274
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,930
The boys got some super
cool Easter eggs, huh Ollie?

275
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,290
- Yeah.
- That's so neat.

276
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,770
And look what else the Easter
Bunny brought you guys,

277
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,760
two giant chocolate eggs
with more goodies inside.

278
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,368
Do you wanna open those later?

279
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,523
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's count

280
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:13,360
how many you got.

281
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,082
- [Bryan] Yeah count your
eggs boys, how'd you do?

282
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:15,999
- One, two,

283
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,784
three,

284
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:20,759
four,

285
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:22,878
five,

286
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:26,910
six.

287
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,380
- [Bryan] Nice.

288
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,230
- And seven.

289
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,063
- Yay!

290
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:30,910
- [Bryan] Ollie got seven eggs.

291
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,433
And how many for you Fin?

292
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,420
(Fin mumbling)

293
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,330
- [Bryan] There's four, five,

294
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,300
- [Missy] How many'd you get?

295
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,719
- [Bryan] Six, he's lining
them all up, he's so into it.

296
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:44,111
- [Missy] Seven, is that all of them?

297
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,855
- Oh nope, two more.

298
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,187
- [Missy] Ooh, eight.

299
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:50,160
You've got more than Ollie?

300
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,710
- [Bryan] Yeah, so
Ollie, Fin has more eggs,

301
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,490
but your eggs are bigger.

302
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,080
- You got big ones, but he got more.

303
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,913
- [Bryan] Isn't that cool?

304
00:10:57,913 --> 00:10:59,390
- I got little ones and big ones.

305
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,700
- [Missy] Yeah, alright, should we see

306
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,460
what's in all these eggs?

307
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,293
- Yeah.

308
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:05,090
- Okay Ollie, you get
to open up yours first.

309
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,440
This is your chocolate egg.

310
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,800
- This giant chocolate egg.
- Can you open it?

311
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,633
- Whoa!

312
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:13,408
Why did you get me broccoli?

313
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:14,241
(Missy laughs)

314
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,777
- What?
- Why there's broccoli?

315
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:16,715
- What?

316
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:18,383
Why is there broccoli in there?

317
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,416
- [Bryan] There's broccoli
in your giant chocolate egg?

318
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,730
- Get it out!

319
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,390
- [Bryan] Well Ollie, you
know rabbits eat broccoli.

320
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,073
So--
- Yeah, does that look good?

321
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,150
- [Bryan] Alright Fin,
let's see what's in yours.

322
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,762
He's like, I hope it's a burrito. (laughs)

323
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,140
Whoa!

324
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,340
What'd you get Fin?

325
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,433
A pepper?

326
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,470
Let me see.
- A red pepper,

327
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,130
and a yellow pepper.

328
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,963
- [Bryan] And what's that Fin?

329
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:47,310
- Peppers are spicy.
- An onion.

330
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,143
- [Bryan] An onion?

331
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:48,976
- Smell it.

332
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:51,289
- Eww

333
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:52,206
- He licked it.

334
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,470
- [Bryan] (laughs) Well,
Fin don't you know,

335
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,770
that bunny rabbits,

336
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,770
they like peppers and onions, and stuff?

337
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,460
Alright boys, April Fool's!

338
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,730
- April Fool's!
- We got you.

339
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,660
- He's like I don't know.
- He's like

340
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,680
this is not an April Fool's Joke.

341
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,260
- I got a giant egg of chocolate,

342
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,072
okay that's enough chocolate,
that's good that's good.

343
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:11,905
- [Bryan] That is awesome,

344
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,270
look at all this broccoli in here.

345
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,140
Alright, time to open up all our eggs now.

346
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,125
The boys are going for the gold one.

347
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,000
- What is it?

348
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,876
- [Bryan] Put it on the
table, put it on the table.

349
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:23,030
- Oh that's so cute.
- What?

350
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,480
It's like a little hamster.

351
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,203
That moves, that's so cool.

352
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:29,840
Whoa!

353
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,340
I love that!

354
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,050
- [Missy] Oh my gosh,
Kath would love these.

355
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,539
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's so funny.

356
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,500
Fin, there's a big one in here.

357
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,690
- Can you get it?

358
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,970
- [Bryan] Open it up.

359
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,281
Ooh, what'd you get Ollie?

360
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:42,614
- Legos.
- Legos?

361
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,910
What'd you get Fin?

362
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,880
Oh, anchovies!
- Anchovies, ew!

363
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,930
- [Bryan] Oh wow, okay this is happening.

364
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,360
Oh gosh, are you actually
opening this, babe?

365
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,330
In our house?

366
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,180
They're little fishies Fin.

367
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,518
- Do you want some?

368
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:00,351
- No.

369
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:01,870
- [Bryan] No, he doesn't want those, babe.

370
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,980
- Ew.
- There, smell em.

371
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,640
- [Bryan] No anchovies? (laughs)

372
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,683
Are you okay babe? (laughs)

373
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:11,460
- I don't wanna smell it.

374
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,017
- [Bryan] (coughs) My
bad, didn't take it away.

375
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:16,850
- Sorry about that.
- April Fool's!

376
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:18,807
- He's like, can I get something real?

377
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,590
- [Bryan] Go for it, open it buddy.

378
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,863
Dinosaurs?

379
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,973
Wow!

380
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,226
What'd you get?

381
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,625
- I got a Ring Pop!

382
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,227
- What?
- What?

383
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,990
If you guys did not know,

384
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,520
Ring Pops are coming back.

385
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
The kids love 'em.

386
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,793
Open this one.

387
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:38,993
- Ew!
- Mushrooms!

388
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:42,273
What?

389
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:43,543
- Why did you get mushrooms?

390
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,850
- I don't know.
- This Easter Bunny

391
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,123
is crazy.

392
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:48,146
- You know why he got mushrooms?

393
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:50,478
Because it's Easter and April Fool's Day.

394
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:53,863
- [Bryan] (laughs) Candy!

395
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,470
I want this one.

396
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,850
Fin made out with the dinosaurs,

397
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,190
and you got a Ring Pop so you
don't have to seal Ollie's.

398
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,162
Ooh you got more Legos, Ollie?

399
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:05,440
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

400
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,706
Hey you wanna see what's in this one?

401
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,123
Oh, a Kinder Egg.

402
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,323
And Fin, look what's in
this one, another one!

403
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,300
Alright Ollie open up this big one.

404
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,460
Let's see what's in it.

405
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,070
What is it, what is it?

406
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,410
Ooh looks yummy.

407
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,725
- [Missy] Is it candy? (laughs)

408
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:27,060
What is that?

409
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,880
- Carrots.
- Carrots?

410
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,793
Or is it meat?

411
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,890
(Missy and Bryan laugh)

412
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,820
Worst.

413
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,750
Easter.

414
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,200
Ever. (laughs)

415
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,730
Alright boys, you can have all the candy.

416
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,490
Daddy will take all the mushrooms

417
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,457
and vegetables and stuff, okay?

418
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:45,040
(upbeat music)

419
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,733
- Look who's over now, it's Pey and Liv.

420
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,150
We have been having such a fun day,

421
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,080
now Peyton and Olivia are
over, and we're actually

422
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,920
gonna do some more Easter stuff.

423
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,460
Okay so we thought it'd
be fun to have a little

424
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,140
Easter egg hunt, with the
girls, since they're here.

425
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,500
And so me and my Dad are
out here, setting up eggs.

426
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,480
Oh look a perfect spot for one.

427
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,193
How cute is that?

428
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:17,130
(upbeat music)

429
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,703
We've got a really loud one in here.

430
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:21,286
(egg vibrates)

431
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,752
Hey kids, do you wanna
do an Easter egg hunt?

432
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:40,098
- [Children] Yeah!

433
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,460
- [Missy] Woo, get down here!

434
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,090
Pick your Easter baskets.

435
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,920
So you get the pink bunny,

436
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,470
and that looks like a blue little sheep.

437
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,520
And you got Cat Boy, Mickey Mouse.

438
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,709
Are you guys excited?

439
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:53,880
- [Children] Yeah!

440
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,220
- [Missy] Okay, on your marks,

441
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,868
get set,

442
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:58,701
go!

443
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,592
(happy music)

444
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,260
Kids are going through all their loot now.

445
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,226
Wow, you got lots of eggs.

446
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,247
- (mumbles) A lot of eggs too.

447
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,344
- [Missy] You've got a big one.

448
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:24,010
(screaming and laughing)

449
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,650
Did you get lots of eggs?

450
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,785
- [Oliver] I got a giant one too.

451
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,693
- Whoa, good job.

452
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,873
Did you have a good Easter,
you little Easter Bunny?

453
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,560
It is so late now, the kids
had so much fun playing today,

454
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,150
playing with Pey and Liv, and
just being with the family.

455
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,590
But something we've been trying
to figure out is honestly,

456
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,830
what does this bunny actually
represent for Easter?

457
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,110
And I don't even really
understand Easter eggs either,

458
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,500
but it's a tradition, and
that's what we keep up with.

459
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,830
But yeah, so now the kids
are passed out asleep.

460
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,400
Bryan's actually working on the video now.

461
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,610
I was like, oh no, we
need to end the vlog.

462
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,640
So I am going to end it right now.

463
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,780
Make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up,

464
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,839
and let us know down in the comments below

465
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,519
what is a really good April Fool's prank.

466
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,410
Let us know down below,

467
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,250
and maybe we will use it for next year.

468
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,920
We will see you guys tomorrow.

469
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,388
Happy Easter everyone.

470
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:17,221
Bye!

471
00:17:18,711 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
