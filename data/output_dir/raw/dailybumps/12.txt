1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:01,633
- [Missy] Did you miss Daddy?

2
00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:02,466
- Uh-huh!

3
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:03,776
- I don't think he missed me.

4
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:04,682
Did you miss me?

5
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:05,515
- No.

6
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:07,461
- No.
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

Good morning!

16
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:32,222
How are you guys this morning?

17
00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:33,055
- [Both] Good.

18
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:35,374
- Yeah? It was a little bit
of a sad morning this morning

19
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:38,317
because we had to say
goodbye to our friends, huh?

20
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:40,238
Ollie's a little still upset about it.

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,262
We really like our friends, huh?

22
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,487
We had such a good time, it's so sad.

23
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:46,370
But it's okay, they're just gonna go home

24
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,012
and we're gonna see
them really soon, okay?

25
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:48,845
- [Ollie] Okay.

26
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:49,678
- And we have some fun stuff planned

27
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:50,717
this summer with them, okay?

28
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,550
- [Ollie] Okay.

29
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,208
- Finn, how are you doing?

30
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,171
Finn's coming with me to
take Ollie to school today,

31
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:57,686
and I do have some errands to run,

32
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:00,073
and since Bryan is
actually still on his trip,

33
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:03,177
he gets back today, he's gonna
be tagging along with me.

34
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:04,691
Which is exciting, huh?

35
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:06,997
He has not been feeling his very best.

36
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:10,172
As you can hear, I don't have
a sore throat or anything,

37
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:12,325
but my voice just keeps, like, cracking,

38
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:13,740
and I keep losing my voice.

39
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,052
I think it might just
be, like, the weather.

40
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:18,299
I'm not really sure, but he
seems to be doing better today,

41
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,428
he's happy, so that is always good.

42
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:22,781
But we are off to school.

43
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,885
We gotta get there because
we are kinda running

44
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,239
a little bit late, just a little bit.

45
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,113
Not as much as, like, the other day.

46
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:29,828
But just a little bit, so we gotta go.

47
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:33,938
You guys, I had to pull
over to show Ollie and Finn

48
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:36,438
this amazing, amazing rainbow.

49
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,211
Do you guys see that?

50
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:41,130
(gasps)

51
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,132
Wow, that looks so pretty!

52
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:44,253
Ollie, do you see it?

53
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:45,711
- Yeah.

54
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:47,116
- [Missy] Finn, do you see it?

55
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:48,412
How cool, huh?

56
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:49,533
(Finn vocalizes)

57
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,668
Do you think there's a pot
of gold at the end of it?

58
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:52,501
- Yeah.

59
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,237
- [Missy] (chuckles)

60
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:57,987
(relaxing music)

61
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:05,828
Look at these handsome boys!

62
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,346
Finn, you never take us to school, huh?

63
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:12,308
Oh, he's like, "Mama, I
just need you to hold me."

64
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:15,118
Finn, normally, when we
take Ollie to school,

65
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,522
you're still in bed.

66
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:17,649
- Ah! Jump the water!

67
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,481
- [Missy] Jump over the river!

68
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,000
Wah! (chuckles)

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,959
- [Ollie] That was funny!

70
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,697
- Normally, Finn is just in bed.

71
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:25,958
He's like, "I'm too tired for this, Mom.

72
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,908
"Why are we up so early?" Huh?

73
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:29,945
All right, let's get
Ollie to school, 'kay?

74
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:30,778
- [Finn] Okay.

75
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:32,321
- [Missy] All right, say bye!

76
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,992
- Bye.
- [Finn] Bye.

77
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:35,734
- Say, "See ya after school!"

78
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,990
Maybe one day, you'll be
playing at this playground, huh?

79
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,823
- Yeah.

80
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:41,170
- He's like, "I wanna play."

81
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,385
I'm like, "It's really
wet out there." (chuckles)

82
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:45,553
You're gonna be soaking
wet if you play out there.

83
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:47,768
But maybe next year or the year after,

84
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:51,080
he'll be at this preschool, and he can

85
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,585
play in the playground, 'kay?

86
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:53,418
- Yeah.

87
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:54,921
- I am definitely going to need this

88
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:57,254
if I'm going to get through today.

89
00:02:57,254 --> 00:03:02,254
Yeah, I dropped off Ollie, and
Finn has been, whoo, on fire.

90
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,967
So he actually has a cake pop.

91
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:04,856
(chuckles)

92
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:07,439
It is 9:00 in the morning
and he has a cake pop.

93
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,743
Whatever keeps him happy.

94
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:11,646
But yeah, I mentioned
earlier that I am working

95
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:14,324
on a project, and I have
some errands to run today,

96
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:17,166
and I am so excited
about this little project

97
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,085
that I'm doing.

98
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:19,552
I'm actually picking up my friend, Brooke,

99
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:20,709
who's going to help me.

100
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,630
And I can't tell you right
now what the project is,

101
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,634
although I'm gonna take you
along, you guys can maybe,

102
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:28,105
like, guess and figure it out.

103
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:30,177
But it is a surprise for someone,

104
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,122
and so I can't share it
to you yet, but really,

105
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,527
really soon, hopefully
within the next week

106
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:37,535
I can share with you what I'm working on.

107
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:40,141
And I cannot tell you how excited I am,

108
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:41,813
this is gonna be so much fun.

109
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:43,343
And I hate being someone that, like,

110
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:44,692
doesn't give out all the details.

111
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,917
I like to give details.

112
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,438
But, can't really do that right now.

113
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:49,383
So, yeah, I'm picking up my friend Brooke,

114
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:51,095
and we're gonna go shopping, and go out,

115
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,214
and do some stuff, and
we've got Finn with us,

116
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:56,214
and I'm like, "Oh, I hope
you're a happy boy today."

117
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:59,350
I hope you, you got
chocolate all over your face.

118
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,593
Whoo! I mean, if that
doesn't make you happy,

119
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:02,908
I don't know what will.

120
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,841
Hopefully today goes good,
and hopefully my voice

121
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,546
doesn't start, like, going away,

122
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,771
or I have to, like, whisper.

123
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:08,811
Ack!

124
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,821
All right, I've got my friend, Brooke!

125
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:12,672
And we actually just ran
into our first store,

126
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,425
and we're, like I said,
we're working on a project,

127
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,201
and we have to keep it kind of a secret,

128
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:19,075
but we've got some fun stuff back there.

129
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,869
I can't show you everything, but yeah,

130
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:21,882
we're really excited.

131
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:25,002
Finn has just been so
sad all day. (whimpers)

132
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:26,122
He's watching a little show right now,

133
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:28,018
but we're headed into
a couple more stores,

134
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,866
and then hopefully we can start

135
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,107
really buckling down on this whole thing.

136
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,190
- So exciting!

137
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,218
- It's so fun!

138
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:36,048
All right, I am back home after doing

139
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,952
some fun little shopping with Brooke,

140
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,722
and guess who's here?

141
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:40,805
Ollie!
- Yeah!

142
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:42,978
- Did you have fun at school?

143
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:43,811
- Yeah.

144
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:44,749
- How did your share go?

145
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:45,582
- Good.

146
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:48,004
- Today he shared his
dragon and dinosaur, huh?

147
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:48,837
- Yeah.

148
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:51,726
- And guess who else is home!

149
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,954
- [Ollie] Daddy!

150
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:54,553
- Me!
- [Missy] Yay!

151
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:55,807
Go give Daddy hugs!

152
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:56,832
- Did you miss me?

153
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:57,665
- Yeah.

154
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:58,672
- Yeah? I missed you, too.

155
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,095
- Daddy's home.

156
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,201
Ahh, it's so nice to have him home,

157
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,478
and have, my voice is like so messed up.

158
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,311
- [Bryan] Aww.

159
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,682
- Just to have the whole
family back together.

160
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,657
We definitely missed him, huh?

161
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:10,757
Did you miss Daddy?

162
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:11,590
- Yeah.

163
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,815
- I don't know if Finn missed me.

164
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:13,648
Finn!

165
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:14,991
- [Missy] Finn, where are you?

166
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,087
Finn, come here!

167
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,421
There he is!

168
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:18,650
(Finn giggles)

169
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,791
Did you miss Daddy?

170
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,874
- Uh-huh!

171
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:21,956
- I don't think he missed me.

172
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:22,789
Did you miss me?

173
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,635
- No.

174
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:24,468
- [Bryan] No.

175
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:25,301
- [Missy] Oh my gosh.

176
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:26,625
- [Bryan] I don't think he missed me,

177
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,821
I don't think he missed me.

178
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,341
- [Missy] That is not
even true. (Finn giggles)

179
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:30,869
Did you miss Daddy?

180
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:31,702
- No.

181
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:34,498
- [Missy] You tell the truth right now!

182
00:05:34,498 --> 00:05:36,568
I think he wants you to do
that thing where you cry.

183
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,208
- [Finn] No, no!

184
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,527
- [Missy] And go (imitates cry).

185
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,650
- [Bryan] Finn, did you miss me?

186
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,631
Did you miss me, Finn?

187
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:43,464
- No!

188
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:45,597
(Bryan imitates cry)

189
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:46,493
- I missed you!

190
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:47,343
- [Bryan] Oh, thanks.

191
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:48,512
- [Missy] Aww.

192
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,085
You missed Daddy.

193
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,803
But now that Daddy is
home, and we are home,

194
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:55,922
we thought it'd be fun
to do a little project,

195
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,612
a painting project.

196
00:05:57,612 --> 00:06:01,284
This has been sitting in
my game closet forever,

197
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,202
and every time they see it,
they're like, "Can we paint?"

198
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:06,788
I'm like, "That seems
really messy." (chuckles)

199
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,144
But I'm gonna go ahead and
set them up so they can paint

200
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:10,352
while I make dinner.
- You're gonna paint?

201
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:11,945
Do you wanna do, like, monster trucks?

202
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:12,778
- Yeah.

203
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:13,611
- [Missy] Yeah?

204
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:14,444
- [Bryan] That's cool.

205
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:15,277
- [Missy] Okay, I think we're gonna

206
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,110
have to share this one, okay?

207
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,519
'Cause I think Finn already
broke into it. (chuckles)

208
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,355
Sound good?

209
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:19,266
- [Ollie] Yeah.

210
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,031
- [Bryan] All right, the
boys have their pictures

211
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,058
they're gonna color.

212
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:24,625
This is the one that
Finn's doing, and Ollie,

213
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,458
what are you doing?

214
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,865
- I'm doing this one.

215
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:28,177
- [Missy] Who is that?
- [Bryan] That's Ryder, right?

216
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:29,010
- [Ollie] Ryder!

217
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,843
- [Missy And Bryan] Yeah.

218
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,147
- All right, we've got all our colors.

219
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:32,560
You guys are gonna
share it, and you've got

220
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,729
three paintbrushes.

221
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:34,859
- [Bryan] So you can't move it, okay?

222
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:35,990
Let it sit right here.

223
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,823
And then these are your paintbrushes.

224
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:37,656
You guys know how it works?

225
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:39,154
- [Ollie] Mm-hmm.
- [Finn] Yeah.

226
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:39,987
- [Missy] 'Kay.

227
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,523
- [Bryan] Ollie, you
gotta get your brush wet,

228
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:44,856
dip it in some water, and now
dip it in the color you want.

229
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:45,689
There you go.

230
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:47,366
- [Missy] Here, Finn, you can do that one.

231
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,313
- [Bryan] Yeah, see the yellow come out?

232
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:51,442
You're gonna need a little bit more.

233
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:52,289
- [Missy] If you get a little more water,

234
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,723
you can get more paint.

235
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:55,747
- [Bryan] All right, Finn,
you gotta get your brush wet.

236
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,444
So you put it in the
water, and then you put it

237
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:59,933
in the color that you want, perfect.

238
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,171
- [Ollie] This is light blue.

239
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,737
- [Bryan] And now start painting blue!

240
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:05,570
Ooh, yeah.

241
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,186
- I'm making a rainbow Ryder.

242
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:13,091
Look, now he has a broken eye.

243
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:14,174
- [Missy] Ah!

244
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,915
- [Bryan] Finn, you got
pink on you, what happened?

245
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:35,639
- I paint him.

246
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,862
- [Bryan] His big brother
happened, that's what.

247
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:42,218
- I just paint Finn.

248
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:45,301
- [Bryan] (chuckles)

249
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:04,183
- I love you, Finn.

250
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,714
(Finn vocalizes)

251
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:08,817
- [Bryan] That is so good, Finn.

252
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:10,484
You are doing great!

253
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,535
Lots of pretty colors on there, huh?

254
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,591
- We're making dinner together, yay!

255
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:20,222
And we're making spaghetti.

256
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:21,603
It's a house favorite.

257
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:26,426
We need a good pasta dish
that is just very homey.

258
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,576
Yum, and Bryan's always
so good at seasoning.

259
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,147
I stink at seasoning.

260
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:31,614
Sometimes I make spaghetti, and I'm like,

261
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:33,618
how did I mess this up?

262
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:35,211
It has like, zero flavor.

263
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,626
- Babe, no.
- [Missy] Yes, yes.

264
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,313
We'll see, you like spaghetti, huh?

265
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,145
- Yeah.

266
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:40,978
- [Missy] Yeah.

267
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,432
- [Ollie] I like noodles!

268
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:44,660
- [Missy] You like the
noodles from the spaghetti?

269
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,577
- Spaghetti is noodles.

270
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:49,491
- [Missy] Yeah, exactly.

271
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:53,241
And I cheat, and I use
this Prego meat sauce.

272
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,016
This is what I've been
using since I was a kid.

273
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:59,310
Well, I guess what my mom has
been using since I was a kid.

274
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,290
And I like it, I wish I
was a little more talented

275
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,154
to make my own spaghetti sauce.

276
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:05,513
I don't even think it's that hard,

277
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:07,065
but I don't even know if
I would actually like it.

278
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:07,898
- [Bryan] I mean, that takes all day.

279
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:08,731
- [Missy] I know!

280
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:09,564
- It takes way too long.

281
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:11,638
- Okay, see, it is hard, so. (chuckles)

282
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,851
- There's some food that
just takes too long to make,

283
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:15,058
and you just don't deal with it.

284
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:17,173
- [Missy] Yeah, so this
is yummy, and it's easy,

285
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:19,866
and you just dump it in, and
you're good to go. (laughs)

286
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:22,554
And I usually always have some in there,

287
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:24,662
because this is just a nice go-to dinner.

288
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:26,245
Yay, family dinner!

289
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,229
- [Bryan] Family dinner.

290
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,989
And Finn, what are you sitting in?

291
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:33,277
Are you sitting in a big boy chair?

292
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:34,860
- Yeah.

293
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,125
- We have regressed a
little bit, because--

294
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,100
- (laughs) Is that our life with kids,

295
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,118
is just not liking food anymore.

296
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:42,502
- [Missy] Yeah, Finn
just doesn't sit anymore,

297
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:43,988
and I'm like, you just need
to sit and eat your food, so.

298
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:45,475
I'm like, we're gonna try this out.

299
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,017
- [Bryan] And look, we
can still cheers, Finn.

300
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,234
- [Missy] See? Cheers!

301
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:49,530
- [Bryan] Cheers, Finn!

302
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,136
- [Missy] All right, fine,
we'll cheers. (laughs)

303
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:51,969
- [Bryan] Okay.

304
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:54,465
- [Missy] But yeah, we are
eating delicious spaghetti

305
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:56,662
that we made together, yay!

306
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,996
- [Bryan] So good.

307
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,723
All right, Ollie is
going to try the noodles,

308
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:03,006
and they are covered in
cheese, and they're supposed

309
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,296
to be really yummy, right?

310
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:05,129
- Yeah.

311
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,210
- [Bryan] Look at them,
they're like worms.

312
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,555
Here, hold one up, let's see it.

313
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:11,314
Whoa, they're like eating worms, Ollie!

314
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:12,147
- Yeah.

315
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:13,081
- [Missy] Oh my goodness.

316
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,097
- [Bryan] But they're yummy worms.

317
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:14,930
- Oh yeah.

318
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,873
- [Bryan] Yummy, nutritious worms.

319
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:16,706
- [Missy] Those are the best worms.

320
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,447
- 'Kay, guys, I'm gonna try a worm.

321
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:19,332
- [Bryan] You're gonna do it?

322
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,165
- Yeah.

323
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:20,998
- [Bryan] All right, let's see you do it.

324
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:22,461
You're so brave.

325
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:25,302
- Trying to get this one.

326
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:27,732
- [Bryan] Good job, dude!

327
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:29,763
What's it taste like?

328
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,706
It's not, it's not really a worm.

329
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:33,041
I was just kidding.

330
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,151
- I don't like it!

331
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,149
- [Bryan] It's yummy,
though, it's spaghetti.

332
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,813
You did so good, you
just tried something new!

333
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:41,696
- [Missy] Yay!

334
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:42,901
Good job.

335
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:46,651
Dinner was somewhat
successful, I don't know.

336
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:51,233
It was delicious, but
the kids were just crazy.

337
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,665
Finn is just really off today.

338
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:55,282
Has been the past few days, and you know,

339
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:56,321
Ollie's just Ollie.

340
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,496
What are you doing, Finn?

341
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,201
- [Finn] Jump in pool!

342
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,455
- [Missy] You're gonna jump in the pool?

343
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:02,288
- Yeah!

344
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,423
- [Missy] (gasps) 'Kay, do it!

345
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:05,227
He's like, "I mean the hot tub."

346
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:06,407
- [Bryan] Jump in, Finn!

347
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:07,545
- [Missy] Go, Finn, go!

348
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:09,378
One, two, three, jump!

349
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:13,362
Go, Finley.

350
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:14,529
Woo! Good job!

351
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,267
- It's swimming time!

352
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,627
- [Missy] Woo! Are you having fun?

353
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:21,460
- Yeah.

354
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,328
- [Missy] You beg to do
this every single day, huh?

355
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:24,161
- Yeah.

356
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,093
- [Missy] You actually
went swimming yesterday.

357
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:25,926
- Yeah!

358
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:27,026
- [Missy] Woo-hoo!

359
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,605
Swimming time.

360
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,504
- Oh, Karma and Luna.

361
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:33,434
Did you two miss me while I was gone, hi.

362
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:37,180
We just got out of the hot tub,
and it is so cold, you guys.

363
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,935
I think even the dogs are like, let us in!

364
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,415
Let us in!

365
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:43,630
We got a fire going.

366
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,560
It's chilly.

367
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,641
The boys burned off a ton of their energy,

368
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:49,471
so we're getting them ready for bed now.

369
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:52,049
Oh hey, you two cool kids.

370
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:54,045
Show me what you got, show
me what you're wearing.

371
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,112
- [Missy] Show 'em your jammies.

372
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:57,560
- [Bryan] Star Wars jammies!

373
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,695
Do you like them, Ollie?

374
00:11:58,695 --> 00:11:59,528
- Yeah.

375
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:00,361
- [Bryan] Are they comfy?

376
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,194
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:02,027
- [Bryan] Yeah.

378
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:04,320
I got them Star Wars jammies
so I could surprise them,

379
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,631
since Daddy had to be gone
for a couple of days, huh?

380
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:07,559
I love them, though.

381
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,656
They look good!

382
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:09,489
- Yeah.

383
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:10,322
- [Bryan] Are they comfy?

384
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:11,155
- Yeah.

385
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:12,958
- [Bryan] You can't stop
touching them, huh? (chuckles)

386
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:13,810
- [Missy] They're so soft.

387
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,472
- [Bryan] What are you doing, Finn?

388
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:16,847
- He's like, "I need to cuddle with you."

389
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,223
- [Bryan] Aww, sometimes Finn just

390
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:19,840
still needs to be the baby.

391
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,433
- He is still the baby.

392
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,266
- [Bryan] Yep.

393
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,957
- Yeah, if I ever don't
act like he's the baby,

394
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,689
he goes, "Mama's baby."

395
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,560
- [Ollie] Watch this, guys.

396
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,063
- And Luna comes in to say.

397
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:31,896
Luna, come here.

398
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:32,729
Luna, come here.

399
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:33,726
All right, show us, Ollie.

400
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:34,559
What do you want to show us?

401
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,668
Whoa, you can crawl
all the way under that?

402
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:38,503
- Yeah.

403
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,133
- That's so cool.

404
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,246
Can you come out through here?

405
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:42,878
- [Ollie] I can come out through here.

406
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:43,813
- [Missy] She's so funny.

407
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:45,365
She's like, "Hello, hello."

408
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,734
- I know, she like, I can't do anything,

409
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:48,129
I'm not allowed to have a separate life.

410
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,528
- She missed you so much.

411
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:50,853
- [Bryan] Oh, I bet.

412
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,481
- [Missy] She was like, "Where is my Dad?"

413
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,297
- Aw, Luna's like my baby girl, huh?

414
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:57,547
(laughing)

415
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:01,856
- She's like, can't even.

416
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:04,284
She's like, "I'm just so
happy we're all together!"

417
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,163
- [Bryan] I know. (laughs)

418
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:07,564
- She literally acts like their sister,

419
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:10,860
like, she's just like,
annoying, but like, adorable.

420
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,726
- [Bryan] Yeah. You guys are so cute.

421
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,297
I feel like you're in like a
little nest of love right here.

422
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:16,987
- I know, they're so cute.

423
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,357
Finn, yeah, Finn has like
this weird habit of, like,

424
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:21,595
if he doesn't think I'm
treating him like my baby,

425
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:24,909
he'll literally grab my tummy,
he'll go, "Mommy's baby."

426
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:25,877
(Bryan laughs)

427
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:27,261
Because he wants me to know that

428
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:30,819
he came out of my belly, so he's my baby.

429
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,270
And he's got a point.

430
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,948
- [Bryan] Yeah, he's funny.

431
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:35,636
- You're my baby, too.

432
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:37,341
- Yeah, you can be the baby, too.

433
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:39,706
- [Bryan] Check out what
else I showed the boys.

434
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:41,661
Carl got my that. (chuckles)

435
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:43,119
It's cool.

436
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,025
Goodnight, Ollie.

437
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,142
- [Ollie] Goodnight.

438
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:46,482
- [Bryan] Goodnight, Finn.

439
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:47,863
- Night.

440
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,827
- [Bryan] Love you, dude.

441
00:13:49,827 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
