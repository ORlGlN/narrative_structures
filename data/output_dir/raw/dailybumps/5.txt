1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,230
- [Bryan] Look at that face.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,559
I think he's up to something.

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,581
Finn, what happened here?

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,296
(Finn babbles)

5
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:12,364
Really?

6
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:13,235
- Yeah.

7
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:15,071
- [Bryan] So then you weren't coloring

8
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:16,831
all over the white board, and then you

9
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:19,468
dragged it all the way down to the tile?

10
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:20,701
That didn't happen?

11
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:25,573
♪ This is our life, this is
our fun, this is who we are. ♪

12
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:30,106
♪ This is our dream, this is our
team, shot among the stars. ♪

13
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:32,339
♪ Take this shield and we'll be fine. ♪

14
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:35,132
♪ Take this hand and watch us shine, ♪

15
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:40,132
♪ This is our life, let's
live it, live it forever. ♪

16
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,969
- [Bryan] Good morning.

17
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,975
What are you doing, Ollie?

18
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:47,118
Are you thirsty?

19
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:47,951
- Mmm-hmm.

20
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,067
- Yeah? (laughs)

21
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:52,489
I walked in the kitchen, and
Ollie was drinking apple juice

22
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,778
out of the carton in
front of the open fridge.

23
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:57,473
You gotta ask, buddy. (laughs)

24
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,726
You just couldn't wait
any longer, could you?

25
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,984
(Ollie laughs)

26
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:01,954
Are you thirsty?

27
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:03,006
- Yeah.

28
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,075
Good morning.

29
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:05,158
(Finn shouting)

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,847
- [Bryan] Good morning, boys.

31
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:08,225
How we doing this morning?

32
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:09,070
- Good.

33
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,667
- Here, Ollie, put the apple
juice back and shut the fridge,

34
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,256
cause you're letting
all the ping pong balls

35
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:14,740
out of the fridge, okay?

36
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,573
(Ollie laughs)

37
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:16,512
Do you know what that means?

38
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:17,345
- What?

39
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,118
- When I was little,
my mom used to tell me

40
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,139
that the fridge and
the freezer were filled

41
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:21,972
with invisible ping pong balls,

42
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:26,445
and when you opened the
doors, they all came out

43
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:29,565
and that's basically all the
cold coming out of the fridge.

44
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:30,903
If you leave the fridge open for too long,

45
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:32,077
all the cold will come out.

46
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:32,910
- Oh.

47
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,251
- So now there's invisible ping pong balls

48
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,485
everywhere all over this
kitchen, isn't there?

49
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:37,318
- Yeah.

50
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:38,186
- [Bryan] Yeah, and I think

51
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:39,812
we may have spilled a couple times.

52
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:40,645
(bottle clatters on the tile)

53
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:41,478
Are you okay?

54
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:42,311
- No.

55
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,794
- You woke up with so much energy

56
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:45,579
and a big ol' smile on
your face, didn't you?

57
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,752
(Finn screams)

58
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,462
(upbeat music plays)

59
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,295
I can barely keep up with this kid.

60
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:52,746
(upbeat music)

61
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,962
This kid thinks he can run from me?

62
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:57,867
You think you can run from me?

63
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,060
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

64
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,643
(Finn laughs)

65
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:02,476
(Bryan laughs)

66
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,419
Hi, Finn. Hey, do you miss Mommy?

67
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:05,252
- Yeah.

68
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:07,257
- Yeah, we're gonna see
her really soon, okay?

69
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:09,693
We've been doing so good.

70
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:12,415
Yesterday, I put the boys
down for naps and they did it.

71
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,869
They've been sleeping
all night in their bed.

72
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:15,702
Right, Ollie?

73
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,490
- We've been really good boys.

74
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,449
- Yes, you have been.

75
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:21,479
I'm really proud of you guys.

76
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,646
(laughs) Oh my gosh.

77
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,562
They seriously have so
much energy, you guys.

78
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:29,206
I don't even know what
to do with them today.

79
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:31,379
(groans) But yes, we've
been doing really well--

80
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,629
(Ollie shouting drowns Bryan out)

81
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,156
Since Missy's been gone.

82
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:36,489
I think she's gonna be home super soon,

83
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,947
so that's gonna be nice
because I miss her so much.

84
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:40,499
We haven't been apart for this long

85
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:42,070
in quite a while, it's been a while.

86
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,838
Probably the last time, she
went to Hawaii without me.

87
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:47,528
Honestly, baby somebody needs to change.

88
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:50,263
But the boys and I have been
having so much fun, huh?

89
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:52,061
Have you been having
good quality dad time?

90
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:52,894
- Yeah.

91
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:54,250
- Yeah, but you miss mommy?

92
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,083
- Mmm-hmm.

93
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,526
- How much do you miss mommy?

94
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:58,484
- A lot.

95
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,071
- A lot?

96
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,323
(Bryan blows a raspberry)

97
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:03,221
(both laughing)

98
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,309
Yesterday, poppa took
the boys for the day,

99
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:08,117
and he found Scoop-A-Bug sorting kit.

100
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:10,530
Look at this, we've got
jars with bugs in it.

101
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,298
Oh, they're getting everywhere, oh no!

102
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:14,525
(mock screaming) You boys gotta sort them.

103
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,062
Can you sort the bugs for me?

104
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:16,918
Put them in that cup.

105
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:19,662
So we need ants in this one,
we need ladybugs in this one,

106
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,603
and we need grasshoppers in this one.

107
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,475
Where's the other one,
where's the bee one?

108
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,586
Ollie, did the bees get escaped?

109
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:28,169
(upbeat music)

110
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:49,270
- [Bryan] Good morning,
fishies, here's breakfast.

111
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,211
(Finn shouts)

112
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:52,378
They're getting some goods.

113
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:55,102
Also gotta do the shrimp.

114
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,509
Love that stuff.

115
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:59,092
(upbeat music)

116
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,174
Finn, you haven't taken care
of your kitty lately, have you?

117
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:07,007
Can you pet her?

118
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,090
(Finn shouts)

119
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,153
Aww, you're so cute with your kitty.

120
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:12,274
Give her nice pets.

121
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,728
Finn, be gentle, okay?

122
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:15,811
There you go.

123
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:18,400
Hi, kitty.

124
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,555
(meowing)

125
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:23,894
Kitties are doing really good, huh?

126
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,889
(upbeat music)

127
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,010
- [Bryan] Look at that face.

128
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,427
I think he's up to something.

129
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,011
Finn, what happened here?

130
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,661
(Finn babbles)

131
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:39,724
Really?

132
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:40,585
- Yeah.

133
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:42,364
- [Bryan] So then you weren't coloring

134
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:45,445
all over the white board,
and then you dragged it

135
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:47,163
all the way down to the tile?

136
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,606
That didn't happen?

137
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,028
- [Ollie] And then it was over here.

138
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,239
- [Bryan] Oh, and over there.

139
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,318
Thanks for pointing that
out, Ollie. (laughs)

140
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,883
Finn was drawing pictures here,

141
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:59,544
and apparently his vision was
just too big for the canvas.

142
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:00,972
Um, thumbs-up this video if you think

143
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:02,555
we should put that fridge on a shirt.

144
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:03,388
(bell dings)

145
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,249
Okay, Finn, this is getting out of hand.

146
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:07,905
I'm officially going to take
the marker away from you.

147
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:08,803
(Ollie mumbles)

148
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:10,011
(Bryan gasps)

149
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:10,844
Oh, no.

150
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:14,640
(Finn laughs)

151
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,153
Excuse me a moment.

152
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,211
Nothing a good old scrubbing can't fix.

153
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,315
I think we're good.

154
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:25,587
Ollie and Finn are all dressed for bed.

155
00:05:25,587 --> 00:05:27,421
You guys ready to chill out?

156
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,254
- Yeah.

157
00:05:28,254 --> 00:05:30,285
- Um, do you guys hear that?

158
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,118
- Yeah.

159
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,670
- What is that, what's that noise?

160
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,954
Is someone knocking on our door?

161
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:34,787
- Yeah!

162
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:36,499
- [Bryan] Should you go
answer the door, Finn?

163
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:37,558
Go, go, go, go, go!

164
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:39,856
Who is it, who is it?

165
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:41,188
(door creaks)

166
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:42,811
- Momma!

167
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:44,561
- [Bryan] It's momma!

168
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:47,659
Give momma a hug, boys.

169
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:50,543
Look at him, he's like, "Are you sure?

170
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:54,376
"Is this really mommy?" (laughs)

171
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:55,209
Hi, babe.

172
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:56,939
- Hi.

173
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,190
- [Bryan] The boys are so
excited to see mommy again, huh?

174
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,023
- Yeah.

175
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,008
- Hi, babe.

176
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:04,731
- You did so good, I'm so proud of you.

177
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,273
- Thanks, babe, I love you.

178
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:08,866
All right, Ollie, grab mommy's luggage.

179
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:11,290
Roll it in the house.

180
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,665
Roll it in.

181
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,559
You're gonna drop it, what are you doing?

182
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,942
- [Missy] There's special gifts in there.

183
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,954
- [Bryan] Ooh, mommy's got gifts for you.

184
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:20,289
- I'm so excited!

185
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:22,216
- Yay, did you miss me?

186
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,049
- Yeah.

187
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,002
- Did you have fun with daddy, though?

188
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:25,835
- Yeah.

189
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:26,668
- Yeah?

190
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:28,245
Did you get to do all kinds
of fun, crazy boy stuff?

191
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:29,078
- [Ollie] Mmm-hmm.

192
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:29,911
(Missy chuckles)

193
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,350
- Did you miss your mama?

194
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,913
- [Bryan] Aw, he, like,
jumped into your arms.

195
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,071
That's so cute.

196
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,297
- You were such a good boy for daddy, huh?

197
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:37,130
(Finn babbling)

198
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,100
You want gifts?

199
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,444
He's like, "What's in here, momma?

200
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:40,672
"What do you got for me?"

201
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,191
- A baby kitten gift?

202
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:43,382
(Missy laughs)

203
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:45,478
- Um, I might have some gifts for you.

204
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:47,633
I might pull something out of here, okay?

205
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:48,466
- Okay.

206
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,561
(both laugh)

207
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:51,726
- All right, boys, momma brought presents

208
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,618
for you guys from Hawaii.

209
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:54,511
You wanna see what it is?

210
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:55,344
- Yeah!

211
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:56,177
- [Bryan] Okay.

212
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:57,108
- All right, are you ready?

213
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:57,941
- [Ollie] Yeah.

214
00:06:57,941 --> 00:06:59,679
- Okay, here it is.

215
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,919
- [Bryan] Ukeleles!

216
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,752
- [Missy] I got you the blue one, Finn.

217
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:05,093
(ukuleles strumming)

218
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,235
Do you know what those are?

219
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:07,068
- What?

220
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:08,417
- They're like little guitars!

221
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,250
- Oh.

222
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,490
- So now you can play like Coco, Ollie.

223
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,138
You wanna play "Un Poco Loco"?

224
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:14,960
(Finn babbles)

225
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,793
Oh, really?

226
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:17,341
Aww.

227
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:18,929
- That's "Un Poco Loco."

228
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,426
- [Bryan] Let me see you play, Finn.

229
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:21,670
Let me see you play, Ollie.

230
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,163
(ukuleles strumming)

231
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:24,797
- [Missy] Can you guys dance?

232
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:25,876
- [Bryan] Nice, Ollie.

233
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:26,786
- Play a song!

234
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:27,797
(laughing)

235
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:31,021
- Oh my gosh, that's
amazing, Ollie. (laughs)

236
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:32,064
- [Missy] Ooh!

237
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:33,443
- [Bryan] Good job, Finn.

238
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:34,691
(Finn babbles)

239
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:36,762
- You guys, I've got
one more special gift,

240
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,071
and I got it at a really
cute horsie store.

241
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:39,904
Do you wanna see?

242
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:40,737
- Yeah.

243
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:44,819
- I got you guys matching cowboy belts!

244
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,652
- [Ollie] Yay!

245
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:46,485
- [Bryan] Whoa.

246
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:47,578
- [Missy] Isn't that cool?

247
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:48,922
- [Bryan] What do you say, boys?

248
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:50,082
- Thank you, mommy!

249
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:51,555
- You're welcome!

250
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,297
This one's Finn's, this one's Ollie's.

251
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:56,236
- [Bryan] Ooh, can you put
it around yourself, Finn?

252
00:07:56,236 --> 00:07:57,183
(laughs)

253
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,426
- He's like, "Is this
how it goes?" (laughs)

254
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,502
Now you can be real cowboys--

255
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:03,201
- [Bryan] With cowboy
belts and your boots.

256
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,784
- Big old cowboy belt, okay?

257
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,617
- Okay.

258
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,063
- [Missy] Isn't that cute?

259
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:08,901
- And then we can have little ropes?

260
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:09,766
(Finn babbles)

261
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,630
- Yeah, we have the ropes on so you can

262
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,494
do your lassos with the cows?

263
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,327
- Mmm-hmm.

264
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,216
- We are so happy that
mommy is back, aren't we?

265
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:19,946
- I missed them so much.

266
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,389
Like, I had so much fun in Hawaii,

267
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,544
but I missed my boys, all of them.

268
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:26,918
- We missed you, babe, but we survived.

269
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,955
We did it, Finn, we did it, didn't we?

270
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:29,932
- You guys did so good.

271
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,362
Like, I was a little
nervous because, you know,

272
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:32,599
it's hard without mom around.

273
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,844
Like, mom does a lot of stuff, and--

274
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:36,020
(Finn babbling drowns out Missy)

275
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,166
Honestly, it went way
better than I even thought.

276
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,585
- She had no confidence in me, you guys.

277
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:42,418
(Missy laughs)

278
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:44,030
- That's not true, not true, but yeah.

279
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,280
- Anyway, I hope you guys
enjoyed all the fun that I had

280
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,848
with Ollie and Finn while momma is gone.

281
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:50,357
What are you doing, Finn?

282
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:51,190
- [Missy] Ew.

283
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,585
- You're silly.

284
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:53,458
(Missy groans)

285
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,610
Thanks for watching this video.

286
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,437
If you enjoyed it, be sure
and give it a big thumbs-up.

287
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:57,270
- Thumbs-up!

288
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,784
- Subscribe, and we'll see you manana.

289
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:01,265
Ollie, you ready to do bye (mumbles)?

290
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,098
(Finn shouts)

291
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:02,931
- [Bryan] Okay, go!

292
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:03,764
- Bye!

293
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:05,614
(Finn shouting)

294
00:09:05,614 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
