1
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:01,874
- We are out of the house because

2
00:00:01,874 --> 00:00:04,587
we have a ton of errands
to we need to run today.

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,458
And one of them is...

4
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,006
(whispers) buying Finn a birthday present.

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:10,364
- We are at the haunted maze!

6
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:12,252
- Is this your first haunted maze ever?

7
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:13,085
- Yes.

8
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,003
- Are you excited?

9
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:14,836
- Yeah.

10
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:15,702
- Are you scared?

11
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:16,535
- Um, yeah...

12
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:17,610
- Yeah, just a little bit?

13
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,496
We'll see how it turns out. (laughs)

14
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:20,770
♫ This is our life

15
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,745
♫ This is our fun

16
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:23,854
♫ This is who we are

17
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:25,134
♫ This is our dream

18
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:26,318
♫ This is our team

19
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,766
♫ Shot among the stars

20
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:31,207
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine

21
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:34,054
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

22
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:35,750
♫ This is our life

23
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,791
♫ Let's live it

24
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,433
♫ Live it forever

25
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:40,810
- Good morning!
- Morning!

26
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,415
(Finn babbling)
(laughs)

27
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:45,583
- Yay, it's Saturday morning.

28
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,500
Huh?
- Yeah.

29
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,295
- It has been a crazy week you guys.

30
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:52,747
I actually cried a few
times last week because

31
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:55,012
we were just so swamped, and so busy.

32
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,268
And it's finally Saturday.

33
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:58,380
And we're still busy,

34
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,316
I still have a party
tomorrow (laughs) actually.

35
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:03,245
But I feel like I'm
pretty much ready for it,

36
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:04,563
and I'm excited for it.

37
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:06,109
So there is stuff I
have to get done today,

38
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,920
like cleaning up...and stuff.

39
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,349
But we have been, just running
like crazy this past week.

40
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:13,869
The house is kind of insane,

41
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,158
especially this area.

42
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,566
I've been trying to
clean it up this morning,

43
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:19,726
but, yeah, I really like my sewing stuff

44
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:21,062
it's just a disaster.

45
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:23,174
I bought this probably
before Ollie was born,

46
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:24,533
because I was doing a lot of sewing.

47
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:27,325
And it is just torn apart,
and nothing is organized

48
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:29,741
in here and it is just
a disaster. (laughs)

49
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:30,987
So I was like, alright,
I'm going to go through it.

50
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:32,163
I'm going to get my bag out...

51
00:01:32,163 --> 00:01:34,147
start throwing away things you don't need.

52
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:36,182
I feel like sewing boxes and, just like,

53
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:38,478
craft areas tend to get very messy.

54
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,063
Because you just keep like
little scraps, you're like,

55
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:42,122
"Oh, well I'm not going to throw this away

56
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:43,729
because I can probably
use it for something."

57
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,313
Which is true, but then it
just becomes so unorganized,

58
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:49,105
and I'm like "I can't do it anymore!"

59
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:51,695
Which makes crafting not
fun when it's not organized.

60
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,727
So anyways, I've got to clean up today.

61
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:55,503
We've got actually a lot
of fun stuff planned today.

62
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:58,551
- Alright you guys, we
are out of the house

63
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,807
because we have a ton of
errands we need to run today.

64
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:02,557
And one of them is...

65
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:04,826
(whispers) Buying Finn a birthday present.

66
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:08,265
So, we have to...
(Missy laughs)

67
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,098
get rid of Finn.

68
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,639
- (laughs) Get rid of him.

69
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,653
- We have to drop Finn off
over at Mimi and Papa's house,

70
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:14,699
he's going to hang out with them today.

71
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,004
And then we are going to
go find a birthday present.

72
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,670
Alright Finn, what you got?

73
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,503
- Me!

74
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:21,989
- [Bryan] What you got, a sucker?

75
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:22,941
- Yeah!

76
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:25,316
- [Bryan] Yeah? You ready
to go see Mimi and Papa?

77
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:27,511
- [Ollie] I've got a red a
sucker, red's my favorite

78
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:28,344
- I have green.

79
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:29,556
- [Bryan] And you've got green!

80
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,980
Yup, he's got a red sucker,
Finn's got a green one.

81
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,196
Alright, come on Finn.

82
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:37,255
Alright! Dropping Finn off,
over at Mimi and Papa's house.

83
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:38,727
He's got all the pets to play with

84
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:39,734
- [Mimi] Hey, oh my goodness

85
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,317
(upbeat music)

86
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:50,479
- [Bryan] Dude, look,
it's actually Bricktober.

87
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,598
Did you know that?

88
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,652
- Yeah, that's Cotton,
comes with two swords...

89
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,420
I did not know that.

90
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,581
He would really like these...

91
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,684
These are Spider-man guns.

92
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:06,599
Oh my gosh! Iron Man, it comes with guns!

93
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,086
- Alright Ollie, you have a very important

94
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,875
decision to make, okay?

95
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,708
- Okay.

96
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,759
- You have to choose a birthday present

97
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,361
for your little brother,
who is turning two.

98
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,417
- [Ollie] Yes.

99
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,410
- He's turning two in just
a couple of days, okay?

100
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,743
- Let's do this.

101
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,389
(energetic, bouncy music)

102
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:46,594
- [Bryan] What do you think Ollie?

103
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,139
Should we get him a dinosaur?

104
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,858
- Um, yeah. Let's get him this one.

105
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:54,744
- [Bryan] Whoa, that looks
way too complicated for Finn.

106
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:57,984
- Yeah, it comes with a
cage and a Rhoetosaurus.

107
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,333
- Hey Ollie, are you sure you're not

108
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,875
picking out a present for yourself?

109
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,028
- Um, no.
- And not Finn...okay.

110
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,947
(Bryan laughs)
[Missy] Look it.

111
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:06,588
- Just so we can share with Finn

112
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:07,644
- [Bryan] Oh, okay.

113
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:09,236
- [Missy] Look at this, a dragon one.

114
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:11,309
- [Bryan] Ooh, it's remote
controlled too, that's cool.

115
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:12,900
(dragon roars)

116
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,980
- [Ollie] We can't...

117
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,428
- [Missy] No, we can't get that for him?

118
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:18,011
(upbeat music)

119
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,767
- Wow, it's with two guns!

120
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,968
- [Bryan] That looks cool! That
could be something he likes.

121
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,628
He definitely loves Batman.

122
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:33,877
- Dada, I found a pirate ship,

123
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:36,172
and it comes with this guy, and a cannon-

124
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:37,764
- [Bryan] Whoa! Who's that guy, Ollie?

125
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:38,788
Where did you see him?

126
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:39,996
- This is Jack...

127
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,300
Jack Sparrow!

128
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,276
- [Bryan] And?

129
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:45,677
- He came to my birthday party...

130
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:48,414
And there's a shark, and a cannon.

131
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,418
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's Jack Sparrow,

132
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:52,546
he was at your birthday party, huh?

133
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:55,034
- Yeah, and goes into the pirate ship.

134
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:56,825
- [Bryan] That's a pretty cool ship.

135
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:58,649
- We picked out a present!

136
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,237
- We did, we picked out
a present for Finn, huh?

137
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:02,070
- Yeah.

138
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,190
- And if you want to see what we got him,

139
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,381
you'll have to watch tomorrow's vlog,

140
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:06,629
because tomorrow we're having
a big birthday party for Finn.

141
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,254
Hey! Are you excited for
Finn's birthday party?

142
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:10,496
Yeah? (Bryan laughs)

143
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:11,817
- I like this and--

144
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:13,096
- [Bryan] Yes, I know you like it all,

145
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:15,744
but that's the point of a
toy store, Ollie. (laughs)

146
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:18,409
He's been such a good
boy, but he has been like,

147
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:21,161
"Ooh I like that, ooh I
like that, ooh I like that!"

148
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:23,945
Like yes, I know, he's
kind of dropping hints

149
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,605
for Santa, I think too.

150
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:26,438
Alright--

151
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:27,271
- Whoa!

152
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:29,917
- [Bryan] Whoa! Do you
have fun shopping? (laughs)

153
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:30,750
- Look at this.

154
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,527
- [Bryan] Alright, we just got
back from shopping for Finn.

155
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,277
Ollie is fast asleep.

156
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:38,674
- [Missy] And so is Finn.

157
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:42,286
- [Bryan] Hey dude,

158
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,119
you want some blankie?

159
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:49,028
(whispers) There you go buddy.

160
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:51,052
Alright, so we got some errands done,

161
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:52,500
the kids are asleep.

162
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,868
And we even... are doing some testing

163
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,852
for our Halloween party.

164
00:05:57,852 --> 00:06:01,091
I really want to serve empanadas at the

165
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:04,529
Halloween party this year,
so we got these ones.

166
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,505
Ooh, we don't know what
any of them are. (laughs)

167
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:08,457
Do you like it?

168
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:10,250
- Mm, not bad I just
don't know what it is.

169
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,741
- [Bryan] We have ham and cheese, beef,

170
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:13,163
and chicken and cilantro too.

171
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:14,058
Alright, let me know if you guys

172
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:15,813
have ever had empanadas before.

173
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:16,981
We are taste testing them,

174
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:18,739
and they are super good.

175
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,492
It's a Cuban food, basically.

176
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,164
And it comes with Mojo sauce,

177
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,284
which is like a garlic sauce?

178
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,948
Do you think we should serve
these at the Halloween party?

179
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:27,745
- [Missy] I like how
easy they are, you just--

180
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:29,486
- [Bryan] I know! No, totally.

181
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:30,645
If you guys have eaten empanadas,

182
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:31,655
let us know in the comments down below,

183
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,454
what is your favorite type of empanada?

184
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:34,749
What should we be looking out for?

185
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:37,230
This one's called The
Oscar, it's got ham, cheese,

186
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,678
and like some sort of other Cuban meat.

187
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:40,973
I'm not sure.

188
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:42,711
Oh hey dude!

189
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,269
Good morning Finn.

190
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,036
- [Missy] Did you have a nice nap?

191
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:47,308
(Bryan laughs)

192
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:50,065
- Hey dude, it's good you
guys got a little nap,

193
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:52,473
because we're going somewhere fun.

194
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:54,160
Yeah, we are going to be
out kind of late today,

195
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,032
because we are going to take
the boys to a haunted maze.

196
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:58,515
So, Ollie definitely needed a little nap.

197
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:00,998
I'm glad Finn got a good one too!

198
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:04,782
Whoa! Your feet are flashing! Do it again!

199
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:06,782
Whoa! Now they're green.

200
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,277
Whoa, those are some dance moves bro.

201
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:11,850
(Bryan laughs)

202
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,054
Alright Ollie, where
are we going right now?

203
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,686
- We are at the haunted maze!

204
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,662
- Is this your first haunted maze ever?

205
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:20,495
- Yes.

206
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:21,506
- Are you excited?

207
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:22,339
- Yeah.

208
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:23,246
- Are you scared?

209
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:24,079
- Um, yeah.

210
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,912
- Yeah, just a little bit?

211
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,172
Yes, we are headed into...

212
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,636
Ollie's very first haunted maze.

213
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,570
We'll see how it turns out. (laughs)

214
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,403
(melodious music)

215
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:43,151
- Alright, the boys are off.

216
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:44,234
Woooo....

217
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,871
- [Missy] Oh my goodness, it's a clown!

218
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,577
(clown honks)

219
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:53,791
Such a funny clown.

220
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,815
- [Bryan] Hi clown! (laughs)

221
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:56,951
Finn high-fived him.

222
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:00,039
We gotta find the keys, in the Orbeez.

223
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,929
Ollie, can you find
the keys in the Orbeez?

224
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:02,762
- Mmhmm.

225
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:03,595
(cow bell clanking)

226
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:04,489
- [Bryan] Okay let's go find the key.

227
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:05,322
- [Missy] Yeah.

228
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:07,684
- [Bryan] Whoa! Look at this clown.

229
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,308
(laughs)

230
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:10,732
So far they're doing really good.

231
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,572
What do you boys think so far?

232
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:13,405
- Creepy!

233
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,072
- [Bryan] Whoa! Hey!

234
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,836
Alright, we gotta find a key, right?

235
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:18,669
- Yeah.

236
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:19,722
- [Bryan] Alright, we
gotta find a key, boys!

237
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:23,222
Can you find a key in one of these holes?

238
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,167
Whoa!

239
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,000
- No.

240
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,956
- [Bryan] No in there?

241
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:29,596
Try the other one, try the other one!

242
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:31,956
We have to find a key in the Orbeez

243
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:33,428
to get out of here.

244
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:34,629
- [Mimi] There's probably no key.

245
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:35,844
They're just making you--

246
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,339
- [Bryan] That's what's scary.

247
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,922
(upbeat music)

248
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:52,459
Alright Ollie, what did you think

249
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,644
of your very first haunted maze?

250
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:56,227
(whines)

251
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,680
You look a little scared, are you afraid?

252
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,814
You don't need to be afraid (laughs)

253
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:01,647
It was actually really cute,

254
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:03,539
we were just like walking between lights-

255
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,311
- That was so cute!
- And hay and stuff

256
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,156
He did so good!

257
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:07,301
You are so brave, dude.

258
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:08,582
Show me your brave muscles!

259
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,415
(Missy laughs)

260
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,848
Can you give me muscles?

261
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,393
No? Aww.
- Aww.

262
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:14,000
- He's so sad, it's okay buddy.

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
- [Missy] You did so good.

264
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,088
Those were like really nice clowns,

265
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:18,777
and it was basically just a game.

266
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,288
- [Mimi] The scary
clowns are in that one--

267
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:21,279
- Yeah everything's scary--

268
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,112
- [Mimi] And we're not gonna go in there.

269
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:23,301
- I'm going to go into that one,

270
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:26,052
and I'm gonna say, "Hey!
You leave Ollie alone."

271
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:27,269
Okay?

272
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:28,572
- [Missy] You don't go in that one, okay?

273
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:29,405
- And you'll be good.

274
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,212
You can hang out here,
and eat some popcorn.

275
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,045
Finn! Were you afraid?

276
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:35,716
Did you find the key?

277
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:39,044
- So, the haunted maze is
actually being held at a dairy.

278
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:40,972
And it is one of the best dairy's,

279
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:43,117
in like Southern California.

280
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,672
Everyone raves about the chocolate milk.

281
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:49,178
- And Ollie's the chocolate
milk professional.

282
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:50,244
(Missy laughs)

283
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:51,152
- [Missy] Yeah! Um, I
want one of those too.

284
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:51,985
- You have to tell me
what you think, okay?

285
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:53,570
- It's like chocolate
milk with whole milk,

286
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,682
it's very good.

287
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,057
- Um, we should all share this one.

288
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,242
This is like 1000 calories.

289
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,746
- [Missy] Oh, you're right. (laughs)

290
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:00,706
It's, uh, very, very famous out here,

291
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,626
and everyone loves DeJong's Dairy,

292
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:04,282
because they have chocolate milk.

293
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:07,109
Alright, look who's joined us!

294
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:09,105
- Hey! Actually, this is
like my worst nightmare.

295
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:09,938
- Now we're really going to get scared.

296
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:10,927
(everyone laughs)

297
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:11,760
I don't want to go.

298
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,919
- So a lot of the stuff
being used in this maze

299
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,888
is actually from our last maze,

300
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:16,423
that we had last year.

301
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:18,983
So we're really excited
to check it out here.

302
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:22,040
It's inside a abandoned
warehouse apparently

303
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,176
- Oh, that's so cool.

304
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,401
(missy laughs)

305
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:25,780
- Well I think it's going to
be really fun, so let's go!

306
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,188
Alright, here we go.

307
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:29,855
(ominous music)

308
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:35,348
(Missy screams)

309
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:36,860
- [Bryan] Ooh, a hand!

310
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,693
(Missy laughs)

311
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:39,684
(Bryan yells)

312
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:41,851
(screams)

313
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,550
- [Missy] Oh, no no no no.
- It says to keep out!

314
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,383
- [Girl] Boo!

315
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,633
(laughter)

316
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,387
Play with me!

317
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,754
- [Bryan] Oh my God, I remember that mask!

318
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,730
(Missy screams)

319
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,522
I remember this mask.

320
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,523
You guys need help with that?

321
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,738
You're supposed to bang it!

322
00:10:58,738 --> 00:10:59,651
(banging)

323
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,274
- [Monster] No, it's not working.

324
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,922
We are trying to watch Teen Mother.

325
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:03,819
(laughter)

326
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,603
- [Missy] Oh my God.

327
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:07,186
- [Friend] They're watching Teen Mom.

328
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:09,853
(Missy screams)

329
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,803
- [Missy] Oh yeah, I
remember we bought that!

330
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:16,034
(laughs) I remember him!

331
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,767
(screams)

332
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:19,600
Oh wow.

333
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,504
- [Bryan] This is really dark and scary.

334
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:23,421
- [Missy] It is pitch dark in here.

335
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:28,580
We made it, we made it through!

336
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,413
Good maze.

337
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:30,246
- You like it?

338
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:31,079
- [Missy] Yeah, it was good!

339
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:31,912
- Okay good, bye.

340
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:32,745
(Missy laughs)

341
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:34,107
- That was such a fun maze!

342
00:11:34,107 --> 00:11:36,059
It was fun seeing it and it's pretty cool

343
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,843
how so many people came
out to experience it too.

344
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:41,300
- [Bryan] This is a really scary

345
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,179
scene of the block right now.

346
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,579
- [Missy] Yeah! I'm
like, um, we're doing--

347
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,020
- [Bryan] (scary voice)
You have no idea...

348
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,020
what lurks in the frame.

349
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:50,715
- This is the scariest part
of the night, right now.

350
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:53,651
- [Bryan] Karma! (whistles)

351
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:54,922
- [Missy] (laughs) Hi boy.

352
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,811
- [Bryan] Oh hi.

353
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:59,275
- [Missy] Did you turn the
handle and just walk in the door?

354
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:00,979
Is that what you just did?

355
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:03,355
If you don't know, Karma has recently

356
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,110
learned how to turn handles.

357
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,718
As long as they're the long handles,

358
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:08,278
turn it and push the door open.

359
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:10,118
He's done it in the bathroom.

360
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:11,654
He's done it from the backdoor,

361
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,127
which is really heavy, and
he pushes on it so hard.

362
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:15,166
It's actually really naughty,

363
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,759
but it's actually kind of adorable.

364
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,182
- And Luna's done it from the front door.

365
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:20,239
- Yeah, she's done it
from the front door...

366
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,335
Karma taught her. And Karma
knows how to close doors too.

367
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:24,326
He'll close the door to the bathroom if he

368
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,654
gets annoyed, or if we get mad at him,

369
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:28,614
he'll just be like, "Fine!",
and run to the bathroom

370
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,470
and slam the door shut. It's hilarious.

371
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,998
But anyways, it is so late you guys.

372
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:34,150
Ollie had a really hard
time falling asleep.

373
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,733
He came out here...

374
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:39,482
(whispers) and fell asleep like this.

375
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:40,490
(laughs)

376
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,241
Alright, oh my goodness.
(laughs) Good night.

377
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,574
I don't know, I guess
he had such a busy day,

378
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:47,481
but maybe he was just over-tired.

379
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,329
He just came out here, and couldn't sleep,

380
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,081
so he laid on the couch and
that's how he passed out.

381
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:52,914
(laughs)

382
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,545
He put himself under there even.

383
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,234
Anyways, it's time for him to go to bed.

384
00:12:56,234 --> 00:13:00,432
We are setting up for Finn's
birthday party right now.

385
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,805
So I'm very, very excited about that.

386
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,229
- So excited for Finn's birthday!

387
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,189
- Yay, it's going to be so fun.

388
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,310
- Don't miss tomorrow's vlog.

389
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,029
- Yes, it's gonna be awesome.

390
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,870
So, I've been setting up
a little bit for that.

391
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,703
- [Bryan] Ollie say night-night.

392
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:13,885
- [Missy] Ollie say night-night. (laughs)

393
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:15,381
But anyways, make sure you give this video

394
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:16,253
a big thumbs up!

395
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,309
We had such a fun day,

396
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:19,333
the boys really enjoyed their very first

397
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,052
haunted maze.

398
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:22,773
But we will see you guys tomorrow.

399
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:24,729
Karma, can you say bye, boop?

400
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,507
Ready? Bye...

401
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:27,340
boop!

402
00:13:27,340 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
