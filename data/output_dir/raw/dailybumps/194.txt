1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,145
- All right, the boys are helping

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:05,646
Missy put together an Exersaucer.

3
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:07,452
Ollie, are you gonna play in this?

4
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:08,285
- Nope.

5
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:10,127
- I mean, you're almost too big, huh?

6
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:12,037
Babe, why are you
building this Exersaucer?

7
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:12,995
We don't have any babies.

8
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:17,357
("This is Home" by Bryan Lanning)

9
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:21,524
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be

10
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:25,976
♫ All it took was a ring
in that soft sunset,

11
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:30,143
♫ Big blue eyes welled up
and said, "This is home."

12
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:36,636
♫ Just running around,
you never looked so cute

13
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:41,294
♫ Hugging you tight, cuddling,
all I could say to you,

14
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:44,435
♫ "I am home."

15
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:48,602
♫ Home's wherever you're with me.

16
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:54,022
(bright guitar music)

17
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,347
- Good morning!

18
00:00:57,347 --> 00:01:00,013
- Good morning! What's up, dude?

19
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,928
- Good.
- Did you have fun yesterday?

20
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:02,761
- Yeah.

21
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,940
- Yes. If you guys
missed yesterday's blog,

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,911
go watch it, it's in the sidebar,

23
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,600
We had so much fun hanging
out with some friends, huh?

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,415
And you have been such a good boy,

25
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:12,123
you've been working on your cotton balls.

26
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:14,738
Yes, Missy set up this
little cotton ball station

27
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:17,128
where when he's good, he gets rewarded,

28
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:19,210
and he fills up his jar with cotton balls,

29
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,618
and look what happened last night, Ollie!

30
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:22,827
- I filled it up!

31
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:26,060
- It's full! So what does that mean, mama?

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,660
- I get a toy!

33
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,139
- Yeah! He gets to pick out a toy.

34
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:31,929
- He has been doing really well.

35
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:32,762
- He has been so good.

36
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:34,261
- He's been going to bed like a big boy,

37
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,016
he's been sleeping in his bed all night.

38
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:38,449
- And I can say that since
we've, like, started this,

39
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:40,068
he hasn't needed a time-out,

40
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,119
he hasn't needed even a warning.

41
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,054
It's been really awesome
and I'm so proud of you.

42
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:46,499
- It's been really cool.

43
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:47,920
And you did it, you finally filled it up.

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,850
So we're gonna go have a fun day, okay?

45
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,569
Finn woke up very hangry, didn't you?

46
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,232
(laughs) say hi!

47
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:55,351
- Hey.

48
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,317
- We're going to breakfast,
he's currently eating

49
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:01,157
muffins and a Pop-Tart to
curb his hangriness, huh?

50
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:02,399
But I think we're all ready, right?

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,899
(Happy music)

52
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,409
- We are here picking out a toy!

53
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,710
- [Bryan] What are you gonna get, dude?

54
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,127
- A dragon sword!

55
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,226
- [Bryan] Let's go find it!

56
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:32,300
Ollie's so excited to get his toy

57
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,153
for being such a good boy.

58
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,056
- He's had something on
his mind for a while now

59
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,111
that he's been wanting.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:39,788
We are looking for a wizard wand

61
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:42,455
that has, like, a wizard in a tower

62
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,471
and the wand kinda looks like a sword,

63
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:46,256
it looks interesting, huh? We'll find it.

64
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,723
Hey Finn, what did you find?

65
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:48,685
- Batman!

66
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:49,746
- Batman?

67
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:50,821
- Can you sing the song?

68
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:54,893
- Sing, "Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, Batman!"

69
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,323
- He loves Batman.

70
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:58,853
I honestly don't know how
Finn got obsessed with Batman

71
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:00,216
all of a sudden, but...
- I don't know either!

72
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:03,049
He loves Batman.
- He loves Batman.

73
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,143
- [Bryan] Ollie! What did we
find? We found the wizard wand!

74
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:12,289
- [Missy] See it?

75
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:14,078
- I was looking for this!

76
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:15,364
- [Bryan] Isn't that so cool?

77
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:17,604
And then they also have the tower

78
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:20,493
and you, like, control the
little wizard inside the tower.

79
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,993
(happy music)

80
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:27,047
- We found the wizard wand!

81
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:30,210
- All right, we are back
home from a very busy morning

82
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,517
of breakfast, farmers'
market, and toy shopping.

83
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:35,827
So, I put on my comfy
shorts, (laughs) obviously.

84
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:37,990
But I thought I would do a
little farmers' market haul

85
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,823
for you guys, to show you guys

86
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,195
what we got from the farmers' market.

87
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:41,384
We love going to the farmers' market,

88
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,525
it's every Saturday where we live,

89
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:45,392
we usually make it, like,
every other Saturday.

90
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,756
So, this morning, I got some flowers,

91
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:49,390
I believe this is eucalyptus,

92
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,376
I got some of these flowers, which,

93
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,152
these are the coolest flowers ever,

94
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:55,546
because they last a really long time.

95
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:58,006
And this is what they look like.

96
00:03:58,006 --> 00:03:58,839
Isn't that cool?

97
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,370
And then I got some hydrangeas.

98
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,887
We also got some fresh green beans,

99
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:05,961
which are giant, so I was like,
"Ooh, I gotta have these."

100
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:07,809
We got some little fruits and stuff,

101
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:09,923
this is mostly whilst walking around

102
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:12,212
the farmers' market, the kids
snacked on some strawberries.

103
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:15,306
- I also got this cute
little homemade dress

104
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,327
for June, it's six to 12 months,

105
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:19,139
and it actually has little fish on it,

106
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,781
maybe flowers, but
- I think it's like,

107
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:22,017
little beta fish.
- But they're so,

108
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:23,689
It's so cute.
- Yeah, it is cute.

109
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:27,759
I'm obsessed. And then we got,
a couple little succulents

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,911
for, just like, a small, what is it?

111
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:30,744
Like a...
- Planter we just bought.

112
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:31,577
- The planter that he bought.

113
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:34,042
- This one, I think is gonna
be like, the pearl one,

114
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,528
which I'll show you, I got
a big pearl plant there.

115
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:36,361
- That's pretty cool.

116
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:38,952
This is so cool. So, this
is just like, a cactus,

117
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,575
and then
- It's a starfish.

118
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,129
- It's a star flower.
- Yeah, so, this is the bloom

119
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,239
from the cactus that only happens,

120
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,875
- Isn't that crazy?
- It's very rare,

121
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,745
It's like once a year.
- And the way it, like,

122
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:53,047
folds and like, forms to what
it is on, it's so pretty.

123
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,815
- [Bryan] Beautiful. I'm
gonna put it in a cool pot.

124
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:57,432
- Love it. And then this is
something we got for Kelsey.

125
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:58,771
If you guys didn't know,
it was Kelsey's birthday

126
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,083
the other day, and they're
gonna be here today,

127
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,534
so we're kind of celebrating it today,

128
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,997
but I really thought this was so cute

129
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:06,453
and it would go really good
with their new little house.

130
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,738
- Yeah, so this is like a
repurposed piece of wood

131
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,140
and then this is like,
an old tequila bottle.

132
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,038
- Is it tequila? Oh my
gosh, I didn't know that.

133
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,353
- Yeah! (laughs) She said
that a bunch of times.

134
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:20,080
It's an old tequila bottle,
she cut the top off of it,

135
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,662
planted these in it, and then
there's a moss plug down here

136
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:24,482
so that when they water
it, it'll drip out,

137
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:26,611
but it'll keep all the dirt in.

138
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:28,252
- So cool.
- Yeah.

139
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:30,638
- We thought they'd like
that for their new house.

140
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:32,574
And then what do we got
going on over here, babe?

141
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:37,038
- I am making Kelsey a homemade
chocolate ganache cake.

142
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,965
She loves chocolate cake, but
she likes really rich ganache.

143
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,842
- So Missy is doing all that
from scratch. No biggie.

144
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,223
Just baking a cake from scratch.

145
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,625
- I'm excited.

146
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,667
- And this is the final thing I got

147
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,565
from the farmers' market.

148
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:50,944
Check this out, you guys.

149
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:54,508
This is something pearls, let
me know in the comments below,

150
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:56,186
it's something pearls.
I'm sure I'll Google it

151
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:57,243
and know in like 10 minutes,

152
00:05:57,243 --> 00:06:01,547
but this is, like, nine months
to a year growth, he said,

153
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:04,176
which is so cool, and
it was only 10 bucks!

154
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:05,718
So, I gotta find a cool place for this

155
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:07,098
and put it in, like, a cute little pot.

156
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:09,173
But I was excited to play
with all our new toys

157
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:12,593
when we got home, but someone decided

158
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:15,133
he had to take a nap, so he's sleeping.

159
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:18,366
All right, what do you guys
think? I put the pearls up there

160
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,381
on my little floating cabinet.

161
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,634
I think it looks good, and I never really

162
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:23,528
open this, so I don't think
it's gonna be a problem,

163
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,974
with all these things hanging down, but,

164
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:27,312
they look so cool! I love them.

165
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:30,117
- Dad, we gotta open the wizard wand!

166
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:32,030
- Yeah, dude! Let's do it!

167
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,082
- I just, hear something, but I don't know

168
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:37,749
I think it was this or the cave.

169
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:41,935
- It made some noise?
- Yeah.

170
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,037
- Ooh. We should see what's inside, huh?

171
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,688
Did you have a good nap?

172
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,629
- Yeah. We need to open this now.

173
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,091
- So we are opening up the wizard wand!

174
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:54,674
Whoa, look at that,
dude. That's cool, huh?

175
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,971
That was odd. So, funny
thing that I just saw,

176
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,585
it comes with a USB charger, Ollie.

177
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:06,987
We may have to charge it.

178
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:09,693
That is cool looking! Look
at that, dude. Feel it.

179
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:10,526
Is that a cool wand?

180
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:11,359
- Yeah.

181
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,194
- Okay, let's see if we have to charge it

182
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,280
or put batteries in it or something.

183
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,323
So this is our little spell book

184
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:19,861
of all the different
combinations you can do

185
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:21,444
to cast certain spells.

186
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:25,577
"Inside every wand lives a dragon so bold

187
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:29,396
with lessons to learn as
their stories unfold."

188
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:32,890
So, a dragon lives inside
of this wand, Ollie.

189
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,723
Yeah.

190
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,083
- That's so cool.

191
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,366
- We may have to charge it.

192
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:40,199
(Whimsical music)

193
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:47,256
- This is the tower.

194
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:49,881
- That's right. This is the tower,

195
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,425
and there's a wizard who
lives inside of it, right?

196
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:56,312
- And this comes off, and,
here, let me show you.

197
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:58,094
- Yeah, it comes off like that.

198
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,843
- Because he escapes.

199
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:02,240
- Yeah, so this guy's in this cage,

200
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,420
and you can just pull him out
and then he escapes. (laughs)

201
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,641
- Hey Ollie, let's show them
the wizard inside the castle.

202
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:11,058
Push this button.

203
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:16,177
- [Toy] 'I ain't afraid of no dragons!'

204
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:24,801
- [Bryan] It's like a little
TV show in the castle, huh?

205
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:26,644
- It is a TV show.

206
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:28,569
- So that's the wizard
that lives in there,

207
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,332
and you have a wand that has a dragon

208
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:34,174
that lives inside of it, and
you got to shoot him, huh?

209
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:36,452
- (Spooky music)

210
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:39,144
- [Toy] Uh oh! I think he just
switched on my mischief mode!

211
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,246
Don't say I didn't warn you!

212
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,607
- Ollie! I just pulled
your wand off the charger

213
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,146
and the dragon's in
there! Look, he's moving!

214
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:47,146
Look at him!

215
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:50,114
That's so cool!

216
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,709
- Yeah! He's moving!

217
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,876
- All right, you wanna turn it
on and see the dragon inside?

218
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:01,698
- [Toy] Good day, young wizard!
Let's cook up the magic!

219
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:05,381
- Whoa, that's so cool! That
dragon was talking to you, huh?

220
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:07,440
- [Toy] Just a ticket to adventure!

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,607
Are you with me, young wizard?
Flick your wand once for yes!

222
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:20,191
- Look, there's dinosaurs!
Hurry, wave your wand! Now run!

223
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:23,953
- [Toy] That worked all
in time! Just in time.

224
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:27,370
- That is so cool, huh? Shoot the wizard!

225
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:34,515
- (laughs) You disintegrated him!

226
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:36,454
This is seriously so
cool, this wand, like,

227
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:39,882
has a little screen, and then it, like,

228
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:43,108
has a screen up there too, and
you can see what's going on.

229
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:47,026
That is so cool. (laughs)

230
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:48,451
You like your new toy, Ollie?

231
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,437
- Yes!

232
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:51,220
- Okay, come give me a hug.
I'm really proud of you,

233
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,437
you are a really good boy, okay?

234
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:55,400
I want you to keep it up, okay?

235
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,041
- I just want to, fight with those guys.

236
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,033
- Yeah, you totally can. Wave your wand!

237
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,426
(lightning bolt)

238
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:06,812
Whoa, dude! You're a good wizard.

239
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:09,729
(orchestral music)

240
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,107
All right, the boys are helping

241
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:18,478
Missy put together a Exersaucer.

242
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:20,260
Ollie, are you gonna play in this?

243
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,235
- Nope.

244
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,328
- No, you're too big!

245
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:24,709
Finn, I mean...you're almost too big, huh?

246
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,485
Babe, why are you
building this Exersaucer?

247
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:27,890
We don't have any babies.

248
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,987
- Uh, for June!

249
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:32,737
- [Bryan] Oh hey! And
Paris, what's up buddy?

250
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,394
- [Corbin] We made it.

251
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:38,279
- [Kelsey] Look at that!

252
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,030
- You guys, they're Californians now.

253
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,863
- [Corbin] I know!

254
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:43,833
- [Bryan] You guys live in California.

255
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,792
- Well, it depends on
tomorrow. We'll get our house.

256
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,767
- [Bryan] So Missy's been
putting this together all day

257
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,549
for June and I'm like,
why are you doing that?

258
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,718
That's so, like, a
newborn dad thing to do.

259
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,183
(group laughs)

260
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:55,373
I've had to put together,
like 10 of these things, okay?

261
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:56,583
I did my dues.

262
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,277
- I was giving her pointers because I just

263
00:10:58,277 --> 00:10:59,153
put one together a couple weeks ago.

264
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:00,156
- [Bryan] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

265
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:04,156
Hi, June! She is getting
excited, it seems like.

266
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,597
She's staring at it.
- She is so excited.

267
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:08,581
- You wanna jump?

268
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,664
And I don't know if you guys have ever

269
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:12,770
seen Paris on our channel!
He's their little puppy dog.

270
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,318
Hi Paris! He's so cool. He's so friendly

271
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:18,985
and fluffy and clean. I like it.

272
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:24,143
All right, we have the
ship, we just need a pilot!

273
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:28,655
Whoo! Finn's like, "Uh, this was mine."

274
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:33,134
This is for June, Finn. (group laughs)

275
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:35,134
- [Corbin] Look at that!

276
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,990
- [Kelsey] There's so many things to try!

277
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,407
- Lego time! He's so excited.

278
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:45,082
- Yes, Lego ninja.

279
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:52,116
- He's actually called The Fire
Mech. Can you say Fire Mech?

280
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:53,034
- Fire Mech.

281
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:56,486
- Yeah! Good job, dude. So,
Ollie is eating his dinner,

282
00:11:56,486 --> 00:12:00,392
and I found this bad
boy at Toys'R'Us today,

283
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:01,898
and I was like, "You know,
I'm gonna get me a toy,

284
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:03,766
I want to put together a Lego set,

285
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,222
because I've been wanting to for a while,

286
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:07,382
so I grabbed this. I'm so
excited to see this movie."

287
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:08,974
- This one is a bad guy!

288
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,017
- He's a bad guy?

289
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:10,850
- Yeah!

290
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,683
- How do you know that?

291
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:12,516
- Because!

292
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:13,349
- He just knows everything.

293
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:15,894
- He's a bad guy, he's a bad guy.

294
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:18,028
- Well, Mama is usually the pro at this.

295
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,166
You're probably not gonna see
the end result tonight, okay?

296
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,069
- I don't know how to do
this, but you can do this!

297
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,216
- Well, I can?

298
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:25,049
- Yeah.

299
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:27,523
- Well, thank you for
giving me permission.

300
00:12:27,523 --> 00:12:28,602
You're so silly.

301
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:29,435
(Ollie blows raspberry)

302
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:30,268
(Bryan blows raspberry back)

303
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:31,389
- I'm not. I'm not silly.

304
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,222
- Yeah, you are!

305
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,055
- No, I'm not.

306
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:33,888
- Yeah, you are!

307
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:34,721
- No, I'm not.

308
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,554
- Yeah, you are!

309
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,387
- No, I'm not.

310
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,369
- I know you are, but what am I?

311
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:39,519
- Silly!

312
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,686
(inspirational music)

313
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:49,387
- All right, it's this guy's bedtime, huh?

314
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:50,705
It is a little bit early for him,

315
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:52,978
but he has been, like,
not in the best mood

316
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:54,388
kind of all day, so I was like,

317
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:55,627
maybe he should go to bed.

318
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:56,736
But anyways, we are so excited

319
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,225
that Kelsey and Corbin are here.

320
00:12:58,225 --> 00:12:59,676
We haven't really talked a ton about it,

321
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:01,910
but I cannot even tell you guys

322
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,243
how much of a dream come
true this is for us.

323
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,354
We've always been friends,
like, since high school,

324
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,218
and we have so much history together

325
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:11,755
and it's really, really cool.

326
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:12,981
I used to tell people, "Yeah, our friends

327
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:14,710
live in Oregon," and they'd be like,

328
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,010
"Oh, well, are they ever gonna move here?"

329
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,185
I'd be like, "No. Nope, they never are."

330
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:21,403
But, you know, things change, and

331
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,481
you have a baby, and you're like, "Wait!"

332
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:26,222
You know, they have family out here,

333
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,416
that live in the same general area,

334
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,299
and we're out here, and it's just like,

335
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,513
it's so awesome that now we
get to raise our kids together.

336
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,097
Although, I have always said this:

337
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,218
you never know how long Kelsey
and Corbin are gonna stay.

338
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:39,921
They are wanderers to the core,

339
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,477
hence their name, "Steps to Wander."

340
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:45,967
I expect them to, I
mean, I hope they don't,

341
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,689
but I'm sure, one day, they might

342
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:49,705
want to try out another
part of the country,

343
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,747
or something, I'm sure they'll
still do lots of traveling,

344
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:55,625
but, I'm just so excited,
like, this is so fun,

345
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,867
I'm gonna have my best friend here,

346
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,632
and we're gonna get to do things together,

347
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:03,033
and have our kids together,
and it's just gonna be so cool.

348
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,784
The boys are gonna grow up with June,

349
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:06,830
and she's gonna be like
a little sister to them.

350
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,465
They're just gonna, like,
probably annoy her (laughs)

351
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:13,515
and probably protect her, so,
just really, really exciting,

352
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:15,501
and it's just like day one of

353
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:16,866
a really exciting new adventure.

00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:19,084

eat that a little bit later, but for now

362
