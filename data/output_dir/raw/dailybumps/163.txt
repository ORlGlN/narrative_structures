1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,376
- Oli is sleepin' on the couch.

2
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,411
It's so cute.

3
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:04,696
(whispers) Sleepin' on the couch.

4
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:06,160
Finn brought 'em a car.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,346
(happy instrumental music)

6
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:12,589
♫ Wherever you are

7
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:16,196
♫ That's where I wanna be

8
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:18,847
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

9
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:23,634
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

10
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:26,638
♫ This is home

11
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:29,523
♫ Just running around
you've never looked so cute

12
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:34,053
♫ Hugging you tight,
cuddlin' all I could saying

13
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:36,888
♫ I am home

14
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:40,971
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

15
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:45,425
- Good morning guys.

16
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:48,415
I just wanted to say a very
huge thank you to everyone

17
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,090
who has bought our brand new song, Tribe.

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,542
If you do not have it, link
down below in the description,

19
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:54,871
to go pick it up.

20
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,035
We've been having such a
blast dancing and singing

21
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,153
along to it.

22
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:00,689
We wanna see videos of
your guys' family dancing

23
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:01,974
and singing along to it too.

24
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:03,510
So, if you have any
videos, be sure to send 'em

25
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,997
to us on Twitter or Instagram.

26
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,486
I'm gonna try and do
something really cool with it.

27
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:09,817
I'm actually gonna be
in Hollywood all day.

28
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:13,836
My producer got tickets to
a private Harry Styles show,

29
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:16,027
and unfortunately, they do
not allow you to take pictures

30
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:17,022
or any videos.

31
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:18,442
I'm a little bummed that
I'm not gonna be able

32
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:20,393
to document it, but it's gonna
be a really fun experience,

33
00:01:20,393 --> 00:01:22,008
and it's the first thing that I've done

34
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:23,954
with the Grammy Association,
so it'll be interesting

35
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:25,530
to sort of see what that all entails.

36
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,896
So I'm getting ready now, and
Missy has a very busy day,

37
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:29,340
with the boys, ahead of her.

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,839
- Alright guys, I can finally show you

39
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,042
one of my new obsessions.

40
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,881
I've been playing a ton on my iPad.

41
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,835
Of course Karma's obsessed with it too.

42
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:36,752
(giggles)

43
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:39,847
It is the Family Zoo app
which is a fun and exciting

44
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:42,657
match three game that you
can get on both your Android

45
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:44,403
and your iPhone.

46
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,844
So, big thank you to Family
Zoo for partnering with us

47
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:48,217
for this video.

48
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,366
So this is the first game
of it's kind, where you can

49
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:53,459
actually interact with exotic zoo pets.

50
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:55,766
Oh look at my tiger
playing with it's ball.

51
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,175
That's so cute!

52
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:58,254
It's so fun.

53
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:01,485
You actually get to collect
all different kinds of animals,

54
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,955
you get to decorate the zoo,
and they also have, like,

55
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:07,519
little mini-games that you can
play, which is so much fun.

56
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,252
So right now, I'm going
to actually be adding

57
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:11,949
a brand new lion to my zoo.

58
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:14,648
And by doing that, I'll
attract visitors, and in turn,

59
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:18,056
I will earn lots of tickets and coins.

60
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,507
That way, I can buy lots
of really cool stuff

61
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:25,106
to make my zoo look really
neat and really fun.

62
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:27,862
And I can even take a
photo of my zoo and share

63
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:30,513
my progress with all my Facebook friends.

64
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:32,920
So, if you guys wanna
download the Family Zoo game,

65
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,948
make sure you click the
link down in the description

66
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:37,408
and get a bonus of 300 coins.

67
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,512
Good morning boys.
- Yay!

68
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:40,549
- Where are we goin'?

69
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,876
- To CJ and Bailey's house!
- Yeah!

70
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:47,058
Today has been kind of a crazy morning.

71
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:50,294
We've already been out of the
house and I forgot the camera.

72
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,696
But actually, because I'm a
little behind schedule now,

73
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:56,201
I am actually going to take
the boys with me and Kelsey

74
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:58,690
to the gym, and then I'm gonna take Oli

75
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,876
to CJ and Bailey's, which
he's very, very excited about.

76
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:02,873
Good morning guys.

77
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:03,823
We have a fun day planned.

78
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:05,323
You're excited.

79
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,472
Finn's excited to hang out with Mama.

80
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:08,547
Let's do this.

81
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:09,958
Alright boys, go play.

82
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,245
See you in a little bit, okay?

83
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:12,784
Alright (laughs).

84
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:14,768
Me and Kelsey had a really good workout,

85
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:16,259
and now the boys are so excited

86
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,435
because they're at CJ and Bailey's.

87
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:21,011
Finn was literally hysterical in the car

88
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,251
because he just wanted out
so that he could see them.

89
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:26,652
And I parked and I had
to move parking spots,

90
00:03:26,652 --> 00:03:28,186
and he about had a cow.

91
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:30,870
So, he's so excited that he's here.

92
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,557
Alright, I've officially
dropped off the boys

93
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,379
and they are so excited.

94
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:38,154
They are planning on going to
lunch and going to the park

95
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,689
and doing all kinds of fun stuff.

96
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,720
And they have four kids with them now.

97
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,579
It's CJ and Bailey and Oli and Finn.

98
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,058
So I let them borrow my car
so they can do all those

99
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,755
errands and stuff.

100
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:49,996
And me and Kelsey are now hangin' out.

101
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,978
But I am so bummed right now, you guys.

102
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,966
I'm vlogging on my
phone, if you can't tell.

103
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,466
And this is our camera, which,

104
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:02,387
I mean, admit it guys, these
things can be really expensive.

105
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:06,452
And (laughs) as you can
tell, if you can't tell,

106
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:08,445
I, basically, I broke it.

107
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:10,678
It is completely broken.

108
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:12,669
It will not turn on, it will not turn--

109
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,536
And I drop these a lot, and it's so bad.

110
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:16,937
I'm just really clumsy
and I tend to be the one

111
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,906
that always drops them.

112
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:21,558
But I've never dropped it
and it broke like this.

113
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:23,261
But when I dropped it, I knew.

114
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:25,624
I was like, "That dropped hard."

115
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:28,913
Like it hit hard (giggles).
- You could hear it

116
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:29,826
from the other side.

117
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:32,060
- Yeah, I was like, "Oh shoot, that's no."

118
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,718
- You had to do it that way.
(giggles)

119
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:37,953
- And I'm tryin' to turn
it on and it's just like,

120
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:38,870
doing that.

121
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:41,516
I'm so bummed.

122
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:42,512
Bryan's gonna be so bummed.

123
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:44,543
I can't even turn it off.

124
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:46,535
Like, that's all it does.

125
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:48,117
I can't even get it to close.

126
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:49,914
So, it's a super bummer.

127
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:54,549
You guys, I'm home and I
am back on a normal camera.

128
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:55,998
I was able to find this one.

129
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,827
It's one of our older ones.

130
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:00,112
We've kind of retired it,
but it's basically all I have

131
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:00,945
at this point.

132
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:04,548
It is really hard to vlog on a cell phone.

133
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:05,499
Like super duper hard.

134
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:08,403
So for those of you vloggers
who do vlog on a cell phone,

135
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:09,603
whew!

136
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,430
One day, life's gonna
get really sweet when you

137
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,807
can use a camera.

138
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,627
It's just so much easier to
like flip around and it's wider,

139
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:17,787
so you can hold it out and I don't know.

140
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:19,115
Just looks a lot nicer.

141
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:20,134
Anyways, we are home now.

142
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:21,659
Oli is sleepin' on the couch.

143
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:22,602
It's so cute.

144
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:25,007
(whispers) Sleepin' on the couch.

145
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,168
Finn brought 'em a car.

146
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,583
Shh!

147
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,617
Can you say shh?

148
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:30,906
- Shh.
(laughs)

149
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:33,634
- I put the shades down and
I'm like, "Ha, I'm exhausted."

150
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,527
It has been a very busy day, honestly.

151
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,681
My day is basically over now, I would say.

152
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,675
It's not over, but it just feels like huh,

153
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,508
it's been a long day.

154
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,747
But it's not over yet, actually.

155
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:46,026
Kelsey and Corbin are
headed over soon to hang out

156
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:47,311
and go swimming.

157
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:49,063
Bryan is out tonight.

158
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:52,209
He's going to LA to have a
ton of fun, I'm super jealous,

159
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:54,334
and happy for him that
he gets to go out and do

160
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:55,167
some fun stuff.

161
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:58,012
Finn brought him a little
blankie and a bear,

162
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:00,345
and a car right by his face.

163
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,656
Me and the boys have been
just hanging out, relaxin'.

164
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:07,507
Pretty exhausted from all the
running around we did today.

165
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:09,416
And now, Kelsey and Corbin are over.

166
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,904
We're goin' swimmin'!

167
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,528
The boys are so excited.

168
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:14,517
June's excited.

169
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:16,889
How's the water Oli?

170
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:17,755
- It's warm.

171
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,171
- [Missy] Okay, jump in!

172
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,193
- Now it's cold.

173
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,104
- [Missy] What?

174
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:23,721
(laughing)

175
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:24,799
Are you scared?

176
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,632
- Yeah.

177
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:29,022
- [Missy] So it turns out
it's kind of a cold day.

178
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,556
So Oli's gettin' in the hot tub.

179
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,427
How's that feel?

180
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:32,923
Is it good?

181
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:35,750
And it's low, you can stand up, huh?

182
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,622
I might need to fill that up.

183
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:39,319
Finley Jay, what are you doin'?

184
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,319
You want a boat for you?

185
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:43,096
- Yeah.

186
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:44,596
- Just like Junie?

187
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,189
Alright, let's go see.

188
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,180
So June is in the hot
tub in her little boat,

189
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,546
and Finn literally jumped
out, ran to the little box,

190
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,701
grabbed this, and I'm pretty
sure he wants to sit in it

191
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:58,609
next to June.

192
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:00,430
It's pretty cute.

193
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,926
He's like, "I'm comin' in."

194
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:04,000
Alright, we are back
in, and now we are going

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,164
to start making dinner.

196
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,887
Me and Kelsey have big plans tonight.

197
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:09,852
Bryan's not here, so it's all
up to us to figure it out.

198
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,097
- I don't know if we can do this.

199
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,097
- [Missy] I know (laughs).

200
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,592
- We do not cook in the kitchen that much.

201
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:14,621
(Missy laughing)

202
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:16,436
- So we're gonna go ahead
and make a delicious

203
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,677
homemade meal.

204
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:18,926
Let's do it.

205
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:22,509
(happy instrumental music)

206
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,713
- [Kelsey] How's it going?

207
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:31,999
- Uh good.

208
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,689
It's a little burnt, you know.

209
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,788
- [Kelsey] Oh that looks beautiful.

210
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,627
- Right?

211
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:37,628
(laughing)

212
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:41,211
(happy instrumental music)

213
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:54,651
Alright, dinner is ready and
we like, did this all together.

214
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:55,771
I think it's good.

215
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:56,604
Okay?

216
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,052
We've got green beans.

217
00:07:58,052 --> 00:07:59,210
(laughing)

218
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,121
- [Kelsey] Oops, a little brown.

219
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:02,076
- [Missy] A little over cooked pasta,

220
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:03,191
(laughing)

221
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,355
and chicken.

222
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:05,643
Hopefully it's seasoned correctly.

223
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,053
Bryan always thinks I season
it like really boring.

224
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:10,489
So, we'll see.
- It's gonna be great.

225
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,897
- We're excited, we're ready to eat.

226
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:12,730
We're starving.

227
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,806
But we made dinner.

228
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:14,807
Yay!

229
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,668
Alright, dinner's done.

230
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,613
It looks good.

231
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:19,446
How is it?

232
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,320
- It's so good.

233
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,771
- Yay!
- Woo!

234
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,057
- [Missy] The seasoning's good?

235
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:25,890
- Oh yeah.

236
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,127
- [Missy] Okay, test out the green beans.

237
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:28,363
- Green beans?
- I tasted them.

238
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:30,137
They're like meh.

239
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:32,431
(laughing)

240
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:33,327
- They're okay.

241
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,861
(laughing)

242
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,900
Now I'll taste the pasta.

243
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,016
Pasta's good.
- Yay!

244
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,796
We did good.

245
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:42,081
We're like professionals now.

246
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:42,914
- Oh yeah.

247
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:43,955
- Chefs.

248
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,725
- Alright, the boys are all ready for bed.

249
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:51,212
They ate their dinner,
they brushed their teeth,

250
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:53,088
they're clean.

251
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:54,286
Huh?

252
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,481
And we're ready for bed, huh bud?

253
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:59,759
Actually, my battery's
about to die, so I did want

254
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,874
to let you guys know that
if you wanna see me cook

255
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,695
something else really fun and crazy,

256
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:06,157
make sure you go check
out my sister channel.

257
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:08,656
I'll have it linked up above.

258
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:11,682
We made awesome emoji stuff.

259
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,466
I gotta say, at the beginning,
it was a little rough,

260
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:16,913
but towards the end, I become
a genius at pancake art.

261
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:18,199
And I'm really proud of myself.

262
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,355
So please go check out
our channel, go subscribe,

263
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:24,276
and go laugh, because it's
pretty fun and hilarious.

264
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:26,310
But for now, I'm gonna go
ahead and put these kiddos

265
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,757
to bed.

266
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:30,567
We are missing Bryan a lot tonight.

267
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:31,689
Are you missing daddy?

268
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:32,849
Yeah.

269
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:34,088
It kinda made him sad just now.

270
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:36,607
But we're gonna see him in the
morning, and we're excited.

271
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:39,219
Anyways, for now, give
this video a big thumbs up.

272
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:40,802
Hey Oli, thumbs up!

273
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:44,045
Oh, Finn, a thumb's up!

274
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:45,288
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

275
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:46,539
Alright Oli, say,

276
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:47,539
- Bye!
- Bye!

277
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,493
- [Missy] Good job.

278
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,150
- Bye poohba.

279
00:09:53,150 --> 00:00:00,000
(happy instrumental music)
