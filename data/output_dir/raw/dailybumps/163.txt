00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:04,500
Hey Finn say good morning.

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,336
Good morning.

00:00:06,336 --> 00:00:07,259
- [Oliver] Good morning.

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,692
- The kids need a ride
on DaDa this morning

6
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:12,090
right, you want to take it on this leg?

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,507
Hashtag Dad life.

8
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:18,208
Just walking around with a
couple of crazy kids on my feet.

19
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,091
that scared me yesterday?

20
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:43,015
- Yeah.

21
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:43,938
- That was pretty funny, huh?

22
00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:45,629
If you guys didn't see Missy scare me with

23
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,742
the snake prank yesterday
you need to watch it.

24

I'll have the video in
the iCard above so you can

25
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,988
check it out, it was quite funny.

26
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:55,930
- Whoa, dude, you got a
swingin' snake there, bro.

27
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,462
What do you have, Finn?

28
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,340
Oh, what are you trying to do? (laughs)

29
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,367
- He has a stamp.

30
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,388
- You have the stamp?

31
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:04,822
Let me see it, I need to confiscate it.

32
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:05,748
Sir.

33
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:06,672
Excuse me, excuse me, sir.

00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:09,150

35
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,124
Excuse me, sir, excuse
me, sir (Bryan laughs)

(Finley yells)

37
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,716
- Let me see this, ooh a stamp.

38
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:15,046
We took these stamps
away from their little

39
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:16,587
gift bags from the
birthday parties yesterday

40
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:20,129
because they get
everywhere, I'm not kidding.

41
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,674
Like one time this little kid got a hold

42
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:25,697
of a stamp and you
stamped everything, huh.

43
00:01:25,697 --> 00:01:27,777
He's like yep and I'm proud of it.

44
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:29,430
- Hi Dad.

45
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,466
- [Bryan] What Finn?

46
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,170
(Finley mutters)

47
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,127
- [Bryan] You want what?

48
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,134
(Finley mutters)

49
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:36,746
- [Bryan] You want to open the fridge?

50
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:38,230
- Yep.

51
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,323
- [Bryan] Okay, what do you want in there?

52
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:40,266
- No.

53
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,668
(Oliver yells)

54
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,649
- [Bryan] Oh, you want the freezer?

55

(Finley yells)

56
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:50,393
- [Bryan] They're
raiding the fridge, babe.

57
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:51,301
- They want ice cream.

58
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,046
- [Bryan] All the time, always.

59
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,294
(parents laugh)

60
00:01:54,294 --> 00:01:55,858
- [Bryan] You guys are raiding the fridge

61
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,577
and you're not even teenagers, yet.

62
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:58,937
- No.

63
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:00,395
- [Bryan] Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

64
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:02,940
Finley Jay, what are you doing?

65
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,916
- I want ice cream.

66
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,500
- [Bryan] You want ice cream?

67
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,423
- Yeah.

68
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:08,185
- How about later after lunch, okay?

69
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:11,295
Let's see how they react
to closing the freezer.

70
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,261
Let's have ice cream after lunch, okay?

71
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,194
- Okay.

72
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,526
- Oh, you're so polite.

73
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:17,795
What a good little boy.

74
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,649
We must have raised this one right.

75
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:21,089
- Yeah, or he knows he's on camera.

76
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:22,409
(laughter)

77
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,992
(upbeat music)

78
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,589
- So we went to the store
yesterday and bought

79
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,480
a ton of Halloween
candy 'cuz I love having

80
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,580
Halloween candy out so
you can grab a piece

81
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,038
and enjoy it and now the kids have learned

82
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:39,631
how to steal all of the candy, right?

83
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:40,556
- Anything?

84
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,488
- You can have some candy corn.

85
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,629
I'm actually surprised that
he even likes candy corn

86
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,613
because not a lot of
people likes candy corn.

87
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,930
I personally love candy
corn, I think it's like

88
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,442
a really simple treat
but yes a lot of people

89
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,222
are anti-candy corn, so let me know in

90
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:57,709
the comments down below,
are you pro-candy corn

91
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,557
or are you against candy corn?

92
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:02,260
I think it's perfect
Fall candy, don't you?

93
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,526
- Mmm hmm.

94
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:04,530
- [Bryan] Yeah, cheers.

95
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,399
(chuckles)

96
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,379
Don't steal it.

97
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,462
You stole it.

98
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:12,862
Face of guilt right there.

99
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:16,332
What did you do, you conned
Mama into some chocolate?

100
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:17,377
- Mmm hmm.

101
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:20,445
- These two kids are a
bunch of baby thieves.

102
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:23,842
That's what you are,
huh, baby candy thieves.

103
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,932
Speaking of candy thief,
you guys, look what I

104
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,163
just found in Ollie's room.

105
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:31,754
- Haha, I'm going to steal all the candy.

106
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:35,241
(slow, mischievous music)

107
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,491
(cackling)

108
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:47,014
- Hm, where's all the candy?

109
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,847
(footfalls clink)

110
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,252
A ha ha.

111
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,091
Hm, what's this?

112
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:14,776
Oh, candy.

113
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,772
(cackles)

114
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:29,254
Oh yeah I got the candy.

115
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:32,714
I never know where they hid it.

116
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,601
(cackles)

117
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:47,042
- [Bryan] Oh, no candy
thief, there's a cop.

118
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,840
He's gonna get you.

119
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,233
(Oliver yells)

120
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,656
Get him, cuff him.

121
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:55,347
Finn, you make a cute police officer.

122
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:57,847
(sirens wail)

123
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,749
I can't believe I'm
catching this on camera.

124
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:04,134
You guys, I'm vlogging a
police pursuit right now.

125
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:06,855
We've got a thief in our
house trying to steal

126
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,163
all our Halloween candy.

127
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:10,811
It's not even Halloween.

128
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,246
- No, you won't get me.

129
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,869
- Get him, Finn, get him.

130
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:17,952
(sirens)

131
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:21,555
Oh man, he is way too fast, huh?

132
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,595
Did you eat too many
donuts today, officer Finn?

133
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:24,520
- Yeah.

134
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,858
- Yeah, officer Finn ate
too many donuts today.

135
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,359
I'll help you get him, okay?

136
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:32,827
- [Bryan] I got you candy thief
with my special agent mom.

137
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:35,839
No more stealing our Halloween candy.

138
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,373
- Oh, yeah?
- You're under arrest.

139
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:38,816
- Oh yeah?

140
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,666
- Let's see who this candy bandit is.

141
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,662
(yells)

142
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:44,100
- [Bryan] Oh no, he escaped the cuffs

143
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,992
before we could reveal his true identity.

144
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,374
Officer Finn, can you help us?

145
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:50,740
- [Missy] Go get him.

146
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,240
(sirens wail)

147
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:03,094
- [Bryan] Special agent
mom has got you now.

148
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:06,036
- All right we need to
reveal, we need to reveal.

149
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:08,472
- [Bryan] Who's the true
identity of this masked villain?

150
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:09,705
(all gasp)

151
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,708
- Ollie?
- Ollie?

152
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,649
You stole all our Halloween candy?

153
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,062
- Yes.

154
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:16,928
- [Bryan] But why, why would you do it?

155
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:18,217
- Because.

156
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:19,138
- [Bryan] Because why?

157
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,240
- Because.

158
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,990
(majestic music)

159
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,996
- [Bryan] Good job, boys.

160
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:35,830
Was that fun dressing up
and you trying to steal

161
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,812
all our candy?

162
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:38,125
We've gotta put all this candy back.

163
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:42,110
This has got to last us all month, okay?

164
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,954
- Wait, I have more candy.

165
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:43,969
- [Bryan] You have more?

166
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,101
- [Missy] You're right, the bandits candy.

167
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,184
- More candy.

168
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:52,301
Wow, Ollie, you stole lots of candy.

169
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:55,065
All right boys, you can
have one piece of candy.

170
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:56,803
Finn, you got a Reese's?

171
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:57,895
Yummy.

172
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,160
Ollie, what candy do you want to choose?

173
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,434
You can have a candy if you'd like.

174
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:01,576
Sour Patch Kids?

175
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,993
I'm going to steal a Kit Kat.

176
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:06,482
(laughs maniacally)

177
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:07,626
They may think they know

178
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:09,446
where our candy stash is but they don't.

179
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,532
There's one that I didn't show him.

180
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,449
(electronic music)

181
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:17,781
- [Bryan] Finn, you make quite a cute

182
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,836
police officer, you know that?

183
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:20,762
- Yep.

184
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,300
- Yeah, he knows that. (laughs)

185
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,068
So we woke up this morning and Pearl,

186
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:30,235
this clownfish here ended up
eating the other clownfish.

187
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:32,205
- I'm really upset about it.

188
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:34,547
- [Bryan] She ate both
our beautiful clownfish

189
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:36,801
and she's obviously very aggressive

190
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,303
so we're going to take her
back to the fish place today.

191
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:39,924
So we're going to scoop her out.

192
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,483
Let's see if we can do this, babe.

193
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:43,221
I believe in you.

194
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:44,823
- She knows.

195
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:46,623
- [Bryan] She knows.

196
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:48,738
- Look at her hide underneath there.

197
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:49,571
Come here.

198
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:53,280
- [Bryan] That's right, come over here.

199
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,816
All right let's put some bait in. (laughs)

200
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:59,769
- [Missy] It's like
we're actually fishing.

201
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,343
- [Bryan] There she goes, there she goes.

202
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:02,487
- Shh.
- Oh.

203
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:05,307
- She's a little stinker, she knows.

204
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:08,705
- [Bryan] She's smart, she knows. (laughs)

205
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:09,787
(child yells)

206
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:12,481
- [Bryan] Come on evil little fish.

207
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:14,259
Oh, hiding back in her hole.

208
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,676
- All right so scooping
her out with the scooper

209
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:19,383
is just not working so
Bryan just so happened

210
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:21,914
to have a fish trap that
he must've purchased

211
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:24,365
off Amazon just in case
something like this

212
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:26,051
happened and so I just
put it all together.

213
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:28,775
It's like a big box and
there's food inside the box

214
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:32,010
and there's this piece
of glass that's the door.

215
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,771
What is it, Ollie?

216
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:34,986
- It's a trap.

217
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:36,760
- It's a trap door and then as soon as

218
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,225
she swims in there we
pull the string I've got

219
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:41,938
here and it pulls that little piece that's

220
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,707
there up and then the door will shut.

221
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:46,858
I'm just trying to stand back as far away

222
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,493
as possible so I can be
with my little string

223
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:53,010
and I'm waiting for her to swim in, huh?

224
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,951
- Yes.

225
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,378
(laughs)

226
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,345
- [Missy] She's over on
the left and I'm waiting

227
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:59,707
for her to swim over to the right.

228
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,297
Looks like she's getting a little braver.

229
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,299
- [Bryan] Quick stop at the fish store.

230
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,432
We went and talked to the
guy who's been helping

231
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:06,548
us get all set up.

232
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:09,351
He said that if that
one is being aggressive

233
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:11,780
that is definitely a
fluke thing and if we want

234
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,712
to get any more of the
nice orange clownfish

235
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:15,108
we're going to have to get her out.

236
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,660
We tried to get her out.

237
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,454
- We definitely want more clownfish, so-

238
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:19,382
- [Bryan] Yeah.

239
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:20,997
- We'll have to get her
out sooner or later.

240
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:22,169
- So we're going to try it,

241
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,852
we have an appointment for
next week for them to come

242
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:25,604
by, too because they're really good at it.

243
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:27,363
So we have a couple days
to try and get her out.

244
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:29,076
He did say that we could go ahead

245
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:30,145
and get started on some other things

246
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:32,774
so we got more crabs
for cleanup since Pearl

247
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:34,169
had her little rampage.

248
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:35,409
We got another cleaner shrimp,

249
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,908
which these are going to clean the tank.

250
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:39,174
We got a couple of corals
to put into the rock

251
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:41,461
to start growing and then we got a big guy

252
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,588
our first tang who actually eats seaweed

253
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:44,920
so that's going to be really cool.

254
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,063
- Sounds really fun.

255
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,572
- Yeah, he's one of the
biggest fish we've bought

256
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:50,195
so far so it'll be nice.

257
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:51,931
We can buy them small
and watch them get big

258
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,749
or we can get them big
and put them in our tank

259
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:55,919
because he says we have a good tank.

260
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,072
- He's still small, he's
going to get way big.

261
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:58,885
- Oh, yeah he said he's still
probably less than a year.

262
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:01,468
(mellow music)

263
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:08,633
- [Bryan] Ollie, what are you doing?

264
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,346
- I found a chicken egg.

265
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:12,498
- [Bryan] He found a chicken
egg out in the chicken coop

266
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:14,603
and he came to his playroom
and now he's putting it

267
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:16,558
in blankets in his
playroom so it stays warm.

268
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:18,211
Why are you doing that?

269
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:21,878
- Because I don't want
it to be cold or hot.

270
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:27,397
- Oh, okay well this isn't going to turn

271
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:29,766
into a chicken, buddy,
this is actually just

272
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,243
an egg that we can eat.

273
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:33,166
Isn't that cool?

274
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,092
- Mmm hmm.

275
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,530
- [Bryan] Yeah, can
you go give it to Mama?

276
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,955
- Here you go, Mama.

277
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:40,638
- [Bryan] Do you need an
egg for tonight's dinner?

278
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:41,816
- Nope.

279
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:43,140
- [Bryan] Nope, good job, buddy.

280
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,075
- Can we move my calendar?

281
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,167
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, you can.

282
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,312
- Yeah, we forgot about that.

283
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,525
- [Bryan] Do you want to grab
the seven out for yesterday?

284
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:53,637
- Yeah.

285
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:54,876
- All right you can grab the seven.

286
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,450
No that's a nine.

287
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,550
There you go that's a seven.

288
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,061
Nice, can you share
that with your brother?

289
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,166
- Yeah.

290
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,756
- [Bryan] He's got some
candy for you, Finn.

291
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:05,741
- I took it out from the calendar.

292
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:07,272
- Finn really wants to get the eight.

293
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:09,865
Okay, so it's October
eighth so you can pull

294
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:12,002
the candy, no, no, no, no, the other one.

295
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:13,502
There you go, yay.

296
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:19,468
- So the boys are playing
outside and getting

297
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:21,513
some last minute wiggles out

298
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,340
because it's almost time for dinner

299
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,582
But I am cooking up a few things.

300
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,901
I've got my chicken pot pie all prepared

301
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,699
for tonight, I'm just
going to pop it in the oven

302
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,532
it's all ready to go, it'll just take like

303
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,070
30-40 minutes to cook.

304
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,385
Then I've got a pumpkin pie here

305
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:36,651
that I am cooking up right now.

306
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:38,136
And I did something a little differently.

307
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:40,570
Instead of just mixing all
the pumpkin pie mixture

308
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,619
all together and just throwing
it into a pie and cooking it.

309
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,984
I read a little tip that
said if you're using

310
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,514
canned pumpkin, to heat
it up on the stove first

311
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,517
with a little bit of spices and it gets

312
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:52,294
the canned flavor out and makes it

313
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,764
taste more like fresh pumpkin.

314
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:58,068
So I just basically heated
it all up and I'm waiting

315
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,525
for it to cool before
I mix in all the milk

316
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,224
and eggs and all of that.

317
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:04,617
So I'm excited to make
pumpkin pie and then

318
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:07,623
I was even thinking I know
this seems a little crazy

319
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,660
because I'm like, I am
not even probably eating

320
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,131
the pumpkin pie or this but I thought

321
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,134
I'd make some cookies, too.

322
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,689
Ollie's been begging
to help me make cookies

323
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:17,754
and so I thought maybe I'll do it

324
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,484
and I was just sitting here cooking.

325
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:22,915
The house is clean, the
kitchen is pretty clean.

326
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:24,897
I'm waiting for that to
cool so maybe I'll just

327
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:27,474
throw together some cookies, too.

328
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:28,745
- Can you crumple that into a ball?

329
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,308
(laughs)

330
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:31,506
All right, sit next to Ollie.

331
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:32,788
Crumple that into a ball.

332
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:33,712
Let me see it Ollie.

333
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,038
Thanks, buddy.
- Wow, good job.

334
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,686
- I will take your crumpled ball

335
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:40,658
and I'm going to put it
right here on the bottom.

336
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:42,979
Thank you, Finn, good job.

337
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,639
I'm showing the boys how to start a fire.

338
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,553
(laughs)

339
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:47,483
- I'm having some Boy Scouts flashbacks.

340
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:50,230
Actually, you know I had to do this

341
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,932
every single morning
when I was in Boy Scouts?

342
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:52,996
- [Missy] Oh yeah, yep.

343
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:54,231
- That was how we kept warm.

344
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,642
- Yeah, I remember that
little fire in the house.

345
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,244
Oh my goodness, look boys.

346
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:00,784
(boys gasp)

347
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:02,117
Isn't that cool?

348
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,249
Look, he's going to lite
your piece of paper on fire.

349
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,194
Remember where it is?

350
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:07,480
- Mmm hmm.

351
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,846
- [Missy] Finn's like, I'm
going to blow that out.

352
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:10,971
- ♫ Happy Birthday to you.

353
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:11,804
- [Bryan] I hope this works

354
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:13,230
I've never made a fire in this one.

355
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,454
- [Missy] Well, you've got your kindle

356
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:17,016
and your big pieces of log.

357
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:18,179
- [Bryan] Should work, right?

358
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:20,181
- [Missy] Yeah, in theory it should work.

359
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:21,668
There it goes.

360
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,562
- I just felt like it
was one of those nights.

361
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:24,486
- [Missy] It's cold.

362
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:25,412
- It's cold.

363
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:26,630
I just want to bundle in a blanket

364
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,854
and stand by the fire
and roast marshmallows.

365
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:30,314
Does that sound like a good idea?

366
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,309
- [Missy] Yeah, I've got
pumpkin pie, cookies and-

367
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:34,696
- Pumpkin pie, cookies and?

368
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:36,844
- I've got pumpkin pie, I've got cookies

369
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:38,851
and I've got chicken pot pie.

370
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,124
- Yum, that's going to be good.

371
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,811
- [Missy] So, all the
Fall things. (chuckles)

372
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:44,806
It actually has been really warm the past

373
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:47,489
couple of days and even
last night was a warm

374
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,158
night because normally we cool down a lot

375
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:50,935
at night, but it was a warm night.

376
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:53,935
(slow guitar music)

377
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:06,007
- [Bryan] Missy put both
of these pies in the oven

378
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:08,288
and then she put the kids to
bed so I just took them out.

379
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,474
We've got a chicken pot
pie and a pumpkin pie

380
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,976
and I am so excited for
dinner and dessert tonight.

381
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:16,751
Also, I smell like smoke because I've been

382
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:19,156
hanging out outside by
the fire with the boys.

383
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:21,693
It's just been a really fun, cool night.

384
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,193
Speaking of, I just walked
out here and Ollie is watching

385
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:28,354
the iPad underneath the
blanket by the fire.

386
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:29,831
Are you having fun in there, dude?

387
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:30,664
Yeah?

388
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:34,035
Hey Ollie, do you want to
end the vlog like that?

389
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,683
- [Oliver] Yeah, thank you
for watching this video.

390
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:39,266
(Bryan laughs)

391
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:43,511
- [Oliver] Bye.

392
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,353
Boop.

393
00:14:46,353 --> 00:00:00,000
(happy instrumental music)
