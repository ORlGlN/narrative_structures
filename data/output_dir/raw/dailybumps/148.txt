1
00:00:00,514 --> 00:00:01,641
- Yes I have been working at home.

2
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:03,681
We just picked up Ollie from school.

3
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:06,926
And oh my God, there is
a mouse on our counter!

4
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:07,811
♫ This is our life

5
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:08,788
♫ This is our fun

6
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:11,003
♫ This is who we are

7
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:12,282
♫ This is our dream

8
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:13,475
♫ This is our team

9
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:15,914
♫ Shine among the stars

10
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,097
♫ Take this shield all we'll all be fine

11
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:20,750
♫ Take this hand and we'll all just shine

12
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,065
♫ This is our life

13
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,462
♫ Let's live it

14
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:27,145
♫ Live it forever

15
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:30,018
- Good morning!
- Good morning Ollie.

16
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:32,610
- Let me see that smile.
- Smile for mama.

17
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,568
He always has to get his picture taken.

18
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,135
Everyday mama takes your
picture before school?

19
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:37,968
Yeah?

20
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,166
(tranquil music)

21
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,688
Good morning!

22
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,779
Today's a big day for school huh?

23
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:05,612
- It's share day!

24
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:06,445
- [Bryan] It is share day,

25
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,004
and what are you sharing today?

26
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:10,076
- A (mumbles) hook.

27
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:12,041
- [Bryan] 'Cause it starts
with an H, hook huh?

28
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:12,939
- Yes.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,245
Look at him carrying his lunch.

30
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:16,785
And we also got cupcakes,

31
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,288
'cause it's birthday party day.

32
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,645
- Birthday day.
- Birthday party day,

33
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,171
share day and picture day.

34
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:23,069
All in one.

35
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:23,970
That's awesome.

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,988
- And Finn does not
understand why he can't

37
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:27,306
have a cupcake.
- You want a cupcake dude?

38
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:28,846
(laughing)

39
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:30,258
You're gonna have a good day at school?

40
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,946
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:34,696
(tranquil music)

42
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:39,004
Now we are headed into music class.

43
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:42,155
You get to do a little school too.

44
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:43,400
Okay?
- Are you excited?

45
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,298
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:45,732
He's like, he's still not totally sure

47
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,748
but I think he's gonna like it.

48
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:49,963
- Alright let's go make some music dude.

49
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:52,713
(cheerful music)

50
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,368
Finn you got an instrument?

51
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,035
It sounds so pretty.

52
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:04,984
Can you play a note Finn?

53
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,370
There you go.

54
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,203
Right?

55
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,039
Isn't that cool?

56
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,603
Say good morning June!

57
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:22,436
- Morning!

58
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:27,621
You having fun in music class Finn?

59
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,867
- You like her earrings?

60
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,314
- They're pretty huh?
- I like your orange

61
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:34,073
dress June, you look so cute.

62
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:36,670
Hey Finney, can you give it to June?

63
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,881
There you go, make sure June has a shaker.

64
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,298
Everyone's got their shakers.

65
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:51,401
(tranquil music)

66
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,346
What sticker did you get Finn?

67
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,732
You got a frog?

68
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:00,870
- Yeah!
- That's so cool.

69
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,460
Did you have fun at music class?

70
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,870
- Yeah.
- Good.

71
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,117
Alright we are now back from music class.

72
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:08,562
And this kid needs some milk huh?

73
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:09,476
- Yeah.
- Is there any milk

74
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:10,309
in your cup?

75
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:11,142
It's all gone.

76
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,384
Here, leave this here.

77
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:13,552
You go get the milk kay?

78
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:14,385
Come on.

79
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:15,558
He loves this you guys.

80
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:18,506
He can usually get the
door open by himself,

81
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:19,353
but he kind of struggles.

82
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:20,370
Grab the milk.

83
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,453
There you go.

84
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:25,211
It's a big one, be careful.

85
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,044
Good job!

86
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,603
Look at those strong muscles workin'.

87
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:32,377
(laughing)

88
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,286
I got it buddy.

89
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:36,743
This little dude is so serious
about his milk you guys.

90
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:37,715
He's gotta have his milk.

91
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:40,773
And he actually prefers white
milk over chocolate milk.

92
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,918
Unlike Ollie, which is really interesting.

93
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,823
It's crazy how different they are.

94
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,163
Hey did you have fun at music class?

95
00:03:46,163 --> 00:03:47,075
- Yeah.
- That was so cool

96
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,383
playing with all the instruments huh?

97
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:49,550
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

98
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:51,641
So that's like a once a week class

99
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,902
that we're taking Finn to now.

100
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:55,170
And he really loves all the instruments

101
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,278
and he's warming up a lot to all the kids

102
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,438
and the teacher and stuff.

103
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,938
(baby mumble)

104
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,444
Halloween?

105
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,277
Kay.

106
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,110
- Hawwaawee.

107
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,290
- Hey what do you wanna be fore Halloween?

108
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,656
- Baby.

109
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:08,855
- You want to be a baby?

110
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:10,251
(baby mumble)

111
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,084
Okay.

112
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,350
A Halloween baby, that's
what he's gonna be.

113
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,529
- We're home!

114
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:14,997
We have had a busy morning.

115
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:16,192
We had music class

116
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:17,588
and then I actually went to the gym,

117
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:19,195
came home and got changed.

118
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:22,112
I'm actually feeling a little
scraggly right now, still.

119
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:25,049
And Finn is changed into
some different clothes.

120
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:27,348
And actually I just got a call from,

121
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:30,611
actually I got a text
message from Ollie's teacher.

122
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,341
And he said he,

123
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,316
or she said that he had a little accident.

124
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,293
And I feel so bad.

125
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,226
He luckily has the good change of clothes.

126
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:38,516
I just feel really bad.

127
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:39,697
I don't know.

128
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,079
He never has potty accidents.

129
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,930
So I don't know if he was like embarrassed

130
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,031
to say he had to go potty.

131
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,905
Or if they were just super busy

132
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,832
and he like really forgot.

133
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:50,487
So, I hope that everything's okay.

134
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:51,739
I feel really bad though.

135
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:52,784
'Cause I'm sure that's kind of like

136
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,366
an embarrassing thing to happen.

137
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,133
I mean they're all
preschoolers so it's not like,

138
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:58,423
too dramatic, if it happens.

139
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,795
I'm sure it's happened
before in the class.

140
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:02,254
But I do feel really bad.

141
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:03,419
So I think I'm gonna pick him up.

142
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,405
Not early, I mean he's done with school.

143
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,054
Now he just does like
playtime and nap-time.

144
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:09,008
But maybe I'm gonna pick
him up during nap-time

145
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,606
and just bring him home.

146
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,174
'Cause I feel kind of bad for him.

147
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:15,188
Me and Finn are gonna go pick up brother.

148
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,546
- Yeah!

149
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:17,851
He's so excited.

150
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,077
You wanna get Ollie?

151
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:20,244
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

152
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,381
Poor little dude.

153
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,229
I actually tried to put him down for a nap

154
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,227
before I left so that he can
sleep while I picked up Ollie

155
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,828
and it just didn't happen.

156
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,907
And of course he passes out in the car.

157
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:33,704
I think he might actually stay asleep

158
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,867
and then go back to sleep
when we get in the car.

159
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,148
We'll see what happens.

160
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:38,484
Hey Bub, we gotta go get Ollie.

161
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:40,068
Do you wanna go get Ollie?

162
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:42,542
Hi Finney, are you okay?

163
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,887
Were you tired, sleep in?

164
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:45,987
Yeah.

165
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:47,293
Well let's go get Ollie then you

166
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,973
can go back to sleeping kay?

167
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:53,723
Aw Finn are you so happy
to see your brother?

168
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,129
He got to pick up his hook.

169
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:58,956
Everything.

170
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:02,631
And now they're just playing with toys.

171
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:06,186
Hey Bud, are you eating
your lunch in the car?

172
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:08,949
Did you forget to eat lunch?

173
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:10,764
Were you just too busy havin' fun?

174
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:12,183
Yeah?

175
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:13,705
Well how was school?

176
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:14,803
- Good.

177
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:16,947
- [Missy] Do you want to tell
us anything that happened?

178
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,364
- I went pee-pee.

179
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,671
- Oh no!

180
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,402
That's okay though huh?

181
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:23,371
Yeah.

182
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:24,858
What happened, did you forget?

183
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,445
Yeah.

184
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:29,595
Were you just too busy havin' so much fun?

185
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:32,890
Yeah it sounds like he was
just havin' a lot of fun.

186
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,469
He was playin' and just totally forgot.

187
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:36,164
So how was share day?

188
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:37,177
- Good.
- Good.

189
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:38,691
You shared your toy?

190
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,068
Did everyone like the hook?

191
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,208
Yeah and what was your favorite toy that

192
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,616
other people brought?

193
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:45,866
- A baby dog.
- A baby dog!

194
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:48,392
'Cause it starts with a what?

195
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:49,608
- Ba.
- Ba, ba.

196
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:50,441
- Ba.
- B!

197
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:52,700
- Ba, B!
- Yeah!

198
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,506
And so that was your favorite
thing that someone brought?

199
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:57,558
That's so neat!

200
00:06:57,558 --> 00:06:59,670
And how was the birthday party?

201
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,107
- Good.
- Was that fun?

202
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:02,994
What did you get to eat?

203
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:05,183
- A cupcake.
- A cupcake?

204
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,190
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

205
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,023
what kind was it?

206
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:09,606
- I had sprinkles with vanilla.

207
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,464
- Oh yum.

208
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:13,994
That sounds good.

209
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:15,845
Alright Ollie last but not least,

210
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,095
but how did picture day go?

211
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,847
- Good.
- Good.

212
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,014
Did you smile?

213
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,247
Show me how you smiled.

214
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:28,846
Aw, that is a cute smile!

215
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:31,026
- And then I went like this. (grunting)

216
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,853
- Oh! (laughing)

217
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,854
So you did like a funny
smile and a cute smile?

218
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:37,497
Good job.

219
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:40,066
His teacher said that
anytime that they have like

220
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,503
anything that's like out of
the ordinary for their day

221
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,310
where it's like they're not
doing their usual routine,

222
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,109
and like for instance it was picture day

223
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:52,361
and a birthday party day she
said every kid is just crazy.

224
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,204
And it sounds like almost every teacher

225
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:57,646
had just a hard day today
'cause it was just totally off

226
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,493
their schedule and the kids were like,

227
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:00,379
what's going on?

228
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,256
Why are we going to take pictures?

229
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:03,840
It sounds like they got through it.

230
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,234
Everything was good.

231
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,949
And I think it's pretty
cute that he got to do his

232
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,419
very first picture day.

233
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,528
I can't wait to see the photos!

234
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,107
- Welcome back Ollie.

235
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,620
How was school?

236
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,453
- Good.
- Did you have

237
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,286
picture day?
- Yeah.

238
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,466
- They took your picture?

239
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,523
That's so cool.

240
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:21,126
We missed you, love you.

241
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,709
- I missed you too.

242
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:24,922
- Yes I have been working at home.

243
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,139
We just picked up Ollie from school

244
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,655
and oh my God, there is
a mouse on our counter.

245
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,325
(laughing)

246
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:33,171
Wait, did he just topple over?

247
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:35,120
Oh it's like a baby mouse!

248
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,888
Oh my gosh, Ollie, Finn do you see this?

249
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:37,849
Look at him move.

250
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:38,683
Is he asleep?

251
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:39,916
- Don't touch him guys.

252
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,111
Don't get too close.

253
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:42,615
- [Bryan] Gross!

254
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:43,701
- [Missy] Is he okay?

255
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,135
- [Bryan] Oh he's movin'!

256
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:46,363
Okay.

257
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:48,905
How long was that up there?

258
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:49,738
- Oh, it's so gross!

259
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,571
I have to clean this whole thing.

260
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,404
- Oh my gosh.

261
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,516
Look at him, now he's active huh?

262
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:56,241
Oh my gosh, that was crazy!

263
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:58,935
Our garage door has been
open for a couple hours

264
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:00,504
because we've been going in and out.

265
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:03,384
- So cute.
- You think it's cute yeah.

266
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:04,360
(laughing)

267
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,344
- It's so gross.

268
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,493
I mean it's cute.

269
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:07,651
- How did it get here?

270
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:09,565
- [Bryan] It probably lives outside buddy

271
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,618
and it came in through the garage door.

272
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,691
- It's so gross.

273
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,699
But yet it is so cute.

274
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:15,587
- He is pretty cute.

275
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,739
Not everyday you wake up and see that huh?

276
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,462
I remember as a kid,

277
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:22,081
waking up and going into the
kitchen to make breakfast

278
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:24,157
and seeing oh my gosh,

279
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,817
and seeing like mice run across

280
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:27,773
the--
- Ew!

281
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:28,750
- It was the craziest thing.

282
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,585
And it was just something

283
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:30,975
we dealt with as a kid in our house.

284
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:32,311
There's mice in every house isn't there?

285
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,648
- No.

286
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:34,808
- [Bryan] Are you sure?

287
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:35,878
- No, there's definitely
not mice in every house.

288
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:37,988
- [Bryan] Okay, or is it spiders?

289
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:40,217
(screaming)

290
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:42,591
I think there's spiders
in every house right?

291
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:43,892
- Yeah there's spiders.

292
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:44,725
- They say something like,

293
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:47,025
you eat like a thousand spiders a year

294
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,326
when you sleep.
- No, that is not true.

295
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:49,741
That is absolutely ridiculous.

296
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:51,458
- And Missy doesn't believe it.

297
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,399
Aw.

298
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,641
Oh, oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

299
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,582
You got it?

300
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:55,415
Oh my gosh.

301
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:56,248
Okay I got it.

302
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:57,081
I got him!

303
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,460
Oh my gosh okay.

304
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,293
I'm basically a pro at
catching baby mice now.

305
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:06,261
What Ollie?

306
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:07,422
- So cute.

307
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:08,589
And all alone.

308
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,482
- [Bryan] He is all alone.

309
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,187
Look at the baby mouse.

310
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:15,110
Can you believe that babe?
- No.

311
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,847
- [Bryan] Baby mouse in our kitchen.

312
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:17,680
- Does it bite?

313
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,978
- [Bryan] I don't think so.

314
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,969
- I mean I wouldn't touch it.
- He seems pretty friendly.

315
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,255
The boys are just looking at him

316
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,215
and we put a little bit of water in there.

317
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:26,776
- [Missy] Finn you're
just holding your hand

318
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:27,609
out to hold him?

319
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:28,567
- Yeah. (laughing)

320
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,351
- [Bryan] The kids are so funny.

321
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,788
You wash your hands really good?

322
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:33,621
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we gotta

323
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,802
wash your hands.
- Yeah I didn't

324
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,250
use the soap.

325
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,752
- [Bryan] You didn't need soap?

326
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:40,719
You gotta use soap when
you wash your hands!

327
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:41,552
- I don't!

328
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:42,465
- I don't!

329
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:43,964
- My preschooler thinks
that he doesn't need

330
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:46,624
to wash his hands with soap.

331
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:48,265
You gotta wash your hands with soap buddy.

332
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:49,379
(laughing)

333
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,361
Okay, redo, try again.

334
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:52,099
Wash your hands with soap this time, okay?

335
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,682
(upbeat music)

336
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,130
It's funny too because
we actually have like

337
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,696
a pest service that comes to our house

338
00:11:09,696 --> 00:11:12,479
once a month and sprays
inside and outside.

339
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:15,427
And I still see, spiders, all the time

340
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:16,297
inside of the house.

341
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:17,167
And now a mouse so.

342
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,915
We should probably step our game up a bit.

343
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:21,458
Hey Ollie, what's goin' on here?

344
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,986
- I'm pulling Finn's stinky feet.

345
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,498
- [Bryan] You're pullin'
Finn's stinky feet

346
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:28,498
down the hallway?
- Yeah.

347
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:32,800
- And Finn is enjoying it a lot.

348
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,606
Careful of the chord,
careful of the chord.

349
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:35,817
Okay I think Finn's had enough.

350
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,322
Finn, I think it's your turn to pull Ollie

351
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,155
down the hallway okay?

352
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:42,206
Grab his feet Finn, pull him, pull him!

353
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:43,404
Pull him!

354
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:46,098
(laughing)

355
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:48,640
I don't think he's strong enough.

356
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,222
Oh he's trying so hard it's so cute.

357
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,399
Aw, you boys are so cute.

358
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,032
Oh and now he wants you to do it.

359
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:57,236
Finn!

360
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:58,236
He likes it.

361
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:04,354
Okay that's enough horse-rousin I think.

362
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:05,524
Give your brother a huge.

363
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,543
Hug it out brothers.

364
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,928
Hug it out brothers.

365
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,178
Horse-play and hugs, right?

366
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:15,718
They're seriously so cute.

367
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,086
I love them so much!

368
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:19,613
Can you stand on your head?

369
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,764
Here, I'll hold you up.

370
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:21,597
Look at you.

371
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:22,732
Look at you dude.

372
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:24,616
- I wanna show mama.

373
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:25,699
- Whoo, nice!

374
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,438
You did a little flip.

375
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:29,300
- Ow, ow.

376
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,690
- [Bryan] Aw did you hurt your knee?

377
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,145
- Yeah.
- Aw.

378
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:33,671
Do I need to kiss is all better?

379
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:34,504
- Yeah.

380
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,989
- Sometimes all you need
is to kiss it all better.

381
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,850
How's that?
- Good.

382
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,745
- Okay.

383
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:39,842
You too?

384
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,946
You want me to kiss your knee?

385
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,092
There you go.

386
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:44,930
(laughing)

387
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,248
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

388
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:47,915
(laughing)

389
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:51,656
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

390
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:54,405
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

391
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:55,488
Alright boys.

392
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:59,697
(giggling)

393
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:02,265
You body slammed me Finn.

394
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:03,098
Oh geeze.

395
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,694
Okay now they're all
climbin' on top of me.

396
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:06,527
Okay.

397
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:10,028
(snoring)

398
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:16,657
Babe!

399
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:20,795
They're getting weapons, send help!

400
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,328
Okay.

401
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:26,793
To be fair, I did rean him Hop on Pop

402
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:28,293
when he was a kid.

403
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:31,946
That's probably where they learned it.

404
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,256
Thank you Dr. Seuss.

405
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:35,957
Thank you Dr. Seuss for
this magical moment.

406
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:36,874
Oh my gosh.

407
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,474
- Check it out.

408
00:13:42,474 --> 00:13:43,739
I put fake hair in

409
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,234
today and I did it all by myself

410
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:47,695
which I've never done before.

411
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,588
I actually think it looks pretty good.

412
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,129
I think it could look a little better.

413
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,512
Like blended a little bit better

414
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,825
but I am not a professional

415
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,359
and this will just have to do.

416
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,458
But the reason I did this

417
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,214
is 'cause me and Bryan are
actually goin' out tonight

418
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,393
and we're gonna go to a concert

419
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:01,472
and just have a fun date night.

420
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,238
And we are super duper excited.

421
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:05,559
And so the boys are really excited

422
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,385
'cause they get to stay with?

423
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:10,135
- Mimi and papa!
- Mimi and papa!

424
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,887
They are super excited.

425
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:13,950
My mom and dad are here.

426
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,300
And yeah I think we're actually
just gonna end the vlog.

427
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,112
It's gonna be fun to just go and relax

428
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:20,349
and have fun and not worry
about any vlogging so.

429
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:23,163
Finn do you want to help me end the vlog?

430
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,810
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

431
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,221
Alright say, give this
video a big thumbs up!

432
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,343
Yeah!

433
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:31,203
Say we'll see you guys tomorrow!

434
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,355
Okay, ready and...

435
00:14:33,355 --> 00:00:00,000
