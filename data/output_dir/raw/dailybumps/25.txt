1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,260
- I'm going to take Ollie
to the doctor with me

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,400
so that he can show me
how to be brave, right?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,233
- Yeah.

4
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,066
- [Bryan] I don't have to be afraid?

5
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:08,630
- 'Cause I telled him.

6
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,950
- He told me, "you have to be brave daddy"

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,606
"and you can do it."

17
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:36,529
- [Bryan] Good morning
boys, where are we going?

18
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:37,815
- To Hawaii!

19
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:39,033
- We're going to Hawaii?

20
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:40,048
- Yeah!

21
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:41,945
- [Bryan] No.

22
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:43,620
- It looks like we're going to Hawaii.

23
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,680
- It does look like
you're going to Hawaii.

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,250
You wish though.

25
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,360
Actually, ever since Missy and I

26
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,630
went to Hawaii the last
time, Ollie's always like,

27
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,662
"I want to go to Hawaii".

28
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:54,986
- I want to take him to Hawaii.

29
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:55,934
- [Bryan] Aww.

30
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:56,767
- It would be so fun.

31
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:59,120
We're gonna do so many
fun trips this summer.

32
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,481
- [Bryan] You guys excited for fun trips?

33
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:01,314
- Yeah!

34
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:02,669
- [Bryan] All right, but
you're all ready for what?

35
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:04,086
- Ah, wet tongue!

36
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:06,670
- [Bryan] Luna's licking his toes.

37
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,424
Where are you actually going today Ollie?

38
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:09,334
- Swim class.

39
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:11,070
- [Bryan] Swim class!

40
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,050
Your new swim class.

41
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,849
You're gonna do so good
like you did last time?

42
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:16,682
- Yeah.

43
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:18,061
(laughs)
- Luna.

44
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:21,529
- And today Mimi and
papa are gonna take you.

45
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,720
Isn't that fun?
- Cool.

46
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,050
Want to go have some
fun with Mimi and Papa?

47
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,230
- Yeah!

48
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,110
- All right, these boys
are actually really excited

49
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,555
for swim class, it's hilarious.

50
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,249
- I love you guys!

51
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:32,530
- I love you too buddy.

52
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,770
All right boys are off with Mimi

53
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,110
and Papa to go to swim class.

54
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,777
(dramatic synth rock music)

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,729
So today is going to be interesting

56
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,650
because we are actually getting ready

57
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,550
to head to a doctor's
appointment for myself.

58
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,640
For those of you who didn't see,

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,240
I'll have it linked above in the eye card.

60
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,230
But I had an accident about a week ago,

61
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,010
where I actually fell, in the morning.

62
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,050
I fainted, actually, I passed out.

63
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,200
I was unconscious.

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,710
A couple of different times.

65
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,490
I woke up with paramedics around me,

66
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,290
who basically said I could have fainted,

67
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,960
it could have been something else.

68
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,740
They wanted me to go check for
seizure activity in my brain.

69
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,410
A whole lot was going on at that time.

70
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,048
And so we have now scheduled
a doctor's appointment.

71
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:46,810
So I'm going to talk to a doctor.

72
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,480
I'm probably gonna tell them the story

73
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,930
and see if, you know, they
have any answers for me

74
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,740
or anything else that we
can do moving forward.

75
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,340
If we have to, get my brain checked.

76
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,710
If we have to get my blood checked,

77
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,590
and my heart checked or something.

78
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,610
So that this doesn't happen again.

79
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,870
Because it was a very scary experience,

80
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,770
and it's not something
I want happening often.

81
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,420
All right so we dropped
Finn off at Mimi and Papa's,

82
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,670
and we've decided I'm going
to take Ollie to the doctor

83
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,330
with me so that he can show
me how to be brave, right?

84
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,163
- Yeah.

85
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:17,996
- [Bryan] I don't have to be afraid?

86
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:19,510
- 'Cause I telled him.

87
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,930
- He told me, "You have
to be brave daddy,"

88
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,660
"and you can do it."

89
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,990
The doctor's is definitely
not my favorite thing.

90
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,780
I don't really like
talking about my health.

91
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,306
Or getting needles poked in me,
or anything like that, do I?

92
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:31,840
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,997
This is gonna be fun, right?

94
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:34,830
- Yeah!

95
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,663
- Yeah!

96
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:36,496
Okay.

97
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,280
We're going into the doctor.
- Yeah.

98
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,270
- We are actually at the
doctor's office right now

99
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,210
that my cousin Tara-Lynn works.

100
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,610
Which is actually very convenient,

101
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,020
'cause I'm like, hey can we get in?

102
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,730
And then it's like,
she sees us right away.

103
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,200
- Yeah.

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,410
- Which actually we didn't say,

105
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,110
but she just got accepted
into a PA school,

106
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,700
so she's now going to school
to be a physician's assistant.

107
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,660
So now she's like our family doctor.

108
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,840
She kind of already is.

109
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,172
We already asked her all the questions.

110
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:04,650
- I know I'm always like what's this?

111
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,900
- What's wrong with me?

112
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,010
And she's like, "Nothing."

113
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,400
Anyways, so, we're excited.

114
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,930
Ollie got a little nervous, so he's just

115
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,090
gonna watch the iPhone and
not pay attention to anything.

116
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,324
Just zone out baby.

117
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,156
(laughs)

118
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,156
(suspenseful music)

119
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,620
All right, we just finished.

120
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,580
And we're just hanging out with Tara-Lynn

121
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,267
while she was taking all his vitals.

122
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,100
- Yeah.

123
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,290
She was checking my
chart and she was like,

124
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,640
"Oh wait, have you ever
been in here before?"

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,220
and I was like, "No, never".

126
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,040
And she was like, "Well
there's a note about you."

127
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,650
And I was like, "What,
there's a note in my chart?"

128
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,910
- [Missy] And she's like
"I didn't write it."

129
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,280
It's like she didn't write it.

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,373
- It says, "popular YouTube star."

131
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:06,543
I'm like what?

132
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:08,551
(laughing)

133
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:11,960
- So someone saw us and
wrote that in the chart.

134
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,890
Now someone did see us
in the doctor's office.

135
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,930
- [Bryan] Someone who worked here, yeah.

136
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,880
- Yeah someone in the
doctor's office did see us

137
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,410
and did like say hi or something,

138
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,710
I think that they must
have told the front desk

139
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,520
that we're like on YouTube
and so he puts in the chart

140
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,930
"Popular YouTube star"
(laughs)

141
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,860
Tara's like, "I'm gonna delete that."

142
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,266
I'm like, "thanks."
(laughs)

143
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,150
- Yeah I don't know.

144
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,870
- [Missy] We don't need that attention.

145
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,150
So funny though.

146
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,450
- All right, so we just got
out of my doctor's appointment,

147
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,170
and it was pretty uneventful.

148
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,730
They basically just said

149
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,530
that I need to go to see a neurologist.

150
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,310
They don't think that it was orthostatic.

151
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,410
- Yeah the only other, I think
they think it's a vasovagal,

152
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,050
which is what I kind of suspected too.

153
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,020
- Sounds like it is.

154
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,510
So yes, now they made me a recommendation

155
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,910
to go see a neurologist, so
I guess that's what's next

156
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,923
on this journey of finding
out what's wrong with me.

157
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,170
Boo!
(laughs)

158
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,390
Did I scare you Ollie?

159
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,672
I actually did.

160
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:11,222
- That was scary?
- Sorry.

161
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:12,980
Another day, another horse store, huh?

162
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,920
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

163
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,073
- I'm looking for a western curb bit.

164
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:18,792
- Do you want to see a toy horse?

165
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,130
- [Bryan] Oh you're looking for a bit.

166
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,041
And you see toys?

167
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,490
- Yeah over there.

168
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,124
- Let me see.
- It's horses.

169
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,510
- Just a quick trip to the
horse store, apparently.

170
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,100
Yeah.

171
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,275
You see some toys?

172
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:30,525
- [Ollie] Yeah.

173
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,174
- [Bryan] Whoa, these are cool.

174
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:36,264
- Rainbow horsey!

175
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,950
- [Bryan] Whoa, that's cool.

176
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,010
That is a lot of horse figurines.

177
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,300
(laughs)

178
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,820
Yeah I think that one's a little too big.

179
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,020
Ollie what are those?

180
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,250
- Salt lamps.

181
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,910
Remember I have one of these?

182
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,720
- [Bryan] Yeah but it's
actually not a lamp Ollie,

183
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,050
it's just a big ol' piece of salt.

184
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,848
- You know how Nacho
likes to lick so much.

185
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:01,960
He probably would love that.

186
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,440
- [Bryan] Wait, have you
tried giving him salt?

187
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,273
- I actually haven't, no.

188
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:05,580
- [Bryan] You should I
bet he would like it.

189
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,210
- I totally could.
- Yeah.

190
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,580
This is, it literally looks like

191
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,230
the salt lamp you used to have though.

192
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,270
That's so funny.

193
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,890
Okay, I was literally standing
here going what smells?

194
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,590
It's these balls.

195
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,260
This one smells like vanilla.

196
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,281
This one is like, more fruity.

197
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:24,175
- [Woman] That's blueberry.

198
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:25,008
- Blueberry!

199
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:26,180
That's what it is.

200
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,870
- [Woman] Yellow is banana.

201
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,310
- [Bryan] Ollie smell this one.

202
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,591
What's is smell like?

203
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:32,450
- Vanilla, chocolate!

204
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,092
- [Bryan] Yeah, this is a plain
one, this one has no smell.

205
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:39,175
(tender piano music)

206
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,789
- Why is the lobster taped up?

207
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,520
- [Missy] So they don't pinch you.

208
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Do you know that people eat these?

209
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,353
- No.

210
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,953
- [Missy] Is that weird?

211
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:04,900
- Yeah.

212
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,850
- [Missy] That is a lot of lobster huh?

213
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:09,089
You want to see?

214
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,896
See all those lobsters?
- Yeah.

215
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,246
- [Missy] Isn't that crazy?

216
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,466
- My lemonade tastes like lobster.

217
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,923
- It tastes like lobster?
(laughs)

218
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:21,290
- How does it taste like lobster?

219
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,220
- Because mine taste's like lobster.

220
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,345
- Finn I missed you all day!

221
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:27,200
- Yeah.

222
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,923
- Did you hang out with
Mimi and Papa today?

223
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:29,756
- Yeah.

224
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:30,710
- [Missy] How fun!

225
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,549
We are home now and we're
checking out our fishies.

226
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,589
And they're doing so good.

227
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,539
And check out Patrick.

228
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,139
He is still so happy.

229
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,240
What does he do?

230
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,880
All day?
- He climbs.

231
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,620
- He literally climbs all over this tank.

232
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,830
You'll see him somewhere
different all the time, huh?

233
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,430
I actually have footage
of him, he crawled down,

234
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,160
he went up the rock, down the rock,

235
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,240
and then went up the side of the back.

236
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,260
It was crazy, it was the coolest thing.

237
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,060
This guy is so cool.

238
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,090
And he's moving even when
you don't think he's moving.

239
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,520
And so is Dory, look at Dory over there.

240
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,870
She went right into the group perfectly,

241
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,950
and they've accepted her, and she's so,

242
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,350
she just fits right in
with all the others.

243
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,922
We love our little fishies, huh?

244
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:17,755
- Yeah.

245
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:19,500
- Climb over!

246
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,320
- [Missy] You are so cute.

247
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,460
You're a cute fishie too, okay?

248
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,788
My little Finn.

249
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:27,060
- Our crabs are doing really good.

250
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,893
- [Missy] Oh yeah.

251
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:29,010
Well we don't have, oh do we have crabs?

252
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,890
No we don't have crabs,
we have little sand crabs.

253
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,520
They are like sand crabs.

254
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,870
And little snails, and we have shrimp,

255
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,823
and we have all the fish,
and all the things, huh?

256
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:40,656
- [Ollie] Yeah.

257
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:43,060
- But anyways it is almost bedtime.

258
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,301
We had such a fun day, huh?

259
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,134
- Yeah.

260
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,810
- And I missed you Finn!

261
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,620
Yeah and my mom and dad
took them to swim today

262
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,490
and they said that they did so good

263
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,840
and that Finn is this close
to floating on his back

264
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,783
all by himself, huh?

265
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:00,740
- [Finn] Yeah.

266
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,170
- [Missy] The teacher said
that she was letting go of him

267
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,630
just for a few seconds, and
he was actually floating.

268
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,490
So you're this close to
just doing it on your own.

269
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,070
How exciting.

270
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,090
And you're doing good,

271
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,022
all you have to do is
work on your kicks, huh?

272
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:14,855
- Yeah.

273
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:17,550
- Right now Ollie is working
on like, multitasking.

274
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,610
He's like, "It's really
hard to do your hands"

275
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,330
"and kick and do them all properly."

276
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,360
But he's starting to catch on.

277
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,940
And you're teacher's so awesome, huh?

278
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,020
- I missed Finn.

279
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,410
- Did you miss him today?

280
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,243
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

281
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:31,130
- They missed each other.

282
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,440
Finn got in the car and he was
like, "Hi Ollie, hi Ollie!"

283
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:36,774
You're so cute.

284
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:37,990
But anyways we're gonna end the vlog.

285
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,580
Make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up

286
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,610
if you enjoyed it.

287
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,867
Say thumbs up!

288
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,950
(laughs)

289
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,460
And we will see you guys tomorrow!

290
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,378
What do you say Ollie?

291
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:51,378
- Bye, boop.

292
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,180
- [Missy] Oh Finn's turn, can you do it?

293
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,100
Say bye.

294
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,010
- Bye.

295
00:10:57,010 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat instrumental music)
