1
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:01,909
- We have got a ounce-ment!

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:02,742
- [Bryan] What?

3
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:04,253
- We have got a ounce-ment.

4
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:05,086
- [Bryan] "A ounce-ment"?

5
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:05,956
- An ounce-ment.

6
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:08,445
- Announcement? We do?

7
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:09,380
We do?

8
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,893
(laughter)

9
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:11,726
The boys are just like,

10
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:12,559
"Oh you made the bed.

11
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,360
"Awesome, I'll jump all over it."

- Good morning!

24
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:36,613
- Good morning!

25
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,029
Good morning, boys.

26
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:39,037
Where are we goin'?

27
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:40,709
- We're goin' to music class!

28
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:41,542
- Yeah.

29
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,717
You're gonna go learn about music, Fin?

30
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:43,550
- Yeah.

31
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,383
- Yeah.

32
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:45,279
Good morning, guys.

33
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,439
The boys are headed out with
Missy to go to music class.

34
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,844
I've got some work to get done.

35
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:49,677
Have fun, okay?

36
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:50,510
(Oliver squeals)

37
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,293
- You guys, we are so late.

38
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:55,132
We were already gonna be
late when we left the house.

39
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:56,533
And so I was a little bummed about that

40
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,309
'cause I'm not normally late,

41
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:00,661
but then we hit a ton of traffic

42
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,037
and so we're so late right now.

43
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:04,724
Let's hurry up and get
to music class, 'kay?

44
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:05,558
- Yeah!

45
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:06,808
- [Missy] Yeah!

46
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,291
- Ollie, how was music class?

47
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,124
- Good.

48
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:13,957
- I almost said swim class.

49
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:15,602
He was in swim class for years.

50
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:18,226
We actually aren't in
swim class right now,

51
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:21,559
but I just signed them up
for a class in a few weeks.

52
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,176
So I'm really excited to
see them back in swim class.

53
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:25,535
But, yeah, we just did
music class and everything.

54
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,945
They were so cute.

55
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:28,760
Fin is always so clingy in this class,

56
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,559
and he doesn't really like to participate.

57
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,271
And so it's fun for me to bring Ollie

58
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:34,361
because Ollie does like participating

59
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,319
and doing things, and so
Fin's watching him like,

60
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,239
"Hm, maybe I do want to do that."

61
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,990
And today, he actually
did a little bit more

62
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,038
than he normally does.

63
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,590
So I really, really am
liking music class just

64
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,942
because I think it's
really cool for the kids

65
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,862
to just learn how to sit, pay attention.

66
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:51,244
And then music is just always a cool thing

67
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,632
to get incorporated into their
soul and into their life.

68
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:56,921
Just helping them learn beats

69
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:59,713
and stuff like that is
really, really neat.

70
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:02,026
All right, should we go home to see Daddy?

71
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:02,859
- Da.

72
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,866
- [Missy] All right, let's go.

73
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:06,138
- Good morning, guys.

74
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:09,202
I wanted to give you all
a little update on Luna.

75
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,035
You wanna sit?

76
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:12,469
So yesterday, Luna got spayed,

77
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:14,502
and she is doing so well today.

78
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,786
The doctor said that she might be "browsy"

79
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:18,018
for about 24 hours.

80
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:20,058
She might also might have
trouble eating and stuff.

81
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,954
We've been giving her a
little bit of medicine.

82
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:22,787
She ate.

83
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:26,265
She went potty today like
a good girl, (laughs)

84
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:27,370
and she's feelin' a lot better.

85
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,953
She has a lot of her energy back.

86
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:31,161
And we have to keep reminding Karma

87
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,793
that she is not a hundred percent,

88
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:34,433
and you can't be so rough with her.

89
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:35,393
Look, he's kissing me.

90
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,427
But seriously, Karma and Luna are

91
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:39,168
like boyfriend and girlfriend.

92
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,119
It's so cute.

93
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,647
They lay down next to each other.

94
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:44,237
They give each other kisses.

95
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,864
Karma's like, "Thank you for getting me

96
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:48,048
"a girlfriend for Christmas." (laughs)

97
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,544
You're so funny, Karma.

98
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,464
He's a good doggie.

99
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:52,688
And Luna, you're a good puppy, too, huh?

100
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:53,632
You guys are good friends.

101
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,184
See? Look at them.

102
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:59,398
They're kissing. Aw! (laughs)

103
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:01,329
They kiss. It's so funny.

104
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:02,985
They are literally in a relationship.

105
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:04,881
So it's a good thing we
got her spayed. (laughs)

106
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,410
Although Karma is fixed also.

107
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,801
And, yes, there's already a little

108
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,883
Christmas tree in my office.

109
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:12,794
I had to go a little Christmasy.

110
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:15,090
I picked this up the other day,

111
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,675
and I'm not sure if I like it here.

112
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:18,242
We might end up using it
somewhere else in the house,

113
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,338
but it's just a cool, cute,
little Christmas tree.

114
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:22,692
It's battery powered down
there, too, which is nice,

115
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,570
but I didn't think that I
would be the first one to put

116
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,403
up a Christmas tree.

117
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:26,736
I thought for sure it would be Missy.

118
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:28,321
I know she's excited to
get all the trees up,

119
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,250
but I got the first one.

120
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,524
And I wasn't even planning on having one

121
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:31,548
in my office, but I was
like, "You know what?

122
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:32,547
"I think I wanna put one there."

123
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,505
Oh, and look.

124
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,336
I got a new lounger, too,

125
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:37,910
because Missy (laughs)
really wanted the one

126
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,310
that was in here in the playroom.

127
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,638
So we were shuffling couches (chuckles)

128
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,038
trying to find something that works.

129
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:44,871
So, yeah.

130
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:45,977
I got a cool new seating system,

131
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:46,977
and this goes flat and it's really soft.

132
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:51,577
And I can sit here and just
look at my Christmas tree.

133
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:52,752
Oh, hi, Luna.

134
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:54,192
Bye, Luna.

135
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,808
- I like the pictures.

136
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:57,195
- [Bryan] I do, too.

137
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,005
- You know which picture I like?

138
00:03:59,005 --> 00:03:59,900
- [Bryan] Which one do you like?

139
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,987
- Over here.

140
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:04,246
I like baby Luna and the Christmas tree.

141
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:06,471
- [Bryan] Yeah, baby Luna.

142
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:07,559
And baby you guys.

143
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,392
Look at you guys.

144
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:09,800
Look so young.

145
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,015
That was when we had our Christmas tree up

146
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:12,081
in the formal, huh?

147
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:14,831
- Yeah, when it was Christmas.

148
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:15,664
- [Bryan] Yeah, I know.

149
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:16,497
Guess what.

150
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:17,329
- What?

151
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,162
- [Bryan] It's almost Christmas.

152
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:18,996
- Yay!

153
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,079
- [Missy] Hey, Fin.

154
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,639
Did you want a drink, bud?

155
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,472
- Yeah.

156
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,305
- Okay.

157
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,138
This is a daily struggle.

158
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,114
Not even a daily struggle.

159
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,298
Like an hourly struggle.

160
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:28,810
He wants a drink from up here,

161
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,811
but he only wants it from a specific cup.

162
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,772
He is in his terrible
twos, and that is it.

163
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:36,216
So, let's figure out
what cup you want, 'kay?

164
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:37,049
- 'Kay.

165
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:38,542
- 'Kay. Do you want this one?

166
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:39,537
- [Fin] Yeah.

167
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:40,370
- That one?

168
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,203
- Da!

169
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:42,552
- What? No.

170
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:44,056
You don't want that one.

171
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,008
- Dat 'n.

172
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:45,841
- Okay, okay. Here.

173
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:46,674
Let's try it again.

174
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:47,507
Ready?

175
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:48,340
Do you want this one?

176
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,173
- [Fin] No.

177
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:50,736
- Do you want this one?

178
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:51,569
- Da.

179
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,402
- [Missy] Yeah?

180
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:53,235
(Oliver laughs)

181
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,109
Why are you saying that?

182
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:54,942
- Dat 'n.

183
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:57,437
- (laughs) Usually we have this struggle

184
00:04:57,437 --> 00:04:59,030
that goes on for like five minutes.

185
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,863
You want this one?

186
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:00,696
- [Fin] No.

187
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:01,529
- No?

188
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:03,648
Do you want Batman?

189
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:04,556
- [Fin] No.

190
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:05,577
- No.

191
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,305
Do you want this one?

192
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:08,148
- Da!

193
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:09,089
- Yeah?

194
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:10,049
- I want dat 'n.

195
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:11,121
I want mil'.

196
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:12,265
- [Missy] And you want milk?

197
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,098
- Yeah.

198
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,287
- Anyways, it is just
like his daily struggle,

199
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:17,720
and it usually takes me five minutes

200
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,265
to figure out exactly which cup he wants.

201
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,664
You want this one?

202
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:22,736
And you want milk?

203
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:23,795
- Dat 'n. Mil'.

204
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:25,300
- Okay, let's do it.

205
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,403
Hey, Fin.

206
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:27,236
Do you want this one?

207
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,069
- No.

208
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,768
- [Missy] No? (laughs)

209
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:32,669
Sometimes he'll say yes to this one,

210
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:33,967
but then, when I bring down the top,

211
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,710
he's like, "No! Not that one!"

212
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,543
Huh?

213
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,103
Is this what you wanted?

214
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:39,936
(Fin whines)

215
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:42,651
I thought you wanted this.

216
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:43,484
You want this one.

217
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:45,965
You said you wanted that one.

218
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:47,675
Oh, my goodness.

219
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:48,939
- Mama!

220
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,811
- [Missy] You want a different top?

221
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:51,907
Oh, I know what he wants.

222
00:05:51,907 --> 00:05:52,749
I know what he wants.

223
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:56,916
This is not gonna work,
but you want it like that.

224
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,205
Fin, you are going to spill that.

225
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:05,125
That's not gonna work, dude. (laughs)

226
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,229
Is your brother silly?

227
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,574
Fin, that's not gonna work.

228
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:09,993
Don't, you're gonna spill it.

229
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:13,340
Finley Jay, you are going to spill that.

230
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,173
Wow.

231
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,189
You're suckin' that down, though, bud.

232
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:18,044
- We have got a ounce-ment!

233
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:18,877
- [Bryan] What?

234
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,332
- We have got a once-ment!

235
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:21,165
- [Bryan] "A ounce-ment"?

236
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:22,036
- An ounce-ment.

237
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:24,305
- Announcement! We do?

238
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:25,138
We do?

239
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,023
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

240
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,472
The boys are just like,
"Oh, you made the bed.

241
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,657
"Awesome, I'll just all over it."

242
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,115
- Fin, we have an announcement.

243
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:33,091
Don't we? Yes.

244
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,163
You guys remember we had
an announcement last week.

245
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:35,996
- Yep.

246
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,453
- We are doing our new 2018 calendar,

247
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:41,376
but we wanted to do something even bigger

248
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:44,175
and special than that
for the Christmas season.

249
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:46,092
So we have designed a--

250
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:49,003
Ollie, you wanna say it?

251
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:50,836
- Doo na coloring book!

252
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,324
- That's right, you guys.

253
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:56,226
We designed our very first coloring book,

254
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:57,082
and it is so cool.

255
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,506
It's called Coloring with Family,

256
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,771
and it's basically a
bunch of family portraits

257
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:05,286
and doodles and stuff from
the blogs like Easter eggs.

258
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:06,119
- Nice.

259
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:06,952
- Its' really, really cool.

260
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:09,379
- Some of the pictures are
just so cute and so fun,

261
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,833
and I'm so excited to
see how people color them

262
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,970
and send us pictures of them.

263
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,554
I think it's gonna be so much fun.

264
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:16,498
- Ollie, guess what.

265
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:17,331
- What?

266
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:19,714
- There's even a picture of you to color.

267
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:20,676
(Oliver gasps)

268
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:22,148
Do you wanna color a picture of yourself?

269
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:22,981
(Missy laughs)

270
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:23,878
Isn't that gonna be so fun

271
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,086
coloring that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

272
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:25,919
- Yeah!

273
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,441
Oh, Fin thinks I should be wearing a hat.

274
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,771
- I'll wear the hat, 'kay?

275
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:29,604
(Bryan laughs)

276
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:30,704
- [Oliver] You look
beautiful with that hat.

277
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:31,696
- Thank you.

278
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:32,984
- Get a colorin' book!

279
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:33,817
- That's right.

280
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:35,505
Link down below in the description.

281
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,024
Go order your coloring book

282
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,763
fast.
- Go ask your mom and dad

283
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:40,563
to go order you a coloring
book for Christmas.

284
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:41,396
- Yes.

285
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:42,616
And if you're excited about this,

286
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:44,144
be sure to put it on your Christmas list

287
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,560
because we want you guys to order them

288
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,136
so you can have them
in time for Christmas.

289
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,609
And when you do get them,

290
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:50,200
be sure to color all the pages.

291
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,280
Either Tweet them or Instagram them to us

292
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,224
'cause we're so excited to
see how you guys color us.

293
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,057
- Yeah.

294
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:55,890
It's gonna be so fun.
- And all our cool

295
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,723
little doodles.

296
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:57,556
- I'm excited to color it.

297
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:58,566
I'm gonna get all my fancy (Bryan laughs)

298
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,493
coloring pencils out.

299
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:00,613
I'm gonna color that thing.

300
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,446
- Yes.

301
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:02,519
I'm so excited we were able to actually

302
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,605
finish a coloring book for you guys.

303
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,258
We've been working on it
for a couple months now.

304
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:07,091
- It was a lot of work.

305
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:07,924
- It was a lot of work.

306
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:09,108
I think it's cool because it's something

307
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,775
so unique that not--

308
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:12,934
Have other YouTubers done it?

309
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:15,615
I'm sure some have, but it's
not a common thing you see.

310
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,143
So, it's gonna be really cool.

311
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:19,354
- We've got lots of stuff comin',

312
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:20,542
and we're so excited about it.

313
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,375
- Yes.

314
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,398
So, link down below in the description,

315
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:23,269
dailybumpsmerch.com.

316
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,039
I also want to mention: if you
haven't ordered a calendar,

317
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,130
you can do a bundle
package for both of them,

318
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,563
and it makes it a lot cheaper, too.

319
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:30,396
So, that's cool.

320
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:34,106
So, go check that out on our
Daily Bumps Merch site now.

321
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:35,439
Look who's here.

322
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:39,178
My mom showed up for
dinner with my Aunt Bev.

323
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,010
Say hi.

324
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,843
- Hello.

325
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:43,451
- We are cookin' up some spaghetti

326
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:45,322
so that we can have a family dinner.

327
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:46,155
Right, Ollie?

328
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:46,988
- Yeah.

329
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:47,986
- [Bryan] You gonna eat some spaghetti?

330
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:48,819
- No.

331
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,652
- [Bryan] No?

332
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:50,485
- Oatmeal!

333
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:51,318
- [Bryan] You want oatmeal?

334
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,151
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:53,154
- You're not gonna have
spaghetti and meatballs?

336
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:54,777
- [Bryan] (laughs) He loves oatmeal.

337
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:57,360
Missy has been slavin' away on the stove.

338
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,512
Ooh, you got some spaghetti, Fin?

339
00:09:00,512 --> 00:09:01,496
Does that look yummy?

340
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:02,353
- Da. (Missy laughs)

341
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:03,686
- [Bryan] Yeah.

342
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:05,076
He's like, "Yeah."

343
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:07,324
I'm so excited to eat some spaghetti.

344
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:10,335
It is bedtime, and Fin
cannot get off this.

345
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:11,335
Oh, my gosh.

346
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:13,780
That was so fast.

347
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,267
- He's so fast on it.

348
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:16,100
- [Bryan] Where'd he go?

349
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,179
Where'd he go? (gasps)

350
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:18,012
Oh, no.

351
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,427
Are you headed down the dark hallway?

352
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:20,260
Come on.

353
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,093
- 'Kay, go to Daddy.

354
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:21,926
Ready, go!
- [Bryan] Let's ride it

355
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:22,759
to bed.

356
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,496
- He almost picks it up, it feels like.

357
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,290
- [Bryan] Yeah, he's pretty cool.

358
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,546
He's a pretty cool dude.

359
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:28,936
Ready for bed, Fin?

360
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:29,769
- No.

361
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,609
- [Bryan] No?

362
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:31,536
- [Missy] He's so tired.

363
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,480
He's barely awake.

364
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,345
- [Bryan] (laughs) Why are you so silly?

365
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:39,256
- You can't put the bike in your crib.

366
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,200
Okay, Fin?

367
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,144
- [Fin] 'Kay.

368
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:42,480
- [Bryan] He really wants
to sleep with it, though.

369
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,063
- [Missy] Oh, I know.

370
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:46,873
(Bryan laughs)

371
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:47,782
- All right.

372
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:48,913
- He just rides it around the house!

373
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:49,746
- I know.

374
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:50,902
Like, "Today, I did this."

375
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:53,920
- You're so cute, Fin. (laughs)

376
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,096
And that's your Spiderman one?

377
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,836
Is this just your garage,
right outside your crib?

378
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:00,668
- He gets up in the morning
and hops on that thing

379
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:01,580
and doesn't turn it off.

380
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,564
- [Bryan] Yeah. (laughs)

381
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:03,397
Here.

382
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:04,947
Let's turn it around so when
you wake up in the morning,

383
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:06,994
you can just jump right on it, okay?

384
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,033
Or right now. Sure.

385
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,753
You could use it to escape bedtime.

386
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:14,336
Escaping bedtime! (laughs)

387
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:18,299
You're so funny, dude.

388
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,865
(Fin babbles)

389
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,353
Ride that one, too?

390
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:22,186
- Da.

391
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,019
- 'Kay.

392
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:23,852
- Wait, no.

393
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:24,685
Fin, you're done.

394
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:25,518
You're done. (Bryan laughs)

395
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:26,351
You're done.

396
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:27,184
- [Bryan] He's actually gone.

397
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:28,017
- Come on.

398
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:31,394
- (laughs) I love it so much.

399
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:32,477
He's so cute.

400
00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:35,986
(Fin laughs)

401
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:37,475
There you go.

402
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:39,091
Night night, Fin.

403
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:39,924
- Say, "Night night, Daddy."

404
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:41,283
- All right, come give
me a kiss goodnight.

405
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:42,616
Come gimme kiss.

406
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,551
I love you.

407
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:48,670
- [Missy] Don't let him out.

408
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,753
- [Bryan] Oh, he's trying to escape!

409
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:53,648
You're trying to escape. (laughs)

410
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:54,845
- 'Kay, let's go.

411
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:55,822
(Bryan laughs)

412
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,973
Fin, you wanna fly?

413
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,597
- [Fin] No.

414
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:01,501
- [Bryan] 'Kay, good luck with that.

415
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:04,266
(Fin laughs)

416
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:07,273
Night, Fin! (laughs)

417
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:08,106
- All right.

418
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:10,296
Now, it's time for this one's bedtime.

419
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:11,530
Are you so tired?

420
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,363
- Yeah.

421
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:14,450
- You had such a long, fun day, huh?

422
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,033
- Yeah, but I'm...

423
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:18,058
- Oh, he wants to show you guys the books

424
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,516
that we picked out today, okay?

425
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:20,501
Are you gonna show 'em?

426
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,145
We read books every single night,

427
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:24,285
and we read about three.

428
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:28,452
Sometimes he gets four if
he sneaks one in there, huh?

429
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:32,129
(laughs) And it's definitely
just what he needs

430
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,151
before he falls asleep.

431
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,402
So he wants to show you the books

432
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,250
that we're reading tonight.

433
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,097
You ready?

434
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,857
- Snuggle up.

435
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:38,977
- [Missy] Snug as a Bug.

436
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:41,472
- Snug as a Bug, How to Catch a Monster,

437
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:44,889
(mumbles) are Awesome...

438
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:46,687
Goodnight Moon.

439
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:48,438
- [Missy] Yeah!

440
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:49,538
These are all the books
we're reading tonight.

441
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:51,054
- [Oliver] H.

442
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:51,887
- [Missy] Oh, yeah.

443
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:53,310
And he knows that's an H right there.

444
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,853
Good job!

445
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:56,610
Do you see anything else?

446
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,690
He's trying to look.

447
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,773
Right here is a little H.

448
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:04,199
You see the little H?

449
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,670
You see it?

450
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,408
- [Oliver] No.
- [Missy] Not really.

451
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:08,575
You learned B.

452
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:10,369
You see the B?

453
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:11,280
- [Oliver] B?

454
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,944
- [Missy] Nope, that's a G. (laughs)

455
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,634
Oh, you see U.

456
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,960
That's a U, 'member?

457
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,504
What does U stand for?

458
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,671
Or sound like?

459
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:20,971
- H-h-horse.

460
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:23,659
- (laughs) It's a good thing
preschool's workin' for ya.

461
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,094
I'm actually really proud of him,

462
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:27,014
but sometimes, he says
the funniest things.

463
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:30,472
He'll be like, "What does
a U stand for? H-h-horse."

464
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:31,383
Let's get to readin'.

465
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,615
We're gonna go ahead and end this video,

466
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:36,592
so make sure you give it a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it!

467
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:37,425
Yeah.

468
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,160
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

469
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,434
Make sure you guys go check
out those coloring books, huh?

470
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:42,267
- Yeah.

471
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,450
- All right. And...

472
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,450
- Bye. Boop!

473
00:12:46,130 --> 00:00:00,000
(relaxed electronic music)
