00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,651
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,751
♫ Happy birthday to you

3
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:26,039
(cheers)

4
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:32,104
♫ Wherever you are

5
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:35,403
♫ That's where I wanna be

6
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:38,273
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

7
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:42,982
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

8
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:46,225
♫ This is home

9
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:48,973
♫ Just walking around
you never looked so good

10
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:53,681
♫ Hugging you tight cuddling
all I could, singing

11
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:56,380
♫ I am home

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,463
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

13
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,250
- [Bryan] How's it going, boys?

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,000
- Good morning, boys.

15
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:13,976
- [Bryan] Are you guys
having fun together?

16
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:14,953
Hey Ollie, guess what?

17
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:15,786
- What?

18
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:16,619
- You're gonna have lots of presents

19
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,845
because it's your birthday party!

20
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,466
- It's my birthday party!

21
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,430
- And guess what?

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,636
We have some prehistoric
friends are gonna be

23
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:23,865
visiting you, okay?

24
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,756
- It's a dinos.

25
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:26,839
- Shh. Dinos.

26
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,761
You want dinos at your party?

27
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:30,594
- Yeah.

28
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:31,766
- Okay, I'm gonna see if
we can have some dinosaurs

29
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,397
at your party, okay?

30
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:35,288
Hey, how old are you?

31
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:36,620
- Three.

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,877
- Three, show me three.

33
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:39,475
Good job. You're three!

34
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,441
- I'm three!

35
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,262
- And we're gonna
celebrate in style, okay?

36
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:43,095
- Okay.

37
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:43,928
- Okay.

38
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:54,093
We've got some craziness
happening outside.

39
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,694
Papa and I have been cleaning up.

40
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:57,916
We took down the entire pool fence.

41
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,858
Now we're setting up a huge jumper

42
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,959
that's gonna have a slide
going into the pool.

43
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,414
And we got a cotton candy machine,

44
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,030
we're setting up tables.

45
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,197
Starting to look really good out here.

46
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,774
Ellie is working hard, thank you so much.

47
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:17,607
- Oh, you're welcome.

48
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:19,880
In fact, you're doing
the labor out there, so.

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,715
I don't mind this.

50
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,380
- [Bryan] Ellie is making sugar cookies

51
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,904
and should I get the boys
to grab like a dinosaur

52
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:26,067
to do the foot print?

53
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:26,900
- Yes, yes.

54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,154
That is exactly what I was going to do.

55
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,064
- [Bryan] Awesome.

56
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:31,034
Hey boys I need your help, okay?

57
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:34,020
Can you find a dinosaur
toy with a really cool foot

58
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,565
that we can put in the cookie?

59
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:36,398
- Yeah.

60
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:37,282
- [Bryan] Alright, find one.

61
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,762
- This dino.

62
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:39,595
- [Bryan] That one?

63
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:40,428
Let me see.

64
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:41,950
Oh, those feet are much too big.

65
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,520
Can you find something with smaller feet.

66
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,586
- Yeah.

67
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:45,598
- [Bryan] That one?

68
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,627
Oh man those feet are even bigger.

69
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:50,820
Can we find something smaller?

70
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,019
Whoa, lemme see that one.

71
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,433
Oh, I think those feet are just right.

72
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,181
Okay, give it to Ellie.

73
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,595
- Here, Daddy grab Jackson, and we'll have

74
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,534
Jackson make one too.

75
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,911
Push it hard.

76
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,744
- [Bryan] Whoa!

77
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:05,577
- Perfect!

78
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:07,287
- [Bryan] Hey look, you made
a footprint in the cookie!

79
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,220
- That's cool.

80
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,637
- I wanna eat it.

81
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:13,047
- Let's cook it and then you can eat it.

82
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:13,880
- Okay.

83
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,713
- Do you wanna do one more?

84
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:15,546
- Yeah.

85
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:17,190
- [Bryan] Push its foot into the cookie.

86
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,023
- [Ellie] Push it hard.

87
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:20,273
- [Bryan] Rawr.

88
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:24,505
Alright, he's gonna try
it with the big one.

89
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,449
- Push it really hard.

90
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,282
Perfect.

91
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,326
Whoa look, it got the, there we go,

92
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,243
that will be Jackson's.

93
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,387
- [Bryan] What is on your
nose? Is that a dino nose?

94
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,175
That's adorable.

95
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:44,306
And we are testing out
dry ice in the fountain.

96
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,805
Look at that.

97
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,138
That is so cool.

98
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,721
You guys look like a couple of dinosaurs

99
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,971
ready to party.

100
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:55,311
They both have dino noses on now.

101
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:07,699
- Check this out we've
got balloons filling up.

102
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,836
Balloons everywhere, I even
have a huge balloon out here.

103
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,168
It's a T-Rex, he's very cool.

104
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:17,238
And then we've got balloons all in here.

105
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,771
The party is coming
together and I'm so excited.

106
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:21,105
Everything's looking so good.

107
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:24,855
We are tearing off the
balloon dino eggs now.

108
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,471
- Getting there, oh there we go.

109
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:29,628
- [Missy] Yep. So we're doing that,

110
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:31,782
it's such a cold little job.

111
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:34,769
But here are all the dino eggs and we're.

112
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,645
Yes, my hands are so cold right now.

113
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:39,372
And we've got dino eggs
thanks to Ellie and Jared.

114
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:40,780
They made these last night.

115
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,501
Ellie made these today,
she's been the best.

116
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:44,754
- Well you literally told me how.

117
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:47,314
I was like, I don't wanna
dip my feet in there.

118
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:48,492
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, yes.

119
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:50,812
They look so good, they're so cute.

120
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,800
- They're so easy, you
just take the dino and.

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,181
- Yeah, and then we're
gonna pick up his cake

122
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:59,226
and I've got some fruit and
veggies and chips and dip.

123
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:00,518
And everything's coming together,

124
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:01,772
and the outside looks awesome.

125
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:03,212
And I'm so excited.

126
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,368
Finn just woke up, my mom
just went to go get him.

127
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:09,118
So he'll be out any
minute to join the party.

128
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,468
What are you guys doing?

129
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:24,135
- Finding dino eggs!

130
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:27,539
- [Missy] You guys are finding dino eggs?

131
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,525
- Yeah.

132
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:29,679
- That's so cool.

133
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,514
Yes we've got this little station set up

134
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,420
and we've got tons of paintbrushes.

135
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,303
They can come in here and
find the dinosaur fossils.

136
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:41,065
And they can also find dinosaur eggs.

137
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:42,110
Yes, just like that.

138
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,951
You can kind of brush
around and find dinosaurs.

139
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:46,871
Of course, this is for the birthday party,

140
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,019
you guys are starting a little early,

141
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,248
but I'm okay with that.

142
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:53,252
They've got shovels, and dinosaur eggs.

143
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,917
You guys are gonna have fun, huh?

144
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,390
And the chickens are excited
for the birthday party, too.

145
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,720
You guys are gonna love it.

146
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,348
There's gonna be kids running
around, looking at you,

147
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:03,275
wanting to play with you.

148
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,358
Gonna be fun.

149
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:59,308
- [Bryan] Ollie, are you
eating a dinosaur egg?

150
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:00,141
- Yeah.

151
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:01,060
- [Bryan] And how is it?

152
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,899
- Good.

153
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,022
- [Bryan] Good, what kind of dinosaur egg

154
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:03,858
do you think it is?

155
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,525
- It's a iggysaurus.

156
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:07,927
- [Bryan] A stegosaurus egg?

157
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,760
- Yeah.

158
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,592
- [Bryan] So those are
the yummiest eggs, huh?

159
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:11,759
- A T-Rex egg.

160
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:17,290
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, that one
could be a T-rex egg, huh?

161
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,481
- Look at this giant bouncy house.

162
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:35,102
This is so cool, you guys.

163
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:37,571
It's a giant bounce castle,
and then you can climb

164
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:41,231
up there, and you can go down this slide,

165
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,911
and into the pool.

166
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:44,658
Is that pretty epic?

167
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,431
Are you gonna do it?

168
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,571
Yeah!

169
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:49,628
- I'm just jumping.

170
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:51,387
- You're just jumping?

171
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,637
Hi Liv, hi Pay!

172
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,583
Everything is almost quite ready.

173
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,060
The girls are now in the kitchen getting

174
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,517
last minute stuff done, making guacamole,

175
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,759
which is Missy's favorite.

176
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,136
No pressure, girls.

177
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,439
- I wish you were here two seconds ago.

178
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,024
Missy just taught me how to do this.

179
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:12,857
- [Bryan] Oh really?

180
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:14,774
- Wrong wrong! Correct!

181
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:18,219
- [Bryan] You're so funny.

182
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:21,347
We're Californian we just
know. It's in our blood.

183
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,006
And Missy is cutting up watermelon,

184
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:26,066
attempting a dinosaur watermelon display.

185
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,675
- I don't know what I'm doing, I'm like,

186
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,911
I'm just going for it.

187
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:30,828
- Yeah, go for it babe.

188
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,085
Alright things are getting
crazy here with Jared.

189
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,857
We have this big, huge winged pteranodon.

190
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:46,183
And we are hooking it up to the drone.

191
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:47,498
I got the drone all ready.

192
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:50,114
We're just gonna put
the strings on the legs

193
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,225
and see if this works.

194
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,200
And then fly over all the
kids and freak them out.

195
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,732
- I have good faith that
it will work just fine.

196
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:57,660
- [Bryan] Okay.

197
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,546
- You've got me on your
side, Bryan, come on.

198
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:01,917
- [Bryan] And Jared knows
all about attaching things

199
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,593
to drones, if you guys watch his channel.

200
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:05,671
So he's kinda the pro at this.

201
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,938
- I guess you could say
I am a professional.

202
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:12,105
This is what I do for a living,
attach things to drones.

203
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:19,668
It's flying!

204
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:20,668
It's flying!

205
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:23,767
- Oh my god he did it!

206
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,347
How does it look?

207
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:26,960
- Ollie, what's up there dude?

208
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,877
What it is?

209
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:30,010
- A pteradactyl!

210
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,113
- A pteradactyl up there?

211
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:31,946
- Look!

212
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:37,834
I'm gonna catch it now.

213
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,834
- You're gonna catch it?

214
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,116
- Look, it's a pteradactyl!

215
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:46,949
- What?

216
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:49,140
There's a pteradactyl up there?

217
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,973
Run!

218
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:01,930
- Look who showed up! We
got Chris in the house

219
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,209
and he brought all the kiddos,

220
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:04,874
and they're gonna have so much fun.

221
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:06,210
- I'm gonna have so much fun.

222
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,886
- [Bryan] Did you wear
your dinosaur crocs? No?

223
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:08,903
- I did not.

224
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:10,272
- Sad.

225
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:12,196
Just Parker's wearing dinosaur crocs.

226
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,887
It's the cutest thing.

227
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,855
What up guys?

228
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:15,901
What'd we find?

229
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:16,933
- It's an egg.

230
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,672
- [Bryan] And now you're
gonna crack it open?

231
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:19,797
- I'm gonna try.

232
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:22,036
- [Bryan] Gonna try, yeah.

233
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:24,147
Oh look, you almost got yours.

234
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,475
Got a little dinosaur
coming out of there, huh?

235
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:29,179
If anything, you're
getting dirty, that's fun.

236
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:32,096
So, the bouncy house is
in full effect right now.

237
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,823
Cassie and Ollie are climbing up,

238
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:37,251
and they're gonna go down
the slide, look at this.

239
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,717
I wanna see them come down.

240
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:41,134
Ooh, it's very wet over here.

241
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:42,829
Whoa!

242
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:45,688
Oh!

243
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,555
- That was not the proper way.

244
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:52,472
That was not the proper
way to enter the water.

245
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,170
- [Bryan] Bailey are
you having so much fun?

246
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,978
- More cotton.

247
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:10,107
- [Bryan] You can have all the
cotton candy you want, okay?

248
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:10,988
Hey buddy.

249
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:12,086
Are you having fun, CJ?

250
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:12,919
- Yes.

251
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,432
- [Bryan] Is that the coolest thing ever?

252
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:15,910
- Thank you for getting it!

253
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,428
- You're welcome.

254
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:20,004
You know a party ain't a
party without the Vale family

255
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:21,598
up in this hizzy.

256
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,551
I invited you because I was really hoping

257
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:25,524
that you would play
some pranks on everyone.

258
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:26,357
- Really?

259
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:27,190
- That's gonna be happening, right?

260
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,023
- Absolutely.

261
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:28,856
- Did you bring some pooters?

262
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,394
- I'll--

263
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:32,030
- Did you get Ollie a pooter? Come on.

264
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,038
- I'm gonna come up with something.

265
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,346
- Okay.

266
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:35,530
I was like.

267
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,363
- I have a pooter in the car.

268
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,196
- You do?

269
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,029
Yes!

270
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:42,613
Thanks for coming, guys.

271
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:43,446
- Thanks for having us.

272
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:44,279
- Hey buddy, what?

273
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,112
Did you eat pizza?

274
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:45,945
- Yeah.

275
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:46,778
- [Bryan] Awesome.

276
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:49,410
- Ana eating pizza too.

277
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,243
- Really?

278
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,685
How's the pizza, is it good?

279
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:57,541
This is a huge hit, you guys.

280
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:01,208
The kids are loving
this bouncy house slide.

281
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,772
Oh, look who's here,
thanks for coming guys.

282
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,297
Ready to have some fun?

283
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:10,130
Yeah.

284
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,216
Everyone is having so much fun

285
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,809
and now we are all gathered over here

286
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:16,311
and we're gonna have
a little reptile show.

287
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:19,311
We brought real dinosaurs for Ollie.

288
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:25,406
Do you think Ollie's gonna
put a snake on his shoulders?

289
00:12:25,406 --> 00:12:26,269
- Yeah.

290
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:27,269
- I hope so.

291
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,661
(upbeat music)

292
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:18,571
- Hey Jared, that's one shell of a turtle.

293
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:37,637
This is happening.

294
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:38,723
- That's a good accessory.

295
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:39,556
- Oh god, he's going to your neck,

296
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:41,005
he's to your neck, he's
going to your neck.

297
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:42,457
- Okay, someone grab
him, someone grab him.

298
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:43,964
Someone grab him.

299
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:47,297
My life flashed before my eyes, Jeffrey.

300
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:08,131
(suspenseful music)

301
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,180
- Okay you guys, everyone
keeps talking about

302
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,704
a dinosaur, I completely missed it,

303
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:18,208
because I was inside
putting my swim trunks on.

304
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,598
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

305
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:21,227
I did not see any dinosaur,

306
00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:23,438
but I heard it was out
here causing a ruckus.

307
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:25,690
I'm really sorry about
that crazy dinosaur.

308
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,653
I really apologize.

309
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:29,746
Alright, it's time, it's hot, I'm sweaty.

310
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:31,428
I'm going down this thing, you coming?

311
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:32,877
Jared!

312
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,038
Come with me!

313
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:34,871
Oh yeah!

314
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,604
- Ain't no party like
a bounce house party.

315
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:39,437
- What up!

316
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:43,866
Dude, it looks like you were just born.

317
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,199
You just slid right through.

318
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:50,661
Jeffrey, wait, wait for Jeffrey.

319
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:56,702
Nine pounds 10 ounces,
it's a little baby boy.

320
00:17:56,702 --> 00:18:00,452
- Let's make him breathe,
oh he's crying now.

321
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,967
- Alright, all three of us.

322
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:04,918
Ready?

323
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:05,751
Ready?

324
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:12,729
(upbeat music)

325
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,204
It is now cotton candy time.

326
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:43,399
We got a cotton candy machine,
I started making some.

327
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:46,099
And then a line started to form.

328
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:46,932
I love it.

329
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,118
Now Missy's on duty, let's go see

330
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,700
the madness that she's
living in right now.

331
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,180
Babe! You're doing such a good job!

332
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,316
Look at that, spinning cotton candy.

333
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:57,066
It's also kinda going everywhere.

334
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:58,521
Ollie, let me see, what you eating?

335
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,721
- Cotton candy.

336
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:01,471
- [Bryan] Is it good?

337
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:09,347
(upbeat music)

338
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,277
It's pinata time!

339
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:34,360
And Ollie is going first.

340
00:20:41,348 --> 00:20:43,931
(upbeat music)

341
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:28,919
Hey Ollie, what you got?

342
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,167
- This.

343
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,185
- Binoculars?

344
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:32,018
- Yeah.

345
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:33,037
- [Bryan] What's up there?

346
00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:33,870
- Cake.

347
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,997
- [Bryan] Cake! We're all gonna sing

348
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:36,966
Happy Birthday to you, okay?

349
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:37,974
You wanna see it?

350
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:39,391
Aw, look at that.

351
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:43,486
That is a beautiful cake, huh Ollie?

352
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:49,481
♫ Happy birthday to you

353
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,613
♫ Happy birthday to you

354
00:21:56,746 --> 00:22:00,413
♫ Happy birthday dear Ollie

355

♫ Happy birthday to you

356
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,817
(cheers)

357
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:23,399
- [Bryan] Alright Ollie,
you want the first bite?

358
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:24,232
- Yeah.

359
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:25,128
- [Bryan] Okay, you
can take a little bite,

360
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:26,121
right there, okay?

361
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:26,954
Go ahead.

362
00:22:29,774 --> 00:22:30,607
