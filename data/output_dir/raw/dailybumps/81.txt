1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:02,447
- [All] Good morning.

2
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:05,138
♪ This is our life ♪

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,379
♪ Let's life it ♪

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,074
♪ Live forever ♪

5
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:10,783
- Good morning, boys.

6
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:12,350
Hey, how was your Christmas yesterday?

7
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,349
- [Both] Good.

8
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,354
- So, good?

9
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:15,555
Are you wearing the hat I gave you?

10
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:16,785
I love that hat on you, dude.

11
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:18,791
That's a cool Star Wars hat, huh?

12
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,391
It's actually made out of leather.

13
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:22,465
Good morning, Finn!

14
00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:23,715
So, guess what.

15
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:26,130
I am so proud of both of you.

16
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,736
You both slept in your bed
until 7:30 this morning

17
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:32,098
and did not get up last night.

18
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,295
High five.

19
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:36,497
High fives all around
to everyone involved.

20
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:38,066
You guys did so good.

21
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,840
They are now sleeping
in the same bed, huh?

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,896
- Yeah.
- You guys like

23
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:42,255
sleeping in the same bed
together in your new room?

24
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:43,392
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

25
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:47,981
So, the day after Christmas
is always going to be

26
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,081
a day of organization, cleaning up,

27
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:52,242
and playing with new toys.

28
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:55,617
We're basically trying to do that today.

29
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,978
Some years it can be a little bit harder,

30
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,417
some years it can be a little bit easier,

31
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,762
but I think, this year, the
boys are very preoccupied

32
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,037
by all their super-cool toys.

33
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:05,803
Hey, Finn, let's show
them your tool bench.

34
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:07,133
You set it all up, huh?

35
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,573
Whoa!

36
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:09,906
This is so cool!

37
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:13,198
So, now Finn has all the
tools, just like Papa.

38
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:17,758
He's got a saw and a
hammer, screwdriver, wrench.

39
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:19,561
That's so neat, Finn.

40
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:20,567
- Yeah!

41
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:23,005
- [Bryan] You have a
brace here you can use.

42
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:24,553
This is so neat!

43
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:27,136
(upbeat music)

44
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,767
- So, like Bryan said, we're
doing a ton of cleaning today

45
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,925
and I'm going through
a lot of our presents

46
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,974
and, as you can see
here, I've got a present

47
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:37,251
that my mom and dad got me

48
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:40,229
and it's basically like
a little selfie taker

49
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,774
and it has a ball, but
it's selfie for dogs,

50
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:44,275
so I'm gonna show you guys how it works.

51
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:45,279
Let's see.

52
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,280
Ready?

53
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,113
And, ball!

54
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:49,669
He's actually doing it.

55
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:51,333
He's like, okay, now give me the ball.

56
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,773
No!

57
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:54,469
Oh, wow, he actually got the ball.

58
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:55,897
I didn't know you could
take the ball off of it.

59
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,846
He's like, okay, I did my picture,

60
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:59,063
now I get the ball, right?

61
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,582
Well, at least it comes off

62
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:03,001
and he doesn't just go
running with my phone.

63
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:06,821
We are now testing out
the new Star Wars drone

64
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:09,738
that Bryan got yesterday from Santa

65
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:12,645
and it is pretty cool.

66
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:14,531
We're gonna try and fly it out of here.

67
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:18,568
It's so funny because the
controller talks the whole time.

68
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,069
- Yeah, it has sound effects and stuff.

69
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,387
- [Missy] Which, I think it puts you more

70
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,238
in the Star Wars mode.

71
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:25,107
All right, let's see it take off.

72
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:27,690
(upbeat music)

73
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,319
There it goes.

74
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,580
(upbeat music)

75
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,933
(Missy screaming)

76
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:43,932
- It's pretty cool.

77
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:44,936
- [Missy] Yeah, it's fun.

78
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,797
- [Bryan] It's definitely
easier doing it outside

79
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:47,797
than it is inside.

80
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:49,783
- [Missy] Yeah.

81
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:52,964
That actually looks really cool.

82
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,276
(Missy screaming)

83
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,971
Oh, my gosh.

84
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:57,352
That's so cool.

85
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:58,571
- [Bryan] It does flips and stuff

86
00:02:58,571 --> 00:02:59,445
and you can also shoot.

87
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,026
(drone making laser shooting noises)

88
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:02,599
- [Missy] Oh, my gosh.

89
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,363
- [Bryan] Let's see how fast it goes.

90
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:05,525
(Missy screaming)

91
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:06,531
- [Missy] Oh, my gosh.

92
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:07,557
Oh, my gosh.

93
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:08,562
- And, it just crashed.

94
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:09,992
- [Missy] It went fast.

95
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:11,202
- Yeah, I need to turn that down.

96
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:12,776
- So, this is an indoor one?

97
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,007
- It's an indoor-outdoor one, yeah.

98
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:15,992
- Yeah, I feel like this is more outdoor.

99
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:17,825
Let's see it take off.

100
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,189
(Missy screaming)

101
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:24,919
Okay, let's go.

102
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,502
(upbeat music)

103
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:33,799
(Missy laughing)

104
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,632
Uh oh.

105
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,060
- I just crashed it in that tree.

106
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,285
- [Missy] It's in a tree now.

107
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,135
Karma, you're gonna have to go get it.

108
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,475
- Isn't this what day two
of Christmas is all about?

109
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,709
- [Missy] Yeah, playing with
your toys and breaking them.

110
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,216
(Missy laughing)

111
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:49,925
He's gotta climb it to get it.

112
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:50,758
Oh, god!

113
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:53,370
(Missy laughing)

114
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,694
You got it, you got it.

115
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:55,527
- Slippers.

116
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,414
- [Missy] Oh, my gosh.

117
00:03:57,414 --> 00:03:58,497
There you go.

118
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:02,220
- There she is.
- Saved it.

119
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,370
- A little banged up, but--
- It's all good.

120
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,139
My dad is down there right
now because he is setting up

121
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,414
the zip line that Santa got
the boys and I am so excited.

122
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:13,643
I hope it's done soon.

123
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:14,875
It looks really fun.

124
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,872
It's really, really long, too.

125
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,759
Bryan is flying the drone

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,039
down to my dad, down the hill.

127
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:24,442
Karma is legit going to eat that thing.

128
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:27,131
Look at what my dad's doing!

129
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,203
- You want to try it, don't you?

130
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:29,562
- [Missy] I know, I wanna try it,

131
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:30,811
but we probably can't, huh?

132
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:31,644
- I don't know.

133
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:33,733
I mean, that's a sturdy tree.

134
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,098
That's a pretty sturdy tree.

135
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:37,622
- Yeah, my dad is
setting up this zip line.

136
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,697
- I know it will work for the kids.

137
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,430
- Yeah, I'm sure we'll
just do it for the kids.

138
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,517
It looks so fun.

139
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,136
I think if I got on this it
would literally just sink.

140
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,109
- [Jim] I don't know.

141
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:48,308
I can tighten it more.

142
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:49,141
- [Missy] Yeah?

143
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:50,741
- Just tighten this.
- Oh, really.

144
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,861
- It depends on what the trees can take.

145
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:57,253
- All right, the boys are so
excited to try the zip line

146
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,724
that they got for Christmas.

147
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:00,099
We got it all set up.

148
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,988
Remember when you did
this, Ollie, in Florida?

149
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:02,988
- Yeah.

150
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:04,323
- [Bryan] And, what did you zip line over?

151
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:05,378
- The pool!

152
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:06,739
- [Bryan] Yeah, remember the alligators?

153
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,073
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that was so fun.

154
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:11,428
- I did it so cool.

155
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:12,847
- You did do it so cool.

156
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,714
This one is not as crazy as that one.

157
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:19,253
This one is kind of more
like a swing in our backyard,

158
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,544
so it's a little more tamer,

159
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:21,844
but it should still be fun

160
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:23,342
and it's cool that it's
out here in the backyard.

161
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:25,235
Check out this set up we got.

162
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,858
We even have a little hay
bale here to help him get up.

163
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:28,857
- You ready, dude?

164
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:29,855
- Yeah.

165
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:30,947
- [Bryan] Thank you papa for setting up

166
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,246
our backyard zip line.

167
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:33,635
This is so cool.

168
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:34,637
Do you wanna try it, Ollie?

169
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:35,637
- Yeah.

170
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:36,636
- [Bryan] Okay, so here are the rules.

171
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,638
You can only do this with
parents present, okay?

172
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:41,508
We have to be here with you.

173
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,811
You have to hang on to
those handles and not let go

174
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,700
and you have to stay
still on the seat, okay?

175
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,326
- Okay.

176
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:48,838
- [Bryan] Nice!

177
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:51,702
(upbeat music)

178
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:53,557
Grab him, babe.

179
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:54,581
That was awesome!

180
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,288
That was perfect!

181
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,134
What did you think, Ollie?

182
00:05:58,134 --> 00:05:59,133
- Good.

183
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,468
- That went so good.

184
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,057
He was not high off the ground at all.

185
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:05,251
He didn't go super fast,
so it wasn't too crazy,

186
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:08,292
and then they can just drag it up.

187
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:09,168
Is there anybody that wants to go?

188
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,001
- Me!
- Me!

189
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:10,834
- Who wants to go next?

190
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:11,884
- Me!
- Me!

191
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:14,091
- You already went, so who else?

192
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:15,222
Who wants to go next?
- Me!

193
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:16,452
- Okay.

194
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:17,602
- All right, hang on tight!

195
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:18,607
Reach up!

196
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:19,608
You ready, Finn?

197
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:22,191
(upbeat music)

198
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:25,109
Look at you go, dude!

199
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:27,692
(upbeat music)

200
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,791
Nice!

201
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,242
See, that's kinda cool 'cuz
you can even hold on to it,

202
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:34,099
so it doesn't get too crazy fast either,

203
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,908
'cuz Finn's light, so he could be flying.

204
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:39,246
(upbeat music)

205
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:40,248
Look at Finn.

206
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:42,221
He's like, my turn!

207
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:43,221
I need it!

208
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,437
(Bryan laughing)

209
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,020
(upbeat music)

210
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:50,145
Woo!

211
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,925
Jim, that could not be more perfect.

212
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:55,508
(upbeat music)

213
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:08,133
The boys are having such a blast.

214
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:10,420
I will say, if this is something you kids

215
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,206
want to do at home, definitely
have a parent present,

216
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,214
make sure you're following

217
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,004
all the proper safety precautions.

218
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:18,020
Finn, is this your favorite thing ever?

219
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,520
- Yes.
- Okay.

220
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,353
Go!

221
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,592
Woo!

222
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,569
- Yay!

223
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:26,568
- [Bryan] Was that fun, Finn?

224
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:27,401
- Yeah.

225
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:28,234
(Bryan and Missy laughing)

226
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:30,817
(upbeat music)

227
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,216
(cheering and laughing)

228
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:46,562
- [Bryan] He loves this so much.

229
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,811
- I know, it's so cute.
- This is like

230
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:49,962
the stuff our kids love.

231
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:53,178
Our boys just like to
get dirty and go fast.

232
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,513
- I had a zip line when I was little.

233
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:58,245
- Yeah?
- One my dad rigged up

234
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,331
and I think I burned
my hands a couple times

235
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:04,151
'cuz all we had was a
branch that went down

236
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,307
on a rope.
- Oh, geeze.

237
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:07,949
This is 2017, okay?

238
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,546
We're doing things right.

239
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,645
- This is a little safer, probably.

240
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:12,646
- Hit it!

241
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:15,229
(upbeat music)

242
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,458
(Missy cheering)

243
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,041
(upbeat music)

244
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,640
- [Bryan] Finn, you're
supposed to sit on it.

245
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,044
He's a zip line thief.

246
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,043
Take it back up.

247
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:48,931
He just likes pulling it on the cable.

248
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:50,176
- Go.

249
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,535
Give it to Ollie, now.

250
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:52,604
- [Bryan] Go on, buddy.

251
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:55,187
(upbeat music)

252
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,501
- I'm taking it up so I can ride,

253
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,814
but I think I'm gonna hit the bottom.

254
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,301
The kids get pretty low.

255
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:09,485
Go.

256
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,133
- [Bryan] Feet up.

257
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,910
(Bryan laughing)

258
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,991
- I got like five feet.

259
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:16,462
- [Bryan] I think this is a kids' toy.

260
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:19,645
- Well, if dad had it really
high, it'd be fun for us,

261
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,609
but then it would be
too high for the kids.

262
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,304
- Yeah, then it's too high for the kids.

263
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:24,404
It's be six feet in the air.

264
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:25,273
- [Missy] Yeah.

265
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,273
- [Ollie] My turn!

266
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,686
- All right, your turn.

267
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:30,472
- [Bryan] Mommy's trying
to steal your toy.

268
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,116
Did you see her go, Ollie?

269
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,447
- Yeah.
- It was funny.

270
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,030
(upbeat music)

271
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,897
- Look, I see the moon!

272
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:48,423
- [Bryan] That is right, Ollie.

273
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,628
That is the moon.

274
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:50,633
How crazy?

275
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,706
Look at the sky.

276
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:53,401
- That's where Santa Claus lives.

277
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,686
- [Bryan] That's where Santa lives?

278
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:55,689
- Yeah.

279
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,535
- [Bryan] I think Santa lives
at the North Pole though.

280
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,702
- Yeah, inside of the moon

281
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,621
there's the North Pole.

282
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:07,101
- That sounds like
something kids just know

283
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:09,133
and parents in the movies are like,

284
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,022
no, that's not a thing,

285
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:12,825
and then they cut to the next scene

286
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:14,845
and it's like North Pole on the moon.

287
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:16,095
That's so cute.

288
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,342
- Go, Jedi!

289
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:20,828
Go, Jedi!

290
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,833
- [Bryan] It's taking off.

291
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,833
- [Missy] It's off again.

292
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,903
Are you watching dad?

293
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:24,736
- [Bryan] Gotta put my lights on.

294
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:26,097
It's dark out here.

295
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:27,757
- [Missy] Oh, look at that.

296
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,033
Oh, that's so cute.

297
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,003
Ollie, does it look like a real spaceship?

298
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:35,536
- Yeah, but it does a really cool trick.

299
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,720
- [Bryan] You wanna see the cool trick?

300
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,738
- [Ollie] Yeah, trick.

301
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,656
- [Bryan] Three, two, one.

302
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:42,816
(Missy screaming)

303
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:43,983
- [Missy] Woo!

304
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,155
- [Ollie] Is that cool?

305
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,216
- [Missy] That is so cool.

306
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:48,655
- [Bryan] Wanna see it again?

307
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:52,147
There it goes.
(Missy cheering)

308
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:53,843
- [Missy] It's so cool
that this makes sounds.

309
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:56,829
- I know.
(Star Wars sound effects)

310
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:58,034
I wish we had the other drones here,

311
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,441
so they could battle.
- I know.

312
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,775
- I think when you hit the
other drones, like, actually,

313
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:04,246
it falls a little bit
- Oh, wow.

314
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,066
- And reacts.
- That's so cool.

315
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,322
All right, boys, it's cold.

316
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:09,239
Get inside.

317
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:12,270
Get inside.

318
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,103
Hurry.

319
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:16,251
Here it comes, boys.

320
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,084
Are you ready?

321
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:18,251
- [Boys] Yeah.

322
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,312
- [Missy] It made it.

323
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,931
You're home.

324
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,264
Good trip, guys.

325
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:30,856
- [Remote] My the force be with you.

326
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:33,644
X-wing, engaged.

327
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:35,866
Ready for take off.

328
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,306
Timing mode, activated.

329
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,306
Systems check, complete.

330
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,449
(Star Wars music and sound effects)

331
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:20,922
(character screaming)
(Finn laughing)

332
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:26,216
(Star Wars music and sound effects)

333
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,112
- [Bryan] Aw.

334
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,911
- We played all day again today.

335
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:20,257
The boys even stayed in their jammies.

336
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,509
We just changed their jammies

337
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,402
so that they had some
fresh jammies for bed.

338
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:25,633
We had a really fun day, huh?

339
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:26,642
- Yeah.

340
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:30,114
- Just playing with all our
toys and just hanging out.

341
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:32,274
We actually organized and cleaned a ton,

342
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:33,278
so that was really nice,

343
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,930
but now, I'm putting the boys to bed.

344
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,091
I gotta say that putting these boys

345
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:40,642
in a bunk bed and in the same bed together

346
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:43,138
has gone very, very smoothly

347
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:45,474
and I'm just so excited.

348
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,761
I feel like they're
excited to sleep together

349
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,095
and hang out together
and it's just been going

350
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,100
really, really good.

351
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,053
We had a couple first
somewhat rough nights

352
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:55,475
where I might have had to stay in there

353
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:58,082
a little bit longer, come in
in the middle of the night

354
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:00,034
to let them know that everything's okay,

355
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:02,240
but the past few nights have been so nice.

356
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,600
It is now bedtime.

357
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,393
We're going to climb into your
comfy, little cabin up there.

358
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:09,587
Let me know, when do you guys stop reading

359
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,334
the Christmas books
because I still kinda want

360
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:13,507
to read Christmas books just at least

361
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:15,506
for a little bit longer,

362
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:16,960
but I know we gotta put
them away at some point

363
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,427
because we can't be reading
Christmas books all year round

364
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:22,226
otherwise it probably won't be as special

365
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:23,410
around Christmas time.

366
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,695
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

367
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:26,023
We had a blast.

368
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:29,448
Make sure you give it a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it

369
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,061
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

370
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,060
What do you say?

371
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,064
- Bye!

372
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:34,066
- Bye!

373
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:35,636
Boo bah!

374
00:14:35,636 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
