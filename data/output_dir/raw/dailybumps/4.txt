wants to have some
lunch with you too, huh!

00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,391

- [Missy] Good morning miss chicken!

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,050
And good morning, boys!

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,540
- Good morning!

16
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,310
- It's actually lunchtime, huh?

17
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,210
You guys are eating your
lunch on top of the hay,

18
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,550
isn't that cool?

19
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,500
They asked to come up to the barn with me.

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,820
They wanted to bring lunch,
so I brought them lunch

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,530
and set them up on my pad actually,

22
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,440
and you guys are eating lunch, huh?

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,240
And I am actually up at the barn because

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,400
Nacho has his doctor's appointment today

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,880
that I'm hoping goes good.

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,280
I was actually thinking about
putting them up on this hay.

27
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,210
Looks like the chicken wants

28
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,060
to have some lunch with you too, huh?

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,220
She's like, just give 'em to me!

30
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,050
You know chickens are nice!

31
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,150
Well, I guess the kids aren't a super fan

32
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,040
of you trying to take their food,

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,110
so I'm just going to bring you over here.

34
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,420
And Nacho, how you doing, bud, hi!

35
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,060
Alright, they've moved from lunch

36
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,870
to all the way to the top of the hay bale!

37
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,070
Wait, they can't even see
you because it's so dark.

38
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,580
Oh my goodness, you're high
up there, are you scared?

39
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,290
You got Felicia to help you, right?

40
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,201
Finn got scared, he had to get down.

41
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,200
- [Felicia] Finn, do wanna come up?

42
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,320
- Finn, do you wanna go up?

43
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,550
He's like no, that's scary!

44
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,650
Alright, I've got Nacho all saddled again.

45
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,540
I'm going to give him a try
again, see how he's doing.

46
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,250
Vet should be here soon, he
did say he had an emergency

47
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,760
so I'm hoping that emergency
doesn't take too much longer.

48
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,580
We're just going to see how you're doing,

49
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,440
vet will be here soon!

50
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,970
I think he's actually doing pretty good,

51
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,740
he seems in a much better mood today

52
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,470
than he has been in the past couple days.

53
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,067
He seems pretty relaxed and happy.

54
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,650
(upbeat music)

55
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,020
Alright, vet is here now
and it's like we said,

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,120
definitely off on the
foot that we thought,

57
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,260
but definitely not an abscess, he says.

58
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,100
So they're doing this
thing called blocking.

59
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,200
They're basically sticking
him with, like, this needle

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,680
and they're, like, cutting off
the nerve and if he's better

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,400
then they know that the
problem is in that area

62
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
but then if they go higher
and it's still not better

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,580
then they just keep going higher until

64
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,440
they figure out it's between this area.

65
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,273
It's really weird.

66
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:50,620
So they just stuck him
with his first needle

67
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,453
and they're walking him around,

68
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:54,020
and then we're gonna trot
him and see if he's still off

69
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,660
and if he isn't then
we know the issue is in

70
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,820
this like, bottom area of his foot.

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,870
But if it's not we gotta keep going higher

72
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,800
to see where it could be.

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,090
Your doctor visit's over, yay!

74
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,160
So they only had to do one block,

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,360
and so they discovered that
the part that's bothering him

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,100
is definitely in the lower
part of his foot and heel.

77
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,170
So he says not an abscess though,

78
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,940
that part of his hoof is growing

79
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,510
just a little bit faster
than the other side

80
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,470
and in, like, a different way.

81
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,490
So he says just tomorrow,
actually, the fair is coming

82
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,330
pop some front shoes on him and hopefully

83
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,430
he will be looking better pretty quickly

84
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,000
and I can even trail ride
him, like, right away!

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,960
So I'm so excited!

86
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,010
And he had, like, a bump
here which I think was just

87
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,320
maybe just like, maybe an
uncomfortable part of the saddle.

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,310
I'll have to see how the
saddle is fitting him.

89
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,250
And then the hives, he
just said he probably

90
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,960
rubbed up on something, or ate something,

91
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,520
or maybe even all the stuff that we've

92
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,220
been putting on his
foot, he could've gotten

93
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,200
an allergic reaction to.

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,300
So he thinks it'll go away pretty soon,

95
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,010
and then it's probably
not even bothering him,

96
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,610
it's more bothering me than him.

97
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,370
Which is true, he doesn't, like, itch it

98
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,810
or, like, have any issues with it, huh.

99
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,210
He's like, why are you always
talking to that camera?

100
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,090
So yeah, honestly, best news!

101
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,358
I was thinking abscess and
then he was going to say yeah,

102
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:05,970
you're going to have to wait a long time

103
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,670
until it comes out or something!

104
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm so happy!

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,663
Alright, let's put you away,
you've had a fun day, huh?

106
00:04:12,663 --> 00:04:14,163
(upbeat music)

107
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:15,204
- [Oliver] Where's your bellybutton?

108
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:18,866
Where's your bellybutton,
where's your bellybutton?

109
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,026
(babbles)

110
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,153
Where's your bellybutton?

111
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,481
Where's your bellybutton,
where's your bellybutton?

112
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,231
- Where's your bellybutton, Finn?

113
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:30,530
That's just a dirty thing!

114
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,080
Where's your bellybutton, Finn?

115
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,640
(blowing raspberry)

116
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,590
(laughing)

117
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,760
You guys are so cute!

118
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,360
They've just been playing here

119
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,010
for like, the past fifteen minutes,

120
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,920
like laughing hysterically
and like chasing each other,

121
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,530
and like blowing
raspberries on each other.

122
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,590
It is so cute!

123
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,550
But I am home now and I am just
so relieved about my horse!

124
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,750
I'm so so excited.

125
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm really looking forward
to his appointment tomorrow.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,266
Now it's time to just relax
with the family and hang out.

127
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,810
And I think we're gonna go
out, does that sound fun?

128
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,650
Whoa, what's going everywhere?

129
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,448
Are those your gems from Valentine's Day?

130
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:05,620
- [Oliver] Yeah!

131
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,146
- [Missy] Ollie, what
is that on your head?

132
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:09,390
- Um, hair!

133
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,430
- [Missy] What are you?

134
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,900
- Um, I'm a girl!

135
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,410
- [Missy] You're a girl?

136
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,630
You called yourself what
though, what superhero?

137
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,463
- Aquaman.

138
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:19,450
- You're like Aquaman, that's so cute!

139
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,540
Yeah, I took my hair out, and
he's like, I wanna wear it!

140
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,880
Should we try Finn?

141
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,166
Finn, you wanna try?

142
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,879
(upbeat music)

143
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,379
- [Oliver] You're funny, Finn!

144
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,959
- Oh, Finn looks like a girl now!

145
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,138
(screams)

146
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:38,154
(laughs) Are you Momma?

147
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,920
(mumbles)

148
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,620
Oh, you got long hair?

149
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,930
It actually looks so funny from the back.

150
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,479
Like what if this was like...

151
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,959
(screams)

152
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,136
Alright, alright, I'll
take it, I'll take it.

153
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:53,080
Alright, I am now with my Aunt Christy

154
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,780
and I've got Liv and Pay in the back.

155
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,340
Boys are with my parents and
I thought I would include

156
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,050
this footage in the vlog
because today is the day

157
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,170
Nacho's getting his shoes
on and I'm really hoping

158
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,210
that this just fixes him all
up and he's feeling good.

159
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,350
So I thought it would be fun
to just vlog a little bit of it

160
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,580
and see how it all goes.

161
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,210
I don't know if he's ever
had shoes on, honestly.

162
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,040
I think they've always said he hasn't.

163
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,739
So it'll be interesting to see.

164
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:19,322
(upbeat music)

165
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:31,170
Alright, how's it feeling?

166
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,370
You got brand new shoes!

167
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:36,560
I hope that makes you happy.

168
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,010
Hopefully he's not
like, what's on my feet?

169
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
What do you think of those?

170
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,770
Huh, what do you think of that?

171
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:49,764
- [Woman] I got new wheels!

172
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:52,870
- Yeah, let's take 'em for a spin, Nacho!

173
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,910
Alright, Nacho's feet are done!

174
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,010
Looks so good.

175
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,020
He's obviously just gonna rest for the day

176
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,460
and we'll see how he's doing
in the next couple days.

177
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,420
Everyone seems very sure that he should

178
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,290
be good to go now and all done!

179
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,636
I think I'm kinda dirty from the barn.

180
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,800
But yeah, I'm so happy!

181
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,610
I'm excited to have my horse back

182
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,570
and hopefully everything is good to go.

183
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,790
He really needs a bath
too, I think I might

184
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,850
do a bath soon, and a trail ride!

185
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,273
I don't know, I'm excited.

186
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:23,360
Alright it is time for
bed for these beddy boys!

187
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,620
Are you guys tired?

188
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,453
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

189
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:27,100
- Did you have a fun day today?

190
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,933
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

191
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,900
I am so glad Nacho's looking a lot better.

192
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,515
You guys excited to ride Nacho again soon?

193
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:34,348
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

194
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:36,150
- Yeah, I'm super excited!

195
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,260
We are going to end the
night with some stories.

196
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,380
We're going to read a couple books

197
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,940
that we haven't read in a while.

198
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,230
We're going to go ahead
and end this video,

199
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,160
we had such a fun day.

200
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,670
Give this video a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it.

201
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,550
Say thumbs up!

202
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,520
- Look at that robot, guys!

203
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,540
- Aw, look at that robot!

204
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,090
Can you thumbs up?

205
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,290
Okay, I'm gonna see you guys tomorrow!

206
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,153
What do you say?

207
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:58,662
- Bye!
- Bye!

208
00:07:58,662 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
