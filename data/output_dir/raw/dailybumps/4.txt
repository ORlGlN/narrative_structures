1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:03,011
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,720
- Good morning guys, I have been talking

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,210
a little special project
that I've been working on

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,744
and I finally get to
reveal to you what it is.

5
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:24,327
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,470
- I am at my barn right now
that I board my horse at,

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,240
Nacho, he's right over there

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,610
and I gotta tell you that this has been

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,930
one of the most amazing experiences.

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,380
Horses have always been
part of my childhood

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,300
and a part of like my blood

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,600
and for Bryan to be
able to kinda like say,

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,370
like go for it, this is
your dream, let's do it,

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,080
was amazing, but the next step

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,550
was finding a barn that
I could fit in with

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,610
and finding someone who can
make this a good experience,

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,300
because it can be hard
to find the right people

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,040
to work with when you are doing something

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,270
that means so much to you.

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,770
Bryan found me the most amazing barn

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,980
and the most amazing person to help me,

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,860
as you guys know her name is Maria,

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,900
and she has literally
made my dreams come true,

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,810
she has made this experience so amazing

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,870
and she has thought me so much.

26
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,850
So this is actually Asher,
this is Maria's baby,

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,140
she has got a couple of them

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,120
and he is such a sweet little horse.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,380
Maria just, she cares
for her animals so much,

30
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,470
and not just hers, she
cares for all animals,

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,610
and all her animals here,

32
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,160
she constantly says it's
just all about the horses.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,260
So she has such a cool property here

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,540
and she always has like little projects

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,930
that she wants to get done,

36
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,010
and they usually involve
something to do with the animals,

37
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,130
whether how can she make the,
taking care of them easier,

38
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,040
or their life easier and better,

39
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,880
but there's one thing
that she wants to do,

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,850
but I don't know if she'll
ever really have the time to do

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,180
and it's for her, it's
not really for the animals

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,180
and that is this room right in her barn.

43
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,640
She actually used this room for her pig

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,140
that she got on Christmas,
who's the cutest thing, Wally,

45
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,500
and it was so cold and she
really had nowhere to put him in,

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,150
that she kind of put him in here,

47
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,610
it's a mess now guys, I'm gonna be honest.

48
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,920
She's like it's a mess and such a bummer,

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,120
but he now has a nice,
warm, cozy place to be

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,610
and now I'm thinking why don't we

51
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,600
make a really special
little heaven for her

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,740
that she can just come in,
relax, hang out with her horses.

53
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,130
It's actually a really, really fun room,

54
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,290
it's got a lot of space,
so that's why I thought

55
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,740
it would be so cool if I came in here

56
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,380
and just ripped out everything
and redid it all for her.

57
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,380
So they actually just left
for a trip for one week.

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,970
I got one week guys,

59
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,760
and they are off to a beautiful
Cabo to go relax in the sun.

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,010
They left and I was like,
okay let's get in there

61
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,120
and let's start ripping stuff up.

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,100
So today we're here and we're
basically just gonna start

63
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,800
cleaning up, ripping all these floors out

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,950
and just starting, starting fresh.

65
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,120
So we're going to try and use
as much as we can in here,

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,330
but her daughter was actually
telling me about this table,

67
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,387
I guess her neighbor
custom made this for her,

68
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:16,420
so I definitely wanna
incorporate this somehow,

69
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,350
maybe just kind of
refinish it a little bit,

70
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,660
or even just like clean it up,
maybe add some new hardware

71
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,870
and then we'll definitely
keep like cabinets,

72
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,610
and you know just switch out
a few things here and there,

73
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,920
but we definitely have to start fresh

74
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,075
and we gotta get going because
we are on a time crunch.

75
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:33,658
(upbeat music)

76
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,250
So this is Wally right here,
she got him on Christmas.

77
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,750
So he's the cutest thing,

78
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,810
but he is the one who destroyed that room

79
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,710
and that is where we're
going to fix up and make look

80
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,220
so cute since he's got a
nice place to sleep now.

81
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,620
- [Bryan] Still going Wally?

82
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,160
- I think he was in there a
long time because he was cold.

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,923
- Yeah, but you know how
when you wake you just go?

84
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,280
He's still going,

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,410
okay can someone do a
Google search real quick?

86
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,633
How long do pigs pee on average?

87
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,493
Are you proud of yourself?

88
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,291
(upbeat music)

89
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:50,730
- So I am cleaning the
walls before we paint them

90
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,180
just 'cause there's a lot
of dirt on them and dust.

91
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,170
So in order to cover as
much wall as possible

92
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,070
I am using a Swiffer, it's all wet,

93
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,770
it's actually working pretty good.

94
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:02,280
(upbeat music)

95
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,200
So the scent in this room is so strong,

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,830
I actually feel like the ammonia

97
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,050
is starting to get to
my head or something,

98
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,920
but that's what I'm
saying, like this place

99
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,250
is not going to be just
like a treat for the eyes,

100
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,460
it's going to be a treat for the nose,

101
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,960
because we are going to make
this place smell so good.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,820
And I have to say that I'm so
thankful to my dad especially

103
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,720
'cause he's definitely helping
make this really happen,

104
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,260
but even all my other like,

105
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,950
I have friends that are
gonna be helping me,

106
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,600
I had Brooke help me stuff pick stuff out

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,020
and I think she's even coming
up here later to help clean

108
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,770
and help me like decorate and paint

109
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,580
and even Bryan for letting
me do my crazy ideas

110
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,400
and he's just like okay, if
that's what you wanna do.

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
These kind of things just make me so happy

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,510
and just so thankful, even
to my brother, who's helping.

113
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,880
So many people are gonna help me

114
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,280
and we're gonna get this done so quickly.

115
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,530
So what do you think of
this crazy idea that I have?

116
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,970
- Well, it's not unlike a
lot of your crazy ideas.

117
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,490
Missy is one of those people
who's just always thinking

118
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,090
of something that she
can do for someone else.

119
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,810
It's gonna be super
unexpected, Maria's gonna.

120
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,750
- She has no idea.

121
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,583
- Be super surprised.

122
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,254
- She actually has recently talked to me.

123
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:16,040
She's like, I just really
should get that room done.

124
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,245
I was like, yeah, no, don't do it.

125
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,507
(both laugh out loud)

126
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:22,090
(upbeat music)

127
00:06:48,636 --> 00:06:50,171
- [Missy] Finn, are you
getting ready to paint?

128
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:51,004
- Yeah.

129
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:53,310
- Yeah, all right guys, it
is almost painting time,

130
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,510
look at this, we've got everything out,

131
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,560
we're taking down the blinds.

132
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,880
We were gonna keep the blinds,

133
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,320
but they are just a little too dirty

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,020
and those ones are just like trash.

135
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,090
And I was like well, I'm
getting rid of those ones,

136
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,847
maybe I'll just fix these ones.

137
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:07,343
We are gonna start painting now, ha?

138
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:15,121
And that's why we don't
have the real flooring now.

139
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,330
So make sure you dip it and then kind of.

140
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,250
- [Finn] No!

141
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,143
- [Missy] You don't want
it to drip too much.

142
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh, good job bud, Olli, you are here now!

143
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,605
Are you gonna help us paint?

144
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:27,438
- Yeah.

145
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:28,890
- [Missy] And you just did an O?

146
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,827
- [Olli] Yeah.

147
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:33,023
- The boys are being so helpful.

148
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,380
(upbeat music)

149
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,100
Oh my gosh, we just got
rid of all of the yellow,

150
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,950
all there is now is just a fresh
coat of prime on the walls.

151
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,040
It has just totally brightened

152
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,970
and like made this room
look so much bigger

153
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,920
and there is no bad smell, so
yeah, we got the smell out.

154
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,020
My brother's working on
putting a new knob here.

155
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,280
My dad is working on
putting the new fan in.

156
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,310
We are staying on schedule,

157
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,180
my plan was today to be done with painting

158
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,405
and then we will start
the flooring, woo-hoo!

159
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:08,238
We are getting it done.

160
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,380
I'm actually also doing quite
a few projects for the room

161
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,360
and some of them are like
a little bit personal.

162
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,500
And one is, I'm gonna be
taking some professional photos

163
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,735
with her horses and that is Brooke.

164
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:19,568
- Hello.

165
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:21,913
- [Missy] She's taking the
photos and we're trying,

166
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,640
we've got Rusty, he's
totally standing next to hay,

167
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,852
so what do you expect?

168
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:28,570
- He wants this stuff,
he has been working hard.

169
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,220
- This is what we're
doing, mom's gonna help,

170
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,083
she's gonna film.

171
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,506
(soft music)

172
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,840
okay, we just finished, Rusty was so hard,

173
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,130
I thought he was gonna be like easy,

174
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,958
I thought he was just gonna stand there

175
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,326
and just whatever, he was like, no.

176
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,550
But look at these, we got some cute ones.

177
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,300
Look at that, Brooke is so nice,

178
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,100
she's gonna like take these and edit them

179
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,590
and we're gonna print them fast.

180
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,690
Oh my gosh, she's gonna love looking

181
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,170
at pictures of you guys
in her little room.

182
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,269
Well thank you Brooke.

183
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,775
- You are welcome, this is so fun.

184
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,970
- I know.

185
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,970
We are now starting flooring,
oh my gosh this is so cool dad

186
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,080
and it's so awesome, Brooke
is now helping me clean it

187
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,710
and get it all ready and
then even Shaun, her husband,

188
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,651
was helping my dad, so
thank you Shaun and Brooke,

189
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:18,650
it is so nice of you.

190
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,680
Things are moving along
now, Kelsey's here!

191
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,050
- Hey!

192
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,550
- And she actually just got
done staining all these crates.

193
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,500
And we're making a little TV stand

194
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,530
that the TV won't necessarily
be standing on it,

195
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,050
and yeah, these were just like pine

196
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,150
and now she's like staining
them like this dark brown

197
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,013
and I think it looks so cute.

198
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:36,596
(upbeat music)

199
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:57,597
Olli, are you out here playing?

200
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,430
- Yeah.

201
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,670
- Um yeah, the boys are out here playing,

202
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,500
I just found Finn, he's
like a wild kid right now.

203
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,180
Put your shirt back on!

204
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,640
It is freezing out here guys,

205
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,380
like I'm wearing like a little jacket

206
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,940
and he has his arm out of his shirt.

207
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,310
I think he's just really
feeling the wild life.

208
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,940
Finn what are you doing?

209
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,480
Your cheeks are even red.

210
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,370
- He's just running around
this field with a wild goat?

211
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,520
- [Missy] I know.

212
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,850
- Grazing in the background.

213
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,450
- All right guys, the
room in the barn is done.

214
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,640
I spent about three days finishing it up

215
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,620
and it is so cute, I
love everything about it,

216
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,940
I love all the little details,

217
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,050
and I'll show you all,
everything about it in a minute,

218
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,370
but I actually went off on a trip

219
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,650
and I got back the same
day that Maria got back,

220
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,750
she ended up actually going
in and seeing the room,

221
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,740
which I'm really excited about,

222
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,310
I feel like it happened in a
real fun, natural way for her.

223
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,640
Her husband was so nice
enough to actually film the,

224
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,600
like her seeing the room,

225
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
which I'm really excited about to see,

226
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,490
but I'm gonna go ahead
and include it right here

227
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,393
so you guys can watch it.

228
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:00,384
- I just go, I just caught a glimpse.

229
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,646
(all chuckle)

230
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:03,723
- [Cameraman] Just go in, go in!

231
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:04,556
- Oh,

232
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:10,456
I don't even wanna walk, what?

233
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,946
Is this even my barn?

234
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:15,085
(all chuckle)

235
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:18,973
Oh my goodness, this is crazy.

236
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,613
What have you guys done?

237
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:25,961
- [Felicia] Not us.

238
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,373
- [Cameraman] Oh my god.

239
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:28,623
- Oh, how cute.

240
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:34,574
Missy and Bryan, you guys are, oh my god.

241
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,730
- [Felicia] Oh mom, there's a card.

242
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,962
- [Cameraman] There's card
here, look at the wine bottle.

243
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:42,364
- [Felicia] Oh, you've
always wanted one of those.

244
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:44,187
This is better than my room.

245
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:46,223
- Right, I'm just gonna move here.

246
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:49,656
Thank you, I love you.

247
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,873
- Oh, she's almost crying.

248
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:55,073
And remember, you wanted
to, you wanted to do that?

249
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:56,586
- Oh it's showing Rusty!

250
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:58,468
- You didn't notice that?

251
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,158
(chuckles)

252
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:03,806
- Ah, he's so handsome.

253
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm so excited, thank you.

254
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,520
- So I'm now headed up to go see Maria

255
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,750
and show her all the
little things about it

256
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,930
that she may not have seen,

257
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,643
and I'm just so excited to see it all

258
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:17,910
and I'm excited to be home so
I can enjoy the room as well.

259
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,640
It's gonna be so fun and so
far she has been messaging me

260
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,270
and she loves it, so I
can't wait to see her

261
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,518
and talk about it all with her.

262
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,935
(soft music)

263
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,660
I'm here with Maria and it has been so fun

264
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,830
showing her all the little details.

265
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,585
- Amazing, I'm so grateful
and thankful and excited

266
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:27,650
and I can't wait to spend some
time in here with you guys.

267
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,590
- I know, we're gonna have some drinks

268
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,220
and hang out with our horses

269
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,210
and Felicia's hiding,
she refuses to come out,

270
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,600
but I am excited that you
get to hang out here too,

271
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,080
because she's always up
in her and doing homework

272
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,550
and now she can do homework down here.

273
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,700
- She already did
homework down here today.

274
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,810
- This was like so much fun to do,

275
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,130
and I'm so thankful to my dad,

276
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,500
I know I like thanked
him a couple of times,

277
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,900
but I like could not
have done it without him,

278
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,740
and for Brooke, Brooke
helped me do tons of,

279
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,720
like the decorating and
of course the photos.

280
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,460
We were here one night till like 2AM,

281
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,960
just like oh let's put this here,

282
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,620
I mean this right here,
I mean you would be,

283
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,680
you'd be like why are you guys
spending an hour doing this?

284
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,460
But like, oh that's too
tall and that's too little,

285
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,100
but we had so much fun and
I'm so glad they love it,

286
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,130
I love it too.

287
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,003
- We love it!

288
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,490
- And I'm just, again I'm
so thankful for Maria,

289
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,210
like she has done so much for me, yes,

290
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,270
yes she has, she just made it so fun,

291
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,050
and I just, I literally feel like I found

292
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,760
like a little horse family with them

293
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
and it's crazy how little
time I've known them,

294
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,683
but how like, I just,
they're so special to me now.

295
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:33,003
- We are so happy to have you here.

296
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:35,570
- Thank you for letting me do it.

297
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,790
Anyways I hope you guys
enjoyed this fun little video.

298
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,750
Make sure you give us thumbs up if you did

299
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,793
and we will see you guys
in our next one, bye.

300
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,579
Felicia, end my vlog for me, ready?

301
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:46,412
- [Felicia] Bye.

302
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:47,329
- [Missy] Say bye.

303
00:14:47,329 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Felicia] Bye.
