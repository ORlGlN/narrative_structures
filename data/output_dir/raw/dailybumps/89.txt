- No, I don't

29
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,369

and it seems like he's hiding

31
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,256

He's eating a cookie and he's

176
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,927

00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:36,908
How cool is that, you guys?

184
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:38,957
So these are early Christmas presents?

185
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:39,790
- [Ollie] Yeah.

186
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,881
- [Bryan] What?

187
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,819
- Okay, here. There's one.

188
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:43,786
Let's grab this one.

189
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,593
I don't wanna mess up Fred.

190
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,376
(laughs) All right, Fred.

191
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:48,209
I'll leave you to it.

192
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,177
You finish that cookie, okay buddy?

193
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:51,068
See you later.

194
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,948
All right, you wanna close it?

195
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:54,148
Say, "bye, Fred!"

196
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:55,187
- [Finn] Bye, Fred.

197
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:59,177
- I cannot believe Fred brought
two early Christmas presents

198
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:01,463
for these boys from Mrs. Clause.

199
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:02,804
- Aaaahhhhh.

200
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:04,535
- There is excitement
abound in this house.

201
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:05,621
Let's see what's in here.

202
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:07,952
So Mrs. Clause watched your video.

203
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:08,894
Isn't that cool?

204
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:09,736
- [Ollie] Yeah.

205
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,263
- Do you think she's a subscriber?

206
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:13,381
Santa's gotta be a
subscriber by now, right?

207
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:14,570
All right, boys.

208
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,814
You heard Mrs. Clause.

209
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:18,368
She wants to see you practice
unwrapping some presents

210
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,824
so, what are you waiting for?

211
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:22,415
Go ahead and open 'em.

212
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,407
Pretty sure this one's for Ollie

213
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:25,514
'cause it's got the red
bow which is his favorite.

214
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:28,189
(gasps)

215
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,572
- What is it?
- Star Wars!

216
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,898
- [Bryan] What is it?

217
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:31,847
- [Finn] Star Wars!

218
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:33,619
- [Bryan] Star Wars?

219
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,146
Whoa, what'd you get, Ollie?

220
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:39,576
- I got, is it, Kylo
Ren fighting (mumbles)

221
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:41,625
- [Bryan] That is so cool.

222
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,836
It's a little Kylo Ren figure.

223
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,851
And what did you get, Finn?

224
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,587
A Storm Trooper?

225
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:48,420
Nice.

226
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,947
And you guys are even
dressed as Star Wars, huh?

227
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:51,780
- Yeah.

228
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,014
- [Bryan] Mrs. Clause probably knew

229
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,256
- That it!

230
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:56,173
- Yeah! That's so cool!

231
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,290
Thank you, Mrs. Clause.

232
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,955
You guys wanna say thank you?

233
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:01,878
- Thank you, Mrs. Clause.

234
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,689
- Yes, that was very nice of you.

235
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,901
- Thank you Clause.

236
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,649
- [Bryan] All right,
you boys wanna open 'em?

237
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:10,316
(Festive music)

238
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:20,280
Look at how good they are.

239
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,660
They even pick up all their
trash to throw it away.

240
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,493
That's so cool.

241
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,305
All right, throw it in
the trash can, boys.

242
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:26,387
Thank you, Finn.

243
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:27,970
- [Finn] Thank you.

244
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:31,101
- [Bryan] Got it, Ollie?

245
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,329
Kay.

246
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,509
- You guys, today me and Bryan

247
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,727
are doing something really, really fun

248
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:38,345
and I don't think we're
gonna vlog a ton of it

249
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:40,453
so I thought, maybe I'll
insta-story some of it.

250
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:42,676
I'm not gonna tell you
guys yet what we're doing

251
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:45,456
but I will let you guys guess for now.

252
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:47,789
(Fun music)

253
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,017
All right, figured out what
I'm wearing thanks to Michelle

254
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,984
I would go crazy if it
wasn't for Michelle.

255
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,190
I'd be like everything looks terrible.

256
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,998
But I found what I'm wearing
and I'm really excited.

257
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:11,255
- Oh howdy, babe.

258
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:12,569
- Oh, hey.

259
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,909
I just got back, oh hi.

260
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,056
- [Bryan] Aww.

261
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,542
- Did you miss me, too?

262
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:19,417
He was so excited.

263
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,026
- Like, I'm pretty sure that you walked in

264
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,206
like 10 minutes ago

265
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:24,307
- Yeah, but I just put the hat on

266
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:25,874
and when he saw me with the hat,

267
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:27,273
he was like, "hu hu hi."

268
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,289
He got so excited.

269
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,241
You like my hat?

270
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:30,074
- Yeah.

271
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:30,907
- Yeah?

272
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:32,289
- Did you do some damage, babe?

273
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,448
- I went a little shopping.

274
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,439
Yeah, I went shopping with Michelle

275
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,394
and it was so nice to have
someone there helping me

276
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,491
'cause I hate shopping.

277
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:42,458
I'm just like really terrible at it

278
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,543
and she definitely was
like, "that looks good."

279
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,006
And I was like, "okay,
if you say it looks good

280
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,098
then I'll get it."

281
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:50,079
We are actually going to a concert tonight

282
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,794
and we're so excited.

283
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:52,636
- Should we tell 'em?

284
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:53,644
- Yeah, let's tell 'em who.

285
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:56,635
- We are going to see Lady
Gaga and I'm so excited.

286
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,417
We're going with our
friends Crystal and Galen

287
00:08:58,417 --> 00:08:59,663
who are also huge fans.

288
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:03,067
It's kind of like our generation
who grew up with Lady Gaga

289
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,628
so it should be cool to
see her perform tonight.

290
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,265
- Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun

291
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:09,203
and we're definitely making
a little event of it.

292
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:12,256
They're actually picking us up in a limo,

293
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:14,271
like, they got a limo for us.

294
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:16,400
- And the thing is, it's
really hard to vlog concerts

295
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,233
so we're not gonna
- Yeah

296
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,805
- [Bryan] Vlog it, but we're
gonna insta-story it at times

297
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,028
so make sure you're following
both Missy and I on Instagram.

298
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,293
- Yeah, totally, but I still have to

299
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:23,257
figure out what I'm wearing.

300
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:25,208
I have like a couple of dresses in here

301
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,855
that I really like and a couple of options

302
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:32,422
for the concert, but I don't
know exactly what I'm wearing

303
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,257
so I'm gonna go try some stuff on.

304
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,156
We're leaving in the next two hours

305
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:37,775
so I've got some time to figure it out.

306
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,024
My hair's all done.

307
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:41,148
Thanks Michelle.

308
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,524
- Hey guys, say hi.

309
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:43,524
- [Boys] Hi.

310
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:46,359
I'm ending the vlog
with the boys once again

311
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:48,143
'cause Missy and Bryan are off

312
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:50,092
having a really fun time
tonight with their friends

313
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:51,284
so I'm with the boys tonight.

314
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:52,744
We filmed the video, didn't we, Ollie?

315
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:53,650
- Yeah.

316
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,610
- Yeah, was it cool?

317
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,577
- Yeah.

318
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:56,410
- We had a really fun time.

319
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,425
