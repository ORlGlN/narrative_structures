44
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:20,706
- And they have an obstacle
course that we can go across.

45
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:21,542
Isn't that neat?

46
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,475
(laughs)

47
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:25,655
- Anyways, yeah we are really excited.

48
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:27,911
Carl and Ginger's house
is just the house you want

49
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:29,083
to be out if you're a YouTuber.

50
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,217
There's so much to do, so much fun stuff.

51
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,404
They have everything that
you could possibly think of

52
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:36,887
and we are just so excited
to play, play, play, huh?

53
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,126
I even brought Finn's bike

54
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:39,909
cuz he loves riding his bike around

55
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,895
and so I thought it would be
fun if he got to ride his bike.

56
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,748
And there's so many toys here huh?

57
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:45,581
- Yeah

58
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,550
- Ollie so Sibley said, I was like,

59
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,041
Ollie, bring some toys
so that you can play

60
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,207
with some toys while they're here.

61
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,341
And he said, Momma, I don't need any toys.

62
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:55,524
There's gonna be plenty of
toys at Carl and Ginger's huh?

63
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:56,357

00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:57,190

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,653
(Missy laughs)

67
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:04,609

00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:07,086
Anyways the boys are havin a blast. Yeah?

00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,070
The fun isn't ending yet, huh?

70
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,342
(squeals)

71
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:11,175
(Missy laughs)

72
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:12,352
(upbeat music)

73
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,864
- Alright guys, Carl and Ginger built

74
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,925
their own obstacle course
going over their pool

75
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:18,978
and we are gonna have
some fun, aren't we Ollie?

76
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:19,811
- Yeah

77
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,220
- [Camera Man] Do you wanna
try and do the obstacle course?

78
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,053
- Yeah!

79
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:23,872
- [Camera Man] Yeah, let's do it!

80
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,571
- Alright so what they have
is basically a very long plank

81
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:28,989
that goes across the entire pool.

82
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:30,344
And then over on top of it

83
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:34,419
you've got basically
a string with noodles,

84
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,711
- Pool noodles!

85
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:36,832
- Pool noodles that hang down

86
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,793
and are somewhat of an
obstacle to go around.

87
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:39,626
- [Camera Man] Yeah, yeah, yeah,

88
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,542
and we can upset other things on here

89
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:44,120
and we can challenge ourselves, huh Ollie?

90
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,034
- Yeah!

91
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,390
- We could like mess with them ourselves

92
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,863
by hitting them with the pool noodles.

93
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:50,275
(Camera Man laughs)

94
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:51,895
- [Camera Man] Alright Ollie,

95
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:52,728
- Yeah!

96
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:54,593
- [Camera Man] Alright for
the first one all you gotta do

97
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:56,040
is walk across it. Can you do that?

98
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,873
- Yeah!

99
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:57,706

00:02:57,706 --> 00:03:00,289

00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:08,577
- [Camera Man] Alright, walk across Ollie!

102
00:03:08,577 --> 00:03:09,623
He's crawlin.

103
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,124
- Go Ollie, go!

104
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:11,957
- Stand up!

105
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:12,947
- Can you stand up?

106
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:13,780
- No!

107
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,605

108
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:17,960

109
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,479
- [Camera Man] See that?
That's not so scary, huh?

110
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,312
Oh!

111
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,517
How's the water feel?

112
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:26,350
- Good!

113
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,795
- [Camera Man] Don't touch the noodles!

114
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:30,628
- [Missy] Stand up, stand up!

115
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,081
- No!

116
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,664
(upbeat music)

117
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:40,538
- Alright, now we're gonna add
cones they have to walk over.

118
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:41,636
(children yelling)

119
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:42,926
- [Camera Man] Missy is in full clothes.

120
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,509

121
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,598

(laughs)

176
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:53,570
That was for me, not him.

177
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,771
(laughs)

178
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:56,969

- Alright, sorry Kyle. I'm sorry.

180
00:05:58,765 --> 00:05:59,778
- Don't push me

181
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:01,103
- Okay, I won't

This is a seven week old Australian,

221
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,479
and he's a very angry little puppy.

222
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,312
(barks)

223
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,536
You're just a little puppy.

224
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,258
Come here, come here.

225
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:21,337
Come here, I'm just gonna pet you.

226
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,206
I'm just gonna pet you.

227
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:24,049
(dog barks)
(Missy screams)

228
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:27,074
How could I be afraid of
this seven week old puppy?

229
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:28,974
(dog barks)

230
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:31,061
(laughs)

231
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:34,139
- I'm not sure but he's probably like,

232
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,669
he's like, not good with people

233
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:36,824
- [Missy] Aw that's so sad.

234
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,160

235
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,654

00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:43,967

240
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,384

00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:54,924
(Missy laughs)

277
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:55,979

283
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,165
with these kiddos.

284
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:33,742
They are both passed out.

285
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:36,975
I've been sleeping, Bryan's
been driving this entire way

286
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,906
and we're both so exhausted,

287
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:43,104
but we had such a fun past couple of days.

288
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:45,487
Thank you so much to both Carl and Ginger

289
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:48,720
for letting us stay at their
home and just have a blast

290
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,724
with their kids. It was so much fun.

291
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,437
We just had a really awesome
few days to get to hang out

292
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:56,127
and have fun with their friends,

293
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,287
but anyways we're home now.

294
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:00,410
We've been driving for so
long, it's almost 1:00 a.m.

295
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,372
