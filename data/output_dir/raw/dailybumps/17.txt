1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,740
- [Missy] What is that?

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,017
- [Ollie] Rain!

3
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:05,271
- [Missy] Rain? Oh, it's coming down now.

4
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,607
- Ahh!

5
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,672
(laughs)

6
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:09,474
- [Missy] He's like, get me inside!

7
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:10,725

- Good morning, plant.

17
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:35,947
- [Bryan] Good morning, plant.

18
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:36,960
And good morning, Ollie.

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,516
Are you giving him a drink of water?

20
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:39,349
- Yeah.

21
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:40,182
- [Bryan] I think he
needs a little bit more.

22
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:41,400
- Okay.

23
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,070
- [Bryan] (chuckles)

24
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,140
This is a money tree in my office here.

25
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,299
Ollie is watering it, huh?

26
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,460
- So that it can grow really big.

27
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,293
- Yeah.

28
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,250
Good morning, guys!

29
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,568
Ollie, look at your bedhead.

30
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,060
It's crazy. (laughs)

31
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,580
You need to do your hair.

32
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,310
So Ollie just did
something super, super cool

33
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,320
in the hallway, and he
really, really wanted

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,490
to show you guys.

35
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,322
You ready?

36
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:05,155
- Yeah.

37
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:06,351
- Okay, show me your trick.

38
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,357
(Finn yelling out)

39
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:10,120
- (laughs)

40
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,737
Well, good morning, Finn!

41
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,820
(laughs)

42
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:16,611
Whoa!

43
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,990
That's some pretty good gymnastics, dude!

44
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,823
Whoa!

45
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,220
Crazy Finn, you've got some
energy today, don't you?

46
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,646
- Yeah.

47
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:29,320
- Good morning, Finn.

48
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,170
I love you.

49
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,110
Ollie was also just telling
me what his favorite, oh!

50
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,093
He's crazy.

51
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:39,874
Ollie was also telling me
what his favorite picture

52
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:41,247
in our hallway is.

53
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:42,153
Do you wanna tell them?

54
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:42,986
- Yeah.

55
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,336
- [Bryan] Okay, what's
the favorite picture?

56
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:45,196
- This one.

57
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:47,169
- [Bryan] And I think
that is just so cute.

58
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:49,483
So, this is a picture of Missy and I

59
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:51,824
when she met Finn for the first time,

60
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:53,013
when he was in the NICU.

61
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,096
That's Finny.

62
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,890
That's this crazy boy right here!

63
00:01:58,948 --> 00:01:59,880
(laughs)

64
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,450
- That's hilarious, guys.

65
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,664
- It is, huh!

66
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,786
(Finn yelling out)

67
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:08,449
Never a dull moment at
our house, you guys.

68
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,818
Especially with two crazy,
wild boys running around.

69
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:13,069
(chuckles)

70
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:19,618
(pleasant music)

71
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:29,664
- What is it?

72
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:31,547
Oh, paper! You got paper!

73
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:34,340
- No, I did not just get paper, Ollie.

74
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,760
But I am really excited,
because I actually bid

75
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,199
on something on eBay, and I won!

76
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,545
And it's something I've been
wanting for a while now.

77
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,510
They don't make them anymore.

78
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,050
Check this out.

79
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,070
This is so cool!

80
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,600
It's the iCEO Throwboy doll.

81
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,033
They only did a limited
number of these years ago,

82
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:57,365
and it looks just like Steve Jobs.

83
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:58,720
It's just so cool.

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,165
So they only made 1,200, you guys.

85
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:03,640
And I always thought it was just so cool,

86
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,435
and I always thought how cool
it would look in my office,

87
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,631
and I scored.
- Wait, does it move?

88
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:07,464
- [Bryan] Huh?

89
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:08,297
- Does it move?

90
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:09,940
- [Bryan] No, he doesn't move. (chuckles)

91
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,640
He looks so good, though!

92
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,609
Oh, you guys, I miss Steve Jobs.

93
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:14,760
Hey, Siri.

94
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,630
Play the song Let's Catch
Santa by Daily Bumps.

95
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,140
- [Speaker] Let's Catch Santa
by Daily Bumps now playing.

96
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,214
- All right, so we're
gonna see how Steve Jobs

97
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:24,229
likes the new Apple HomePod.

98
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,590
♪ Let's catch Santa Clause ♪

99
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,892
He just wants to dance.

100
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:30,020
Oh hey, did I mention I'm a nerd?

101
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:37,210
- [Missy] You guys, what
is falling from the sky?

102
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:39,800
- [Ollie] Rain!

103
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,010
- [Missy] Rain?!

104
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,800
Get over here, it's wet!

105
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,084
Luna, get inside before you get all dirty.

106
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:48,680
It is a very rainy and coldy day.

107
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,670
Look at this.

108
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,896
I mean, the sky is just gray,
and there's this wetness,

109
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,825
dampness on the ground.

110
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:58,120
(Finn vocalizing and yelping)

111
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,071
What do you think of that? (chuckles)

112
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:04,660
It's like, barely sprinkling on him.

113
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,883
(Finn screeching)

114
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:10,897
I don't think Finn knows
what to think about this.

115
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:15,897
He's like, get me inside! (laughs)

116
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,659
Oh my gosh.

117
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,610
Um, yeah, it's actually a beautiful day.

118
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,140
I love it, it's definitely
nice to have some rain

119
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,000
here in California since
we don't get much of it.

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,390
Oh, and she's back out again.

121
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,439
Luna, get inside!

122
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,000
Luna, do you want out?

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,864

It doesn't rain enough
here, I don't know the song.

129
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,399
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go!

130
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,920
We actually have a lot to do today,

131
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,550
we gotta get you guys ready.

132
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,050
Your hair is crazy, bud.

133
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,883
Crazy.

134
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,280
Okay, I thought it'd
be fun to show you guys

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,073
how I do Ollie's hair in the morning.

136
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:56,338
All right, you ready?

137
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,171
- Yeah.

138
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,847
- So first, we have to get it all wet.

139
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:01,363
And this is actually just
a water spray bottle.

140
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:03,305
(Bryan laughs)

141
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:05,452
- It has flowers on it.

142
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,130
- (chuckles) It does have flowers.

143
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,424
All right, I do use this
leave-in conditioner

144
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:11,204
just to make his hair a little bit softer,

145
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:13,680
and it smells really good, too.

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,242
All right, once we got it all damp,

147
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,720
we're just gonna brush.

148
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,440
- [Bryan] And Ollie only likes
one kind of brush, right?

149
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,273
- Yeah.

150
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:24,106
- [Bryan] Which one do you like?

151
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,557
This one, he likes this brush.

152
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:29,752
He doesn't like my brush,
because it's too spiky, he says.

153
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:31,119
- Yeah, too spiky, huh?

154
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,160
This one's like a massage.

155
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,610
So now that we got this
in, I'm gonna use this

156
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,959
Kevin Murphy's Smooth Again.

157
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,895
Just a little tiny bit.

158
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,193
- Why is it white?

159
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:42,870
- [Missy] Because that's
the color of it. (chuckles)

160
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,918
And then we're just gonna run it through.

161
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:46,585
- Oh, it smells like hot dogs.

162
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:47,418
(Bryan laughs)

163
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:49,820
- He says that every
single time I do his hair.

164
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,750
- It does not smell
like hot dogs, you guys.

165
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,240
- He says it smells like barbecue,

166
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,030
and I'm like...

167
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,863
No, it doesn't.

168
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:57,083
- [Bryan] No, not even close.

169
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,080
(laughs)

170
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,640
- Now we're gonna use our
handy dandy blow dryer

171
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,040
and blow dry it.

172
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:03,895
Let's do it.

173
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:07,228
(pleasant upbeat music)

174
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,018
All right, next I'm gonna
use the Kevin Murphy

175
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:21,723
Night Rider Maximum Control Texture Paste,

176
00:06:21,723 --> 00:06:24,599
which opens like, oh, like.

177
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:25,800
- [Bryan] It looks like
a treasure box, Ollie.

178
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,489
- Like this, and then like that.

179
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:29,309
And we've got his hair, like, blow dried

180
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:31,580
in the general direction I want it to go,

181
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,927
and I'm gonna use a
super small amount, like.

182
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,142
- Mmm, smells good!

183
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:40,934
- And then I'm just gonna
rub it all over my hands.

184
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,266
And then I'm just gonna
kind of form his hair

185
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:45,302
in the general, like,
what I want it to do.

186
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:46,135
- Ooh.

187
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:47,938
And also to mention, all of
these are my hair products.

188
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:48,771
(laughs)

189
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,171
These are all what I use.

190
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:51,529
You like getting your hair done?

191
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:52,362
- Yeah.

192
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,430
- [Bryan] Yeah.

193
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,230
Oh, that looks so good, dude.

194
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,110
- [Missy] All right, now
that I like the way it looks,

195
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,241
we're just gonna hairspray it.

196
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,908
We're gonna glue it.

197
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:03,727
- [Bryan] And there you go, dude.

198
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,663
- [Missy] Look how fly you look!

199
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:06,496
Do you like it?

200
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:07,440
Look in the mirror.

201
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,373
- Yeah!

202
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:14,700
- Luna, I have stuff to do today,

203
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,580
and I need you out of the car.

204
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,960
I've been telling her to get
out while I buckle them in,

205
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,511
'cause I have some errands to run,

206
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:23,720
and she refuses to get out!

207
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,150
Luna, come.

208
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,670
Come on. Oh, there she goes.

209
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,503
Luna, come.

210
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:29,240
You can't go with me.

211
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,020
You stay here, 'kay?

212
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,780
You stay here.

213
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,330
All right, we are all loaded up.

214
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,020
I have a feeling Finn's
gonna fall asleep. (chuckles)

215
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,710
It is right about his nap time.

216
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,490
We're just gonna do a
quick grocery store run,

217
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,595
and I do want to run really
quickly to Home Depot

218
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:49,520
just to grab something for
the barn, for my horse.

219
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,090
The weather is just pretty wet and muggy,

220
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,198
so it's not really weather
that I would want to ride in,

221
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:56,170
but I may end up going up there

222
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,410
a little bit later to go visit.

223
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,292
So, funny story, I made
my way all the way to,

224
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,465
actually I ended up going to Lowe's,

225
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:07,379
or I'm headed into Lowe's,
and both children fell asleep.

226
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,990
And so I went home, and
I put Finn into bed.

227
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,111
I was like, what was I thinking?

228
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:15,194
Finn just needs to go to
bed, he always needs his nap,

229
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,110
and it's definitely his nap time,

230
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,730
it's not too late for his nap.

231
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,518
And I'm like, I just need
to go put him to bed.

232
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:22,954
So I ran home and I put him to bed,

233
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,190
and he was out like a light.

234
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,450
Ollie, on the other hand,
doesn't really need a nap.

235
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm sure he's getting
a nice little nap in,

236
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,780
which will be nice, but
he doesn't really need

237
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,620
to sleep very long, and
so I'm gonna wake him up,

238
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,370
and then we're gonna
run in, and I'm actually

239
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,222
looking for some flowers,
so gotta wake this dude up

240
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:42,799
and tell him it's time
to go into the store.

241
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,720
Well, good morning there, sunshine.

242
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,950
How was your sleep?

243
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,880
- [Ollie] Good.

244
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,866
- [Missy] Did you think it's funny that,

245
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:51,530
when you woke up, Finn was just gone?

246
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,363
- Yeah.

247
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:55,113
(Missy chuckles)

248
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,928
- [Missy] So I was looking for this,

249
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:01,250
like a hanging plant for in the barn,

250
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,430
and I love this one.

251
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,890
I love the planter it's in, or
like the little pot it's in,

252
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,350
and I love the plants.

253
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,769
It's not something that's
like, the horses are gonna eat.

254
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,279
And then I wanted a small
one for one of my shelves,

255
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,225
and I just think this is
really pretty and simple,

256
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:18,174
it doesn't need too
much light or water, so.

257
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,363
Do you like them, Ollie?

258
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:20,230
- [Ollie] Yeah.

259
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,063
- [Missy] Yay!

260
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,260
- These are little bug catchers, guys.

261
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,200
- [Missy] Bug catchers?

262
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,639
And what kind of bugs do they catch?

263
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,530
- They catch flies.

264
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,120
- [Missy] Flies?

265
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,280
- I just don't want to touch them, guys.

266
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,113
- [Missy] Yeah.

267
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:37,946
- They will bite you.

268
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:38,930
(Missy chuckles)

269
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,580
- So we are grocery shopping, and we are

270
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,660
in desperate need of a lot of things, huh?

271
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,493
- Yeah.

272
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:48,494
- So, so far we've got our
bread, we've got some fruit,

273
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:50,709
I need to get a little
bit more, and some salads,

274
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,497
avocados, which we always need.

275
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:54,522
And then of course, you
know, we always need

276
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,212
cinnamon rolls, right?

277
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:57,045
- Yeah.

278
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,410
- [Missy] And then
check what Ollie brought

279
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,917
into the store with us.

280
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:03,077
(chuckles) He brought his venus fly trap.

281
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:06,440
So yes, we did get one for
him, and he was so excited.

282
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,171
- Because I really wanted one.

283
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,890
- He actually didn't
even ask me, he was like,

284
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,400
"Can I just go see them one more time?"

285
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,415
I was like, let's just get you one,

286
00:10:13,415 --> 00:10:15,528
and he wants to take care of it, huh?

287
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:16,361
- Yeah.

288
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:17,194
- [Missy] So what do you have
to do to take care of it?

289
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:20,190
- Um, give it some water and some food.

290
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,749
- [Missy] Yeah, what kind
of food do you give it?

291
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,140
- Um, flies.

292
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,410
- [Missy] What kind of flies?

293
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,770
- Black flies.

294
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,608
- [Missy] Black flies?

295
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:28,740
- But real flies and black flies.

296
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,089
- [Missy] They have to be alive, huh?

297
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:30,922
- Yeah.

298
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:31,755
- [Missy] So yeah, he's really excited.

299
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:33,010
And he had to bring it
in, he's been telling it

300
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,571
how much he loves it. (chuckles)

301
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:35,404
- Yeah.

302
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,237
- [Missy] Yeah.

303
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,221
And he's been giving it a kiss.

304
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,999
Oh, and he even, like, he
put it here and he was like,

305
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,550
"I want it to be able to look at me."

306
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,510
Huh?

307
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,343
- Yeah.

308
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,640
- I told him it's not alive.

309
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,720
He thinks it's, like, has
eyes and can see him, huh?

310
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,340
All right, we're looking for arugula.

311
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,300
Can we find the arugula?

312
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,135
- No.

313
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,537
- We can't find it anywhere.

314
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:54,681
We're lost.

315
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:57,505
So I got home from shopping,
and I've been doing

316
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:00,761
a little project. (laughs)

317
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,770
- Um, is this like, homework or something?

318
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,206
- It is, you know, I'm
working really hard right now

319
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,037
to win you a vacation home. (chuckles)

320
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:10,452
- She has been doing this
for over and hour and a half.

321
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,690
- (groans) I get like obsessed
about stuff like this.

322
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,701
Um, okay, so at our store, you can,

323
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,790
it's like a Monopoly game, you get like,

324
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,600
all these pieces when you buy groceries.

325
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
- I think they have
Monopoly everywhere, right?

326
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,380
- Yeah, I'm sure, yeah.

327
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,420
Well, I don't know.

328
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,830
But yeah, and so basically
I'm doing really good.

329
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,841
- When you land on Free Parking,
do you get free parking?

330
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:27,674
Do you get free parking
at the grocery store?

331
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:28,520
- [Missy] I know, right?

332
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,230
Or like a best parking spot.

333
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,642
Um, I don't know, but I'm
about to win the million dollar

334
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:36,091
cash prize, and the million
dollar vacation home, so.

335
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:36,924
(laughs)

336
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:37,992
- Oh my gosh, you're so full of it.

337
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:38,825
- [Missy] I know.

338
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,680
I'm pretty close to the
$5.00 one, though, too.

339
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,379
I've got a $5.00 gift card. (chuckles)

340
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,580
Yeah, I'm actually doing pretty dang good,

341
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,080
and I have quite a few left.

342
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,506
We'll be shopping at this grocery store

343
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,089
for the next few months
until the game is over,

344
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,988
(Bryan laughs) and hopefully
I win a million dollars.

345
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:51,930
(chuckles)

346
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,450
All right, I finished with
my little project now.

347
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,865
I gotta say, I am so close to
winning that million dollars.

348
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,283
I've got one left!

349
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,270
Anyways, kids just ate dinner
and they're taking a bath.

350
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,410
Actually, they're taking a shower.

351
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,940
And I thought I would talk about something

352
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,780
I've been thinking about a lot lately,

353
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,768
which is something that
also people ask me about

354
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,540
all the time, especially
now that I have a horse,

355
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,244
and my life is, like, a
little bit busier and stuff.

356
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:16,730
But it is if I'm going
to have another baby.

357
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,258
I have to say, I've kind
of been telling myself,

358
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:22,206
like, 2018 we're gonna start to try again.

359
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:24,070
That's kind of been like my plan.

360
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,550
And life is just so busy right now,

361
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,521
I'm just like, I don't
think I can swing it yet.

362
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:32,703
But my plan was kind of end
of 2018, so I'm still like,

363
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:34,799
am I gonna be ready by the end?

364
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,487
I'm not really sure.

365
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:40,240
I have thought about,
like, what I'm going to do,

366
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,640
now that I have two kids,
I've got one in school,

367
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,750
the other one's gonna be
in school pretty soon,

368
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,715
I have a horse, which
is a big responsibility,

369
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,540
I mean, we've got a business,
we've got a couple businesses,

370
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,960
honestly, and we have
a lot, a lot going on.

371
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,230
Can I actually manage another baby?

372
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,290
And I honestly feel like not yet.

373
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,680
I feel like there will be a time.

374
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,100
I definitely have, like,
me and Bryan both have,

375
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,630
like, that feeling in us that's just like,

376
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,670
I think we want one more.

377
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,005
I think we would love
to have just one more,

378
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:09,290
and it feels like that would
be, like, the finishing piece

379
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,186
to our puzzle, or our family, you know?

380
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:13,220
And it feels like something's missing.

381
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,813
I mean, we love our little family of four,

382
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:16,907
and we're just cherishing
every second of it.

383
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:19,130
But it just, I don't know, to
me, I feel like there's just

384
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,840
like a little something
that might be missing.

385
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,647
And so as far as, like,
managing a horse, gosh, like,

386
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:25,247
I wouldn't be able to ride
too far into my pregnancy,

387
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:28,119
probably not very far at all, honestly.

388
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:31,369
And you know, just the work
of it, I think I'd be able

389
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:33,473
to manage working with
the horse, but riding,

390
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:34,850
I wouldn't really be able to do,

391
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,110
so I would probably have to find someone

392
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,772
to help ride and stuff, which
wouldn't be too difficult.

393
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:41,429
And then yeah, I mean, just
life is busy, you know?

394
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:44,888
It's not as much napping as
I could've done in my first,

395
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:46,990
with like, when I was pregnant with Ollie,

396
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,114
which I really didn't do much of anyways.

397
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:51,850
And just busy, you know?

398
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,996
I'm gonna be going in and
out of taking them to school,

399
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:56,407
and doing things, and then
you throw a baby in there,

400
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:59,857
I mean, that's a whole other life to that,

401
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:01,590
I can't even imagine yet.

402
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,690
But I am hoping that by
the end of, like, 2018,

403
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,931
we can really start, like,
really start getting our life

404
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:10,943
ready and prepared to throw
another little one into the mix,

405
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,434
and I know that by doing
that, that's at least

406
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:17,130
three to four years of, like, busy.

407
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,830
I mean, honestly, it's
like the rest of your life

408
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,663
is super busy.

409
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,837
But, you know, when they're
just like itty bitty baby,

410
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:24,646
they just rely on you so
much, and you can't really

411
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:27,347
just be like, oh I'm just,
you know, I've got a horse,

412
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:28,440
I've gotta do that.

413
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,230
Like, I've got a baby,
that's more important.

414
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,390
So, just trying to figure out how to

415
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,552
manage all of that, and
how to fit everything in,

416
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,330
and how we're gonna make it happen.

417
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,354
But I'm excited, the boys
are always talking about

418
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:39,421
how much they want another baby,

419
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,970
and they want to be momma's baby,

420
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,780
but they need another baby, and it's just

421
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,830
the cutest thing ever.

422
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,960
So maybe soon, I think it'll be fun, too,

423
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,200
to wait 'til they're a
little older as well,

424
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,416
to like really get to be involved

425
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,098
and remember the next
little one being a baby.

426
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:55,090
That is my cue, though, so
I'm gonna go check in on them.

427
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,572
Bryan's in there, but I'm
gonna go check in on them,

428
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,676
and then get them ready for bed!

429
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:01,191
Life is so crazy, I gotta go!

430
00:15:01,191 --> 00:00:00,000
