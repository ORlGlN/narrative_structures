1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,187
We have one final question From Shannon,

2
00:00:02,187 --> 00:00:04,762
"What's the one thing you really want

3
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:06,271
"for Christmas this year?"

4
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:08,690
Okay boys, so this is your chance,

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,328
you can tell Santa
through the YouTube video,

6
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:13,911
what do you want for Christmas?

7
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:18,975
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)

8
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,439
- [All] Good morning.

9
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,127
We just got back home and this
little buddy ran up to us,

10
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,325
and gave us both the biggest hugs ever.

11
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:44,955
Did you have fun with Mimi and Papa?

12
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:45,838
Yes.

13
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:46,796
Yeah?

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,863
We just got back from our trip,

15
00:00:47,863 --> 00:00:49,212
so we're excited to see all of them.

16
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:50,284
Mimi, Papa.

17
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,740
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,423
Cover Batman cup, go,
go, go, go, go, home.

19
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:56,483
Ollie.

20
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:58,900
- [Bryan] Hey what's up dude?

21
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:00,867
Hi Ollie.

22
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:01,700
- [Missy] Give Daddy a hug.

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,602
Oh hey, remember me?

24
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:06,240
(laughs) Did you have fun?

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,073
Yeah.

26
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:09,065
Yes, I missed you.

27
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:10,171
I missed you too.

28
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,436
Aw gimme a big hug.

29
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:12,551
(growls)

30
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,655
Now you can have lots more fun

31
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,696
now that Mama and Dada are home, k?

32
00:01:16,696 --> 00:01:17,529
Yeah.

33
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:20,254
You guys it is so nice to be home

34
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,928
and it's actually kind
of a warm day today.

35
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:24,794
We've been having a lot of cool weather

36
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,464
the past couple weeks, and kind of warm.

37
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:29,332
But I'm gonna toss out some baby arugula

38
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,847
that we had in the fridge
leftover from I think pizza night

39
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:33,630
to my little chickies.

40
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,238
And all I have are hens left guys,

41
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:39,487
if you don't know I had to get
rid of a few of my roosters,

42
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:40,987
I'll have that video linked up here.

43
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:42,092
It was kind of sad,

44
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:44,114
but I know that they'll be
happy where they're going.

45
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:45,591
And they're going to a nice place,

46
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:47,549
no one's gonna eat them or
anything, so that's good.

47
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,765
Yeah I just thought I'd toss
out some arugula for them.

48
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:52,372
One, two, three, four, that's five.

49
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:55,613
There's Moana, six, and seven.

50
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:59,214
That's Ursula, and this is all
the chickens I have you guys.

51
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:01,501
This is it, seven chickens
plus that one in there.

52
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,933
That's not very many chickens,

53
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:06,078
I might end up having to
buy some more chickens.

54
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:07,203
I'm just trying to debate,

55
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:10,344
do I wanna do them from like eggs, chicks?

56
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:12,450
Or just get hens that are already laying?

57
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,957
Cuz really I'm only getting like

58
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:15,537
two or three eggs right now,

59
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:17,027
because not all of my chickens are

60
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,200
high-production egg layers.

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,708
I'm like do I want more eggs?

62
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:24,276
Because if I want that then
I can just buy grown hens

63
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,497
that are already laying

64
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:26,959
and maybe that are good layers.

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,321
So that's what I'm kinda
debating right now.

66
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,114
But I do love raising them as chicks,

67
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:31,125
when they're little babies,

68
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,880
I think that is like
the sweetest thing ever.

69
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,465
Let's see how many eggs I got now.

70
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:37,516
Oh there's two.

71
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:39,836
Just two eggs, that's it.

72
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:40,916
There they all are.

73
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,596
Oh, that one's kind of a meanie.

74
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,110
Ollie are you wearing Olivia's shirt?

75
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,065
Yeah.

76
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,511
(laughs) He's wearing Liv's shirt.

77
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,667
She must have left it here
one time when she slept over,

78
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,610
it's so funny.

79
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,763
Hey now that Mommy and Daddy are here,

80
00:02:53,763 --> 00:02:54,783
you can do crazy stuff right?

81
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:55,616
Yeah.

82
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,104
Oh no what are you doing on the table?

83
00:02:58,104 --> 00:02:58,937
Whoa.

84
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:01,224
(laughs)

85
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,469
- [Ollie] Let's do that again.

86
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,576
Let's do that again.

87
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,420
Here we go.

88
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,806
Whoa, oh my gosh that was crazy.

89
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:10,125
Ollie could you go higher?

90
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,389
Watch this.

91
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:12,361
- [Bryan] Okay.

92
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:13,891
Whoa you did a spin?

93
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:14,724
Yeah.

94
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,603
Whoa, do another one like a Superman.

95
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:19,853
Go, whoa that was such a good Superman.

96
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,206
You're so good at this dude.

97
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:24,489
He's just going nonstop now,

98
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,914
it's just getting crazy up in here.

99
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,632
Whoa, on your back?

100
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:30,196
Where did you learn all those tricks?

101
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:31,029
From Papa.

102
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:33,533
Come here, you're so funny dude.

103
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:36,241
You always have so much energy, huh?

104
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:40,601
(upbeat instrumental music)

105
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,851
Alright Missy, what is going on

106
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:45,222
in our kitchen right now?

107
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:48,256
We have some huge boxes laid out

108
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:49,994
and a ton of groceries.

109
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:50,827
What are we doing?

110
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:53,436
Yeah so basically we are

111
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:56,451
gonna help provide Thanksgiving
dinners to some people

112
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:58,414
who are in need through our community.

113
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,415
So we have these boxes,

114
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:00,588
and we're gonna basically
just gonna fill them up

115
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,439
with all kinds of groceries.

116
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,166
And I used this super easy Instacart

117
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,853
to just literally order everything,

118
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,820
and it was just delivered.

119
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,093
Now I'm just gonna separate
all into the boxes.

120
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,705
Yes, so this is a local
outreach initiative,

121
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:14,036
done by our church.

122
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,754
They had all these boxes prepared for us,

123
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:19,051
and then they gave all of us a
shopping list of what to shop

124
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,909
and fill them with.

125
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,170
Now we get to pack 'em up.

126
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,019
Yeah okay, so each family

127
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,786
gets four boxes of Stove Top Stuffing,

128
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:28,369
which I think is awesome
cuz that stuff is delicious.

129
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,029
Mom we need three cans of corn.

130
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:35,152
Alright, one, two, three.

131
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,160
Put 'em in there.

132
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,993
Okay.

133
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,321
(laughs) Can you do it?

134
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,154
No.

135
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:43,005
- [Bryan] (laughs) Wrong
box, but that's okay.

136
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:44,070
I'll just set 'em on the counter,

137
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,211
and you can put 'em in there.

138
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,194
We need three cans of green beans.

139
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:51,785
- [Missy] Three cans, alright, hang on.

140
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,752
- [Bryan] Searching through
all these groceries,

141
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,013
look at this.

142
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,342
- [Missy] Set 'em in there.

143
00:04:56,342 --> 00:05:00,009
(upbeat instrumental music)

144
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,625
Ollie isn't this so cool?

145
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,458
Yeah.

146
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,646
We're gonna put all this food in a box,

147
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:08,679
and then guess what?

148
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,384
We're gonna give this box to
someone who is struggling,

149
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:14,231
so that they can have a
nice Thanksgiving dinner.

150
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,143
Isn't that nice?

151
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:15,976
Yeah.

152
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:16,809
Yeah.

153
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:17,823
Think that's a cool thing to do,

154
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:18,982
to provide for people right?

155
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,054
Oh look we have sweet potatoes.

156
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,898
- [Missy] Go ahead and put
the sweet potatoes in there.

157
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:25,303
- [Bryan] We need one giant
can of sweet potatoes.

158
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,695
(Ollie yells)

159
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:28,706
(Bryan laughs)

160
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,046
Mama don't forget the cranberry sauce.

161
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:33,112
- [Bryan] Yes, you gotta have

162
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:35,183
cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving.

163
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:36,983
- [Missy] We've got whole cranberries

164
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,524
and jelled cranberry sauce.

165
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:40,338
- [Bryan] Yes, cuz some people like both.

166
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:41,965
I prefer the real stuff,

167
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,665
but the jelly stuff is kind of iconic.

168
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:46,710
- [Ollie] Mom we need marshmallows.

169
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,543
- [Missy] You got it.

170
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:48,376
(screaming)

171
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:49,209
(laughs)

172
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,150
They're having so much fun

173
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,559
packing these Thanksgiving boxes.

174
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,980
I wanted to ask you guys though,

175
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,283
which one do you prefer?

176
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:58,492
Canned cranberry sauce
or jelly cranberry sauce?

177
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,979
I'm gonna have a poll in the iCard above

178
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:00,981
so that you can select,

179
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:03,597
but also let us know down
below in the comments below.

180
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,042
Do you like real cranberry sauce or jelly?

181
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:08,062
I definitely prefer the real stuff.

182
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:09,915
Hey Ollie what kind of
cranberry sauce do you like?

183
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:13,278
I don't like cranberry sauce.

184
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,904
- [Missy] Alright they need gravy.

185
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:15,928
Gravy.

186
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:18,411
- [Bryan] Let's put it in.

187
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,244
Tatoes.

188
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:22,611
- [Bryan] And then we're
also throwing in cereal

189
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,479
and peanut butter because
the local outreach

190
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,385
always needs lots of
cereal and peanut butter.

191
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:29,530
So that's a good thing
to throw in there too.

192
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,650
So this box is basically fully packaged,

193
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,659
except we also gonna put a
little $20 check in there,

194
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,122
so that they can get
their turkey, their pie,

195
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:38,378
and their rolls.

196
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:39,290
- [Bryan] Yeah.

197
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,194
What do you think dude?

198
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:41,990
Is that a lot of yummy
food for Thanksgiving?

199
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,240
Yep, I Thanksgiving.

200
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,988
Can't wait for Thanksgiving.

201
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:51,118
It's gonna be so much fun, huh?

202
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:53,608
Alright, let's pack up
the rest of these boxes.

203
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:57,275
(upbeat instrumental music)

204
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:11,734
Alright, while Ollie and
Missy work diligently

205
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,184
to pack these Thanksgiving boxes.

206
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,759
I thought we could also do another

207
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,089
Ask Daily Bumps at the same time.

208
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,977
So we asked you guys on Twitter
to send us some questions,

209
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:23,753
and we're gonna answer
some of them right now.

210
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,328
Alright Ollie Madeline asked,

211
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,905
"What are you gonna do if the Grinch comes

212
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,118
"to your house again?"

213
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:29,048
(Ollie gasps)

214
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,507
Do you remember that?

215
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:33,699
Oh, he's obviously gonna hide,

216
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,979
because he is very afraid of the Grinch.

217
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,645
Hey Ollie, it's okay you
don't need to be scared.

218
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:38,639
If you guys don't remember,

219
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,096
last year the Grinch came to the house

220
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:42,227
and some hilarious stuff went down.

221
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:43,500
Here's what you missed.

222
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,583
(mischievous instrumental music)

223
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:02,043
Hey Mama I'm ready for the next one.

224
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:04,677
- [Missy] Alright lemme
just find this last corn.

225
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:07,124
- [Bryan] You need corn?

226
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:08,460
- [Ollie] We don't need corn.

227
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,571
- [Bryan] We need corn.

228
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:11,439
You're doing so good packing these buddy,

229
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,945
I'm so proud of you.

230
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:15,532
(Ollie mumbles)

231
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:16,770
Selma asked,

232
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,159
"What are you most excited
about for Thanksgiving?"

233
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,851
I am excited about spending
quality time with my friends,

234
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:27,946
with my family, and turkey sandwiches.

235
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:29,245
You excited about for Thanksgiving?

236
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:33,107
Hanging out with all of my
family and of course food.

237
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:33,940
- [Bryan] Yeah, Ollie,

238
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,602
what are you excited
about for Thanksgiving?

239
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:39,769
I'm excited about Thanksgiving
is about my doggies.

240
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:42,151
(laughs)

241
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:42,985
- [Missy] Wait, what did he say?

242
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,358
My doggies, what?

243
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,567
Wait did you say you're excited

244
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,353
to learn what Thanksgiving is about?

245
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:48,186
Yeah.

246
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:49,346
Okay we'll teach you this year okay?

247
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:50,349
Thanksgiving.

248
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,007
Thanksgiving.

249
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,654
Alright, put those green beans in.

250
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:56,445
We got green beans that need
to be loaded into those boxes.

251
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:57,709
Minty Trouble asked,

252
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,055
"What is your favorite thing
to eat on Thanksgiving?"

253
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,613
Honestly probably, and this is gonna sound

254
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:05,862
really, really, weird; Stove Top stuffing.

255
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:07,679
I love Stove Top stuffing.

256
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,551
What's your favorite thing
to eat on Thanksgiving babe?

257
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:10,384
Apple pie.

258
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,883
- [Bryan] Ooh good one.

259
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:15,481
Whoa, Finn is zipping around on this.

260
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,171
He is so fast you guys.

261
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:19,253
I'm trying to catch up with him,

262
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:20,580
because I'm trying to ask him.

263
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,747
Finn, what is your favorite
thing to eat at Thanksgiving?

264
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:28,886
(laughs) I can't get him to answer.

265
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:30,883
Hey Finn what's your favorite
thing to eat at Thanksgiving?

266
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:31,716
Food.

267
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:34,587
- [Bryan] Food, yeah, food's pretty yummy.

268
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,172
Okay bye, Finn is so funny.

269
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:37,697
He seriously just wants to be independent

270
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:40,475
and ride his bike while we

271
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:42,926
pack our Thanksgiving boxes inside.

272
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,015
Daily Bump's Tribe asked,

273
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,047
"What's your favorite Christmas movie?"

274
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:47,275
Hers is The Grinch.

275
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,363
What is our favorite Christmas movie?

276
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:50,938
You know my Christmas movie?

277
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:51,771
- [Bryan] What?

278
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:52,900
Nightmare Before Christmas.

279
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,892
- [Bryan] Oh that's a good one.

280
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:55,058
Babe we all know yours.

281
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:56,001
Elf.

282
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,059
Elf of course.

283
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:00,178
Missy actually asked if we're
going to decorate outside.

284
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:01,195
We have such a huge yard,

285
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:02,808
we should at least put
a blow-up or something.

286
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:05,224
I definitely wanna decorate.

287
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:07,845
- [Bryan] Do like a blow-up Santa?

288
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:08,853
Hopefully this year we can.

289
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:11,128
- [Bryan] Okay, look at
Ollie putting all the gravy.

290
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:13,761
Uh oh, make sure that box only gets two,

291
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,631
there you go.

292
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:16,789
Here we go marshmallows.

293
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,344
(Ollie yells)

294
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:19,177
- [Bryan] Marshmallows.

295
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:20,702
Where do I put this?

296
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:21,535
In the second one.

297
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:22,676
It's right there, no, no.
Is this one?

298
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:23,509
- [Missy] That one.

299
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:24,342
- [Bryan] There you go.

300
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:26,299
Alright, go to the next box.

301
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,132
(laughs) Stop.

302
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:28,557
- [Missy] Nope, the next one.

303
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:31,018
- [Bryan] Now this one
Ollie, right here (laughs).

304
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,351
Ready, get it.

305
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:34,706
Go to the next.

306
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,473
In this one?

307
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:37,739
Yeah this one.

308
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:40,450
Yeah any one that doesn't have it.

309
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,867
Alright catch it!

310
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:44,920
Put it in the box.

311
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,587
(upbeat instrumental music)

312
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,821
Hey Ollie, Grace wants to know

313
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:01,284
what your favorite ice cream flavor is?

314
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:04,863
My favorite is cherry and strawberry.

315
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:07,802
Cherry strawberry, there you go.

316
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:09,614
Oh hey Finn.

317
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:12,698
Waka, waka, waka, waka, waka, waka.

318
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:15,030
- [Bryan] We're putting
together Thanksgiving boxes,

319
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,863
what are you doing?

320
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:18,996
Hey Ollie, all the peanut
butter has to go in the boxes.

321
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:22,249
- [Ollie] Peanut butter, my favorite.

322
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,860
- [Bryan] Alright, we have Finn

323
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,899
into the mix helping pack these boxes.

324
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,970
Alright babe, Icicle Pop wants to know,

325
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,489
do we have any holiday
traditions with our family?

326
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,476
Yes we have a lot of traditions.

327
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:35,464
One is that every year we
write a Christmas letter

328
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:36,911
and we read it the next year.

329
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:38,724
- [Bryan] Yeah kinda like
a time capsule thing.

330
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:42,543
And I also love when we
all get matching pajamas.

331
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:43,728
Do you like when we do that?

332
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:44,794
Yeah.

333
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:45,936
(kisses)

334
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:46,769
Are you helping me?

335
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:47,602
- [Bryan] I don't know if he's helping

336
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:50,391
or just pulling things out
of boxes at this point.

337
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:51,407
Put the peanut butter in that one.

338
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:56,111
Alright Sophie asked do we
like giving or receiving gifts?

339
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:58,917
And I think it's pretty clear

340
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,406
for what Missy's doing right now even.

341
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:02,701
I love giving.

342
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,695
I love that way more than receiving.

343
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:09,169
Yeah, she's so funny and
frugal with ourselves.

344
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,030
And then when it comes to
other people and giving

345
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,084
she's like, "Give 'em whatever they want."

346
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:16,668
Missy's got such a sweet heart
and we love that about Mama.

347
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,620
(growls)

348
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,260
Finn, look at all this yummy food.

349
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,491
Doesn't it look so yummy?

350
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,324
Yeah.

351
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,694
Yeah, we're gonna give this to someone

352
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:26,479
so that they can have Thanksgiving.

353
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,312
Cool, huh?

354
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:28,575
Alright boys, now that we have

355
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,821
all the Thanksgiving boxes packed,

356
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,668
we have one final question
from Shannon who asks,

357
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:36,288
"What's the one thing you really want

358
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,000
for Christmas this year?"

359
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,416
Okay boys, so this is your chance.

360
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:44,009
you can tell Santa
through the YouTube video,

361
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:47,378
what do you want for Christmas?

362
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:50,175
I want is a special dinosaur

363
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:52,397
that is a Power Ranger.

364
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,021
Okay, that's the one thing you want?

365
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:57,733
Okay Finn, what do you want for Christmas?

366
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,763
Halloween.

367
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:00,151
You want it to be Halloween again?

368
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:01,144
Yeah.

369
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:05,554
(laughing) That is probably
the strangest Christmas wish

370
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:08,422
I've ever heard (laughing).

371
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,139
You're so cute Finn.

372
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,157
I love you guys.

373
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,035
Alright, thank you for helping pack

374
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:14,313
the Thanksgiving boxes.

375
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:16,186
Ollie you did so good dude.

376
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,295
I'm so proud of you.

377
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,878
(upbeat music)

378
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:23,141
- [Bryan] Ollie, who's
here playing with you?

379
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,798
Pay and Liv.

380
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:27,488
- [Bryan] Yeah, Pay and
Liv came over to visit.

381
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:28,671

382
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:29,696
What are we doing?

383
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:30,805
I'm making Play-doh.

384
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:33,849
We got a Play-doh set
for them to dig into.

385
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:35,055
They're all enjoying it.

386
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:37,323
Ollie's been begging for
Liv and Pay to come over,

387
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:38,329
so that they can hang out.

388
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:41,080
You guys work together really well, huh?

389
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,597
What are you making Ollie?

390
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:45,151
I'm making a kitty cat
cuz I love kitty cats.

391
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,955
- [Bryan] Oh, that is a kitty cat

392
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:50,743
Finn's in charge of all
the shapes and cutouts.

393
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:51,576
What are you doing?

394
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:53,501
I'm making an alligator.

395
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,772
- [Bryan] Oh, that's so cool.

396
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:56,387
Do you see that Ollie, with green?

397
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:57,220
- [Ollie] Yeah.

398
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,479
She's making an alligator, nice.

399
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:03,312
(cheerful instrumental music)

400
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:15,371
Alright you guys, Missy
is reading a bedtime story

401
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,486
to the boys right now.

402
00:14:16,486 --> 00:14:18,023
I'm gonna go in and
show you what happened,

403
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,253
something hilarious and funny,

404
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:23,003
but you guys gotta be quiet okay?

405
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:29,244
This book knocks them out every time.

406
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,310
This has never happened.

407
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,263
- [Bryan] This has never happened.

408
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:40,650
They've never fallen
asleep in the same bed.

409
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,533
- [Bryan] Do we leave 'em?

410
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:42,915
I was thinking about it,

411
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,379
but I think Finn would fall off.

412
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:48,680
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, that's so cute.

413
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,847
- [Missy] They're so cute.

414
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,408
K, nite, nite boys.

415
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:59,133
And with that adorable mess,
I think we will go ahead,

416
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,637
and end today's vlog.

417
00:15:00,637 --> 00:15:01,972

There's one more thing I have to show you.

428
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:26,593
Finn made me put these on
him before he went to bed.

429
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:33,208
- [Bryan] He asked to wear underwear?

430
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,452
Yes, he made me change them three times

431
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,945
until he was happy with them.

432
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:39,372
- [Bryan] He's so funny,

433
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,791
he just wants to be like his brother.

434
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,129
I know, look at him.

435
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:43,372
I can't move him.

436
00:15:43,372 --> 00:00:00,000
