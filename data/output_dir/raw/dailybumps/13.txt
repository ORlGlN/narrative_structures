1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
- [All] Good morning.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,124
- Although that is about as far
from the truth as it can be.

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,440
It has been a rough, rough morning.

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,113
Would you say so, Finley Jay?

16
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:32,947
- Yeah
- Yeah

17
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:35,398
- I'm going to school
and Finn just be crazy.

18
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:37,593
- Crazy (laughs).

19
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,090
- That is basically the truth.

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,500
Finn hasn't been feeling that great

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,200
and so he had a rough night

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,290
and then this morning was rough

23
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,750
and we did not get up for school in time

24
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,950
and so now we're running late.

25
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,850
And then usually I leave Finn

26
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,140
because taking Finn to
like, drop off Ollie

27
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,650
would be kind of a long process.

28
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,920
And I could not leave.

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,430
Could not leave.

30
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,430
I feel like at this
point we're like so late

31
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,060
that I should just skip.

32
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,740
But I really want Ollie to get to school,

33
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,940
they're learning a really
cool letter this week

34
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,010
and I don't want him to miss out on that.

35
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,230
And so, I put Finn in the car.

36
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,730
I might actually drop him
off with my mom and dad

37
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,070
since it's on the way,
and then he can play

38
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,120
and not feel like I abandoned him.

39
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,610
'Cause that is what he
was making me feel like.

40
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,730
Bryan's actually getting
ready to head out on a trip.

41
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,090
So he was really busy and
couldn't really, like,

42
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,203
take care of Finn.
- Wait, what kind of trip?

43
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:25,170
Finn is in need of like,
some major cuddles, so.

44
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,234
- What kind of trip?
- He's going on a guys trip.

45
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:30,870
(cheering)

46
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,260
We have hopefully a fun
day planned for these boys.

47
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,200
We just gotta get through this
morning and get to school.

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,840
All right, are we ready for school?

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,673
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

50
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,073
- Lets go.

51
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:46,300
Ollie, you're late,
you're late, you're late.

52
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,410
For a very important date, huh?

53
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,093
You're never late to school.

54
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:53,207
- Are you just kidding me?

55
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:54,903
- [Missy] No you really are late.

56
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,940
I think it'll be okay.

57
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,500
Bye baby, love you.
- Bye.

58
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,417
- Have a good day.

59
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,153
All right, I just dropped off Ollie.

60
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,850
And he was so cute.

61
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,479
He was late and they were actually doing

62
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,750
circle time at the time
and it was the first time

63
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,180
that I'd seen all his friends
get all excited to see him

64
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,930
and they were all like "Ollie,
Ollie come sit next to me".

65
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,150
And it was just so cute.

66
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,300
It's just fun to know
that your kid fits in

67
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,470
and has friends at school.

68
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,670
I am now though, headed probably to Finn.

69
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,120
I do have a horse-riding lesson today.

70
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,050
But I just want to make
sure Finn is doing good

71
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,050
before I head there.

72
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,020
I did want to say, I'm riding,

73
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm wearing my horsey jacket
that I bought a few weeks ago.

74
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,480
At like, a horse sale.

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,540
And I love this jacket.

76
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,370
And I've worn it quite a few times.

77
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,420
It's very like, easy to like, ride in

78
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,610
'cause it gives you lots of movement.

79
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,700
It's not like a jacket.

80
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,870
But it's also super warm.

81
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,013
But I realized today,

82
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,130
It smells.

83
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,320
It literally smells like horse.

84
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,140
But not like, good horse.

85
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,163
Kind of like, stinky poopy horse.

86
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,580
I'm like ew, I need to wash it.

87
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,730
So yeah, I probably
smell like a horse today.

88
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,520
But I don't really care
'cause I love horses.

89
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,040
I am off to go check on Finn
and make sure he's doing good.

90
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,700
So I am at Mimi and Papa's

91
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,960
and I was looking everywhere for Finn,

92
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,330
but he's not here.

93
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,050
Leo, what'd you do with him?

94
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,860
He's like don't talk to
me about that crazy kid.

95
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,600
I guess he was actually
in such a good mood,

96
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,310
that my dad ended up taking
him to go have some fun

97
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,160
and go do some stuff.

98
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,330
So, I'm scarfing down some
banana and peanut butter.

99
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,163
That's a lot of peanut butter,

100
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:30,243
I don't think I'm gonna eat all that.

101
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,110
And then I'm headed up to go
do my horse riding lesson,

102
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,730
which Finn might actually come up

103
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,520
and hang out for a
little bit but we'll see,

104
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,510
'cause my dad has him right now.

105
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm just gonna finish this up,

106
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,980
get some protein in my body

107
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,050
before I go work on my
horse for the next hour.

108
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,163
Hi Nacho.

109
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,603
Did you have a good day?

110
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm actually down here at the barn

111
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,530
and Papa brought Finn by.

112
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,480
He was so excited because
he found his Frankenstein

113
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,313
and he's been hanging out,

114
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:58,350
watching a little YouTube Kids.

115
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,070
Trying to relax, while
Mama has been working.

116
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,440
Oh my gosh, my hair is a mess.

117
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
How are you doing?

118
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,393
Are you happy?

119
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,510
That's how he's doing.

120
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,930
He had a fun time with Papa,

121
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,940
and then he decided to
come on down and hang out.

122
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,899
But, yeah, I think I'm
actually gonna head out now.

123
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,629
And go get Ollie and
we're all alone today.

124
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,170
So, daddy's not here, huh?

125
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,370
- Yeah.
- Did daddy go?

126
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:26,380
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

127
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,414
I am home now and look who's here.

128
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:30,880
Auntie's here
- Hey, what's going on?

129
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,410
- And when Finn is grumpy
and not feeling good,

130
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,640
he gets whatever he wants,

131
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,633
which means Rice Krispies Treats cereal.

132
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,700
I've had this in my cupboard for months

133
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,760
and we've never opened it.

134
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,480
I was actually giving it
to my sister and he saw it

135
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,910
and he was like, "I want some of that".

136
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,310
So, how is it Finn?
- Ball.

137
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,490
- Good, oh, ball.

138
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,710
Are you watching something on

139
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,440
- He's playing a ball game.
- Oh, you're playing a game.

140
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
- Yeah.
- Wow.

141
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,663
- Are you still happy you got Auntie?

142
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:00,260
(laughs)

143
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,290
- Yeah, and we are having some salad.

144
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,520
And my mom and dad were nice
enough to pick up Ollie for me,

145
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,050
so he will be here any minute.

146
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,790
He's going to be so excited
that Auntie is here.

147
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,680
So yeah, we're excited, huh?

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,741
Are you starting to get into a good mood?

149
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:18,793
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

150
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:19,970
- [Missy] Welcome home.

151
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,873
And who's here.

152
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,756
Are you so excited that Auntie's here?

153
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,589
- Yeah.

154
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,350
- [Missy] Was it fun having
Mimi and Papa pick you up too?

155
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

156
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,905
Hey Ollie, should we do
something fun with Auntie today?

157
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:31,840
- Yeah.

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,830
- What should we do?

159
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,370
Should we take her somewhere fun?

160
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,860
- Go to the park?
- Yeah.

161
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,980
- That'd be cool?

162
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,160
Yeah.

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,670
All right, we're outside
enjoying the weather.

164
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,906
It is so like, cool out today.

165
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:46,290
- It's like the perfect
kind of chilly weather.

166
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,388
- [Missy] I know.

167
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,425
- It's too cold for the pool, guys.

168
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,775
- [Missy] Yeah, the pool
is just a little cold, huh?

169
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:52,608
- Yeah.

170
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,900
- [Missy] Are you riding
your Strider Bike?

171
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,990
- No, it's actually a
motorcycle but a toy motorcycle.

172
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,710
- Oh, a toy motorcycle.

173
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,410
Well, there you go.

174
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,780
- [Auntie] I got you that bike.

175
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,915
- Yup.

176
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,940
- When you were two.
- When you were two years old.

177
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,026
- Now you're using it.
- Yeah and I had it but.

178
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,109
Now I'm four.

179
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,463
- Yep, all right, show me how fast you go.

180
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,241
Look at that motorcycle.

181
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,913
Show me how fast you go, Auntie.

182
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,813
They're crazy, huh?

183
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:26,613
- Was that cool guys?

184
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:29,073
- [Missy] So cool.

185
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:31,960
- Was that cool guys?

186
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,793
- [Missy] Yep

187
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,578
- [Missy] What did you say?

188
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:37,640
- The chick lay eggs.

189
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,710
- [Missy] Okay, let us know.

190
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,360
- Usually they lay eggs in this one.

191
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,193
- [Missy] Oh, in this one?

192
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,026
- Yeah.

193
00:06:43,922 --> 00:06:45,050
One egg.

194
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,450
- [Missy] One egg, good job.

195
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:50,140
- I think there's another egg guys.

196
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,600
- [Missy] Okay, lets keep looking.

197
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,020
They don't normally lay in this one, huh?

198
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,160
Oh my gosh.

199
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
They did huh?

200
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,320
We need our egg thing,
you wanna go get it?

201
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,340
The egg apron.

202
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,150
Karma, No.

203
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,090
- No, he's trying to put the bone in.

204
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,580
- [Missy] Let's see if any are in here.

205
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,663
Nope, none in there.

206
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,200
All right, lets go get our egg apron

207
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,851
so we can go get our eggs, okay?

208
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:13,684
- Okay.

209
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,797
- [Missy] Look who's wearing the apron now

210
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:19,308
- Ollie with the mustache

211
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,050
(laughs)

212
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,540
- [Missy] All right,
lets go get your eggs.

213
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,160
Come on Finny.

214
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,620
All right, he's getting
his eggs in his apron.

215
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,180
Good job, bud.

216
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,013
- Big one.

217
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,860
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, you
have so many eggs there.

218
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,070
How many eggs do you have?

219
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,550
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

220
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:47,970
- [Missy] Seven?

221
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,841
Wow.

222
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:49,674
- Chicken

223
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:50,507
- [Missy] You hear the chicken?

224
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:51,340
- Yeah.

225
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,173
- Wow.

226
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:55,110
So we are actually on our own today,

227
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,500
if you guys don't know it,
Bryan is off on a little trip.

228
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,860
And so we're on our own, huh?

229
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,040
- Yeah.

230
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,235
- Daddy left us, but
he'll be back soon, huh?

231
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,068
Yeah.

232
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:10,560
(upbeat music)

233
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:12,460
Go Ollie, go.

234
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,463
Go Ollie, go.

235
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,410
You're so good at that.

236
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,660
When did you get so good
at riding your bike?

237
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,529
Oh my gosh.

238
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:22,370
- [Mimi] Go get them.

239
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,990
Oh God, Oh God.

240
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,860
Someone's gonna get hurt.

241
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,147
- [Missy] Auntie, I'm calling
Auntie's getting hurt.

242
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:31,019
- She dropped her phone.

243
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,936
- [Missy] Oh she dropped her phone.

244
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:35,669
- Auntie, you dropped your phone.

245
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,489
- [Missy] Oh my gosh, the gate is open,

246
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,248
Finley Jay.

247
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:40,081
(laughs)

248
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,987
Oh my gosh, got her.

249
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,588
She dropped her phone.

250
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:47,671
(laughs)

251
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,650
Oh my gosh.

252
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,333
Auntie just saved Finn
from leaving the yard.

253
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,110
- [Mimi] The pressure
plates are awfully white.

254
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,447
- [Missy] I know, he
just like rides over it

255
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:05,500
and the gates open.

256
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,850
Auntie, did you just save his life?

257
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,263
- I saved his life, I
definitely saved his life.

258
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:13,000
I think I even scrapped my hands a bit,

259
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,890
but they're just black I think.

260
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,960
And my new shoes.

261
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,570
- [Missy] And what was he doing?

262
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,720
- He was going and then as
soon as he saw the gate open,

263
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,850
he hit the gas as hard as he could

264
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,927
and looked at me like,

265
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:25,970
"Oh yeah, I'm gonna go".
- Oh my gosh.

266
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,630
- I'm grabbing him and he
was still pressing the gas

267
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,362
as I was pulling him backwards.

268
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,270
- Oh my gosh.

269
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,760
He's never done that, like for us.

270
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,560
He was like, he knew you were like--

271
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,030
- I think it's because he
saw that I was chasing him,

272
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,037
so he decided it was like a game almost.

273
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,610
- Oh, that little stinker.

274
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,517
Papa is yelling at him now.

275
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,600
- [Mimi] I think he
just made a road block.

276
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,163
- Oh yeah, you guys have to play up here.

277
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,190
You crazy boy.

278
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,140
All right, we've got road
blocks and we've got gloves.

279
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,551
- I'm ready

280
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,801
- [Missy] And we are ready.

281
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,218
- Oh, Finn.

282
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:12,411
- It's like what, you think
I'ma go down that hill?

283
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,592
- I like hill.
- Down the hill.

284
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:15,736
- Go Finn.
- You gonna go down the hill?

285
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:16,569
- Yeah.
- Go.

286
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:18,132
- Are you, let's see if he pushes.

287
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:18,965
- [Missy] Go.

288
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:21,724
- Oh my gosh, he really done it.

289
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:23,800
Good thing we put it in reverse.

290
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,710
- [Missy] Go.

291
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,440
Ollie, who's here now?

292
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,030
- Carl and Ginger.

293
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,119
- Well, just Ginger.

294
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,110
(laughs)

295
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,943
Not Carl.

296
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:32,920
Carl is with Bryan.

297
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,810
But we've got the boys here

298
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,560
and Ollie and Finn are so excited.

299
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,393
They got here pretty late
so it is this one's bedtime.

300
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,900
It's actually Ollie's bedtime too

301
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,980
but I'm gonna let him stay up and play.

302
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,560
Finn on the other hand, is
just having a rough day.

303
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,620
I think I'm gonna have him go night night.

304
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,650
So, I'm trying something a
little bit different tonight.

305
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,710
Look at the room I'm in.

306
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,620
I haven't been in here
in many, many months.

307
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,480
He does sleep really good with Ollie.

308
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,200
But one, the last few
nights he's been getting up

309
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,000
a lot and he just hasn't
been sleeping very well.

310
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,080
Two we've got a lot of company over,

311
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,690
so I was gonna put him to bed in here.

312
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,330
So I've got his sound machine set up.

313
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,050
And his camera and got
his little bed in here.

314
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,480
He's like I'm turning this off

315
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,840
because I'm not sleeping in here mom.

316
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
But I'm so excited to rock
him in the rocking chair.

317
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,070
I haven't rocked him in so long.

318
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,950
This whole room is just so bare

319
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,520
'cause we've taken a lot of it and put it

320
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,650
in their now, other room.

321
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,790
And this I've been
meaning to move this out

322
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,197
so I can measure them.

323
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:33,880
I need to do that.

324
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,533
But yeah, I'm gonna try
to put this one to bed,

325
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,360
but I'm not gonna tell him.

326
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,900
All right, the boys are all in bed.

327
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,210
I got Finn to sleep.

328
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,570
- Our eyes are reflective.

329
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,440
- I know, we've got like,
our little patches right now.

330
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,920
- So we look like swan you guys.

331
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,599
- When the boys are away, it's girl time.

332
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,240
- Holla.

333
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,440
- So yeah, we have these
on and they're like,

334
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,210
de-puffing our eyes.

335
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,511
And hopefully making all
of the wrinkles go away.

336
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,344
- Wrinkles?

337
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,087
We do not have wrinkles, ew.

338
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,840
- We've got Finn asleep.

339
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,243
Ollie and Carl are trying to fall asleep.

340
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:11,076
- They're talking a lot.

341
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:13,280
- Yeah, they're just all so cute.

342
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,110
But yeah, we're finally
gonna sit down and relax.

343
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,350
And actually we're getting
ready to start a new show

344
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,597
that is coming out on NBC,
it started tonight for us

345
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:26,380
and it's called Rise
and my cousin is in it.

346
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,770
And he's actually like,
he's got a good part in it.

347
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,878
He's not just like a side
character, he's there.

348
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:32,711
- Which is really cool.

349
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,070
- Yeah, maybe he is like a side character

350
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,500
but he's not like an extra.

351
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,370
Like he's there, like he's in the show.

352
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,203
- He's an actual character.

353
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:39,230
