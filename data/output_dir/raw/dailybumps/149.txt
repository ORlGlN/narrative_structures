1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,135
- What do you think of these pumpkins

2
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,971
mama picked up yesterday?

3
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:03,804
- Good!

4
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:04,797
- [Man] Well don't go hugging them yet

5
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:08,380
because we are going
to destroy them today.

6
00:00:10,383 --> 00:00:13,133
(cheerful music)

7
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:34,328
- Good morning!

8
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:36,041
- [Man] Good morning dude!

9
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:36,905
What are you doing hanging out here

10
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:37,933
in laundry hamper?

11
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:41,041
- I was hiding whatnot in my room.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,708
- Good morning guys!

13
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:44,925
Today is gonna be a fun day,

14
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:46,269
oh you're putting it on me now?

15
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:48,362
Well that's gonna make my head look weird.

16
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:49,573
Weird for sure.

17
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:50,731
Guess what, Ollie?
- What?

18
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,033
- It is a beautiful day outside.

19
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,405
There's so many cool things for us to do,

20
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,172
and we're gonna have so much fun, okay?

21
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:58,236
- Oh, I love you.

22
00:00:58,236 --> 00:00:59,490
- Oh, I love you too.

23
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,639
So today is a very special day

24
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,893
because we have some
friends from out the town,

25
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:04,176
did you know that?

26
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:06,336
Yup, and they film some pretty cool stuff

27
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:07,347
here on YouTube,

28
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:08,630
and they're gonna film some epic stuff

29
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,480
for our channel.

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,355
You're gonna get to meet them.

31
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:11,654
Does that sound fun?

32
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,487
Yeah?

33
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:14,244
And look what Ollie can do now.

34
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:15,465
(laughter)

35
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:16,298
He can cross his fingers.

36
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:17,251
That's pretty good, dude.

37
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:20,280
This is how Ollie greets our new friends.

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,499
Everyone say hey,

39
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,441
we got Legendary Shots in the house.

40
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,931
Whole crew!

41
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:27,029
- What, you got two of them?

42
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:27,995
- [Bryan] Yeah, I do.

43
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:29,095
- I feel like Iron Man or something.

44
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,373
(Bryan laughs)

45
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,762
- I wonder if they can feel
the bold spots on your leg

46
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:34,284
from where we waxed them yesterday.

47
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:35,828
- [Bryan] I know right. (laughter)

48
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,058
- It's pretty pronounced.

49
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,041
- Legendary Shots does some crazy things

50
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:39,874
here on YouTube.

51
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:41,337
I'm gonna have their
channel linked in the iCard.

52
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:42,367
You should go check it out

53
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:43,308
'cause we're gonna be
filming a ton of fun stuff

54
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:44,142
today, right?

55
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:45,083
- It's gonna be awesome.

56
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,008
- Here's the beast.

57
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:49,039
- [Bryan] I know that is so cool, dude.

58
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,130
Hey, should we go experiment

59
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,339
with some chickens? - Yes.

60
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:52,172
- [Bryan] See what they do

61
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,952
when we throw them in the air?

62
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:55,833
(chatter)

63
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,392
Yeah, they were like freaking out.

64
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,225
'Cause they were like,

65
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,847
"We've never done slow mo of a chicken!"

66
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:00,830
- We haven't, it's weird.

67
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,155
- This may be your only chance.

68
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:05,905
(exciting music)

69
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,858
How many frames is this, you guys?

70
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:11,108
- This is 5765.

71
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:14,112
- [Bryan] Oh my Gosh!

72
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:15,829
- You still clear 720 ps.

73
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:17,490
- [Bryan] Oh my Gosh, babe.

74
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,993
That's nuts.

75
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:20,201
What do you think about
seeing your chickens

76
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,093
fly like that?

77
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:23,852
- They actually look very like majestic,

78
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,100
and very cool.

79
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,457
- [Bryan] The people get to see, like,

80
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:27,585
how beautiful they actually are.

81
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:29,758
- Yeah, like, I had no
idea how they, like, use,

82
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,187
I don't think they know how to use them.

83
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:32,544
They're like (clucking sound).

84
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:33,377
(laughter)

85
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:35,143
- [Bryan] Yeah, that's pretty cool.

86
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,498
- They cover their entire body

87
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,400
with the entire, like, wings.

88
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,320
- Actually, they have a
pretty broad, like, wing span.

89
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,164
- [Bryan] It's so cool.

90
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:41,997
- Their feathers all flare out,

91
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:42,830
it look pretty cool.

92
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,312
- Alright, the family is here right now.

93
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:46,397
Actually, I think auntie
is coming over soon.

94
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:47,436
Uncle should be,

95
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:48,615
is Uncle coming over?

96
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:49,448
- I think so.

97
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:51,236
- We're making the big
old family get together.

98
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:52,338
We're having a lot of fun.

99
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,837
Just making videos and
doing some fun stuff.

100
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,742
And my mom and dad are here to help,

101
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,893
and it's gonna be a fun day.

102
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:01,115
(exciting music)

103
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,816
- Alright, boys, what to
you think of these pumpkins

104
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,535
mama picked up yesterday?

105
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:05,417
- Good!

106
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,700
- [Bryan] They're huge, huh?

107
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,894
Well don't go hugging them yet

108
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:13,273
because we are going
to destroy them today.

109
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,837
- Should we smash them?

110
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,612
(hums approvingly)

111
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:18,486
- [Bryan] They're like
getting really attached

112
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:20,289
to the pumpkins now.

113
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:21,891
Yeah guys (laughs).

114
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:24,231
As you guys know, Halloween
is fast approaching,

115
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:25,917
and we love celebrating early,

116
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,546
so Missy picked up some pumpkins,

117
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:30,561
and we are going to
smash them in slow motion

118
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:32,550
with the help of Legendary Shots,

119
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,113
so that you guys can see
what exactly this looks like.

120
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:37,452
Don't go do this on Halloween, you guys.

121
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:39,231
Don't go to people's
doors and smash pumpkins.

122
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,064
Did you ever do that?

123
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:41,629
- They're not gonna like
that. No, I'm not a hooligan.

124
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:42,816
- [Bryan] Yeah, we don't do that.

125
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:43,942
We're good kids.

126
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:45,872
Just get your own pumpkins
and smash them yourself

127
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:47,638
at your house (laughs).

128
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:49,040
- And have at least have
6000 frames per second.

129
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,456
- [Bryan] 6000 frames per second.

130
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:51,319
- Then put it on YouTube.

131
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,355
- Let's do this!

132
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,346
(exciting music)

133
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:57,222
- Check out this sledgehammer, you guys.

134
00:03:57,222 --> 00:04:00,353
I am so excited to be
smashing some pumpkins today.

135
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:02,092
And the boys got the
best seat in the house.

136
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,137
- [Missy] They're all ready.

137
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:05,027
- You're ready to see what happens?

138
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:05,860
- [Children] Yeah!

139
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,715
- I wanna see if I can make a mess.

140
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:07,706
- [Missy] Yeah!

141
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,146
Say, "Yeah"!

142
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:10,487
- Yeah!

143
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:13,237
(exciting music)

144
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:16,882
- I hope it won't get on us.

145
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,715
- [Bryan] It won't.

146
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,034
- [Missy] Here we go.

147
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:21,784
(exciting music)

148
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:26,045
- Look at that hole!

149
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:31,942
(exciting music)

150
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:47,378
(screams excitedly)

151
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,757
- [Legendary Shots Guy]
Wasn't that so cool, dude?

152
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,899
- Yeah, I wanted to see.

153
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,116
- [Missy] Seeds are everywhere.

154
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,276
- [Bryan] Check out the
remnants of the pumpkin, dude.

155
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:57,221
- [Missy] He smashed that
thing to pieces, huh?

156
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:59,035
- Here's the top.

157
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,357
We have the top right there.

158
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:04,199
We got some seeds and
goopy stuff coming out.

159
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,225
Isn't that gross?

160
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:07,008
(Missy screams in disgust)

161
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,758
(exciting music)

162
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,263
- [Missy] Nice!

163
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,343
- [Legendary Shots Guy] Houdini split!

164
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:26,420
(Bryan screams excitedly)

165
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,819
- [Missy] You did it!
There it is! (laughs)

166
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,224
- [Legendary Shots Guy]
Like, split it in half!

167
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:32,431
- [Missy] Yeah, that looks awesome.

168
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:33,441
- [Legendary Shots] What do you think?

169
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:36,138
- Halloween don't come
around here no more!

170
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:38,888
(exciting music)

171
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:53,412
- [Legendary Shots Guy
1] That was awesome!

172
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:54,740
- [Legendary Shots Guy
2] That was so cool!

173
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,978
- It exploded!

174
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:57,987
- [Legendary Shots Guy
1] Are you okay, dude?

175
00:05:57,987 --> 00:05:59,181
- [Bryan] You got seeds all over you.

176
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,038
(laughter)

177
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:01,088
Look at this.

178
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:02,840
- [Legendary Shots Guy 2] Pumpkin, aw.

179
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,855
You kept her face though.
- This is okay.

180
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,199
- [Legendary Shots Guy 2]
Yeah, she's got a face.

181
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,384
- Make up still dead (laughs).

182
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:11,147
- Eyebrows on fleek, eyebrows on fleek!

183
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:12,780
(exciting music)

184
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,416
- This is seriously so much fun.

185
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,750
We are now breaking out the tractor.

186
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,082
Just gonna break some stuff.

187
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:20,229
- This is what guys live of.

188
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,195
- [Bryan] I know, dude.

189
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,608
This is so cool.

190
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:23,907
(tractor noise)

191
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:25,084
- [Legendary Shots Guy] Oh, that's muddy.

192
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,523
- [Bryan] Muddy!

193
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:29,682
Whatever goes under there is
getting demolished, you guys.

194
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:32,726
(exciting music)

195
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,067
We're doing some soda cans.

196
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,126
Shaking them up first,

197
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:38,111
see if we can get some cool explosions.

198
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,198
Is that your camera
running hot? Is that a fan?

199
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,781
- Yeah, I mean it's got like a massive fan

200
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,397
just sitting here.
- Dude that's working hard.

201
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,688
How cool is this, Jim (laughs)?

202
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:47,780
He's loving this.

203
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,831
Smash those babies!

204
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:50,664
It's gonna get all over us

205
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,039
oh my God back off, back off.

206
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,060
Back off, dude.

207
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,238
(exciting music)

208
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:57,655
Oh (laughs)!

209
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,510
- Look at this, I got soaked.

210
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,465
- [Bryan] Dude!

211
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,887
- Oh my God.

212
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,167
- [Bryan] Hey, at least
there's no sugar in there.

213
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,802
- Yeah, at least it's just like.

214
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,531
- [Bryan] I know (laughs).

215
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,025
That was so cool.

216
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,130
Ten years ago did you
think you'd be sitting here

217
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,016
on a tractor?

218
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,710
- That I would be smashing cans.

219
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,428
- [Bryan] And pumpkins (laughs).

220
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:19,787
This is so cool.

221
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:20,722
I'm glad we have a tractor,

222
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:22,745
we can do cool stuff like this (laughs).

223
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:25,833
This is how you have fun
with the tractor, you guys.

224
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,467
Oh, smells!

225
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,299
(exciting music)

226
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,496
Hey, Fin!

227
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,282
Did you hear that chainsaw?

228
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:33,115
- Yeah.

229
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:35,270
- It's loud, huh (laughs)?

230
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,242
What should we do with it?

231
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:37,475
- Say, "Smash them"!

232
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:38,308
- Halloween he said.

233
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,423
- [Bryan] Halloween!

234
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:42,167
That's like his favorite word
right now, it's Halloween.

235
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,548
So we have broken out the chainsaw,

236
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:48,666
and now we are going to
destroy a watermelon.

237
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,034
How is this gonna work, you guys?

238
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,517
- [Legendary Shoots Guy] We're
gonna full rev that thing,

239
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:54,535
and drop a watermelon on it.

240
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:56,945
- [Bryan] I'm gonna get covered
in watermelon, you guys!

241
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:58,661
I'm telling you!

242
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,144
Should I put up a shield or something?

243
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:01,140
This is gonna be funny.

244
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,235
- Alright, so for the next idea,

245
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:05,890
they have a chainsaw and a watermelon.

246
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,966
Now the boys think that they
if they put it up full blast

247
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,971
and drop the watermelon on to the blade,

248
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,451
it'll just slice it right at half,

249
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,135
kinda like Fruit Ninja.

250
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:17,326
I don't think that's gonna happen.

251
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:18,941
We're gonna find out right now.

252
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:21,691
(exciting music)

253
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:25,798
(screams) It worked!

254
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,632
- That was actually awesome!

255
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:29,465
We did it!

256
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,467
(chatter)

257
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,904
- [Missy] You were like
a real life Fruit Ninja.

258
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:36,539
- Fruit Ninja in real life!

259
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,095
- I really wanna eat it
but it's covered in dirt.

260
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:40,659
- [Missy] Let's just
rinse it up and eat it.

261
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,284
- That's how queen cut
the [Incomprehensible].

262
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:46,202
- [Missy] Yeah, yeah (laughs)!

263
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:50,044
I know, I did not think that would happen!

264
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:51,727
Alright, we're going for it again.

265
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,644
(chainsaw buzzing)

266
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:58,381
(exciting music)

267
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,746
Oh my God.

268
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:05,701
- [Bryan] They got 'em!

269
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:06,633
They got 'em all, look at that!

270
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:10,622
- So, the boys are still having a blast

271
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:12,404
cutting things up, exploding things.

272
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:13,641
It's been pretty cool to watch.

273
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:15,569
Fin's actually napping and Ollie went off

274
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:16,428
to hang out with Mimi,

275
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:19,456
so I decided I'm gonna head
over to Kelsey and Corbin's

276
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:20,800
and help them unpack.

277
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,874
I was kinda planning
on doing this anyways,

278
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,224
and the boys were just on a roll

279
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:26,472
doing all kinds of stuff,

280
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:27,305
and I was like,

281
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,784
alright I'm heading out
since Fin's taking a nap.

282
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,460
So I'm really excited to go see

283
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,596
how much progress they've made,

284
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,120
all the stuff in their house.

285
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,501
I'm excited to help them,
like, set it all up, yay!

286
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,483
Alright, I'm at Kelsey and Corbin's.

287
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,511
Look! They have a living room!

288
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,303
- Look at that stuff!

289
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:44,134
- [Missy] (laughs) And
boxes and, like, things,

290
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:45,931
like, you guys don't have nothing.

291
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,317
You have things (laughs).

292
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,416
June's just happy she's got her little,

293
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,842
her little gym (laughs).

294
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,854
She looks so happy (laughs).

295
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:56,708
We are unpacking.

296
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,274
I've actually just seen June's room,

297
00:09:58,274 --> 00:09:59,455
it looks so cute.

298
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:00,501
I'm not gonna show it though,

299
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:01,943
'cause you guys will have
to go to check it out

300
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:02,784
on their channel.

301
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,641
But now we're gonna work on the kitchen,

302
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:07,254
and I gotta say they
have a lot of cabinets,

303
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:09,216
so this should be fun (laughs).

304
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:10,808
- I know right.

305
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:12,214
Why don't we put everything?

306
00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:13,106
- [Missy] I know!

307
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:16,004
Yeah, and they get their
dining room table today,

308
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:18,296
so it's like we're soon
gonna be able to do, like,

309
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:20,520
family dinners here.

310
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,265
- And we'll actually cook for you guys.

311
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:25,565
- Yeah! We can put the kids to bed

312
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:27,850
'cause they'll have like a little room.

313
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,619
It's gonna be so fun!

314
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,320
Alright, we gotta get to work!

315
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,037
You actually have a lot of kitchen things.

316
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:36,137
- I know, this is still a kitchen.

317
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,750
(laughter)

318
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,209
- [Missy] Like, for the small kitchen,

319
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:40,498
that you guys did have,

320
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:42,314
you might just fill
everything in here (laughs).

321
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:43,446
- [Guy] I know.

322
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:44,406
Love you!

323
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:45,401
- Kiss me back.

324
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:47,207
- [Missy] Saying bye byes.

325
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,576
(laughs)

326
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,046
The boys have been hanging
out here and playing,

327
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:54,575
and then I came, and me and
Cassie did a few workouts.

328
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,440
Good workout, Cass!

329
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,437
And, as you guys can see,
I achieved my workout goal.

330
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:01,017
I just haven't finished my move goal.

331
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:02,210
I definitely need to workout now.

332
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,998
But I'm getting better
at trying to figure out

333
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,522
how to make this thing work.

334
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:10,102
- [Bryan] Hey Fin, why are you
walking like that (laughs)?

335
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:14,123
I think that means something (laughs).

336
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:16,066
- Let's see!
- [Bryan] He's so funny.

337
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,304
- I think that it's just pee.

338
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:18,476
- [Bryan] That's funny,
he's just being silly.

339
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,226
- Maybe he is [Incomprehensible].

340
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,398
- [Bryan] Yeah.

341
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:24,436
What are you gonna do?

342
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:25,762
Is that how you walk now?

343
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:27,446
Oh my Gosh, look at them.

344
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:29,146
Fin's like copying him (laughs).

345
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,731
Missy and the boys just got back come,

346
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,002
and they're so cute.

347
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:33,391
Why are you boys so cute?

348
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,233
Every day they just
surprise me with, like,

349
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:38,405
something new they say or act or.

350
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:40,091
Ollie can you walk like Fin?

351
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:41,235
With your legs open like that?

352
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,246
Like you got a poo poo in your diaper?

353
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:47,309
(laughs) Poo poo diaper
walk, poo poo diaper walk!

354
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,142
(laughs)

355
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,603
Alright, Ollie is gonna vlog me doing

356
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:50,654
the poopy diaper walk, you ready?

357
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:52,654
Stay right there, watch!

358
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,622
Poopy diaper walk! Poopy diaper walk!

359
00:11:58,606 --> 00:11:59,753
(Fin screams excitedly)

360
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,317
(laughter)

361
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:02,896
Ollie, you're a good vlogger!

362
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,016
Now you're showing them Carmen,

363
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,793
ain't that cool?

364
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:06,931
- [Ollie] Carmen!

365
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:08,694
- [Bryan] We get to start
that on October first,

366
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,527

367
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,914
- [Ollie] Then it's gonna be Halloween!

368
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:14,098
And we get to eat the candy!

369
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:16,339
- Anyway, that's all for today's video,

370
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,137
but we had so much fun colabbing with

371
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,216
Legendary Shots today.

372
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:21,024
Be sure you're following
their YouTube page,

373
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:22,434
as well as their Instagram.

374
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,715
A lot of the videos that we shot

375
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,534
are gonna be up on Instagram, too.

376
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:27,564
As always, if you're not
following me on Instagram,

377
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:28,440
you should as well

378
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,357
because I post lots of
cute awesome fun photos

379
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:32,327
all the time.

380
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,673
Cute photos of my boys by the way,

381
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:34,809
not cute photos of me.

382
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,036
I mean some people may
probably think them cute,

383
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,133
I don't know if I would
classify them as cute,

384
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,941
but I post photos (laughs).

385
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:42,833
But anyway, thanks for
