1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,620
(happy music)

2
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:20,635
- Okay you guys the party has begun

3
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:21,940
and all the kids are having a blast

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,052
but I just got this
really weird text message

5
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:26,126
from my buddy Batman, he
said he was gonna come

6
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,928
by and bring a couple of friends.

7
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:28,761
Oh look.

8
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:29,594
Oh look.

9
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,380
There his invisible jet.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,213
- [Mom] Oh there it is.

11
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:33,126
- They're flying in.

12
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:34,547
I think they're circling around right now.

13
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:37,231
Invisible jet you can't see it but ...

14
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,508
He's on Find my Friends,
so I know where he is.

15
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:40,686
♫ This is our life

16
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:41,619
♫ This is our fun

17
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,991
♫ This is who we are

18
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:45,207
♫ This is our dream

19
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:46,269
♫ This is our team

20
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,009
♫ Trying to moon the stars

21
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,811
♫ Take the shoe it'll be fine

22
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,314
♫ Take this hand and watch the show

23
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,897
♫ Lets live it

24
00:00:58,176 --> 00:00:59,675
♫ Live it forever

25
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:02,758
Good morning and happy birthday Finn.

26
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:10,001
My little guy you're
growing up so fast. (ding)

27
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:10,851
Finn, are you so excited!

28
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:11,865
We're having your birthday party today!

29
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,408
- Where Batman?

30
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:14,463
- Where's Batman?

31
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:16,129
- Batman!
- Guess what?

32
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:16,962
- [Bryan] What?

33
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:18,358
- The real superheroes are coming!

34
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:19,248
- What?

35
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,306
No.

36
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:22,051
Ollie doesn't know what
he's talking about.

37
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:26,073
We are throwing a superhero
party for our little Finny

38
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:29,278
because he's going to be
two in just a couple of days

39
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:30,984
but we're having his birthday party today

40
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:32,693
with all his friends and family.

41
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,790
- Yeah!

42
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,724
- Yeah!

43
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:37,119
Hey Finn, who is your favorite super hero?

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,830
- Batman and Robin!

45
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,988
- Batman and Robin!

46
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:43,506
The boys are going to be
dressing up, Missy's dressed up

47
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:45,701
and we're getting the house
ready so let's go see.

48
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,897
I'm so excited, I can't believe he's two!

49
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:50,176
He's so smart and lovable!

50
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,355
(chittering)

51
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:54,525
He's very excited for his superhero party

52
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:55,545
if you couldn't tell.

53
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:58,543
Well hello to the cutest
little Wonder Woman

54
00:01:58,543 --> 00:01:59,964
I ever did see!

55
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:02,131
She looks so cute, Kelsey!

56
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,466
And we've got Wonder Woman
in the flesh, incarnate.

57
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,453
My wife is actually a
Wonder Woman, you guys.

58
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:09,876
Look at what she's doing right now,

59
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:11,459
setting up this whole party!

60
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,611
You're amazing and you look good

61
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,747
in that Wonder Woman outfit.

62
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:16,660
You and June are matching, that's so cute!

63
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,225
June, are you helping
set up for the party?

64
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:20,117
Yeah?

65
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:20,950
Hi baby!

66
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:25,559
All right, we just got the
cutest birthday message

67
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:28,851
from our friends Carl and
Ginger and all the boys!

68
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:29,909
- You wanna see it?

69
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:30,761
- [Bryan] You want to see it?

70
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:33,043
- Okay, here it is!

71
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:35,240
♫ Happy Birthday to you

72
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,598
♫ Happy Birthday to you

73
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,119
♫ Happy Birthday, Dear Finn

74
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,925
♫ Happy Birthday to you! ♫

75
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:45,772
(giggling)

76
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:47,801
- [Bryan] That's so cute, huh, Finn?

77
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,859
- Did you like that?

78
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:50,199
- [Bryan] Can you say thank you?

79
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,334
- Say thank you.

80
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,078
- Thank you.

81
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:54,053
- Thank you.

82
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:54,986
Who is that?

83
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:56,085
- [Finn] Smash!

84
00:02:56,085 --> 00:03:00,185
- [Bryan] We have the
Hulk, Spiderman and Thor!

85
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,339
That's so neat, dude!

86
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,418
- Can you say Hulk smash?

87
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,269
- Smash!

88
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,845
- [Bryan] Ollie, you
need to see this balloon

89
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:12,012
that we got for Finn, it is Spiderman!

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,860
It's so intricate.

91
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:17,673
It's kind of weird.

92
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:19,463
Wait, there's another one!

93
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:20,843
This is what happens when you put Mimi

94
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:22,344
and Pawpaw in charge of balloons.

95
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:23,847
They go all out, look at that.

96
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:26,408
It's Batman, oh my gosh!

97
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:29,175
Finn is totally going to freak out!

98
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,758
(upbeat music)

99
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:42,149
- We got a bouncy house!

100
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,302
Finn is going to be excited!

101
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:45,302
- Yes he is!

102
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,839
Ollie is testing out the bouncy house

103
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:50,442
while Finn takes his nap
because he needs some energy

104
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:52,957
for this rager we're throwing him!

105
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:55,707
(exciting music)

106
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:58,899
- Nananana Batman!

107
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,232
- Nanana Batman!

108
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,395
Look at my little guy.

109
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,015
We have Batman here!

110
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,852
What's Batman without Robin?

111
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,148
(action sounds)

112
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,688
Whoa!

113
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,305
Are you loving this Finn?

114
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:13,440
(laughs)

115
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,877
Whoa, you're way up there, dude!

116
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:19,856
Whoa, you guys are like real superheroes!

117
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:21,351
- We are real superheroes!

118
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:25,201
- [Bryan] Oh, you are? (laughs)

119
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,132
As he tumbles off!

120
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,307
Are you okay, buddy?

121
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:29,456
Alright, babe, what are
you setting up over here?

122
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:32,051
- We've got a pumpkin painting station.

123
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:32,984
- Oh awesome!

124
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:35,089
So all the kids can
create their own pumpkin

125
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,386
and take it home with them!

126
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:37,357
- Yep.

127
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:38,190
- It's a good idea for
this time of year, babe.

128
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,345
Are you having fun in this bouncy?

129
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,178
- Yeah!

130
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:41,171
- [Bryan] All the guests
are gonna start showing up

131
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,403
really soon!
- Yeah!

132
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:44,578
- [Bryan] You so excited to play?

133
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:45,411
- Guests is coming!

134
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,244
- All our friends are coming.

135
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,334
- All my friends.

136
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:50,450
- [Bryan] Your friends
and Finn's friends, huh?

137
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,283
- Yeah.

138
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:53,243
- Oh, I think Finn's going down the slide.

139
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:54,076
Go with him, hurry!

140
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,476
Oh my gosh!

141
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:59,643
Ollie, you dragged him down
and I think Finn loved it!

142
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,443
(smooth music)

143
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,808
Bailey is here!

144
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,835
Bailey, who are you for
the superhero party?

145
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:29,335
- My name's Harley Quinn.

146
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:30,553
- [Bryan] Harley Quinn.

147
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:32,624
Are you daddy's monster? (laugh)

148
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,208
Go play, kiddos!

149
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,681
All the kiddos have arrived

150
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:38,258
and they're taking over the bouncy house.

151
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,658
CJ's reppin' the Batman!

152
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,241
(swanky music)

153
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:49,916
You got your Hulk hand on, Ollie?

154
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,833
Three, two, one, smash!

155
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,769
Smash, Bailey, smash!

156
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:55,686
Hulk smash!

157
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:59,258
I have just entered the
super secret superhero,

158
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,372
what is this, hide out?

159
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:03,809
Finn's like, "Save me!"

160
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:06,732
Oh no, Harley Quinn
broke into the hide out!

161
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:10,711
You guys, Harley Quinn
broke into the hide out.

162
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,461
Don't let her escape!

163
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:34,945
We've got Cat Woman in the house!

164
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:40,156
We've got Robin versus
Spiderman right now.

165
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:42,027
Who is going to win,

166
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,179
Spidey or Robin?

167
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:47,262
Oh, Robin found a secret hiding spot.

168
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,231
Whoa, look at that strong hulk.

169
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:54,780
Finn is ready for the
birthday party of the century.

170
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,113
You ready, Finn?

171
00:06:57,103 --> 00:07:00,770
Look at all you superheroes
looking so good!

172
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,425
Whoa, we've got some more superheroes!

173
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:10,348
- [Molly] You guys look so cute!

174
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,482
You're Bat Girl!

175
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:13,475
- [Bryan] Bat Girl!

176
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,900
- [Mommy] Did you find your Carol?

177
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,070
- I know I'm soaking it all in.

178
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,141
- [Molly] I know, he's so cute.

179
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:21,391
Are you Batman?

180
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,147
He's like, "Take this!"

181
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:30,434
(epic music)

182
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:36,056
- The party has begun and all
the kids are having a blast

183
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,925
but I just got this
really weird text message

184
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,687
from my buddy Batman and he
said he was going to come

185
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:43,042
by and bring a couple of friends.

186
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:44,587
- Yeah.

187
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:45,420
- So I think he's on his way right now.

188
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,576
Oh look, oh look!

189
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:49,133
Yep, there's his invisible jet.

190
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,393
They're flying in in the invisible jet.

191
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:51,653
Where are they going to
park that thing, babe?

192
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,074
Probably in the dirt field.

193
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:56,574
I think they're circling around right now.

194
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:58,884
Invisible jet, you can't see it but

195
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:01,239
he's on Find My Friends,
so I know where he is.

196
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,714
- I have Wonder Woman
vision, so I can see it.

197
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:06,153
- [Bryan] (laughs) I don't
think that's a thing, babe.

198
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,070
- Whatever.

199
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:11,700
(epic music)

200
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:16,238
- Well hey, guys, thanks for showing up!

201
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:20,868
We got some of my friends
showing up for the party.

202
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,307
I think we have a few kids
who would like to say hello.

203
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:26,155
(muffled speech)

204
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:26,988
Yeah.

205
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,921
Come on in, guys!

206
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:31,394
(muffled speech)

207
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,953
- How's it going, superheroes?

208
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:36,286
- I can't believe they came!

209
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,310
(epic music)

210
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:48,128
- So superheroes, first of all,

211
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,242
I just want to say you
all look so awesome!

212
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:53,664
Very, very good job on your costumes.

213
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:56,677
You're going to get a
lot of candy this year.

214
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:59,260
(swanky music)

215
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,858
- [Bryan] There he is.

216
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,671
Say, "Hi dude!"

217
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:11,906
Danananananana Dananana!

218
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:15,199
He knows your song even, Batman.

219
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,032
Don't you?

220
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:20,032
- Hey Finn, we hear you're
celebrating something really,

221
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:21,658
really special today.

222
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:23,284
I hear that you just graduated
college, is that right?

223
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:27,451
And we also heard that he
has the best friends that--

224
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:31,687
(swanky music)

225
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,850
Who here wants to be a superhero tonight?

226
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,933
(wooing)

227
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:53,081
- Spidey's about to
show them all his pose!

228
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:53,914
Woo!

229
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:15,296
(grunting)

230
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:18,296
- Say it even scarier, "I'm Batman!"

231
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,605
You want to come step over here, buddy?

232
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:28,325
Do a superhero pose,
all right, let's do it.

233
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:30,036
One, two, three!

234
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:30,869
Whoa!

235
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:36,839
- [Bryan] Nice job, Ollie!

236
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:43,394
(cheering)

237
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:46,998
(grunting)

238
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:49,845
(laughing)

239
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:52,845
Whoa, whoa, whoa, he's got his foot!

240
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,520
He's got his foot!

241
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:04,776
Who do you think is going to win?

242
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:05,609
- Spiderman!

243
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:06,442
- Spiderman?

244
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:07,275
Oh!

245
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,137
- Whoa, I'm really dizzy.

246
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:13,428
All I can see is a man in a blue suit.

247
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:15,345
That must be Spiderman!

248
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,694
(grunting)

249
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:22,444
- [Bryan] She's got him, get him!

250
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,535
- Wonder Woman?

251
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:27,307
Let me go!

252
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,557
(laughter)

253
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:36,224
- You were trying to attack me.

254
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:38,255
- I'm sorry, I got a little light headed!

255
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:40,672
(epic music)

256
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:47,359
- Bryan She got him in the shin!

257
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,026
(nursery music)

258
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:52,683
Poor Spiderman!

259
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:53,516
Hey girl!

260
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,664
Wonder Woman just beat up Spiderman.

261
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:59,081
(slow music)

262
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:07,667
- Wake up, Spider Chicken Baby!

263
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,001
- Did somebody say Spider Chicken Baby?

264
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,343
(laughter)

265
00:12:13,343 --> 00:12:14,484
- Which one is your favorite, Peyton?

266
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,744
- That one.

267
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:16,842
- Wonder Woman?

268
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:18,509
She's cool, huh.

269
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,383
All right, we're going to take
the superhero oath, Ollie.

270
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:22,579
Raise your hand, raise your hand, Ollie.

271
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:25,579
(audience laughter)

272
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:32,070
(swanky music)

273
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:50,134
Hey Spidey, what happened
to your head, bro'?

274
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:52,736
- It came off, it just started to float.

275
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:55,704
I think it can make it out the front door.

276
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:58,549
Maybe my head wants to wear me?

277
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:01,962
- [Bryan] Yeah, we seem
to have lost the head

278
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,045
on the Spiderman balloon.

279
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,556
Good luck, Ollie.

280
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:50,605
Look at this giant tower that they aww!

281
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,368
All right, kiddos!

282
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,213
You can't use your hands,
hands behind your back.

283
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,324
The first one to eat their
donut wins with no hands.

284
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:02,383
Ready?

285
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,050
Three, two, one, go!

286
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:11,990
Get it, Ollie, get it!

287
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,157
Get it, C.J., get it C.J.!

288
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:17,720
Spidey, that's cheating!

289
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,637
Get it Ollie, get it Ollie, get it!

290
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:30,628
- This party has been so fun!

291
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:32,454
- It's so cool and now it is pinata time.

292
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,287
- Yeah.

293
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,844
- Check out this rig we
have to hold the pinata.

294
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:38,066
- Yeah.

295
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,038
- We've never had before.

296
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:39,871
- Normally, you have to find a tree

297
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,556
and you have to find a
way to get it rigged up

298
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:44,403
and this is what we have this year.

299
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:45,338
It's a whole station for it.

300
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:46,434
Yay!

301
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:47,739
He's got a Batman one!

302
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:52,168
- [Bryan] Finn is going to
start the pinata off first.

303
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:55,418
We're putting Spidey in charge of this?

304
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,243
- Yeah.

305
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:03,544
- All right, you've got this.

306
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:05,898
Hit me right in the face!

307
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:06,731
One, two, three, go.

308
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,398
One, two, three, go.

309
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:13,369
Stop hitting yourself,
stop hitting yourself.

310
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:14,751
- [Bryan] Spidey is waterskiing right now

311
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,026
on this pinata contraption.

312
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:18,776
Hit it, Wonder Woman!

313
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:33,037
All right, Ollie, you're up next.

314
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:35,870
You going to tear this thing open?

315
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,395
- Here we go, buddy.

316
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,228
Here's your weapon.

317
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:41,406
- Swing, get it!

318
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:43,071
Woo!

319
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,104
Okay, that's enough.

320
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,177
Bro, those were some hits.

321
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,437
That was pretty strong.

322
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,061
You got some pretty big muscles?

323
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:50,894
Yeah?

324
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:07,532
- Would I be nervous if I was this pinata?

325
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,782
(laughter)

326
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:18,077
- [Bryan] You got the arm off!

327
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,562
- [Batman] One, two, three!

328
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:28,246
(cheering)

329
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:29,579
- [Bryan] Candy!

330
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:33,722
- Candy, candy!

331
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,496
- [Bryan] Good job, C.J.!

332
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,965
- Birthday boy coming in!

333
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:46,740
- [Bryan] Grab some candy.

334
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:49,724
- You get candy?

335
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:53,774
- [Bryan] Go some candy, buddy!

336
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,110
Happy Birthday, Finn.

337
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,897
Are you having fun?

338
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:01,730
- Yeah.

339
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:04,470
- [Bryan] Yeah?

340
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,803
♫ Happy Birthday to you

341
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:12,152
♫ Happy Birthday to you

342
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:15,819
♫ Happy Birthday, dear Finn

343
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:21,930
♫ Happy Birthday to you! ♫

344
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,106
(cheering)

345
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:28,323
Blow 'em out, buddy, blow 'em out.

346
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,323
Woo, one more, one more!

347
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,517
(cheering)

348
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,340
- The superheroes have
a little birthday gift,

349
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,507
for you, Finn!

350
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:45,748
This is a superhero birthday medallion!

351
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:47,896
This means that Finn here is in charge

352
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,896
for the rest of the day.

353
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:53,135
- You have to do whatever he says!

354
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:54,478
- [Bryan] All right.

355
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:56,224
- Do whatever he says.

356
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:57,890
You got to be super nice to him.

357
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,473
Give him some awesome presents.

358
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:03,295
Alright, Finn, this may
weigh as much as you,

359
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:04,391
so hopefully it won't
bring you down but I bestow

360
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:05,409
upon you the superhero
leadership medallion!

361
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:07,561
(cheering)

362
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:08,561
- Yeah Finn!

363
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:13,617
Take a bite of your cake, Finn, woo!

364
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,238
Whoa!

365
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:16,296
That yummy?

366
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:20,070
- Guys, thank you all so
much for having us out.

367
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,860
- [Bryan] Thank you!

368
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,193
Bye guys, thanks for coming.

369
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:28,766
- Happy Birthday, Finn!

370
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:29,784
- [Bryan] Bye Spidey!

371
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:30,617
- Bye!

372
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:37,432
- [Bryan] Finn gets all
the love on his birthday!

373
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:38,849
We all love Finn!

374
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:48,044
We got the crew out here
painting some pumpkins.

375
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,399
How's it going Peyton?

376
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:51,982
That looks so cool.

377
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,718
What color are you doing?

378
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,361
- She was sharing purple with me.

379
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,861
- [Bryan] Oh cool!

380
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,109
It's Karma Batman, Dogman!

381
00:19:06,902 --> 00:19:07,735
Dananana!

382
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:11,922
(slow music)

383
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,225
We are opening presents.

384
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:23,862
What?

385
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,945
Is that a Spiderman bike?

386
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,523
What?

387
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:34,402
He got a Spiderman ATV?

388
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:35,652
That's so cool!

389
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,717
What?

390
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,703
It's got web blasters on the front.

391
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:41,800
I know.

392
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,259
Ollie, what are you doing?

393
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,417
That's way too small for you.

394
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,250
Whoa!

395
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,420
Ahh!

396
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,994
That means thank you!

397
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,411
- You're welcome.

398
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:58,550
- [Bryan] In Finn's language.

399
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,403
- Well, bud,

400
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:01,233
that concludes your second
birthday party, huh?

401
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,066
- Mhmm.

402
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,165
- Was that a fun day?

403
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:05,998
- Yeah.

404
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:06,834
- You had so much fun, huh?

405
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:10,689
You got to play with all
your favorite superheroes,

406
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:11,581
all your friends!

407
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,045
It was such a fun day but I will say

408
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,401
that he is still one.

409
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:19,056
He has one more day left of being one.

410
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:19,889
- Yeah!

411
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,736
- So you are still my baby

412
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:24,052
because you're still only one.

413
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:25,513
We had such a fun day.

414
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:26,937
I absolutely love throwing the birthday

415
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:27,873
parties for the kids.

416
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:29,790
We always have a blast.

417
00:20:30,673 --> 00:20:32,779
I just want to tell you
guys that me and Finn

418
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:34,085
earlier today were
watching his first birthday

419
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:38,715
party together and kind
of getting him the idea

420
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,710
of what his last birthday party was like.

421
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,679
There's lots of people
and we sang happy birthday

422
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,042
and all of that to kind of get him an idea

423
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,802
of what this birthday
party was going to be like.

424
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:51,604
It was such, I just loved
that birthday party.

425
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:54,021
It was so cute, we had a pony

426
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:58,299
and it was just such a cute thing

427
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,557
so if you guys haven't seen that one,

428
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:00,533
I'm going to have it linked up here

429
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:01,548
so you guys can check it out too

430
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:02,931
because it's such a cute party

431
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:06,061
and this one was such a cute party too.

432
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:08,463
(giggles)

433
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:10,652
You are such a big little two year old.

434
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,449
I'm also going to sit down
and read one of his new books.

435
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:14,785
We just read all of
these books with Ollie.

436
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:16,567
He got six new books and
we read them all tonight.

437
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,460
We were so excited to read them

438
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,445
but this one specifically
it's from Mattie and Malachi.

439
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,862
Well, I guess it's probably from Michelle

440
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,232
because she said Mattie and Malachi loved

441
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:29,530
this book when they were little and so,

442
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,785
I just read it to Ollie

443
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:32,042
because Finn ran out of the
room while we were reading it

444
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,017
so I'm going to read it to him now.

445
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:34,195
So anyways, I'm going to
go ahead and end the video

446
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:35,818
so make sure you give
this vlog a big thumbs up.

447
00:21:35,818 --> 00:21:37,068
This one, boop!

448
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,160
Thumbs up and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

449
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,381
What do you say?

450
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:47,036
Bye!

451
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:48,213
- Bye.

452
00:21:48,213 --> 00:00:00,000
(exciting music)
