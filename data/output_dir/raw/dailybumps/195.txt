1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,627
- [Bryan] Oh! You guys
played so well together

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:03,985
Oh, they might be going down.

3
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:06,218
- How come you and I
don't ever hug like that?

4
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:08,093
- (Missy) Oliver, Finley.

5
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:10,694
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:12,944
(laughter)

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,449
(playful melody)

8
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:22,491
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I want to be

9
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:27,070
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,717
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said

11
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:35,109
♫ This is home

12
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,754
♫ Just running around
you've never looked so cute

13
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:42,453
♫ Hugging you tight,
cuddling all I could saying

14
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:44,786
♫ I am home

15
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:49,779
♫ Home's wherever you're with me

16
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:53,781
- Good morning!

17
00:00:56,386 --> 00:01:01,378
What? That was not good
morning, you've got shoes on?

18
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:03,812
Guys my hair is like super curly today

19
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:06,401
But good morning, we are up this morning

20
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:10,476
the boys are dressed, and
where we going out Finny?

21
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:13,280
- Billy Beez with Jackson!

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,697
That's for later!

23
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,135
They're so excited, we are doing,

24
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:20,739
going to see someone special later today

25
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:21,841
We're gonna have a lot of fun though

26
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,502
but first, the gym

27
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:24,335
- Yes

28
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,562
- K, Mama's gotta go work out (laughs)

29
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:28,290
I'm gonna go run on the treadmill

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,568
I've been feeling pretty good guys

31
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:31,440
I've been going to the gym
almost every single day

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,873
I went to the gym yesterday
and I had a personal trainer

33
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:37,885
and it was rough, and my
arms are definitely killing

34
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,396
and there's parts of me that I'm like

35
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,965
I'm in so much pain, but I'm
definitely gonna go today

36
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:44,619
I'm just gonna go do a
couple miles on the treadmill

37
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,615
and what's cool is the
boys are coming with me.

38
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:48,709
They're being a little naughty right now

39
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,249
(laughs) taking apart the couch

40
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:51,458
but they're coming with me
because they have a really fun

41
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,041
little play center at the gym,
which is why I chose this gym

42
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,756
because being a mom it is
really hard to go to the gym

43
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:59,791
especially when you have kids
that are with you all day long

44
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,272
and so I was like, if I can
just take them somewhere

45
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,244
where they can play while I work out,

46
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:08,936
all my worries and troubles
will be not really a thing

47
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:10,828
because that's the biggest thing is like

48
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:13,261
leaving the kids here, like
Bryan is always working

49
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,338
like right now he is in
his office, he's working

50
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:18,043
and he can not really just watch the kids

51
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,588
I get to take them with me

52
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:21,700
By the way Ollie, you're
getting really close

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,168
to filling up your jar
of cotton balls huh!

54
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:28,467
So as you guys know, we are
doing, we brought this back

55
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,205
if you don't know what it
is, basically he has all his

56
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,172
rules of things that we do
and things that we don't do.

57
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:37,017
He's got cards so that
if he does get in trouble

58
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:38,879
he goes to like a warning

59
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,800
if he does something wrong
again there's a time out

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,717
and it goes all the way up to
like taking privileges away

61
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,899
bedtime early, stuff like that.

62
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:49,185
As long he doesn't have
to flip any cards in a day

63
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:52,589
he gets to put two balls at the
end of the day into his jar.

64
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,379
Yesterday, he was a very very good boy

65
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,852
so he gets to put two balls in his jar

66
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:00,720
Yay, and look how many he has left,

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
just three, three balls!

68
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,311
It is basically full, but
we basically have to move

69
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,092
all these into here, and
then once it's all full

70
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:11,485
he gets to pick out a very special toy

71
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,571
and he has been saving up, saving up

72
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,194
and every once in a while
he gets an extra cotton ball

73
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:17,640
if he did something really really good.

74
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,467
So every once in a while when
he does really really good,

75
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,159
we give him one extra little ball,

76
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,691
so right now he has three balls left,

77
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:24,506
so if he does something really good today,

78
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:26,411
he might get three balls
in his jar tomorrow

79
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,490
and then he can go pick out a toy.

80
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,439
So he's super duper excited.

81
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,291
Alright boys, we got to go
though, Mama's gotta go!

82
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,907
- (over the phone) What are you doing?

83
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:36,642
- (Missy) Who you talking to Ollie?

84
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:37,749
- (Ollie) Auntie

85
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:39,555
- (Missy) Auntie? Say Hi!

86
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:40,388
- Hi guys!

87
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:46,306
Hey little dude, you look
so handsome, you both do.

88
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:50,186
- (Missy) Auntie's gonna show
them something real quick

89
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:54,353
- (Auntie) Ew papa has to eat that, ew.

90
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:56,590
- Is that funny?

91
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,353
Auntie is doing a little editing right now

92
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:02,128
of a hilarious video
that she did with my dad

93
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:06,123
and whenever my dad's in
her videos, he is hysterical

94
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:09,569
and this one in particular
is very funny and disgusting

95
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,345
so she was just showing
them a piece of it,

96
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:12,739
but if you guys want to see it,

97
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:14,149
it's up on her channel right now,

98
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:15,707
make sure you go check that iCard

99
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,437
and go subscribe while you're there

100
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,101
and it's supposed to
be a super funny video

101
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:20,500
ight Cassie? Ollie show me Auntie

102
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,333
- (Cassie ) Yes

103
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:24,612
It's been so hard to edit
for not even 30 minutes long

104
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,622
- (Missy) Because dad's just so funny

105
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:29,773
- Finn, don't cry this time, okay Finn?

106
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:33,940
- (Missy) K Finny? No crying
this time let's go, bye!

107
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,877
(upbeat music)

108
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:57,333
Alright I ran a mile and a half
and I ended up accidentally

109
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,887
erasing what I had done but
it was a mile and a half

110
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,709
and I'm gonna go pick up the boys.

111
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,888
They actually close early
that's why I had to stop though

112
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,055
Just in time. Ollie! Finn!

113
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:11,331
Hi boys, did you have fun?

114
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:12,504
- Yeah!

115
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:16,101
- (Missy) Well I'm back let's go.

116
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:17,684
Say bye! Thank you.

117
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,940
Alright that was a pretty
quick but fun workout

118
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,984
I had no idea that the kids
area closed early today

119
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:29,095
but I got like 30 minutes in,
which is better than nothing

120
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,694
I kind of have to go pretty soon anyways

121
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:33,971
cause were heading out of
town to go meet up with

122
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,496
some people, yeah Jackson.
It was a fun but quick one.

123
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:41,838
Ran a mile and a half which
it's okay, it's pretty good

124
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:44,421
I mean I could have done
better, but whatever

125
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:46,562
I was also trying to vlog it for you guys

126
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,052
so that was like really distracting,

127
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:50,128
I was like trying to find
places to put the camera

128
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:52,182
so you guys could see it all.

129
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,834
Now we have to run to
the store really quick

130
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,771
grab a few little groceries that we need

131
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,819
and head home, then head out of town.

132
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,344
Are you excited?
- Yeah!

133
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:01,065
- And you guys did so
good at the playground

134
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:05,144
I'm so happy, thank you. Oh
he's meditating, hang on.

135
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:07,960
So cute, alright let's go to the store, k.

136
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,019
- Hey dude
- Hey

137
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,453
- Did you just take the best
nap ever on the way here?

138
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:15,893
Yeah, so where are we?
- Billy Beez!

139
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:19,939
- We're at Billy Beez! And
who are we going to see here?

140
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:22,132
- Jackson
- Jackson and Calvin

141
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:22,965
- Yeah!

142
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,973
- And I get to see my buddy
Jared. Are you so excited?

143
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:27,605
- Yeah!

144
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:29,164
- What are you going
to do when you see him?

145
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:31,129
- I'm gonna give him big hugs

146
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,504
- Big hug, anything else?

147
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:33,453
- Big kiss

148
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:36,149
- You're going to give
him a kiss too? (laughs)

149
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:39,369
Aw I'm so excited, Jared
and Ellie just randomly

150
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,631
were going to be down here for something.

151
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:45,531
We decided to meet and have a
place where the kids can play

152
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,793
and we're probably gonna get
some food and have fun, huh.

153
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:50,751
- You're the beautiful Mama

154
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,443
- Thank you I love you

155
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:55,326
- (Bryan) He's so cute, he's
always calling you beautiful

156
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:57,705
You're the beautiful too Finn, k?

157
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:59,938
Finn's the beautiful, right?

158
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:02,313
- Where is Billy Beez?

159
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:06,048
- Where is Billy Beez, let's find out.

160
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:08,715
(playful music)

161
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,857
So we're currently looking
for Ellie and Jared

162
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:17,023
and I think they may have left their mark

163
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:18,989
on this community chalkboard.

164
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:19,822
- It's a clue!

165
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:20,858
- It's a clue!

166
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,521
We're tracking them, huh?
- Yeah!

167
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,874
- Do you know what this is Ollie?

168
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:24,749
- What?

169
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:26,711
- It's an E for Ellie and a J for Jared

170
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,694
So they did E plus J, they've
been here they just did that

171
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:32,194
We have found Billy Beez, yay!

172
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,473
(exciting music)

173
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,508
Excuse me sir, I don't
think you're supposed to be

174
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:46,591
climbing the slide, what's up Calvin!

175
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,761
How's it going dude?

176
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,049
Oh! Say hi Calvin!

177
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:53,966
- Hi Calvin

178
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:56,315
- Oh hey!

179
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,607
- Hey! How are you?

180
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,698
- What's up dude?

181
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:04,348
- How's it going?
- Good

182
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:05,848
- Ellie what's up!

183
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:16,722
Aw, and kisses even you guys are so sweet

184
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:23,798
Yeah, go play kiddos. These
two are already up to something

185
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:25,311
What are we doing guys?

186
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,653
- We're going on a mission

187
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,770
- A mission? Finn are you
gonna go on the mission too?

188
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,293
Yeah, look at him crossing that.

189
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,043
(exciting music)

190
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:41,333
- I'm staying back to hang out with Finn,

191
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,766
because he's a little slower

192
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,783
and I've seen to have
lost all of the boys.

193
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:48,450
So I'm assuming they're this way

194
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,115
Do you want to go down
the slide with daddy?

195
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,630
- Yeah

196
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,152
- We are going on a
mission to find the dragon

197
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:58,329
- Okay, Finn we're gonna
go find dragons, okay?

198
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,452
Let's go find dragons. Giant slide!

199
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:05,369
Oh hey (laughs), that was fun.

200
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:09,946
Come on Finn, on his belly (laughs)

201
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:11,944
Well that's one way to do it

202
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:13,546
Can't fit through them
like we used to Jared

203
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,982
- They don't make them fun anymore!

204
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:18,552
I want to have fun, but
it's a really hard time

205
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:22,641
- Nothing like going
to a indoor playground

206
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:25,982
to show you how out of shape you are.

207
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,250
Can we all just appreciate
Jared's massive camera right now

208
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,276
We've got a three way angle
on this slide you guy's ready?

209
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:36,276
- 1, 2, 3! (cheers)

210
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:42,374
- (Bryan) Why are we so cool you guys?

211
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,468
Literally traversing this right now,

212
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:48,929
through a ropes course,
here we go, I made it.

213
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:52,150
Trying to find Ollie,
Ollie! He's down there now.

214
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,058
I just climbed all the way
up here, he's down there.

215
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,558
Okay, this is how it is, whoa.

216
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:04,252
Chasing the kids the whole time.

217
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,465
Who's gonna win? 3, 2, 1, go!

218
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:16,835
Whoa, you both won, yay!

219
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,831
- That is fast!
- That is really fast.

220
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,998
I got some air, whoa dude.

221
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:36,929
(playful music)

222
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:44,547
If you guys can remember we came here once

223
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:46,974
when Finn was really really little,

224
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:49,362
and he was terrified going down the slide,

225
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:51,065
I'll have that video in the iCard

226
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:52,931
so you guys can check it out
and up there will also be

227
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:55,435
Ellie and Jared's channel so
you can check out all the fun

228
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:58,194
from their perspective today
so be sure to go check out that

229
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:02,361
But yeah, this is super cool,
the kids are having a blast

230
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,556
Oh Ollie, what are you doing kiddo?

231
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,526
- I shooted some balls

232
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:18,618
- That's so cool so this is
like a whole other level up here

233
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:22,471
where you can use the
air to shoot the balls

234
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:24,993
into this cool little gun thing

235
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:29,461
(laughs) It's a little hard to control.

236
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:33,294
Alright you aimed and I'll
give you bullets, you ready?

237
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:34,794
Go go go go go go!

238
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,157
Ellie and Jared are vlogging down there

239
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,824
and I've got this aimed at them.

240
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,517
Sorry, am I getting in your way?

241
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:49,184
(playful music)

242
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,733
Nice !

243
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:05,297
Going to attempt the
hamster wheel you guys, whoa

244
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,375
- (ELlie) Jared's going
to still have to push it

245
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,708
- I think I locked myself in, oh my god!

246
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,903
- (Missy) Oh my god!

247
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,848
- Okay Jared you're good

248
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,681
- My turn!

249
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:34,502
- Watch this

250
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:37,285
- (Missy) Jackson get back, oh my gosh

251
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:39,152
- I feel like I'm on the Price is Right

252
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:41,235
(laughs)

253
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:49,996
- (Bryan) What's the secret word?

254
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:50,996
Finn's turn!

255
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,649
Say go mama go go go.

256
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:01,511
We did it good!

257
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:03,182
Ollie what are you
dressed up as right now?

258
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,167
Can you check my heartbeat?
Yeah put those in your ears.

259
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,714
There you go, and then check my heartbeat

260
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:12,164
with your stethoscope,
right here okay? And listen.

261
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:14,185
(heartbeat)

262
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:17,929
Do you hear it? Do I have
a heart? It's still there.

263
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,179
- Yeah
- Thank you Dr. Ollie

264
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:29,065
- (Missy) What is that? Oh, that's so cute

265
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:32,051
- (Bryan) He's always picking
flowers for the ladies

266
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:35,183
- Look I saw your picture right here !

267
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:38,117
- (Bryan) Did you guys
do that? Ellie and Jared

268
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,102
You did the E and J huh?

269
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:44,339
Kiddos, that's how you
fall into the fountain

270
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,442
Ollie remember when you
fell in that fountain

271
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:48,847
Oh, it's that one over there
actually that Ollie fell in

272
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,514
Do you remember that?
- Yeah

273
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:52,903
- If you guys haven't
seen that video of Ollie

274
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:54,981
falling in the fountain,
I'll have it in the iCard

275
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:56,398
it's super funny.

276
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,903
(upbeat music)

277
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:18,333
So we all just had an amazing
dinner at P.F Chang's.

278
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,203
Hey Ollie, did you have so much
fun hanging out with Jackson

279
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:21,094
- Yeah

280
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,677
- Be sure to give him a big hug

281
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,256
Good to see you dude, aw you
guys played so well together

282
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:31,941
Oh, they might be going down

283
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:32,774
- Oh yay!

284
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,294
- That was a cool hang out
bro, I was just saying,

285
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:38,432
how come you and I don't
ever hug like that.

286
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:40,309
You know where we just
like wrestle each other

287
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,977
to the ground and
- Snap each other's neck

288
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:44,644
- Or hurt each other

289
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,168
(playful music)

290
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:51,418
(laughter)

291
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,186
- We're home, and are you Buzz Lightyear?

292
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:09,248
We are exhausted, with a super
fun day with Ellie and Jared

293
00:15:09,248 --> 00:15:12,720
we had a blast, and now
it's time to end the vlog

294
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,067
and go to bed, so make
sure you give this video

295
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,650
a big thumbs up, say thumbs up!

296
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,520
Thumb's up! And we'll
see you guys tomorrow

297
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,770
Oh say go subscribe to Auntie!
- Auntie

298
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:27,691
- Alright go check out her video,

299
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:31,108
and we'll see you guys tomorrow, say bye!

300
00:15:32,028 --> 00:00:00,000
(playful music)
