Before today's vlog starts
please know that we understand

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,450
that our comments section
is almost always (ding)

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,670
full of love and positivity and happiness,

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,210
and we absolutely love
it and we are so thankful

14
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,580
for you guys, but at the
same time our comments is

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,280
our house and our house, our rules.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,760
And if you cross Missy,
trust me, she can be brutal.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,270
She will take away your
chocolate milk privileges.

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,000
But every one in a while, a
comment comes through that

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,391
just has us scratching our
noggin and we're like hm,

20
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:57,850
what was the motivation?

21
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,070
What was the thought process?

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,090
Did they use spell-check
or grammar-check at all?

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,420
So, today we are gonna share
those comments with you

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,700
and we are going to comment back.

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,310
If you guys have not seen
our last mean comments video,

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,630
I'll have it up in the
icard so you guys can click

27
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,463
it and watch it.

28
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,550
We like to do something fun with these.

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,483
It's about due, I think it's due.

30
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:17,155
Okay, let's get started.

31
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:20,520
Finn, is there a chicken in our house?

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,147
- Yeah.

33
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:23,842
- [Bryan] What, where?

34
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,581
Up there?

35
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:26,884
- Yeah.
- Say cock-a-doodle-doo.

36
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:28,910
- There.
- (giggle) There is a chicken

37
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,770
in our house, isn't there?

38
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,620
That's Hay-Hay.

39
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,259
How'd Hay-Hay get up there?

40
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,650
- Papa.
- Papa, of course

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,149
Papa did it, huh?
- Yeah.

42
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,050
- Alright, today I'm
gettin' Finn a little snack.

43
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,883
- Ollie.

44
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,470
- Are you gettin' a snack?
- Yeah.

45
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,763
- What d'you want to eat?

46
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:46,030
(Finn babbling)

47
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,520
Popcorn and chicken?
- Yeah.

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,160
- That actually sounds like a pretty good.

49
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,340
- Your kids are horrible.

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,690
Nobody likes your channel.

51
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,920
I hope you fail.

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,675
Your new name is Poopy Bumps.

53
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:57,705
LOL.

54
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:00,332
- Well that just sounds
like a mean comment.

55
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:02,030
- That is a mean comment.

56
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,680
- That is a very mean comment.

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,110
- It's a very mean comment.

58
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,680
- What if we just change
our name to Poopy Bumps?

59
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,400
- I feel like our SEO
wouldn't be as successful.

60
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,530
- Yeah, that probably wouldn't work.

61
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,900
- [Bryan] I was thinkin'
today babe, we could actually

62
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,876
read some mean comments, you know.

63
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:15,709
- Yeah.

64
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,663
- [Bryan] Maybe that will
help keep us humble. (laugh)

65
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:20,340
- You know that I do think
that reading some negative

66
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,020
with the positives is always a good idea.

67
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,350
- [Bryan] Okay, should we get started?

68
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,183
- Let's do it.

69
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:25,652
- [Bryan] Hey Finn, should
we read some mean comments?

70
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:26,980
- Uh huh.

71
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,979
- So this person said,
I'm sick of seeing the

72
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,003
hourse already.

73
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,336
- What is a hourse?

74
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,520
- I'm sure if they're sick
of seeing our house or

75
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,353
the horse?

76
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:37,670
- Maybe both?

77
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,440
- If you're sick you should
really just go take some

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,550
medicine and like you should
really nip it in the butt.

79
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,170
If you are so sick of seeing
our hourse, you should totally

80
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,700
get some Airborne, it's really, it's good.

81
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,100
It keep you from getting sicker?

82
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,727
I dunno, just a suggestion, trying here.

83
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:52,599
Finn, you want some water?

84
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,630
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

85
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,880
That was a tough comment to swallow huh?

86
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,700
- Yeah. (click)
- Need a little water to help

87
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,595
that comment go down. (laughing)

88
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:03,660
- Alright, next mean comment
is uh, Missy seriously

89
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,916
you need to break the
habit of touching your hair

90
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,530
so much when you're talking to the camera.

91
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,200
It's annoying to watch.

92
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,842
And like I seriously don't
even know what you're talking

93
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:15,230
about 'cause like why, first
of all like why is that

94
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,820
even annoying and I don't
touch my hair that much.

95
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,680
So, I dunno what you're
even talking about.

96
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,440
So, anyways, yeah Ollie's
actually at school right now

97
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,960
and I definitely am really
excited to like to go

98
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,300
pick him up.

99
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,660
He actually was a little
emotional this morning but

100
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,242
I think he's just kinda
getting over a little bit of a

101
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:31,800
cold.

102
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,239
Hopefully he's starting
to feel better. (laugh)

103
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,720
No, but seriously, I do touch
my hair a lot and it's kinda

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,520
a habit and I try not to,
but it's kinda just like what

105
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,418
I do so I don't just look
like I'm standing here doing

106
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:45,640
nothing.

107
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,930
I'm touching my hair, see?

108
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,928
It's funny.

109
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,167
♪ Go Finn, go Finn ♪

110
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,309
♪ It's your birthday ♪

111
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,330
♪ It's your birthday ♪

112
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,530
- You okay?
- Aw, you made it like a foot.

113
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,530
(groan)

114
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,730
- You're a strong boy. (groan)

115
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,310
- So this person commented,
good less horse and better

116
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,130
then yesterday, wrong then.

117
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,327
I jumped over horses.

118
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:10,910
She
- She jumps over

119
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,135
- She used to jump over horses.

120
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:16,557
Why Missy abandon kids and goes
everyday to stay with horse.

121
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,190
That's stupid.

122
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,339
You really shouldn't use
that word, that's not nice.

123
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,395
She has small kids, she should
dedicate to them, not the

124
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,270
horse.

125
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,170
I think at this point Missy
just has to make a decision

126
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,240
and I think she likes the
horse more so she's gonna

127
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,860
abandon the kids to go hang
out with the horse more, right?

128
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,790
- I mean I'm gonna have
to abandon one of them.

129
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,503
- [Bryan] Apparently
you can't have it all.

130
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:35,535
- I never know how I could ride my horse.

131
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:38,065
- [Bryan] (giggling) Just kidding.

132
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,830
(kiss) Momma loves you.

133
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,150
- Hey, I need time to myself too guys.

134
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,820
- [Bryan] Look at Luna
and Karma right now.

135
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,889
(rooster crowing) They're
seriously playing tug o' war.

136
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,300
(laugh) Karma.

137
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,810
Luna won and yes that is
our rooster going crazy,

138
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,050
huh Finn?

139
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,318
You like the chickens?

140
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:57,580
(rooster crowing)

141
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,413
- The time he goes crazy the most?

142
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:00,760
6 A.M., it's really fun.

143
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,940
- Go Finn, go.

144
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,773
Slide.

145
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:05,590
(laugh)

146
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,050
Here is another comment.

147
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,900
I didn't think it was mean
at first and then I started

148
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,990
thinking about and it
really got to me you guys.

149
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,910
This is probably one of the worst ones.

150
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,170
OMG Ollie and Finn are so cute.

151
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,910
Happy face, happy face,
happy face, happy face.

152
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,163
- What about me?
- What about me?

153
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:22,920
- Do you think we're cute?
- What about?

154
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,074
Ollie and Finn are cute, sure,
but hello I've been tryin'.

155
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:27,884
- What about the dogs?
- I've been tryin'.

156
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:29,490
Karma and Luna are cute.

157
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,620
- They're adorable.

158
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,526
- Karma and Luna I think you're cute.

159
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:33,930
- Yeah, that person might not,
- Even if this person doesn't

160
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,740
think you're cute.
- But you are cute.

161
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,589
- [Bryan] Hey Finn, are you
the only cute one in the house?

162
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,799
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

163
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,350
He's like prolly.

164
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,850
You two are so cute, also.

165
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,090
Don't you ever forget it, 'kay Luna?

166
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,129
'Kay Karma?

167
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:48,962
(rooster crowing)

168
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:50,904
'Kay, go fetch. (giggling)

169
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:53,226
That rooster is going crazy.

170
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:55,230
You know who's not cute?

171
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,440
That rooster for sure.

172
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,050
- Okay, this next person
says Miss, you need to stop

173
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,090
saying it's your house.

174
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,347
It's Brine's house too.

175
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,790
I mean who's Brine?

176
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,570
It's definitely not their house.

177
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,890
Who's Brine?
- Brines

178
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,250
- Do you know Brines?

179
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,140
- No, I don't think Brines bought a house.

180
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,830
- He's definitely not
like on the contract.

181
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,819
- Are they saying, do they
think I own the house?

182
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,930
- Maybe.

183
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,763
- 'Cause I don't own the house.

184
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:23,319
I don't make any money.

185
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,445
Missy's the money maker.

186
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:27,333
- Yeah, I mean I am the full
bread-winner here, guys, 'kay.

187
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,300
- [Bryan] Yeah, she makes all our money.

188
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,741
- It's my house, 'kay, it's my house.

189
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,230
Not Brine's, not Bryan's either.

190
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,960
- Thanks for lettin' me live here babe.

191
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,480
- Of course, you know.

192
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,807
- So this mean comment says
the way that Missy runs.

193
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,310
Laughing emoji.

194
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,617
I'm not sure.

195
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:43,250
I've never really seen Missy run weird.

196
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,370
I'm not really sure what
the comment could ever be

197
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,203
in reference of.

198
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:48,940
I'm pretty sure Missy
runs completely normal.

199
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,135
(soothing music)

200
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:51,620
- It's so nice outside.

201
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,800
- [Bryan] I know, but it's cold.

202
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,110
Come inside.

203
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,375
- Okay.

204
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,125
(soothing music)

205
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,740
- [Bryan] What, what is she doing?

206
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,706
She move like that all the time?

207
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:07,630
That's weird.

208
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,753
Look, Finn's just like what
just happened? (giggle)

209
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:12,618
Has Mommy always ran like that?

210
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:13,909
- Um hmm.

211
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:16,833
- So we know some of the, excuse you Luna.

212
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,834
(both laughing)

213
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:18,961
She's like I'm just gonna lay up here.

214
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:22,750
So we know some of those
comments weren't exactly mean

215
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,101
but that's kinda the point of it.

216
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:27,350
I think that regardless of
whether someone leaves a mean

217
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,440
comment or not, we should
still always reply with love

218
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,370
because that is just what the world needs.

219
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,730
So I also thought we should
end this video by sharing

220
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,560
some very positive,
happy, friendly comments.

221
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,393
- Yes.

222
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,470
- From people in our comments section.

223
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,180
- We read a lot of our comments
and there's so much love

224
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,966
and positivity that comes
through it's hard to even let

225
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,010
those negative comments really
effect us because so many

226
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,843
people love us.

227
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:50,760
- Yeah.
- And it's so awesome.

228
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,212
- And we appreciate you guys.

229
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:55,180
Abby and Emmy said we love
you Ollie and Finn, watch you

230
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,078
all the time.

231
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:57,692
- Thanks, that's so sweet.

232
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,492
Alright, this one says my
wife started watching you

233
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:04,492
when you had 46,000 subs and
we have met you many times.

234
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,100
She really likes you when
you went to VloggerFair

235
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,000
for the first time and Ellie and Jared.

236
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,030
- That's awesome.

237
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,460
- Oh and prolly met Ellie and Jared.

238
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,730
That was an awesome VloggerFair.

239
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,070
Meeting Ellie and Jared was
- Yeah

240
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,430
- Literally so much fun.

241
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,250
It was prolly one of the
first friends we met in real

242
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,180
life from YouTube.

243
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,480
- So TeeLife Daily Vlogs,
you guys have been watching

244
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,570
since 46,000 subscribers, that's crazy.

245
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,320
- I don't even remember
that time, honestly.

246
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,910
Like, I don't even know when that was.

247
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,181
- I know, that had to be
like when we first started.

248
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:32,539
- Uh huh, well if it was
VloggerFair, well VloggerFair

249
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,289
was we had just Ollie and he was a baby.

250
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,889
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much for

251
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,861
following for that long.

252
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:37,899
- Seriously it's awesome.
- We just really

253
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,820
appreciate it.

254
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,360
- Alexia said thank you so
much for vlogging every day

255
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,193
for five years.

256
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:43,789
We appreciate and love you.

257
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,950
We appreciate and love
all of you guys as well.

258
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,840
I think Missy has one more
nice comment as well, right?

259
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,340
- Yes, I do, hang on.

260
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,350
Alright, I read this one earlier
and I just thought it was

261
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,960
so sweet, but it says Missy
you are just beaming all the

262
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,190
time since you got your horse.

263
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,023
You deserve it.

264
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:58,118
I've never seen you so happy
as you are with, when you

265
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:01,630
are with Nacho and by the
way I couldn't comment on the

266
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,630
dentist vlog but you are
a great mom to your boys.

267
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,910
So patient and loving.

268
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,800
Thank you so much.

269
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,760
I am of course to absolutely
thrilled to have a dream

270
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,940
come true with my horse.

271
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,880
I just appreciate seeing
comments where people can notice

272
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,340
that like having time with
my horse is so cool and

273
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,790
really important, but I also
love and love spending time

274
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,690
with my boys and it really
makes me feel good when I see

275
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,318
comments that see both
sides of me as a mom and as

276
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:27,170
a horse lover. (giggle)

277
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,260
- And we kinda just wanna
wrap today's video up with

278
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,120
the simple idea that spreading
love and positivity is

279
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,591
what this world needs right now.

280
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:38,380
Yes, there are mean people online.

281
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,510
There are mean people in
real life, but I've always

282
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,780
been a huge believer in love.

283
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,560
That love can stomp out hate.

284
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,970
That's kinda what we wanted
to wrap up this video with.

285
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,690
- And if you're one of
those people that leave nice

286
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,420
comments all the time, and we
didn't read them, just know

287
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,300
that we appreciate you.

288
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,500
We love you and we've been
doing this for five years.

289
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,870
Honestly, our comments
section is really, really fun

290
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,703
to go through.

291
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:58,450
People are so supportive and loving,

292
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,210
and we thank you guys and
that's why we're still

293
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,570
doin' it after five years.

294
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,790
- Yes.
- We're on our sixth year.

295
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,590
- So go leave some friendly comments.

296
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,171
Go to other people's channels,
leave friendly comments.

297
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,650
- We need it guys.

298
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,380
- And encourage others to do the same.

299
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,430
- Yes, alright.

300
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,970
We're gonna go ahead and end this video.

301
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,390
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

302
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,821
We thought it was kinda fun.

303
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:17,110
- Say bye, Luna.

304
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,320
- Bye Luna.

305
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,545
Oh, Karma wants to say bye too.

306
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,416
Hi Karma (giggle).

307
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,840
We will see you guys tomorrow.

308
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,450
Can you give a thumbs up, Karm?

309
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,511
No?

310
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,013
- [Bryan] Finn, maybe with your pinky up.

311
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,014
Pointing.

312
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,408
- [Missy] Look at that thumbs up.

313
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,690
- [Bryan] Point up to the sky.

314
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,014
- [Missy] He's like it's
naptime mom, I'm done.

315
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,010
(laughing)

316
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,010
- Point up to the sky.

317
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,722
- Whoop, up, he's like yeah.

318
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,920
(giggle) Alright, we will
see you guys tomorrow.

319
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,099
Bye.

320
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,884
- Bye boop.
- Bye boop.
