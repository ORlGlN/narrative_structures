00:00:00,304 --> 00:00:02,731

guys our new tattoos.

- [Missy] Good morning Luna.

16
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:31,519
Why you sleeping there?

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,871
- [Family] Good morning!

18
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,463
- You're so cute, Finn.

19
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:36,296
So are you.

20
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:38,170
(laughs)

21
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,636
Good morning guys.

22
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,821
We were just admiring Luna in the house,

23
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:42,654
she was
(bell rings)

24
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:44,216
taking a little snooze, huh?

25
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:45,049
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:45,882
Are you looking at Momma?

27
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:46,715
- Yeah.

28
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:48,278
- What are you doing?

29
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:50,443
Aw, I think he loves me, guys.

30
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:51,486
You love Momma?

31
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:52,614
- [Finn] Oh look.

32
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:54,717
- Oh, oh, look who else loves Momma.

33
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:56,685
Luna! (laughs)

34
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:57,518
Hi.

35
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:58,351
- [Ollie] I think Karma too.

36
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,911
- [Missy] You think Karma loves Momma too?

37
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:00,744
- [Ollie] Yeah.

38
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:01,577
- I think so too.

39
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:02,410
I think he loves me the mostest.

40
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,797
Karma, do you love me?

41
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,547
He's like "Ah, yeah?"

42
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:08,986
Come here, boy!

43
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:09,903
Hi puppies!

44
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:13,217
You guys are all so cute.

45
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:15,785
Yeah, we are having a really nice morning,

46
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,001
isn't a beautiful day?

47
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,676
As you can tell, we aren't
getting a winter this year.

48
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:21,475
(laughs) I think I've
come to terms with that.

49
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:24,287
But yeah, we actually
skipped school today.

50
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:25,967
If you guys don't know, I took Ollie to

51
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,713
school on Tuesday, and it was clearly

52
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,891
just not a school day and everyone

53
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,236
was still out, and even
the teacher wasn't in,

54
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:36,669
so I think school is officially
starting next Tuesday,

55
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:38,641
so I was like, I'm not
gonna take him there

56
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,530
just for daycare to like watch him,

57
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,856
'cause I do like being with this boy.

58
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,546
He is a lot of fun to be with.

59
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:45,682
Right, Ollie?

60
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:46,515
- Yeah.

61
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,348
(Missy laughs)

62
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:49,552
- We're just hanging out
today, having a chill day.

63
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,517
I'm still doing a lot of horse stuff.

64
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:54,562
Just kind of still looking, I think I have

65
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:57,083
a really, really good possibility of the

66
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,398
one I'm getting, and
I've looked at and stuff,

67
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:04,211
but nothing is 100%
until we actually get it,

68
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,591
or pick it up I guess,
or go to pick it up.

69
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,253
We'll see, we'll see, I might have a horse

70
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,603
by this weekend actually,
it might be interesting.

71
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:12,440
But I am super sore
after riding yesterday,

72
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,682
but not like so sore that
I couldn't get on a horse.

73
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,995
I could totally get on a horse today,

74
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:19,836
but I'm gonna take today off and then

75
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:21,757
tomorrow hopefully I'll be able to ride,

76
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:23,728
but I am pretty sore.

77
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,944
My ankles are sore 'cause
I definitely twisted

78
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,389
them in some weird way yesterday,

79
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,169
but not too bad, they're not
swollen or anything like that.

80
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:35,072
So I think all is good, I
just gotta build up my muscle.

81
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,143
The dogs are playing tug of war,

82
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:40,193
it is the cutest thing ever! (laughs)

83
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,276
Look at that!

84
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,289
They are so sweet.

85
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,917
I just think it is so adorable how

86
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,101
Karma kind of hated Luna
when we first got her,

87
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:51,449
and Luna was so annoying and he

88
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,175
for a long time just couldn't stand her,

89
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,367
and now they are literally best friends.

90
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,662
It is the sweetest thing.

91
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:01,854
Is Karma your best friend, Luna?

92
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:03,115
Are they best friends, you think?

93
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:03,948
- Yeah.

94
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:05,907
- Yeah, and Karma, I think Luna's

95
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:07,752
definitely grown on Karma, 'cause

96
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,212
he enjoys being around
her and playing with her,

97
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:11,302
so it's kinda cute.

98
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:13,341
I think you've made him young again,

99
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:14,425
'cause he was getting to be older,

100
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:17,028
and now he's just like, he's playing again

101
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:17,945
a lot more.

102
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:21,182
What are you doing?

103
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:24,908
(gasps) Are you picking Mommy a flower?

104
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:27,917
Look at pretty these flowers
are, even in the winter.

105
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,642
Look how pretty that is, thanks bud.

106
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:34,350
(chuckles) I think Finn's
over there trying to...

107
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,229
What are you doing?

108
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,223
You trying to get any?

109
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:39,473
Your brother will help you.

110
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,104
What do you have there?

111
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:50,481
(gasps) A flower?

112
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,031
Oh, oh he's putting
behind it behind his back,

113
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:52,864
what do you have?

114
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:54,564
(gasps) A flower!

115
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:57,626
Look at both of these beautiful flowers,

116
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:58,756
thank you boys.

117
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:00,478
- Luna's just chewing up the flower.

118
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,476
- [Missy] I know, bad Luna!

119
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,733
- I think I'm addicted, you guys,

120
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,341
and I feel like I have to come clean,

121
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,846
I have to tell you guys, I have

122
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:11,979
a La Croix problem. (laughs)

123
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,138
Yeah, so I'm kinda started this new thing

124
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:17,510
where I don't drink sugar in sodas,

125
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,563
so I stocked up on La
Croix, which by the way

126
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:22,354
they have a cola one, it's okay.

127
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,369
Passionfruit, tangerine.

128
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,572
And I have completely
stopped drinking soda,

129
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:29,167
I've completely stopped
drinking diet sodas,

130
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:32,439
or like the 10 ones with only
10 calories, or whatever.

131
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,897
I just was decided, and
I didn't even really

132
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:36,524
decide it as like a new year thing.

133
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:38,139
I kinda decided it as a me thing,

134
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,363
I was like, you know what?

135
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,697
I just always feel really not good after

136
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,413
drinking that all day.

137
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,005
But I'm the type of person who needs to

138
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:47,054
have a drink all day with me.

139
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,256
So La Croix is a great thing 'cause

140
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,678
it's just like sparkling water,
and there's nothing in it.

141
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:53,805
So yes, I am addicted to La Croix.

142
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:56,182
I wanted to ask you guys
if you drink La Croix too,

143
00:04:56,182 --> 00:04:58,113
what is your favourite flavor?

144
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:00,204
Let me down below in the comments.

145
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,644
I think I've tried almost all of them,

146
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:05,198
I definitely cleaned out the grocery store

147
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:06,380
last time I was there because I was like,

148
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,845
I don't want any excuses, I don't wanna

149
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,988
drink any soda, I threw
all the old soda out,

150
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:12,295
I was like, not drinking this.

151
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,613
New year, new me, I'm
gonna try it. (laughs)

152
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,772
Not like a resolution, I
don't wanna call it that,

153
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:19,877
and I don't wanna say, I'm not gonna eat

154
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:22,553
or drink sugar, 'cause
obviously that's a lie.

155
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:24,730
But yeah, definitely
had to cut back on soda,

156
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,909
and La Croix is helping.

157
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,735
But I just got home after
running a bunch of errands,

158
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,033
and the house is empty, so I'm pretty sure

159
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:31,769
Missy is out looking at another horse

160
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,031
here in town, and she's gonna throw

161
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,846
some of it up on her Insta story

162
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:37,310
because she forgot the camera.

163
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,692
- Momma doesn't feel good.

164
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:39,659
- [Bryan] She doesn't?

165
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,723
- Yeah.

166
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,022
- [Bryan] Oh that's so sad!

167
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:43,064
Shall we help her?

168
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:44,444
- Yeah.

169
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,231
- So Missy and the boys just got back

170
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:47,990
from checking out the horse.

171
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,667
Missy got rather car sick

172
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,000
on the way here.

173
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:55,726
I have peppermint.

174
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:56,941
I think peppermint oil.

175
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,750
All right, I'll just put some
peppermint oil right there.

176
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,918
(Missy mutters)

177
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,100
A little bit together.

178
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,478
Smell it, there you go.

179
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:04,329
- That's good, thank you.

180
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,162
- [Bryan] Is that helping?

181
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:06,720
Okay. (chuckles)

182
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,265
- I was at, was rocking out,
I saw some cool clouds, look!

183
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:12,598
- [Bryan] What!?

184
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:15,841
Whoa, those do look cool!

185
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,223
What do you see, buddy?

186
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:20,252
- I just cool clouds,
but look at that cloud!

187
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:21,539
- [Bryan] What does it look like?

188
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,173
- It looks like a carrot.

189
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,006
- [Bryan] A carrot?

190
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:24,839
- Yeah.

191
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,117
- [Bryan] Um, you guys, it actually does

192
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:28,968
kinda look like a carrot. (laughs)

193
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:29,801
- Bow!

194
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,021
- [Bryan] Whoa, what
are you doing? (laughs)

195
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:33,146
(babbles)

196
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:34,986
Oh, you threw the ball
all the way down there?

197
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:35,819
- Yeah.

198
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,652
- [Bryan] You're gonna have to go get it.

199
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:37,877
- Okay.

200
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,929
- [Bryan] No, you don't have
to get, I'm just kidding.

201
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:40,974
(laughs)

202
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:41,978
- Get it.

203
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:42,985
- [Bryan] You want me to get it?

204
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,818
- Yeah.

205
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:47,639
- Finn threw the basketball
all the way down the stairs.

206
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,123
Now we gotta go get it.

207
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,258
We're going on an adventure.

208
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:53,023
Oh, it's in the dirt, guys.

209
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:54,471
Aw.

210
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,451
- No, it's right next to the sim-play.

211
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,579
- [Bryan] Yeah it is, huh?

212
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,412
- [Ollie] Yeah.

213
00:06:58,412 --> 00:06:59,245
- [Bryan] Yeah.

214
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:00,330
- [Ollie] Oh my gosh, look at that.

215
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,635
- Whoa, there's a puddle of water!

216
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:05,015
Careful Finn, don't
step in the water, okay?

217
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:05,848
(moans)

218
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:06,850
(Bryan laughs)

219
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,058
Come here, you're okay.

220
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:09,106
What, Ollie?

221
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:11,881
- Finn, if you jump in
the water, that's okay,

222
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,498
we can wash you off, okay?

223
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:14,668
- That's true, if you get in the water,

224
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,050
we'll just wash you off, okay?

225
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,559
(laughs)

226
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:20,445
The skies today are beautiful though,

227
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,151
sun is going down.

228
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,318
(pleasant folk music)

229
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,884
- Mom feels better now!

230
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:34,895
- [Bryan] She does?

231
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:35,728
- Yeah.

232
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:38,203
- Aw, well that's good. (laughs)

233
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:39,718
I'm sure both the boys jumping on

234
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:40,799
top of you helped as well.

235
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,215
- Yeah, they like ran in here.

236
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:43,467
(Bryan laughs)

237
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,314
I'm feeling a lot better, okay sweetie.

238
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:46,558
- [Bryan] I told you.

239
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:47,521
- I was so sick, I was like

240
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:48,901
I'm gonna throw up in there.
- Yeah.

241
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,734
Peppermint.

242
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,244
Works good, huh?

243
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:52,507
You like lavender, huh?

244
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,460
- Yeah.

245
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,600
- [Bryan] He likes lavender
on the bottom of his feet.

246
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,727
- I feel a little on fire.

247
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,076
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, I forgot it can tingle.

248
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,039
- Yeah. (chuckles)

249
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,051
- Shh, Missy went to go get pizza.

250
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,718
And look what I did.

251
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,726
They're watching Olaf's
Frozen Adventure with Olaf.

252
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:11,833
(laughs)

253
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,583
You guys are so cute.

254
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,186
Are you hungry?

255
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,478
- Yeah.

256
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:20,064
- It's bed time for these boys.

257
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:21,537
- Daddy, watch this.

258
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:23,534
- [Bryan] Let me see, whoa!

259
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,408
You flying through the
air like an airplane?

260
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:26,241
- No.

261
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,712
(Bryan laughs)

262
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:29,420
- [Bryan] Are you guys
sleeping in the woods tonight?

263
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,418
- [Ollie] Yeah.

264
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:32,470
- [Bryan] Yeah, with our
good old friend Charlie, huh?

265
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,466
- [Ollie] Yep.

266
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:34,549
- Yep.

267
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,984
Boys are getting ready
for bed, all right boys?

268
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:37,684
Give me hugs!

269
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,262
Give me hugs, good night, good night!

270
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:40,645
Ooh, that was a good hug!

271
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,775
(yells)

272
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:44,361
Good night, I love you.

273
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:45,491
- I love you too.

274
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,033
- [Bryan] (chuckles) All
right, get in the tent.

275
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,923
Get in the tent, close the doors.

276
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:50,509
And then go night night, kay?

277
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:51,505
Good night guys.

278
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:52,683

All right.

290
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:31,035
So we put the kids to
bed, and they did so good,

291
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,405
they're doing amazing sleeping
in their beds, aren't they?

292
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,029
- Yeah, honestly it's been like

293
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:37,251
the best decision that we've made.

294
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:38,243
- Yeah.

295
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,167
- And it was definitely a little bit of

296
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,347
rough patches but I feel like we've

297
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,769
worked through most of them now, and

298
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:43,726
- Totally.

299
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:44,870
- (clicks) They're good.

300
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,081
- Yeah, it's been awesome.
- Our biggest worry now

301
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,090
is that if one of the other

302
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,195
isn't here, I dont know how they'll

303
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:50,410
sleep without each other.
- Oh yeah.

304
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,069
How are they gonna sleep apart?

305
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,064
- They just like love each other

306
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,115
so much right now.
- Yeah.

307
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:55,660
- It's so cute.

308
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,845
- So Missy and I did something fun today,

309
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:01,872
and we wanna show you
guys our new tattoos.

310
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:04,461
Missy and I have been wanting to get

311
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:06,968
tattoos for a while that are matching,

312
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:09,206
and we decided that we're
gonna do it our wrists,

313
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:12,820
and we're gonna show you them right

314
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,653
now?

315
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:15,628
Ooh, ah!

316
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,001
(laughs)

317
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,414
Yeah, so
- Check them out.

318
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:20,537
- [Bryan] Check it out.

319
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,039
We have paper cranes on our wrists,

320
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,478
mine is super light, ugh!

321
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:26,896
I don't know why it turned out like that.

322
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:29,876
- Your tattoo artists was
just kinda not feeling it.

323
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,464
- I guess, it's supposed
to get darker, we'll see.

324
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,340
What do you guys think
of our matching tattoos?

325
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,550
They're paper cranes,
which I guess are a symbol

326
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,936
of health and longevity,

327
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:41,189
- Yeah.
- So that's cool.

328
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:42,661
Happiness,

329
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:44,129
it's like a happy bird,
- Yeah!

330
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,175
- It's supposed to be a happy bird.

331
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,008
(laughs)

332
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:46,841
The crane.

333
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:47,674
- Yeah.

334
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:48,799
That's pretty cool, I like it. (chuckles)

335
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,876
- Yeah, it's cool.

336
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:53,350
But yeah, this is one of
those semi-permanent tattoos.

337
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,306
- They're the henna ones.

338
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,893
I actually still have the eyelashes.

339
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,989
- Oh yeah, and my Star Wars
one is completely gone.

340
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:58,919
(laughs)

341
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,770
- Yeah, it's like on this
side, I was turning it around.

342
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,978
- [Bryan] Oh yeah, you
have the little eyelashes.

343
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:02,811
- It's when they get to this point

344
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:03,644
- Barely.

345
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:05,455
- It's like, yeah, I need to wash my arm.

346
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:06,477
- [Bryan] Yeah, you can probably just

347
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:07,477
wash it off at this point.

348
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,066
- [Missy] Yeah, I seriously had tried it,

349
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,622
it's like there.

350
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:12,472
- [Bryan] Look at that
crane, it turned out

351
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,886
so good on yours babe.

352
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:15,180
- [Missy] It's so cute, I like it.

353
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,271
I like where it's at too.

354
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,863
- But anyway, that is
all for today's video.
