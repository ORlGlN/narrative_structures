1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
- Where's Finn?

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,200
Has anybody seen Finn?

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
Finn, oh, come on, Finn!

4
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,700
(giggling)

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,133
- [Mimi] Whoever's on Finn's
team is totally gonna lose!

(playful guitar music)

18
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:35,269
- Good morning, guys.

19
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,868
So, a lot has happened

20
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:40,467
(laughs) since the last video.

21
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,202
If you guys didn't see yesterday's video,

22
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm gonna have it linked up in the I-card,

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,833
you can go back and watch it,

24
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,733
so you kind of understand where we're at.

25
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,434
We had a really, really hard
day yesterday, Missy and I.

26
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,402
It was a huge rollercoaster of emotions.

27
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:55,302
And we had some travel already lined up,

28
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:56,969
we were gonna be in Vegas for CES,

29
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,901
we have some meetings here,

30
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:02,376
and so we already had this travel set up.

31
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:06,001
So we are now here,
and we kind of got here

32
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,833
and put everything on hold.

33
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,433
We kind of just took
some time to think about

34
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,067
what we want to do and what
we should do, and can do.

35
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:17,534
So we're kind of taking
a break from all the work

36
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:19,650
we had planned, and we're
using this as an opportunity

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,867
to just be together and
just try to have that time

38
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:25,333
where we can like, reflect
and have a little fun,

39
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,600
and process, because a
lot happened yesterday.

40
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,500
Yesterday, Missy and I
hugged our boys for a very,

41
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,003
very long time, and we
were probably so annoying.

42
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:39,867
And if you watch yesterday's
vlog, you'll know why.

43
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,500
But it was just one of those things

44
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,267
where you can't help
but be affected by it.

45
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:47,234
Our boys just kinda loved on us yesterday,

46
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,834
and it was what we needed.

47
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,639
And now they're hanging
out with Mimi and Papa,

48
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,100
they're totally cool, and they're happy,

49
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,034
which is awesome.

50
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,600
And we get to have a little
bit of time to ourselves

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,800
here in Vegas.

52
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,767
But there's a couple of really cool things

53
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,934
in our hotel that we
wanted to show you guys.

54
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:01,500
So we figured maybe
we'll pick up the camera

55
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,771
and vlog a little bit about
that, and have some fun.

56
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:04,735
Sound good?

57
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:07,467
We saw a show last night,
and they gave Missy a rose,

58
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,500
so I think she's already wowing the crowd.

59
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,200
Funny story about roses
actually, and Missy...

60
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,868
When Missy and I were in high school

61
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:14,970
and we first started dating,

62
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,338
I gave her a rose every
single day for a long time.

63
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,300
I think it ended up
being like, six months.

64
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,634
But I worked at a grocery,

65
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,034
I think I worked at
Albertson's, I was a bagger.

66
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:26,600
Every day after my shift, I
would buy a single red rose

67
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,267
for I think it was probably like,

68
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,934
a buck or three bucks or something.

69
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:34,038
And I would bring it to her,
and it was just a funny time.

70
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:36,400
And so whenever I see roses now,

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,833
I think of that time in our lives,

72
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,359
because I know she really liked it.

73
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,875
But anyway, Missy is
downstairs at the restaurant,

74
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,499
so let's go meet up with her.

75
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:46,458
(upbeat music)

76
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:50,125
Look at this giant map
of the United States!

77
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:54,373
It's America, babe! (laughs)

78
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:56,206
Eatin' pasta in America.

79
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:57,737
Oh, are you Facetiming?

80
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:59,334
- Yeah, my mom.
- Hey, oh, the boys!

81
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:00,434
What are the boys up to?

82
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:03,800
- Hi Daddy!
- [Bryan] Hey dude!

83
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,599
Miss you, buddy!

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,700
Hi, Finn!
(Missy laughs softly)

85
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,300
Oh, they're having so much
fun with Mimi and Papa.

86
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,883
(upbeat music)

87
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:30,301
- [Mimi] We're gonna do
it on three, you ready?

88
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,600
One, two, three!

89
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,800
- Hey guys!
- Hey guys!

90
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,835
- Hi!

91
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:37,801
- (laughs) That was perfect!
(Mimi giggles)

92
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,333
Okay, we're gonna play hide and seek.

93
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,501
- Yeah, yeah!

94
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:43,067
- Okay, then Mimi and Ollie, versus who?

95
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,101
- Uh-uh!

96
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:46,601
- [Mimi] Uh-uh's here!

97
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,067
Uh-uh, in case you didn't
know, is what Finn calls Uncle.

98
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,967
He calls him Uh-uh!

99
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:53,734
- Ollie's gonna help us now.

100
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,233
- [Papa] I'm gonna take a
kid, and I'm gonna hide it,

101
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,066
like here, here, hide!

102
00:03:58,342 --> 00:03:59,475
Where's Finn?

103
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:00,501
(Finn shouts)

104
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,467
(Papa exclaims in surprise)

105
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:02,734
(Finn giggles)

106
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:04,500
- [Papa] We'll try to
find a better hiding spot!

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,200
- [Mimi] And someone needs
to teach Finn how to hide!

108
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,700
- [Papa] Okay, here we go.

109
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,533
Where's Finn?

110
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,867
Has anybody seen Finn?

111
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:13,434
Finn, oh, come on, Finn!

112
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,204
(giggling)

113
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:18,600
- [Mimi] Whoever's on Finn's
team is totally gonna lose.

114
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,533
- [Papa] Uh-uh!

115
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,399
- [Mimi] Uh-uh's on Finn's team!

116
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,367
- Me and Papa!
- [Papa] Okay.

117
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,234
- [Mimi] So no one say, "Where's
Finn?", or the game's over.

118
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:28,034
- [Papa] Okay, Finn, you've
got to sit over here,

119
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,700
you and Uh-uh.

120
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,433
- [Uh-uh] We've got to close our eyes.

121
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,100
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.

122
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:36,000
- Okay, go team Ollie!

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,067
- [Mimi] What are we counting to?

124
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,533
- 400!

125
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,200
- [Mimi] Okay, let's make it 30!

126
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,367
- [Papa] Okay, go right
up there. I can see you.

127
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,300
Not a good hiding spot.

128
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,567
- [Mimi] Go, Papa, hurry!

129
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:55,234
- One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

130
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:01,568
29, 30!
- [Mimi] What do you say?

131
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,334
- [Uh-uh] Ready or not, here we come!

132
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:04,167
(Finn squeals happily)

133
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,325
Can you say ready or not?

134
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,158
(Finn babbles)

135
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:06,991
(Mimi and Uh-uh laugh)

136
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:09,534
- [Mimi] Alright, here we go!

137
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,467
- I found Papa.

138
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:13,834
- [Mimi] Oh, that's a
terrible hiding spot.

139
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:17,167
- I hid the boy!
- [Mimi] Oh, you hid him.

140
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,134
- Went through the front
gate, down the street.

141
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:22,534
- [Mimi] And he knows to be quiet?

142
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,934
- He's in the house and
he knows to be quiet.

143
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,301
- [Mimi] Okay, here we go, Finn!

144
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:27,833
Finn, you find Ollie!

145
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,600
- [Uh-uh] Okay, we gotta be thorough here.

146
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,234
Let's check the bathroom.

147
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:33,733
- [Finn] Yeah.
- [Mimi] Is he in there?

148
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,300
- No.
- [Mimi] No?

149
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,167
Wanna check the closet?

150
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,000
- Okay!

151
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,002
- [Mimi] This is Mama's Monica closet!

152
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:44,034
- [Finn] No!
- [Mimi] Not in there!

153
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,700
Do you wanna check in Mama's room?

154
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,300
Okay, let's go check, go in
there, start looking around!

155
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,550
(playful music)
- No?

156
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,667
- [Mimi] No, you don't see him?

157
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,500
No, not in the closet!

158
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,201
(Ollie giggles)

159
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:06,401
Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

160
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,300
- [Mimi] What was it?
- Him!

161
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,133
- [Mimi] Is it Ollie?

162
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,216
Where do you think he is?

163
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:14,067
- [Papa] If Ollie's hiding somewhere,

164
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:15,267
he needs to be quiet!

165
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:16,100
(Mimi laughs)

166
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,733
Wherever you are, Ollie,
you need to be quiet!

167
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,100
- [Mimi] Could he be behind
those moving clothes?

168
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,367
(Papa laughs)

169
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,784
Oh, we found him!

170
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:31,267
Good game, good game, good game!

171
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,100
- I'm gonna say that Ollie
is the second-worst hider

172
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,835
in the world, because I
know who the worst hider is!

173
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:36,868
- [Ollie] Finn!

174
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:39,100
- Who's the worst hider?
- [Ollie] Finn!

175
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,600
- [Uh-uh] Ollie, come over here.

176
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
- [Mimi] Are we ready?

177
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,567
- [Papa] You've gotta come
over here and count to 400.

178
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:46,400
Ready, go!

179
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:48,900
- Come on, we gotta go!

180
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,202
(Mimi laughs)

181
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,535
- [Ollie] One, two, three, four, five...

182
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,866
- [Papa] 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21...

183
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:07,167
- [Ollie and Papa] 27, 28, 29, 30!

184
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,066
- Ready or not, here I come!

185
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:14,801
- Okay, let's see here.

186
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,868
Alright, here we go guys.

187
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,834
Off to find Finley.

188
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:21,917
- [Papa] Wait, wait, not under there.

189
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:25,633
- [Ollie] Under here?

190
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,466
No!

191
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,301
This is the worst hide and seek ever!

192
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,467
- [Papa] In here, no.

193
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,300
- [Ollie] In here, no.

194
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,502
- [Papa] We know he's gonna giggle.

195
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:38,767
- [Mimi] I don't know.

196
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,667
Okay, do you really think
they're gonna put him

197
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,933
in the exact same spot you just were?

198
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,291
I don't think so.

199
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,424
- [Papa] Did they both hide?

200
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm sure Uncle is helping him stay hidden.

201
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,767
Alright, I think we
need to leave this area.

202
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:51,934
Let's move on!

203
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,300
- [Papa] Are you ready?

204
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,333
Look out!

205
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,700
That's toilet paper.

206
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,967
The laundry room?
- Okay.

207
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:01,733
- [Mimi] Do you see anything?

208
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,100
- [Papa] No.

209
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,134
- [Mimi] That light is on,
that's his old nursery.

210
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:08,733
Do you think he could be in there?

211
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:11,150
(Mimi gasps)

212
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,233
(Finley shouts and laughs)

213
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,500
(Mimi and Papa laugh)

214
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,168
- [Papa] Wait, we're missing Uncle!

215
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,733
- [Ollie] Where is he?

216
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,283
- [Mimi] Do you know where Uh-uh is?

217
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:23,757
- No!
- [Mimi] No?

218
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,100
- [Ollie] Is he in...

219
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
- [Papa] I don't know where he is.

220
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,442
Wait, let's take a quick look around.

221
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,301
Let's just take a quick
look around the room.

222
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:32,767
Do you see anybody?

223
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,767
- [Ollie] I see him!

224
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,280
- [Papa] Where, I don't see him!

225
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,001
- [Ollie] He's in the mirror!

226
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,001
- [Papa] In the mirror?

227
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,734
- [Ollie] He's right there!

228
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:40,967
- [Papa] Right there?

229
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,500
- [Mimi] He's in the back of the mirror!

230
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,533
(laughing)

231
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,501
- [Papa] Oh my god, I
thought he was trapped

232
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:45,334
in the mirror.

233
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,200
- [Mimi] That was a pretty good game,

234
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,000
thanks for playing, guys!

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,202
Say, "Thanks for playing, Uh-uh!"

236
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,933
(children mumble)

237
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,267
Thanks for playing, Papa!

238
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,474
Alright, let's go.

239
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,967
- So I'm really excited,
because as you know,

240
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,300
Missy loves chocolate!

241
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,234
So we're headed into
Hershey's Chocolate World,

242
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:06,002
which is actually inside of our hotel,

243
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:07,333
so we don't even have to leave.

244
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,057
- And you better believe

245
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:10,617
I'm getting stuff for my dad!
- And it looks amazing.

246
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,234
Yeah, Missy's dad loves
Hershey's chocolate.

247
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:14,533
Oh, look, they still have
their Christmas wreath up!

248
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,934
- It's still Christmas here!

249
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:17,133
- I thought we were
bad 'cause we just took

250
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,034
our Christmas decorations
down a couple of days ago.

251
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,734
Look at this!

252
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:24,234
It smells so good, babe.
- It really does.

253
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:26,567
(Bryan laughs)

254
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,767
(upbeat music)

255
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,967
- Chocolate Liberty?

256
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:35,101
Look at this Hershey's
chocolate Statue of Liberty.

257
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:37,435
500 pounds of chocolate, babe!

258
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:40,018
(upbeat music)

259
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:55,433
So my favorite chocolate has
always been dark chocolate.

260
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,667
I love dark chocolate, and I
actually really do not like

261
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:01,067
milk chocolate, and Misty is
a huge milk chocolate fan.

262
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,533
What did I tell you guys?

263
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,301
Missy is a huge milk chocolate fan.

264
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,167
(laughs)

265
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,767
- I thought I was like,
putting this on my ice cream.

266
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,000
(Missy and Bryan laugh)

267
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,833
- [Bryan] I know, right?

268
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,967
- I could really do that with it all.

269
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:10,833
- [Bryan] Are these real?

270
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,534
Oh, no. Oh my gosh, that's so funny.

271
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:13,767
- You could take good ones, like...

272
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,200
- [Bryan] Yeah! (laughs)

273
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,783
(upbeat music)

274
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,268
Look at this giant Hershey's Kisses!

275
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,768
Whoa, that's cool!

276
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,133
What?

277
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,134
- [Missy] Look at that!
- [Bryan] This exists?

278
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:33,001
It's a cupcake covered
in chocolate, oh, wow.

279
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,133
We gotta try that.

280
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,600
- I'm focusing.
(Bryan laughs)

281
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,467
I can't eat chocolate
anymore the way I used to.

282
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,668
- I know, it's actually really sad.

283
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:45,067
Oh my, look at all those strawberries!

284
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,425
See this is my favorite, it's
chocolate-dipped strawberries.

285
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:48,376
- I don't like--

286
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:49,626
- [Bryan] I was telling them

287
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:50,850
how you don't like dark chocolate,

288
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,493
you don't really like dark chocolate.

289
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:53,359
You like milk chocolate.

290
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,476
- Yeah, I'm more of a
milk chocolate person.

291
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:55,367
- And I'm dark chocolate.

292
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,800
So let us know down below in the comments,

293
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,633
what do you like?

294
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,367
Milk or dark, or white?

295
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,800
But white's not really a chocolate.

296
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,333
- I mean, is white
chocolate a chocolate, no.

297
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,701
- [Bryan] All this looks so amazing!

298
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,467
Oh, wow, look at that, babe.

299
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,267
Peanut butter swirl brownie sandwich.

300
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,401
Like, I'm just, like
drooling over all this

301
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,001
amazing looking food right now.

302
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:12,834
- I'm not eating any of it.

303
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,201
(Bryan laughs)

304
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,667
- Is this actual Rolos?

305
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:20,567
It's full of Rolos, but it's
also a little piggybank!

306
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:22,600
- [Missy] Oh, that's cool. Baby!

307
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,100
- World's largest Hershey bar!

308
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,067
- [Missy] Should we get that for my dad?

309
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,167
- I think he'll love it.

310
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,367
(Missy laughs)

311
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,601
Or hate it, he might hate this.

312
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:35,867
- [Missy] Yeah, my mom
would be so mad. (laughs)

313
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,867
- [Bryan] Oh, that is
so cute for the boys.

314
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:38,867
- I'm really gonna get these.

315
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,533
And they're like, super soft material.

316
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,500
- Oh, cool. They have 'em, Missy!

317
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,802
The hat and shirt collection.

318
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:47,201
This is what we get your
dad any time we travel.

319
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:50,234
We always get Missy's dad
the hat and shirt combo.

320
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:52,434
- I was looking for this exactly.

321
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:54,234
- [Bryan] So look, they
have the Hershey's Vegas,

322
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,706
but this is a cool color!

323
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:56,800
- [Missy] That is a cool color.

324
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,068
- [Bryan] He'd probably
wear this one more, though.

325
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,300
- [Missy] I think gray, and
you don't know what it says

326
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,367
until you realize it's about chocolate.

327
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:04,200
This is perfect!

328
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,733
- Alright, we couldn't
decide, so we're getting both.

329
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:10,900
(laughs)
(upbeat music)

330
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,867
We are now at the amazing
candy machine here

331
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:25,067
at Hershey's Chocolate
World, and it's insane!

332
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,100
Look, you can fill your own bag

333
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,634
with any type of candy you desire.

334
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:34,467
There is Caramel, Milk Chocolate,
Dark Chocolate, Almond,

335
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:38,134
Hershey's Hugs, Cherry
Cordial, Carrot Cake.

336
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,200
- [Missy] Ew!

337
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,534
- [Bryan] That's cool, no? (laughs)

338
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:44,117
(upbeat music)

339
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,733
Okay, so we are heading upstairs now,

340
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:52,433
and I'm going to try my
chocolate-dipped strawberry.

341
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,067
- [Missy] Hershey's chocolate-dipped.

342
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,034
(Bryan murmurs in agreement)

343
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:56,867
Pretty good?

344
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:59,400
That strawberry doesn't look
as good as the ones back home.

345
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,133
- Cali strawberries are still the best.

346
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,067
(Missy laughs)

347
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,100
So now we are going up
to the second story.

348
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,467
- Ooh, is that made of
chocolate? (chuckles)

349
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,633
The whole building's made of chocolate.

350
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:11,467
And it gets really hot here in Vegas,

351
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,800
so I can't imagine that's
like, a good thing in summer.

352
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,141
- Whoa, it's all Reese's up here, babe!

353
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:17,669
- [Missy] Ooh, so cool!

354
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,301
Reese's is like my favorite.

355
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,767
(upbeat music)

356
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,434
You're like, in a giant Reese's Cup.

357
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:25,167
- I know, I'd like to
eat my way through it.

358
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,369
(Missy laughs)

359
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,952
(upbeat music)

360
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:31,967
Babe, look at this.

361
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:35,800
They have a Statue of Liberty
made out of Twizzlers?

362
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,833
- Twizzlers, yeah.

363
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,767
- [Bryan] That's crazy. (laughs)

364
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:39,900
- [Missy] It says don't touch, but like,

365
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,939
I want to touch it so bad.

366
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:43,033
- [Bryan] I know, I
wanna feel it! (laughs)

367
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,633
Look at that. That's incredible.

368
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:48,200
- You can see the kinds they used up there

369
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
are the ones that peel off.

370
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,783
(upbeat music)

371
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,967
- Are you kidding me with
that smell right now, Vegas?

372
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:57,834
Are you kidding me?

373
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:58,667
Do you smell that, babe?

374
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,601
Fresh New York pretzels, right here.

375
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:02,568
That's awesome.

376
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:05,868
(upbeat music)

377
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:09,267
That's so cool, they have
Houdini's Magic Shop!

378
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,700
I could totally get
something for the boys.

379
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,900
- Let's go pick it up!

380
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,300
- To like, play a trick on them.

381
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,883
(upbeat music)

382
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,700
- [Mimi] Alright, you found three books?

383
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,668
- Yeah, we just need one more book!

384
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:34,601
- [Mimi] One more?

385
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:38,518
That one too, oh, that
one, who knows this one?

386
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:43,134
I read that to my kids
when they were little.

387
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:44,767
Alright, guys, we're
gonna be saying goodnight,

388
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,067
can you come down here?

389
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,170
We're gonna say goodnight.

390
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,467
Say thanks for watching.

391
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,800
- Thanks for watching!

392
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,401
- [Mimi] Say goodnight!
- Night!

393
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:55,933
- [Mimi] Thumbs up, and
we'll say, what do you say?

394
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:57,467
- [Boys] Bye!

395
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:58,550
- [Finn] Bye!

396
00:14:59,400 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
