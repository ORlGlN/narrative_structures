1
00:00:00,341 --> 00:00:02,706
- What's up, vlog, in the
airport actually heading

2
00:00:02,706 --> 00:00:05,877
to Sweden, and actually,
are we going to Copenhagen

3
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:06,750
to connect?

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,893
I think we're actually
going, this is very meta,

5
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:11,672
I'm going to Copenhagen,
I'm going to Copenhagen,

6
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:14,509
to connect to Gothenburg,
then to Stockholm, and this is

7
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,679
the prelim to a Copenhagen
keynote I gave very recently,

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:21,846
second session, you can and you can't.

9
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:25,438
Second session, very
deep, after first session

10
00:00:25,438 --> 00:00:27,886
I already gave, that you've
seen, as you can imagine,

11
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:31,958
was really challenge to
kind of spur up new stuff

12
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,799
for a second session,
which we did, I'm fired up,

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,200
I hope you enjoy it, check it.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
(dramatic hip hop instrumental)

15
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,705
There's a couple things
I wanna talk about while

16
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:48,061
we're here, and wanna
make sure I'm hitting

17
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:51,253
more mature businesses around
management and structure

18
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:54,809
and managing people, startup
culture, the framework

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,261
of attention, which is
I think the one thing

20
00:00:57,261 --> 00:01:00,848
that really runs through
this entire conference, is,

21
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:03,308
before you can tell anybody
how good your trampoline

22
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:07,268
business is or your art business
is, or your SAS product,

23
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:11,989
or you as a personal brand,
we all are trading attention,

24
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,194
and I'm obsessed with
this, it is why I believe

25
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:19,031
anybody who's been
successful is able to achieve

26
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:21,319
their goals, and there's
a lot going on there.

27
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,914
So, I think, the thing
that I wanna start with,

28
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:28,416
is that we've gotta really
wrap our head around

29
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,140
the framework that we're living within

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,643
as business people.

31
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:35,506
This device is the remote
control of our lives.

32
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:38,300
This device is the remote
control of our lives,

33
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,517
and you are going to be in a scary place

34
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,701
with the amount of time you
actually are looking here

35
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:46,129
versus looking in the actual world.

36
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:48,955
You may judge that, you
may think that's bad,

37
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:52,234
or sad, or ruining the human race, it's

38
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:56,401
completely irrelevant what you
think, it's what's happening.

39
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:01,803
And so, I wanna make sure that
everybody starts backwards.

40
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:05,703
For you to get what you want
in your life and business,

41
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:09,511
you have to give the other
people the thing they want

42
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:13,211
so that you get what you
want, I call it 51 49.

43
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:16,666
Basically, every relationship
I have, every business

44
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:20,343
dealings I have, and the way
I frame up my entire being,

45
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:23,827
it's why I have popularity
or cult of personality,

46
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:26,432
it's because I think it's
smart to give more to

47
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,226
an audience than you ask for in return.

48
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:31,277
And so, when you're
building your product and

49
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,406
your service, and whatever you're up to,

50
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:35,526
you need to find the angle of leverage.

51
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:38,195
You're competing with
a lot of other people

52
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:39,788
that want people's attention.

53
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:41,906
When I started working
with Budweiser, the beer,

54
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:44,158
it was crazy to me, I
walked into a meeting,

55
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:46,786
and I said, you know,
okay, we're competing

56
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:50,163
with Miller or Carlsberg,
or, we're competing, right?

57
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:53,977
And they said, we're
competing for share of throat.

58
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:56,753
Budweiser globally worries
about how much water

59
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:58,464
you're drinking.

60
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:01,134
How much Coca Cola you're drinking.

61
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:04,109
I mean, it was just really
interesting, and it was kind

62
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:06,055
of how I think about attention.

63
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:07,648
You may be thinking
you're competing against

64
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,024
somebody else who has
a trampoline business.

65
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:10,936
You're not.

66
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:13,373
You're competing against
anybody who has anything else

67
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:17,585
to do that weekend, in
Denmark, with those four hours.

68
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:20,321
So we are living through
a world, my friends,

69
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,515
where there's more options than ever.

70
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:24,490
How many people here
manage, how many people here

71
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,866
have more than ten employees?

72
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,192
Raise your hands?

73
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:28,830
Right?

74
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,046
We're living in a world
where our employees

75
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,766
have more options than
ever, either to do things

76
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:36,041
for themselves, or other
employers, and no matter

77
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,439
how good your labor laws
are and how long they have

78
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,090
to stay with you before
they go to the new job,

79
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,592
they still have options
greater than there were

80
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:45,303
ten or 15 years ago.

81
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:48,554
So, I think the biggest thing
that I think a lot about

82
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:50,016
is supply and demand.

83
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:53,802
It is such a simple,
basic business trade, and

84
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:56,341
it's something I'm very
intuitive towards, and it is

85
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,231
basically how I think about
everything, how I manage

86
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:02,483
my people, how I create
my business, how I treat

87
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:05,063
my customers, it is a
supply and demand world,

88
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,390
and you need to understand that the cost

89
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,952
of creating things that can
pull our customers' attentions

90
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:14,354
away from us, has gotten
so low, that there is

91
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,604
so much supply.

92
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,286
There is so much supply of
information, and videos,

93
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:23,300
and pictures, that this is
the reason that I believe

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,655
that advertising, not that it's dead, but

95
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:28,637
the thought that you're
gonna put out something

96
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:31,599
that is selfishly in
your interest, and you're

97
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:34,393
gonna get somebody to
actually pay attention to it?

98
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:36,980
With the technology
advances that we have today?

99
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,232
And with all the supply of information?

100
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:40,982
Is almost impossible.

101
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:45,196
And every day that goes by, it
will become more impossible,

102
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:48,449
so, number one, first and
foremost, I need people

103
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:50,661
to start thinking that
they're a media company,

104
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:53,120
and a publisher, more
than they're an advertiser

105
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,382
for their business.

106
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:59,168
That the skill set that I
think so many people will get

107
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:03,129
in the future to succeed,
is how do I put a piece

108
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:05,058
of content, how do I make a white paper,

109
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:06,409
how many people here are B to B?

110
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,468
Raise your hands?

111
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:09,345
Great.

112
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:13,428
So, for your world, how
do you make a white paper

113
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,302
that's six pages deep, a
presentation on Skillshare,

114
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:19,058
then post on LinkedIn because Skillshare

115
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,976
is owned by LinkedIn and
when you use Skillshare

116
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:23,551
on LinkedIn, more people
organically see it?

117
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:24,384
Tactic ...

118
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,847
How do you make a Skillshare
that gives people value,

119
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:31,847
and it's not a sales deck
for somebody to sign up

120
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:34,704
for a free trial in your
landing page optimized

121
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:38,749
funnel, so that you then become
a client, it is just black

122
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:42,003
and white, an incredible
piece of information,

123
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:45,756
that all the construction
workers, that all the lawyers,

124
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:48,759
that all the CTOs, in
your target audience,

125
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,679
will get value out, and
basically what I'm saying

126
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:55,598
very carefully to all of you, is, I ...

127
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:57,977
When I wrote Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook,

128
00:05:57,977 --> 00:05:59,687
and Thank You, Economy,

129
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,618
they were the two titles,
there was the third title

130
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:05,285
I never used, it was
called Guilt Marketing.

131
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:10,714
I basically believe that
the place that we're going

132
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:15,689
is, unless you guilt your
audience into doing business

133
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,123
with you because you provided
so much up front value that

134
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:22,712
you will get suffocated
over the next decade or two

135
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:26,131
of opportunities for the end consumer.

136
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:30,181
And so, what I do every
day is think about that.

137
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,608
And so, when I think
about guilt marketing,

138
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,637
provided value, where's
the under priced attention,

139
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:39,280
I used to call, this slide
used to say a year ago,

140
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,271
market in the year that you live in.

141
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,595
That we should be
marketing like it's 2016,

142
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,382
is what I would say.

143
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,498
Market in the year that you
live in, because so many

144
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:51,151
of you are spending time
and money on things that

145
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:54,401
worked much better in 2012, 2009, 2006.

146
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:58,305
So it was market in the
year that you live in.

147
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:01,375
What's happened is, with
the speed of updates

148
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,376
on Facebook and Instagram
and Snapchat and LinkedIn,

149
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:07,943
mobile devices, apps, VR,
AR, podcast, all this,

150
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:11,040
with the speed, I've now
changed it to day trading

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,164
attention, because you can't
just decide what you're

152
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:17,944
gonna do in January,
2017, and have success,

153
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:21,126
because too much is
happening during the year.

154
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:24,896
Right before Instagram
became the thing that

155
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:28,160
I think is the absolute
kind of current state

156
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,868
of the union of social
media, I was making content

157
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,840
that said Instagram was in trouble.

158
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,637
Snapchat was exploding.

159
00:07:35,637 --> 00:07:37,076
And getting older.

160
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:40,031
Facebook was far more successful
under 30 than most people

161
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,789
realized, and I made a
video, you know, nine months

162
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,098
ago, or so, that said,
what's Instagram gonna do?

163
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,573
It copied everything
that Snapchat had, that's

164
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,038
what they were gonna do.

165
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,613
And it worked for them,
but it's fun for me to know

166
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:53,426
that that was day trading.

167
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:54,902
There's a video out there
that says Instagram's

168
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:57,474
in trouble, I stand here
today and say Instagram's

169
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:59,223
the most important.

170
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:02,228
So, I think the biggest
thing that I wanna make sure

171
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:05,546
in my key note, I get
across, is the themes

172
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:09,491
of the Q and A earlier,
which is yes and yes and yes,

173
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:13,653
and audacity, audacity,
audacity, you have to wrap

174
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:15,656
your head around the game
you're playing in, which

175
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:16,982
is the following.

176
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:21,793
There is more information
created now in 24 hours

177
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,202
than used to be created in
decades, only 50 years ago.

178
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:28,539
Like, let's just, stick with me here,

179
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:33,299
there is more content being
created in 24 hours, than

180
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,466
used to be created in the
decades of the 50s and 60s.

181
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:42,760
Now, do you feel as good
about your documentary?

182
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,535
Do you feel as good about your poster?

183
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:47,729
It gets hard when you actually
understand what the fuck

184
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,064
is actually happening here.

185
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,110
And so, what I believe
is happening for all

186
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,840
the business owners in
here, and entrepreneurs,

187
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,864
is that you need to wrap
your head around the mindset

188
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,689
of how you get yourself into a place

189
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,539
of accepting this, and
then acting on it, and how

190
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:04,084
does it become practical?

191
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:07,451
The reason I brought
up interns earlier is,

192
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:09,294
there's always supply and demand.

193
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:12,254
When something emerges,
other opportunity happens.

194
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:13,407
Amazon.

195
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:16,443
Scaring everybody in retail
in America and other parts

196
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:18,345
of the world, right?

197
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,428
Amazon is in the wine
business, they bought

198
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:22,807
Whole Foods, they now
have liquor licenses,

199
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,289
in every state.

200
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,448
Everybody at my dad's
company, Wine Libraries,

201
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,448
scared, wah.

202
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:29,574
Me?

203
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:30,866
Excited.

204
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:31,699
Why?

205
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:35,611
Not because I'm a character
or I'm trying to act cool.

206
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:39,323
Because I go on Amazon
site, and I find wines

207
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:43,174
that Amazon has, that
we're selling for less,

208
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:46,121
and then I send emails
to customers that say,

209
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:49,038
cheaper than Amazon, which is true.

210
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,295
And then from a branding
standpoint, it makes them

211
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:54,422
think we're incredible,
'cause nobody's cheaper

212
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:56,924
than Amazon on anything.

213
00:09:56,924 --> 00:10:00,062
And even though Amazon is
gonna take market share,

214
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:03,294
they're not gonna take it from me.

215
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:07,005
In every single thing
that happens, I just said,

216
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:10,062
more content than 24 and
48 hours, than in decades.

217
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:10,980
Ooh!

218
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,440
Shit, how are people gonna watch my stuff?

219
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,131
Meanwhile, more creators
that are talented,

220
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:19,374
than we've ever seen before.

221
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,045
Every single person here
should write a blog post,

222
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:24,586
send an email, make a video,
or make an audio piece

223
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:29,081
of content, tomorrow, hiring
three content producers

224
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:32,169
as interns or the lowest
possible cost you can pay them,

225
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:35,224
based on the laws in
this country, tomorrow.

226
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:38,131
You immediately have a
media company at remarkably

227
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:41,950
low price, including if it's allowed free,

228
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,867
depending on the rules.

229
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,364
And that's what you
should be thinking about,

230
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,882
because if you do not wrap
your head around, that

231
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:54,689
you were a media company first,
I don't care what you do,

232
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:55,939
if you do not wrap your head around that,

233
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:59,653
you are a media company
first, comma, a lawyer,

234
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:04,409
comma, a designer, comma, a
sneaker salesman, if you do not

235
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:07,254
understand that you are a
media company, your business,

236
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:09,229
like the earlier questions,
you don't have to become

237
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:11,978
a personal brand, but
that means your logo of

238
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:15,251
your company, has to become
a brand that produces

239
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:18,847
content that actually has
value to the target audience

240
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:22,010
that you're trying to, now,
don't take it very direct,

241
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,685
let me give you an example.

242
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:28,019
I've a lawyer friend who's
starting a golf podcast.

243
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,385
He's starting a podcast
around golf, once a week.

244
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:34,313
He's interviewing golfers,
golf in the business,

245
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:36,606
but he's a lawyer looking for other people

246
00:11:36,606 --> 00:11:38,649
to hire him as a lawyer.

247
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:42,580
His strategy is that the
people that are actively

248
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,138
hardcore about golf in America, are high

249
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,305
net worth individuals, who
can afford the law practice

250
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,287
that he provides, so that
if he makes something

251
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:56,331
that those doctors and
other business people

252
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:59,838
wanna listen to, golf, that,
because it's brought to you

253
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:03,920
by this law firm, he will
get the residual business.

254
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,753
Now my friends, this is
actually a tactic that

255
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,394
is hundred of years in the
making, and uniquely European.

256
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:15,312
Let me explain.

257
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:18,045
The Guinness Beer Company.

258
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:20,224
The Guinness Beer Company
started the Guinness Book

259
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:24,206
of World Records, because
pub sales were down and

260
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:27,222
they wanted them to grow,
and they did surveying and

261
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:30,415
realized that people talked
about trivia in the pubs,

262
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,254
and they decided to
create the Guinness Book

263
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:35,402
of World Records, so
that people in the pubs

264
00:12:35,402 --> 00:12:38,583
would talk about the crazy
world records, reinforce

265
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,750
the Guinness brand, and then
order a pint of Guinness.

266
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,103
Michelin.

267
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:50,157
The reason you've gone to a
two or three star Michelin

268
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:54,241
restaurant, is because
almost 100 years ago,

269
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:58,245
the Michelin tire company
wanted rich people from London

270
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:02,405
and Paris to start
driving to the countryside

271
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:05,868
and stop by the gas stations
and use up their tires,

272
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:10,413
so they bought new ones, so
they started favorably reviewing

273
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:14,523
restaurants, hotels, and
inns, in the countryside,

274
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:16,747
and then making a book
that drove propaganda

275
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:19,902
and media to the rich in
those towns, and people

276
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:23,281
started going there
for the best foie gras.

277
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:25,716
(audience chuckles)

278
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:29,049
Media as marketing for business results.

279
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:35,104
What is old becomes new
and that in a framework

280
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,227
is the new strategy that I think has

281
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:41,298
the biggest upside for
every business in here,

282
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:43,169
regardless of what you do.

283
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:47,405
How you get people to pay
attention is the tactics

284
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:49,407
that I'm most excited about.

285
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:51,825
Whether that is Google,
whether that is Facebook,

286
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,810
whether that is something
else, once you establish

287
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,017
what your media is about,
and listen, by the way,

288
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:02,017
I'm standing up here, I
am very, very empathetic

289
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,706
that where I'm going right
now for the last five

290
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:07,623
to seven minutes, feels like, whew.

291
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,595
Like, if you're running your
business and I'm sitting

292
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,682
up here, and I'm telling
you, that you need to become

293
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:17,432
the BBC, or CBS, or,
you know, Sky Net, like,

294
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:22,438
I understand, however, please
take me up on this offer

295
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,368
and explore just a little bit.

296
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:30,249
If it starts as simple as
writing a very thoughtful piece

297
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:33,158
on your Facebook page
that you think the people

298
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:36,642
that could potentially be your customers,

299
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,782
would get value out of,
not you get value out of,

300
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:43,679
they get value out of,
you would be flabbergasted

301
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,530
by the opportunities and the
things that could happen.

302
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,962
The young man over there,
who asked 47 questions.

303
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:51,746
He listened to a tactic which I believe in

304
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,477
that everybody here
should pay attention to,

305
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,145
whether you're trying to
pick the people that you're

306
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,147
gonna give a poster for
free, or anything else.

307
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:02,312
The other arbitrage that
I'm massively excited about,

308
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:04,607
and the tactic that I
wanna give you here in

309
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:08,693
the key note, is DMing
people on Instagram.

310
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:13,493
There is a phenomenon going
on that is very intriguing.

311
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:16,514
You need to make a list
of the 50 to 100 people

312
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,595
that you want to speak to.

313
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:20,288
Whether you want them
to be the spokesperson

314
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:22,397
of your brand, whether
you want them to be your

315
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:24,626
first customer, whether
you just think they're

316
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:27,646
famous and you wanna be their friend.

317
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:30,506
I want you to make a list
of the hundred people

318
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:33,715
in the Nordics, in Europe, in
the world, that you would like

319
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:36,929
to have a relationship
with, for a business reason.

320
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,747
I want you to then search their profile

321
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:41,063
on Instagram.

322
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:44,055
If you do not find it,
go to Google and type in

323
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:46,435
the person's name, and the word Instagram

324
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:49,416
after their last name, so it shows up.

325
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,512
I'm being very tactical here.

326
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,068
Very mundane.

327
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:57,235
But, I believe attention
arbitrage, is also a way for,

328
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,876
where is the best business
development opportunity

329
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:04,326
for everybody in the room?

330
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:07,502
The best business development
opportunity in this room

331
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:10,089
is to not do what many people
do, which is spam people

332
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:12,006
on LinkedIn, because
nobody's paying attention

333
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:12,839
anymore.

334
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:17,571
It is to go to Instagram,
find their Instagram, some

335
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:19,409
of the people you want
will not be on there,

336
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:20,523
that's fine.

337
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:24,086
But the ones, the 83 of
the 100, the 47 of the 100,

338
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:27,519
that are, you DM them, direct message.

339
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,401
If you are not native to
Instagram or don't understand

340
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:33,451
that, there's a thing you
can do, you go to Google,

341
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,490
and you search, how do
I direct message people

342
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,811
on Instagram?

343
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:37,993
(audience laughs)

344
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,601
It will take your four
minutes, and listen, this

345
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:42,067
is like a fun thing to do,
'cause you have to understand,

346
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,638
this is what people ask.

347
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:45,221
People are like, be more
tactical in key note,

348
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,442
great, here you go.

349
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:48,617
This is what it is, it's
that basic, that's why,

350
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:50,383
but this is super important.

351
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:51,300
Because ...

352
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:54,720
You were blown away by what
happened when you started

353
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,141
doing it, right?

354
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,237
I'm blown away by what is happening on DM,

355
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:01,309
I became friends with
the Rock, and you know,

356
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,781
and all sorts of characters
that I never thought

357
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:07,733
I would ever interact with,
because people's attention

358
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,483
is on their direct message.

359
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:12,884
Now, most of you will
make the mistake that you

360
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:16,718
will go in for the ask
on your first writings.

361
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:21,412
You will DM, and you'll say, hey, Rock.

362
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,369
Can you wear my T-Shirt of my brand?

363
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,119
No, asshole, he will not do that.

364
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,557
But, if you look at their
last three or four posts,

365
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,347
if you spend ten minutes, don't forget,

366
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:33,965
you're only going after 100
people, this is the business

367
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:37,096
that you wanna build, and
see what they're about,

368
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:39,638
and you look, and you say, hey Rock,

369
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:42,352
I see you have a movie coming
out that you're excited about.

370
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,791
I wanna make some free posters for you.

371
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,608
You know, or whatever it may be.

372
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:51,271
If you bring value in
your first exchange on DM,

373
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,211
you will be stunned.

374
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:57,016
And I get this email 30
times a day, every day, just

375
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:59,280
read three of them before
I got back onstage,

376
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,560
of people who've made the
biggest business development

377
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,917
deals of their lives on
Instagram direct message,

378
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,540
in the last 30 days,
singularly for the same reason

379
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,707
that email worked so well,
in 1997, eight nine ten.

380
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:17,844
Because, how many people
here had email in 1999?

381
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:18,679
Perfect.

382
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:21,311
Do you remember what we
did in '99 with email?

383
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,933
We read every fucking email.

384
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,683
(audience laughs)

385
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:28,062
We do not do that anymore.

386
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:31,397
Supply and demand of attention.

387
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:34,868
Something emerges, we pay
attention, then a marketer

388
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:37,141
and marketers and business
people come along,

389
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,224
they ruin it.

390
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:41,825
And then we move on.

391
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:45,245
That is why I talk about
day trading of attention.

392
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:47,581
That, no matter if you have no money.

393
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:49,753
Or you have a huge business,
you know, I love when people

394
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,625
are like, if we get to Q
and A and they're like,

395
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,441
Gary, this is all great,
Facebook and Instagram, great.

396
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:58,608
But, my company does $38 million
and we grew 13% this year.

397
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:04,054
And we only do direct
mail and conferences.

398
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:05,639
What do you say about that?

399
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:08,434
What I say about that,
Hans, is what's wrong

400
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:11,156
with growing 74%, asshole?

401
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:13,018
(audience chuckling)

402
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,768
This is not about ...

403
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:18,046
What works or doesn't work, this is about

404
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:21,821
where is the upside to
create even more success

405
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:24,702
of whatever, you wanna
raise money for a charity,

406
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:27,538
this is not about, this
doesn't work, this does work.

407
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:31,628
This is about the tactics and the strategy

408
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,423
that is needed to
maximize the opportunity,

409
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:39,172
'cause here's the part
that I have not told you.

410
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:42,297
When I get introduced,
and they say, Gary built

411
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,303
his dad's business from three
to $60 million in five years,

412
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,519
and some people are like,
you know, a lot of people

413
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,476
don't know who I am, and like,
that sounds good, you know,

414
00:19:48,476 --> 00:19:51,310
better than just some guy
yelling and cursing onstage.

415
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,521
(audience chuckles)

416
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:57,274
I sit on the side, and I
say, it should've been 200.

417
00:19:57,274 --> 00:20:00,903
And it should've been 200,
because I was not day trading

418
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:05,439
attention in 1998, I was,
but I wasn't great at it yet.

419
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,522
I had Google.

420
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:11,105
I had Google, the first day
Google Adwords came out,

421
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:13,088
I bought every wine term,
they were five cents

422
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,655
a click, and I was converting customers

423
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:16,738
for 47 cents.

424
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:21,086
Who are worth fucking $30 for me.

425
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:25,158
What I didn't understand,
'cause I was a kid,

426
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,971
I just, I didn't know the
difference, is that I should've

427
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:32,242
poured all my money into Google, not print

428
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:35,154
and radio, and television,
and newspaper, which

429
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:37,022
is what I did, I spent much more on Google

430
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:39,856
than anybody else,
nobody knew what it was,

431
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:43,414
but if I took all that
money, and all that energy,

432
00:20:43,414 --> 00:20:47,164
and I struck when it
was that good of a deal,

433
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,024
I would've had a much bigger
business and more success,

434
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:52,566
and if you are here to
have success and whatever

435
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:54,508
you're trying to communicate,

436
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:57,841
you need to understand that social media

437
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:02,385
which is a word that we
made up, so, let me say it

438
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:06,373
a different way, that the
current state of the internet,

439
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:11,180
attention is on Facebook
and Instagram, and LinkedIn,

440
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,983
and that the opportunity to
strike and maximize dollar

441
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:17,813
amounts out of it, is so
extraordinary, and the only thing

442
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:21,151
I wanted to say other than
that, is if you do it,

443
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:22,651
you will be like some
of the kids that raised

444
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:25,111
their hand right now and said,
this good thing happened,

445
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:27,241
and if you're not, you're
gonna raise your hand when

446
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:31,829
I'm in Copenhagen in seven years
talking about voice and AR,

447
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:33,895
and you're gonna say,
Gary, I'm listening to you

448
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:36,236
because you were here
seven years ago, and you

449
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:39,417
told me to do this, and I didn't.

450
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,283
And I watched other people do
it, and I didn't grow as much

451
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:44,836
or I lost, or I missed
my opportunity, and now

452
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,260
I'm listening to you this time.

453
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,729
I am saying this to put
a flag in the ground

454
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:51,769
to be historically correct.

455
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,926
Facebook advertising
is grossly underpriced,

456
00:21:54,926 --> 00:21:57,143
and everybody here should
move as much of their money

457
00:21:57,143 --> 00:21:59,939
into the platform as they possibly can,

458
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:02,580
and like, these two chicks are
high fiving, so I don't know

459
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,985
what is going on over there,
but I can't wait to find out.

460
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:06,861
(audience laughing)

461
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:09,059
But I promise you, they're
not high fiving because

462
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,973
they've run Facebook
ads and it didn't work.

463
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:13,162
(audience chuckles)

464
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:15,332
And more importantly, watch
this, this is important.

465
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:17,195
How many of you have
run Facebook ads and it

466
00:22:17,195 --> 00:22:19,084
has not worked, raise your hands?

467
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:19,917
Should be plenty.

468
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,084
Raise your hands, raise
them high, don't be, higher,

469
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:24,417
raise them high, high, high.

470
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,975
It's important, thank you.

471
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:33,354
Running Facebook ads, and
it not being successful,

472
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:37,432
just so there's no confusion,
is not a Facebook issue,

473
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:38,849
it's a you issue.

474
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:41,992
You did not plan the media
properly, you did not

475
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:45,743
make the words and pictures work properly,

476
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:48,403
but this is not a debate.

477
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,669
This is data supported.

478
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,477
And I don't want to
hear that your customers

479
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:56,622
aren't on it, because that
doesn't exist, it just doesn't,

480
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,431
and I don't want to
hear that your industry

481
00:22:58,431 --> 00:22:59,705
doesn't do well on it,

482
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:02,466
because it doesn't exist, it just doesn't.

483
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:05,383
We've sold jet engines on Facebook.

484
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:10,799
And I'm very tired of going
to meetings over the last

485
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,802
six months, where 70 year
old executives say to me,

486
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:15,852
for the first 30 minutes
of our dinner, can you

487
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,097
believe this Facebook?

488
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:19,730
They need to regulate it,
it changed the election,

489
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,423
the fucking Russians, and
Trump, and the Brexit,

490
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:24,898
and the fuck, and our
grandchildren, and this,

491
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:26,654
and all that.

492
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:28,360
And then we segue into their business,

493
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,439
and I start telling
them they need to spend

494
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,310
more money on Facebook, and they go, well,

495
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,452
there's no ROI there.

496
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:35,345
(audience chuckles)

497
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,423
Or my customer's not there.

498
00:23:37,423 --> 00:23:38,620
So.

499
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,256
I'm making a very passionate
plea, because I want you

500
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:44,092
to win, for you to become
a practitioner, do you know

501
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:47,392
how many people here have
opinions on Facebook marketing,

502
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,475
but have never run an ad?

503
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:53,607
You've read an article in
the Wallstreet Journal.

504
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:54,440
Congrats.

505
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,800
You're a talking head.

506
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,275
You're not a practitioner.

507
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,018
You have an opinion off
of two conversations

508
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,946
with somebody you trust, but
you're not a practitioner.

509
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:05,485
You have an intuition, but
you're not a practitioner.

510
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,520
So.

511
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,270
If nothing else, go
spend $3,000 on Facebook,

512
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:15,820
with your money, you
do it, I don't need you

513
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,403
to outsource 26 year old Karen.

514
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:21,913
It's not a kids thing.

515
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:23,708
This is the most important
place where the attention

516
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,252
of our end consumer is, at scale,

517
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:29,074
and let me tell you one
great thing you have.

518
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:33,520
Because it is so
underestimated in the Nordics,

519
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,711
by the media companies, it's under priced,

520
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:39,044
because it's a market place.

521
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:42,946
But, the behavior of
the users in the region

522
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:46,475
are extraordinary in depth of attention.

523
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:50,982
Scroll time is slower, which
means there's more consumption.

524
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:55,412
Age is wider, it goes younger
here, and a little bit older.

525
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,964
And the companies are
not spending, your big

526
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,291
companies in these countries,
are not spending enough

527
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,789
money in it, so the prices are down.

528
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:06,584
How many people bought Google
Adwords in 2002, three, four?

529
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:08,001
Raise your hands.

530
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:10,836
For all the practitioners
here, and there's,

531
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:14,625
one more time, bought
Google Adwords, 2003, four?

532
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,536
Right.

533
00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:18,390
For some of us here, go look,
I don't know if you're still

534
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,847
doing it, go look back
at right now, tonight,

535
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:26,077
what those words cost,
compared to 2002, three, four.

536
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:28,758
This is the moment, strike on it, and if

537
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:31,034
you don't understand it, don't outsource

538
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,358
to an agency, don't outsource

539
00:25:32,358 --> 00:25:35,847
to your 21 year old
friend, start Googling on

540
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:39,656
how I make Facebook ads,
how I do creative for it,

541
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:42,457
what works, start testing, and start using

542
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,871
different variables.

543
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:44,704
Next.

544
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,039
How many people have 25
or more employees, raise

545
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:48,880
your hands?

546
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,578
Just trying to get a sense.

547
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:52,850
So, I wanna talk about
employees for a minute.

548
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,683
Culture.

549
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,616
This is managing yourself,
three person team,

550
00:25:58,616 --> 00:26:03,335
ten 25, I'm a very big
believer in starting to follow

551
00:26:03,335 --> 00:26:06,375
employees on social media,
and getting a better sense

552
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,357
of who they are.

553
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:11,609
I spend probably 90%
of my media consumption

554
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:15,132
just reading comments of
the content I put out,

555
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:16,489
and the people in my
community that read it,

556
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:18,197
and then I click their face
and go in a rabbit hole

557
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:20,532
and find out about them.

558
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:22,615
We are spending not enough time listening

559
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:26,127
to our employees, our
vendors, and our customers.

560
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,996
But the place where you
get the disproportionate

561
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:32,102
highest ROI is when you
listen to your employees.

562
00:26:32,102 --> 00:26:34,970
Retention on the employee
level is imperative,

563
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,216
happiness is imperative,
'cause it leads to speed,

564
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,174
and speed is the
competitive advantage that

565
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:43,310
you have against your
competitors in your product

566
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,643
and service, and when nobody's
worried about politics,

567
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:50,854
or drama, they can worry about the work.

568
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:51,937
And so, I ...

569
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,275
Don't wanna spend too
much time on it, based

570
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:57,264
on the hands, but if you
were managing people,

571
00:26:57,264 --> 00:27:00,967
and you've not had a sit down
with one of your employees

572
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,168
in the last six months
or a year, to find out

573
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,326
what they care about today,
whether that's money,

574
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:09,493
work life balance, title,
fame, and more importantly,

575
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:13,985
if you have an employee
that is actually seriously

576
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:16,939
important to your business,
which by the way means,

577
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,147
if you have one employee,
and they're the only employee

578
00:27:19,147 --> 00:27:21,728
you have, then it's you
and them, and you do not

579
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,142
have an understanding of what drives them,

580
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,196
you need to have a two
and a half hour dinner

581
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:28,838
and create that glue, because
one of the biggest things

582
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:31,768
I see in businesses and
entrepreneurs, in failing,

583
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:34,910
is the over-reliance on
an employee that leaves

584
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,567
and then they have to start
all over for 18 months

585
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,690
or are completely crippled
by it, and the thing

586
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,888
that could've allowed them
to mitigate that disaster

587
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:47,578
is literally a conversation.

588
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,404
And if you're not a big
enough man or woman to hear

589
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:53,525
the feedback, well, your
company's gonna lose anyway.

590
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:56,336
So, not having the
conversation doesn't address

591
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:59,297
the issues that are happening
within your company.

592
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:01,502
So I implore all of you to start getting

593
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:03,827
very serious about this, because
if we're having a business

594
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:06,638
talk, the part about
business that we don't talk

595
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:10,305
enough about, is empathy,
for our customers,

596
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,103
but most importantly, for our employees.

597
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:15,936
None of your employees, I
love when people are like,

598
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:19,162
Gary, like, Gary, how
do I get my employees

599
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,861
to work as hard as me?

600
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:22,907
You don't, Frederick.

601
00:28:22,907 --> 00:28:25,724
(audience laughs)

602
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:28,174
No employee should ever
work as hard as you

603
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:31,453
unless they have the same
equity in the company as you.

604
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:35,536
The audacity, my dad would
pay people $12 an hour

605
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:39,169
and want them to work as hard as he did.

606
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:40,841
That would always make
me laugh, and I know it's

607
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:44,175
very Russian and I get it, cultural, fine.

608
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,414
But it was super
interesting to me, I'm like,

609
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:48,053
Dad, they're making $12 an hour.

610
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:49,305
You own the business.

611
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:51,639
It's hard for them to care.

612
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,190
And so ...

613
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,147
I really, really, really
want to push empathy

614
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:58,523
for the humans that you're
doing business with,

615
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:01,097
because it's how you become
the best sales person,

616
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:03,986
it's how you become the
best manager, it's a default

617
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:07,087
of thinking about the
other person, not yourself.

618
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:08,843
Tactics, one more time,
it seemed like a lot.

619
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:11,328
One more time, I apologize,
but give it to me,

620
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:14,377
B to B businesses, raise your hands.

621
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,527
Let's talk about LinkedIn
for a little bit.

622
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:20,433
LinkedIn's ad product sucks.

623
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,839
And it's unfortunate,
because it could be so great.

624
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,662
And it could be so great
if they just literally

625
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:27,995
copied Facebook.

626
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:33,060
Like, if everybody here
could run ads with creative

627
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,144
against the titles of
people's jobs, you would have

628
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:39,429
the greatest tool of all time.

629
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,459
Because most of you in B
to B, are selling to people

630
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,362
that hold one of four to five titles.

631
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:46,628
It would be remarkable.

632
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:49,119
It's not there yet, it's got a high floor,

633
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,095
it's not a low floor
like Facebook and Google,

634
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:55,036
but I'm seeing things that
are making me ambitious

635
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:57,777
that the promise that
they were gonna be better

636
00:29:57,777 --> 00:30:00,189
three, four years ago, is
finally maybe coming here,

637
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:02,962
I think Microsoft sees
it, I think it's coming.

638
00:30:02,962 --> 00:30:05,005
Which is why, if you follow
me carefully, I've been

639
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,337
doubling and tripling down
on my LinkedIn content

640
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:10,764
myself, because I'm trying
to understand it better,

641
00:30:10,764 --> 00:30:12,815
so I can give better advice to GE and SAP

642
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:16,569
and the clients we work with,
and so I highly recommend

643
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:19,508
that if you were a B to B
player, that you start allocating

644
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:22,899
real dollars to LinkedIn, even though

645
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:25,882
there is a way to target
people on Facebook,

646
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:28,648
let me ping you a very
tactical thing, B to B,

647
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:30,697
I want you to run two different tests.

648
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:35,036
LinkedIn, but let me give you
a very detailed ad product

649
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:39,179
on Facebook that I think
is enormously ROI positive.

650
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,875
On Facebook, how many
people here have spent

651
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:46,875
over $50,000 in Facebook
ads with them doing it,

652
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:49,547
not outsourcing it
through an agency, raise

653
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:50,380
your hand?

654
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:52,709
Okay.

655
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:53,542
Three.

656
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:54,619
Okay, so.

657
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,788
No, it's fine, it's what I
thought, and what I actually

658
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,175
hoped.

659
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:00,223
And that's a big number.

660
00:31:00,223 --> 00:31:01,080
Facebook.

661
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,605
If you're not a
practitioner, you don't know

662
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,817
what the capabilities are, right?

663
00:31:04,817 --> 00:31:06,660
You know, if you've never
opened a Swiss Army knife,

664
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,441
you don't know what's in it, right?

665
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,489
There is a segmentation in Facebook

666
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:15,656
called employees of, everybody
here in B to B can run

667
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:21,107
pictures, videos, or words
against people that are employees

668
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:24,857
of specific companies
in their Facebook feed.

669
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:27,852
If you understand how
powerful this is and what

670
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,966
you can do next, you'll
start unlocking some

671
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,175
incredible business opportunities.

672
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,303
By targeting the employees
of, and now you know

673
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:38,662
that your product is sold
to the CIO, or the CTO,

674
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:40,016
or the CFO.

675
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:42,478
Or the director of logistics.

676
00:31:42,478 --> 00:31:45,481
Now, your copy, or the video you make,

677
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:48,148
starts with, does your CFO know?

678
00:31:50,496 --> 00:31:54,276
Does your product managers understand?

679
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:57,301
Want to save time for your accountants?

680
00:31:57,301 --> 00:32:00,578
If you literally verbatim articulate in

681
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:03,670
written or video form,
or picture form, the,

682
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,823
does the person in your
company that is this,

683
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,380
know about this, and then you
follow it with information,

684
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,747
a compelling video, a
how to, what have you.

685
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:16,054
We have seen ungodly
amounts of the following.

686
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:19,723
You run $1,000 in ads
against five companies,

687
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:23,038
and anywhere between
three and 74 employees

688
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,586
of that company forward that
post to the decision maker

689
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:32,362
and it is so extreme, and
unusual, that if the creative

690
00:32:32,362 --> 00:32:35,970
is good and you jab instead of right hook,

691
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,701
that it has been one of the
greatest conversion rate

692
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:41,502
advertisings we've seen
in any shape or form

693
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:46,105
over the last half decade,
and it is a B to B Facebook

694
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:47,813
ad strategy.

695
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:49,210
So.

696
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,213
I can't wait for two months
from now, to get an email

697
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:54,249
from one of you, that actually ran this

698
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:59,014
and felt the results, so please
take that and run with it.

699
00:32:59,014 --> 00:33:03,179
Look, I think that we should
talk about voice, because

700
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,423
I think that is something
that a lot of you

701
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:06,852
are gonna have to wrap your head around

702
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:10,189
going to the next 24 to 36
months, and this may be a place

703
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,719
where some of you have
the personalities where it

704
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:16,154
feels overwhelming to
catch up to everybody

705
00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:19,792
on this social stuff, but
the excitement of being first

706
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:22,822
on the next thing is just
your personality trait

707
00:33:22,822 --> 00:33:25,332
and you'd like to invest,
and that feels more exciting,

708
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:28,340
'cause you don't feel
dumb, and you feel smart.

709
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,117
I don't know what your insecurities
are, but I promise you,

710
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:33,272
here's a very important
thing to talk about.

711
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:34,716
Voice.

712
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:38,726
Besides money, health,
and religion, time is

713
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:42,639
the fourth pillar of the
things that drive us.

714
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:45,989
All of you do so many
things, like give up privacy,

715
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:49,063
to save a little time,
every day of your lives.

716
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:50,461
It's how we roll.

717
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,025
Uber.

718
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:55,153
Sold time, not transportation.

719
00:33:55,153 --> 00:33:57,096
Many of the things you choose every day,

720
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:59,773
are you buying time back,
and you're willing to pay

721
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:02,356
the margin for the convenience.

722
00:34:03,504 --> 00:34:07,089
I believe that audio in our
society is the next frontier,

723
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:09,168
because it is selling back time.

724
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:11,045
How many people here consume my content?

725
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:12,293
Raise your hands.

726
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:13,976
Raise them high, I want
everybody to look around.

727
00:34:13,976 --> 00:34:16,215
'Cause I'm about to show you
something pretty interesting.

728
00:34:16,216 --> 00:34:19,507
Of those people, how many of
you have started listening

729
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:21,303
more to my podcast in the last year,

730
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:24,495
and watching less videos, raise your hand?

731
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,820
This is remarkable.

732
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,768
Like, this is, thank
you, this is remarkable,

733
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:31,601
I would say that's 30 to 50%.

734
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:34,801
That same question just
a year earlier would've

735
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:36,218
been nonexistent.

736
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,947
What is happening, is
podcast, how many people here

737
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:42,029
are actively listening to a podcast?

738
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,034
Raise your hands.

739
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:44,867
It's incredible.

740
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:47,551
How many of you were not doing
that just three years ago?

741
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,830
Raise your hands.

742
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,194
Yeah, this is fucking it, and
this is day trading attention,

743
00:34:52,194 --> 00:34:54,030
you've gotta watch these trends.

744
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,130
Sound.

745
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:55,963
Audio.

746
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:57,799
It's saving us time.

747
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,517
While you're commuting, while you're doing

748
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:03,011
something else, you're able to
consume content, and because

749
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:07,175
we underestimate the brain
and our ability to multitask,

750
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:08,977
you're able to do something else as well,

751
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:11,619
and are you completely holding everything?

752
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:14,438
No, but you start, you
know, it's the reason,

753
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:16,146
do you know how many
people should be dying,

754
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:18,701
based on how many people
text while they drive?

755
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,694
(audience chuckles)

756
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:22,489
This is an interesting
thought, I'm glad you guys

757
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:23,322
reacted.

758
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,358
The amount of people that should
be dying because of texting

759
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,663
and driving is enormous.

760
00:35:28,663 --> 00:35:30,984
It's still higher than we'd like to admit,

761
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:34,085
but, the reason it's
not happening, is we can

762
00:35:34,085 --> 00:35:37,323
do more things than people
realize at the same time.

763
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:40,709
And that is what sound is doing for us.

764
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,767
Podcasts.

765
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:45,450
But, the one that's gonna
save us way more time,

766
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,974
is what's coming up with
Alexa Skills and briefings

767
00:35:48,974 --> 00:35:52,142
on top of the Amazon Alexa,
the one that's coming

768
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:55,293
from Google Home, the Apple Home pod,

769
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,453
and whoever else decides to enter, whether

770
00:35:57,453 --> 00:36:00,862
it's Samsung or Facebook,
or somebody else.

771
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:02,798
Because when you get into a
place where you're brushing

772
00:36:02,798 --> 00:36:05,381
your teeth, and you say, Hey, Alexa,

773
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:09,074
reorder my toothpaste, and
it's done, you're living

774
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:11,432
in a totally different world.

775
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:13,836
What do you guys do when
you're running around your life

776
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:16,836
and you remember that
you've gotta do something?

777
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:19,004
You take out your phone most likely,

778
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,528
and you do something, that
will normally take you

779
00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:25,278
somewhere between 14
seconds to text somebody

780
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:29,146
to two minutes to write
a note or call somebody,

781
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:32,392
I don't know how you
roll, but I can tell you

782
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:35,363
that time is the thing that
all of you will trade on,

783
00:36:35,363 --> 00:36:38,296
and the biggest white space
to change your business

784
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,794
in the next 24 to 36 months, is gonna be

785
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:42,884
about your investment to
understand how your product

786
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:46,712
and service can penetrate
the time quartum.

787
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:50,129
AKA, if in 2007, eight,
nine, you decided to be good

788
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:53,270
at Facebook and LinkedIn and Twitter,

789
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,454
you would have some of
the things that happened

790
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:56,280
to me, because I went all in.

791
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,520
You need to figure out
the same thing for time,

792
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,691
because the skills and
briefings, for example,

793
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,449
mark my words, five, six years from now,

794
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:07,226
everybody will wake up
and they will treat one

795
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,805
of these devices like the morning radio.

796
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:11,807
Remember, some of you woke
up with the Morning Radio

797
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:14,481
alarm, it would go off, and
your favorite morning show,

798
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,650
radio show, would start talking?

799
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,545
Your news and weather?

800
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:19,730
This is what you're device is gonna do,

801
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,858
you're gonna all download apps, skills, to

802
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:25,518
your voice device, and
your first seven minutes

803
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:27,839
of the morning are gonna
be curated with your bank

804
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,369
account, balance, with the
weather, with your favorite

805
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:34,331
sports teams update, with
the six most important

806
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:36,957
things in your business,
with your schedule.

807
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:39,293
You will listen, passively.

808
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:42,131
Now, you grab your phone,
go to the bathroom,

809
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:45,008
take a poop and look at your phone.

810
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:48,367
In the future, you will wake
up, and the first seven minutes

811
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,847
will start talking to you about things,

812
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,819
and you'll start interacting with it.

813
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:55,065
Alexa, change that meeting,
cancel that, tell Tyler

814
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,064
I wanna go to Copenhagen
three hours earlier.

815
00:37:58,064 --> 00:38:01,320
It will be you and the machine.

816
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,736
And I highly recommend that
you start getting serious

817
00:38:04,736 --> 00:38:05,653
about it.

818
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:06,486
Don't believe it?

819
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,155
Let me show you some
consumer behaviors that you

820
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,545
would find interesting.

821
00:38:09,545 --> 00:38:13,421
How many people here,
remember, lying is the devil.

822
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:14,897
(audience laughs)

823
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:16,955
How many of you here, by show of hands,

824
00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:21,122
now get annoyed when another
human being calls you?

825
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:26,091
Raise your hand.

826
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:27,038
Stand up.

827
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,977
Do me a favor, get up, I mean
it, I want everybody to see

828
00:38:28,977 --> 00:38:31,023
how dramatic this is.

829
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:33,276
I see some of you didn't do
it yet, thank you up there,

830
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:34,757
look around, look up and down.

831
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:36,477
I'm gonna give you two
more, keeping staying up,

832
00:38:36,477 --> 00:38:37,834
please keep staying up.

833
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,646
Keep staying up, I want
everybody to see this.

834
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:41,772
I'm gonna give you
another, I'm gonna ask you

835
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:43,541
one more time, in case you didn't hear it.

836
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,081
You are now upset, annoyed,
like, why would that person

837
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:48,727
call me, they can text me or email me.

838
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:53,034
You are genuinely, you react
poorly to another human being

839
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:54,417
calling you.

840
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:55,500
Look at this.

841
00:38:57,611 --> 00:38:59,248
This is something that
was the most standard way

842
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:02,081
we communicated 36, 48 months ago.

843
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:04,256
Thank you.

844
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:06,703
More than half this room
is upset, literally,

845
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:08,497
(imitates phone buzz)

846
00:39:08,497 --> 00:39:11,142
Come on, mom, fuck you, you know?

847
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:12,808
(audience laughs)

848
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,641
Text me, I'll call you on my time.

849
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:18,168
(audience applauds)

850
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,001
Listen.

851
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:26,234
Do you know how many people
here, because this is not

852
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:28,625
just 18 year olds, didn't
think they were gonna

853
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:32,792
get a cell phone, because
their pager was good enough?

854
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:37,131
I remember those days.

855
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:40,373
Do you know how many people
here were not gonna text?

856
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:43,208
'Cause texting was for kids?

857
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,918
Do you know how many
people here, 36 months ago,

858
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,617
when they saw emojis for
the first time, thought

859
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,773
it was the stupidest shit of all time?

860
00:39:49,773 --> 00:39:52,134
But last night, sent a poop emoji?

861
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:55,138
(audience laughs)

862
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:59,305
We see new forms of
communication, and we resist them.

863
00:40:00,558 --> 00:40:03,899
Until we realize they save us time.

864
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:07,125
That thumbs up emoji has
saved me a lot of time.

865
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,056
'Cause it's quicker for me to say, good,

866
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:13,572
instead of okay, 'kay, it's
just speed, and if you're not

867
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:16,905
paying attention, we are going so hyper,

868
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:22,831
and that is why sound,
voice, is the next frontier.

869
00:40:22,831 --> 00:40:26,834
If you can figure out how
to build an Alexa Skill

870
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:30,289
that helps people with
your product and service,

871
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:32,817
that is a gateway drug then
to your overall product

872
00:40:32,817 --> 00:40:35,111
and service, you know how
some of you have tried

873
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:38,472
to come up with free ebooks, free trials,

874
00:40:38,472 --> 00:40:42,215
free this, free that, gateways into you?

875
00:40:42,215 --> 00:40:44,968
If you are able to provide
that in sound, in voice,

876
00:40:44,968 --> 00:40:47,104
if you then figure out
how, you have to understand

877
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,567
what happens, how many
people, anybody here build

878
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:53,493
an iPhone app when the
app store first came out?

879
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,326
Okay.

880
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,519
What happened, was there was a land grab.

881
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,669
There was not a lot of
apps, we all had the phone,

882
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:00,251
and so we went in there
and there was not as many

883
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:03,846
apps, and we pick the apps that we wanted.

884
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:04,873
There was a land grab.

885
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:06,510
There will be a land grab.

886
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,298
How many people here
have been in the Alexa,

887
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:11,619
the Amazon Alexa skill
store, how many of you

888
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,600
have been in there, raise your hands?

889
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,654
Right, about seven eight,
nine of you, right?

890
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:18,085
So you've seen, right?

891
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:19,228
It's interesting.

892
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:23,269
There's stuff there,
but not a lot of stuff.

893
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:24,102
Right?

894
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:26,454
This is the white space
that I recommend for

895
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:29,816
the people here that are
really trying to leap frog,

896
00:41:29,816 --> 00:41:32,188
who are willing to,
like the first question,

897
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:35,182
eat shit for 24 to 36 months, stay around,

898
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:37,749
stay around, stay around,
and then let the market

899
00:41:37,749 --> 00:41:39,296
come to you.

900
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:42,457
2009, ten, 11, 12, of
VaynerMedia, no company

901
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:44,014
wanted social media.

902
00:41:44,014 --> 00:41:46,091
What's the ROI, what is it, it's stupid,

903
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:48,449
are talking about us on Twitter?

904
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:51,141
We don't want people talking
about us, don't put our,

905
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,457
but we stayed around.

906
00:41:52,457 --> 00:41:55,666
We stayed around, and if
you're a stay around player,

907
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,635
if you're young, if you've
got the dollars to invest

908
00:41:58,635 --> 00:42:00,846
and you're worried about
being at the mercy of Google

909
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:03,982
or other things and you want to diversify,

910
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:05,825
or if you just generally
believe what I believe,

911
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:08,802
which is that technology
is eating up our society,

912
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:13,198
and technology's not
a thing, it is oxygen.

913
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,464
Well, then you will get very serious about

914
00:42:14,464 --> 00:42:16,695
the last ten minutes of
my rant here about voice

915
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:20,278
and you will go to Google,
and you will search

916
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:22,660
how to build an Alexa skill.

917
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,786
What's the difference
between an Alexa skill,

918
00:42:24,786 --> 00:42:26,635
and Alexa briefing?

919
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:28,696
I'll give it to you
quickly, a briefing is dumb,

920
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:30,409
you just record something and it plays,

921
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:34,337
a skill is AI, and technology,
and you can interact with it,

922
00:42:34,337 --> 00:42:36,313
it's more than app.

923
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:38,384
And so I think this is a
huge space, it's the one

924
00:42:38,384 --> 00:42:40,168
I'm most excited about,
I have not invested

925
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:42,984
in startups for the last 15 to 24 months,

926
00:42:42,984 --> 00:42:45,763
because I hate them all, I
think everything's overpriced,

927
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,476
I think everybody's an
entrepreneur, I don't think

928
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:49,604
anybody's interesting
anymore, I think it's all

929
00:42:49,604 --> 00:42:51,938
club promoters that now
think they're entrepreneurs,

930
00:42:51,938 --> 00:42:53,105
it just sucks.

931
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,768
But this is the first time I feel ready

932
00:42:55,768 --> 00:42:58,653
to invest again, because
I went to Seattle,

933
00:42:58,653 --> 00:43:01,322
I saw the incubator that
is only people building

934
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:04,922
on top of Alexa, it's creative
shit I'd never thought of,

935
00:43:04,922 --> 00:43:08,031
I saw an app that you
say, Alexa, I'm starting

936
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:09,127
to read the book.

937
00:43:09,127 --> 00:43:12,333
You read a child's
book, you start talking.

938
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,806
The boy ran through the street.

939
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:16,940
And Alexa starts making the sound of a boy

940
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,381
running in the street.

941
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:21,208
And as you're reading,
Alexa is complementing you

942
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,552
with surround sound.

943
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:25,365
He jumped in the puddle,
it started to rain.

944
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:27,098
You know, it's funny, I
don't think you can zoom in

945
00:43:27,098 --> 00:43:29,602
but maybe you two can
see it, my goosebumps.

946
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:32,023
I sat there and is said,
oh my God, no child

947
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:35,377
will be read a book in seven years without

948
00:43:35,377 --> 00:43:38,960
background noise
complementing the content.

949
00:43:39,987 --> 00:43:40,820
Right?

950
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,986
You understand?

951
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,198
It's just so interesting.

952
00:43:44,198 --> 00:43:45,116
There's just so much.

953
00:43:45,116 --> 00:43:48,972
And let me tell you,
when your shirt's collar

954
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:53,921
is sound activated, and you,
when Alexa starts making deals

955
00:43:53,921 --> 00:43:58,913
with Ralph Lauren, and your
collar is there, and anything

956
00:43:58,913 --> 00:44:01,408
you think that you need to
create lack of friction of,

957
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,760
you just say, and it gets done.

958
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,472
We will all be addicted to
that, 'cause that is speed.

959
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:11,978
And if you could be the,
Alexa, I need a lawyer.

960
00:44:11,978 --> 00:44:15,728
All of a sudden, Google
search is in trouble.

961
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:19,185
And so we live in a world
where we've accepted

962
00:44:19,185 --> 00:44:23,184
the reality without
anticipating what's coming next.

963
00:44:23,184 --> 00:44:25,366
Some of us lived in a
world where Yahoo was

964
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:27,887
the biggest search engine.

965
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:30,371
Some of us lived in a
world where Microsoft

966
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:33,404
was the company that we
had to regulate, because

967
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,904
they were too big.

968
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:39,339
We forget that this is
always gonna keep happening,

969
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:40,964
and the only thing that
your should be religious to

970
00:44:40,964 --> 00:44:45,928
and it went away, is the
attention of the end consumer

971
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:48,452
and what's over priced
and under priced, what's

972
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:52,035
too early, VR, in my
opinion, is too early,

973
00:44:52,934 --> 00:44:55,619
because you've gotta stay
alive for quite a long time

974
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,375
before people do it at scale.

975
00:44:57,375 --> 00:45:00,643
Maybe I'm right, maybe
I'm wrong, we'll see.

976
00:45:00,643 --> 00:45:03,449
But we have an incredible,
incredible decade

977
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:04,697
ahead of us.

978
00:45:04,697 --> 00:45:06,780
I wanna remind everybody here.

979
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,778
Actually, how many people
are retiring in 12 years?

980
00:45:09,778 --> 00:45:12,848
And I don't mean, you're gonna
come up with some big idea

981
00:45:12,848 --> 00:45:16,749
crush it, and buy an island,
I mean you're fucking old

982
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:18,340
and you're finished.

983
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,963
(audience laughs)

984
00:45:19,963 --> 00:45:22,131
12 years, raise your hands?

985
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:24,564
Okay, there's about six, seven of us.

986
00:45:24,564 --> 00:45:28,014
I want to remind everybody
else that 12 years ago,

987
00:45:28,014 --> 00:45:31,505
almost everything we
talk about did not exist.

988
00:45:31,505 --> 00:45:34,558
Not Uber, not Facebook, not
Youtube, not the iPhone,

989
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:35,391
nothing.

990
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,271
And so, I implore everybody to understand

991
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,566
what I'm trying to do
in this talk, which is

992
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:46,154
change your mental strategy
of what you're gonna need

993
00:45:46,154 --> 00:45:48,157
to be successful.

994
00:45:48,157 --> 00:45:51,870
This is not about running
a simple Facebook ad.

995
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,203
This is not about learning
what an under priced

996
00:45:54,203 --> 00:45:57,070
or over priced influencer is.

997
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,295
This is all those things,
but unless you have

998
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:01,792
the mindset of patience and empathy, and

999
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:05,134
really understanding the
reality of the marketplace,

1000
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:07,634
there are people here, my friends,

1001
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:10,553
there are multi-billion
dollar international companies

1002
00:46:10,553 --> 00:46:12,534
that will be out of business
in five years, because

1003
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:14,639
of what's going on.

1004
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,893
Do you think your eight
million dollar a year business

1005
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:17,726
is safe?

1006
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:21,368
The level of audacity of the entrepreneurs

1007
00:46:21,368 --> 00:46:23,232
and business people in here
who have a 50 million dollar

1008
00:46:23,232 --> 00:46:24,824
business and think they're good.

1009
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,961
Because they've been good
for the last 15 years,

1010
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:30,158
is extraordinary, and
it is going to create

1011
00:46:30,158 --> 00:46:33,585
a ton of carnage in the
entrepreneurial and business

1012
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:36,619
landscape, because the
skill sets that it will take

1013
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:39,917
to survive this next 15
years, are going to be

1014
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,608
extraordinary.

1015
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:43,259
Do you know how many of your
friends are out of a job

1016
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:47,426
once people understand the power
of AI and machine learning?

1017
00:46:48,397 --> 00:46:51,138
I mean, do you understand
the ramifications

1018
00:46:51,138 --> 00:46:54,640
if block chain ever
actually hit full-scale?

1019
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,184
It arbitrages out the need for countries.

1020
00:46:58,184 --> 00:47:00,472
Outside of weapons.

1021
00:47:00,472 --> 00:47:04,400
We are living through fucking crazy times.

1022
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,338
And people think it's
like some silly update,

1023
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:07,925
like the iPhone ten.

1024
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,738
This is not, this silly
shit, this is the most

1025
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:13,284
macro thing that has
happened to human beings,

1026
00:47:13,284 --> 00:47:16,896
in just 20 years of consumer
internet, we have watched

1027
00:47:16,896 --> 00:47:21,133
the internet tumble
dictatorships, create new dynamics

1028
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:23,875
in the most powerful companies,
excuse me, countries,

1029
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:27,346
in the world, take down the
biggest companies in the world.

1030
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:29,478
Amazon has become the
biggest company in the world

1031
00:47:29,478 --> 00:47:31,518
or the potential biggest
company in the world,

1032
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:33,394
by using Google ads.

1033
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:35,725
The first seven years of Google ads.

1034
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:38,651
That's who the biggest
advertiser was on Google ads.

1035
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:41,104
Attention arbitrage.

1036
00:47:41,104 --> 00:47:43,960
Where is your customer, what do they do,

1037
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,279
and why are you holding
up, what got you here,

1038
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,196
instead of figuring
out what you need to do

1039
00:47:50,196 --> 00:47:51,878
to still be around.

1040
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:55,374
The great mental flaw of this room.

1041
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:58,411
Is that you put on a pedestal,
if you're successful,

1042
00:47:58,411 --> 00:48:00,973
what got you here,
without realizing that is

1043
00:48:00,973 --> 00:48:03,751
exactly what gives you no
chance to be successful

1044
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:04,918
going forward.

1045
00:48:05,955 --> 00:48:07,887
For all the accolades
and all the cool things

1046
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:11,509
going on with me, nothing
matters that I've done yesterday

1047
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:13,032
and behind.

1048
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:14,870
It is always having the level of humility

1049
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,418
to know the customer's
right, and to be religious

1050
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:20,433
about what the customer's
doing, and then providing value

1051
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:21,915
to the customer.

1052
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:23,998
Nothing else, ever, ever.

1053
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,343
Ever.

1054
00:48:27,317 --> 00:48:28,359
Thank you.

1055
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:32,359
(audience applauds extensively)

1056
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:48,585
- That was a good one.

1057
00:48:51,016 --> 00:48:55,011
Gary, two years ago, at Elevate,
the main speaker, he was

1058
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:59,514
talking about how only 5% at
max, leaves a room like this,

1059
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:02,006
leaves a conference like
this, and really deploys

1060
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,540
any of the knowledge that has been ...

1061
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,767
- [Gary] That was a very optimistic dude.

1062
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:06,767
- Thank you.

1063
00:49:07,895 --> 00:49:09,858
So, I guess I'm insane if I have a vision

1064
00:49:09,858 --> 00:49:12,276
that that number should be much higher.

1065
00:49:12,276 --> 00:49:13,215
Nonetheless ...

1066
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,945
- It's not gonna be.

1067
00:49:14,945 --> 00:49:15,778
(audience chuckles)

1068
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:16,664
It's not.

1069
00:49:16,664 --> 00:49:18,825
And I'm not trying to cut you
off, it's because what I'm

1070
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,181
trying to do right now
is make the number be

1071
00:49:20,181 --> 00:49:22,495
two people to three people.

1072
00:49:22,495 --> 00:49:23,968
'Cause they're gonna get mad
that I'm calling them out,

1073
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:26,708
and I'm trying everything,
love, hate, oil, vinegar,

1074
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:29,545
honey, I'm trying everything
on you to do something

1075
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:33,712
about this, but unfortunately,
people run their lives

1076
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:36,765
on defense and fear.

1077
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:37,917
- [Man In Audience] I'll fucking do it.

1078
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:38,750
- Good.

1079
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,121
(laughter)

1080
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:44,666
And to me, I hope that you
bring this up, me doing that,

1081
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:48,813
him doing that, the stakes are very high.

1082
00:49:48,813 --> 00:49:51,258
And I think the reason we
got tricked, was the world

1083
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:54,198
didn't change for 70 years.

1084
00:49:54,198 --> 00:49:57,865
My friends, the growth
from the 30s to 2000,

1085
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:03,081
were minor, when you understand
what the internet's done.

1086
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:05,873
There were big, stuff happened.

1087
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:08,373
But there's nothing like this.

1088
00:50:11,837 --> 00:50:13,525
(audience laughs)

1089
00:50:13,525 --> 00:50:16,525
(audience applauds)

1090
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,307
- But I guess you agree,
then, when somebody

1091
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:27,310
actually does do it, then it's
also fair to celebrate it.

1092
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,143
- Yes.

1093
00:50:28,143 --> 00:50:31,106
- And instead of just
asking for, to put the name

1094
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:33,123
on the T-Shirt, but when
somebody has actually done it,

1095
00:50:33,123 --> 00:50:35,987
then it's also fair enough
to do something about it.

1096
00:50:35,987 --> 00:50:36,820
So ...

1097
00:50:38,255 --> 00:50:39,672
This guy that ...

1098
00:50:41,324 --> 00:50:42,949
We see ...

1099
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:44,532
Here, okay, is Mez.

1100
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:49,856
And Mez, I don't know if you
can say that he is the Danish

1101
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:52,898
version of you, in terms of getting views,

1102
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:56,332
he's pretty good, and in terms
of building a personal brand,

1103
00:50:56,332 --> 00:50:58,329
he's done pretty well for himself.

1104
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:00,970
So, we really would like
to celebrate when people

1105
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,179
do something.

1106
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:04,718
So, among all the people who
have asked to get some time

1107
00:51:04,718 --> 00:51:07,282
with you, and get some time
in front of everyone here,

1108
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:10,186
I think that Mez is a worthy candidate.

1109
00:51:10,186 --> 00:51:11,019
- [Gary] That's awesome.

1110
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:14,080
- So, Mez actually has, the
first question for you here,

1111
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,440
this following up Q and A,
but if I know him right,

1112
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,849
this is gonna turn into a
little bit of a weird thing,

1113
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:22,490
I hope he keeps his
clothes on, because half of

1114
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,397
the times, when he speaks in public,

1115
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:25,661
half of it goes off.

1116
00:51:25,661 --> 00:51:27,663
But, Mez Myers.

1117
00:51:27,663 --> 00:51:30,663
(audience applauds)

1118
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,882
- [Mez] Hello, Gary.

1119
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:36,918
- How are you, my friend?
- I'd like to be myself when

1120
00:51:36,918 --> 00:51:38,923
- [Mez] I talk to you,
so if you don't mind,

1121
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:41,300
and everyone else, I'd
like to drop my shirt.

1122
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,538
- Yes.

1123
00:51:42,538 --> 00:51:43,558
Understand.

1124
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:47,902
(audience applauds and cheers)

1125
00:51:47,902 --> 00:51:50,070
- [Mez] And I know this
might seem odd, but

1126
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,182
as a 16 year old kid, I
wanted to be a speaker,

1127
00:51:53,182 --> 00:51:55,384
I wanted to go to schools
and help people build

1128
00:51:55,384 --> 00:51:58,434
their own self-esteem, I
really care about the youth,

1129
00:51:58,434 --> 00:52:01,291
and as someone who's suffered
from feeling different,

1130
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,922
because I have this huge
fucking scar on my stomach,

1131
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:08,131
you can't see shit, but it's
okay, but it's 24 centimeters,

1132
00:52:08,131 --> 00:52:10,381
and if you imagine an iPad.

1133
00:52:13,332 --> 00:52:16,722
In a vertical way, that's
the length of my scar,

1134
00:52:16,722 --> 00:52:18,073
which is a lot.

1135
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:19,490
From a small boy.

1136
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:23,418
So, I learned to dig
into the topic that you

1137
00:52:23,418 --> 00:52:26,116
really dig, which is
self-awareness, and I learned

1138
00:52:26,116 --> 00:52:29,726
a lot about myself until
I was capable of standing

1139
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:33,096
at a stage and talking to
people, and when I finally

1140
00:52:33,096 --> 00:52:35,131
got that thing going, where, you know,

1141
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:36,732
I got this shit!

1142
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:39,728
I started to tell myself,
if I can't walk the talk,

1143
00:52:39,728 --> 00:52:42,458
social media wise, and
preach my message, just like

1144
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:45,450
I do nowadays, then I'm shit.

1145
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,475
So I did, and everything
escalated, and my brand

1146
00:52:48,475 --> 00:52:53,082
started growing, and going
from, I live in a basement.

1147
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:55,165
Which is quite nice.

1148
00:52:55,165 --> 00:52:58,167
But, going from the basement
to becoming a national speaker

1149
00:52:58,167 --> 00:53:01,088
at schools was something
different, and the pressure grew

1150
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:03,531
within the last five months, which I love,

1151
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:06,605
because I got a lot of
speaking jobs, so that's nice.

1152
00:53:06,605 --> 00:53:09,639
I usually say I'm a stripper,
which is because I drop

1153
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:10,807
my clothes.

1154
00:53:10,807 --> 00:53:13,021
Not at the principal's office,
like, (imitates knocking)

1155
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:15,146
hello, but, you don't.

1156
00:53:15,146 --> 00:53:18,990
But, the point is, as the
pressure grew, how do you,

1157
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,735
as an international speaker,
with all of your attention,

1158
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:25,688
how do you cope with all of the pressure,

1159
00:53:25,688 --> 00:53:29,451
in terms of hate and
everything that goes on?

1160
00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:30,701
- Quite easily.

1161
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,165
From a very basic thing.

1162
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:38,332
I know what my intent is,
and I'm very grounded in it.

1163
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:44,248
And I deploy enormous amounts
of empathy to my haters.

1164
00:53:44,248 --> 00:53:47,427
When somebody leaves a
comment on my Facebook

1165
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:50,772
or anywhere else that I'm
a charlatan, or a snake oil

1166
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:53,767
salesman, or my daddy
gave me the money to build

1167
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:56,152
the liquor store and I
shouldn't be listened to,

1168
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:59,120
I understand why they say that.

1169
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,287
I know it's not true, and you
know, it feeds me in a very

1170
00:54:05,234 --> 00:54:06,067
good way.

1171
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:09,356
And so, for me, to be very
honest with you, brother,

1172
00:54:09,356 --> 00:54:13,261
it's been very easy, because
when your intent is pure,

1173
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:15,343
and comes from a good place, I think about

1174
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:18,343
succeeding in one very simple story.

1175
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:21,964
There are two ways, my friends, to build

1176
00:54:21,964 --> 00:54:24,865
the biggest building in town.

1177
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:26,421
Step number one.

1178
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:30,390
Just build the biggest building in town.

1179
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,756
Step number two, build
a decent sized building

1180
00:54:33,756 --> 00:54:36,323
and then spend all your
time trying to tear down

1181
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:38,859
everybody else's building around you down

1182
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:42,218
so you end up being the
biggest building in town.

1183
00:54:42,218 --> 00:54:46,324
My friend, 95% of people
try to do number two.

1184
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,575
But when you know you
can build the fucking

1185
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:50,489
biggest building in town, you do that.

1186
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:52,772
And so, because I know what my intent is,

1187
00:54:52,772 --> 00:54:56,781
I just don't value anybody's
opinion about me, including

1188
00:54:56,781 --> 00:55:00,363
my parents and wife and
children, more than I value

1189
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,363
my opinion about myself.

1190
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,421
(audience applauds)

1191
00:55:05,421 --> 00:55:06,421
- Thank you.

1192
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:14,513
Before I leave, not directly
leave, I'd like to give

1193
00:55:14,513 --> 00:55:16,623
you something, Gary, this is
not wine, this is something

1194
00:55:16,623 --> 00:55:21,397
that has great importance
to me, because everything

1195
00:55:21,397 --> 00:55:24,450
I've done in the last two
years, building my brand,

1196
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,866
has been built upon something different.

1197
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:31,371
And those I give this to is
only to those who inspired me,

1198
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:34,139
for example, you, to create
this concept in this way,

1199
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:35,197
being me.

1200
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:37,159
So, I'd like to give you something.

1201
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,742
- [Gary] Fantastic.

1202
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:42,686
- [Mez] I'd like to give you
a rubber duck, and this might

1203
00:55:42,686 --> 00:55:45,989
seem odd, but whenever
I talk, I talk about

1204
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:48,631
becoming the ugly duckling,
standing up to yourself,

1205
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:51,385
giving zero fucks about everyone else.

1206
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:52,863
That's what I preach
to the youth at least,

1207
00:55:52,863 --> 00:55:55,162
that's why I'm naked.

1208
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:57,133
- [Gary] Well, fuck, if I had
a six pack I'd be naked all

1209
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:58,026
the time, too.

1210
00:55:58,026 --> 00:55:59,771
- Yeah! (laughs)

1211
00:55:59,771 --> 00:56:01,702
So I'd like to give you this, Gary.

1212
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:03,483
- Happy birthday, nice to meet you.

1213
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:04,316
- You too.

1214
00:56:04,316 --> 00:56:06,649
- You're gonna be a success.

1215
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:09,860
That takes no courage,
if I was fucking ripped,

1216
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,988
I'd be like, yeah.

1217
00:56:10,988 --> 00:56:13,616
(audience laughs)

1218
00:56:13,616 --> 00:56:14,449
Cool.

1219
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:15,282
- [Woman] Cool.

1220
00:56:15,282 --> 00:56:18,183
And now, we've officially
gone into the Q and A.

1221
00:56:18,183 --> 00:56:20,605
- Yes, clearly.
- (laughs)

1222
00:56:20,605 --> 00:56:24,295
- Alright, and we have the
next question from Mez,

1223
00:56:24,295 --> 00:56:25,711
where are you Mez?

1224
00:56:25,711 --> 00:56:26,544
What?

1225
00:56:26,544 --> 00:56:27,377
- That was Mez.

1226
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:28,335
- Oh.

1227
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:29,466
- Next one.

1228
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:30,734
Line, line.

1229
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:32,548
- Oh, you missed one.

1230
00:56:32,548 --> 00:56:33,465
- One back.

1231
00:56:34,426 --> 00:56:35,899
One back.

1232
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:36,732
- [Woman] One back.

1233
00:56:36,732 --> 00:56:38,065
- There we go.

1234
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:38,898
Yep, good.

1235
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:42,953
- [Woman] Women and technology, right?

1236
00:56:42,953 --> 00:56:44,581
Yeah, Leanie.

1237
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:46,788
Oh, she was right here,
can we have a mic runner?

1238
00:56:46,788 --> 00:56:47,621
- Yep, she's coming.

1239
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:49,788
- [Woman] Yeah, thank you.

1240
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:57,949
- By the way, this lovely
lady who just brought the mic,

1241
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:01,432
is wearing Vans sneakers,
if you do what I do

1242
00:57:01,432 --> 00:57:03,320
for a living, and try
to understand culture

1243
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,193
and how things happen,
Vans 30 months ago, got

1244
00:57:07,193 --> 00:57:10,293
very aggressive in paying
Instagram influencers

1245
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,272
to wear Vans, and that
is why Vans is back.

1246
00:57:13,272 --> 00:57:16,738
Period, end of story,
everything else is secondary.

1247
00:57:16,738 --> 00:57:19,098
That is why so many kids are wearing Vans,

1248
00:57:19,098 --> 00:57:20,728
for all the people that
are wondering why they see

1249
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,936
more Vans today, period, end of story.

1250
00:57:23,936 --> 00:57:28,690
(audience chuckles and applauds)

1251
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,858
Just trying to help, just
trying to make you see

1252
00:57:30,858 --> 00:57:32,078
that it's happening.

1253
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:33,339
This is not coming.

1254
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:34,172
I'm sorry, go ahead.

1255
00:57:34,172 --> 00:57:36,488
- [Leanie] It's okay.

1256
00:57:36,488 --> 00:57:38,575
First of all, thank you, Gary, for coming,

1257
00:57:38,575 --> 00:57:41,671
I'm a big big fan, and I've
been listening to your podcast

1258
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:43,065
for more than a year now.

1259
00:57:43,065 --> 00:57:46,728
Hours and hours and hours, which
makes it a little difficult

1260
00:57:46,728 --> 00:57:48,292
actually to ask questions because ...

1261
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:49,565
- Right, 'cause you know all the answers.

1262
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,156
- [Leanie] I know all the answers.

1263
00:57:51,156 --> 00:57:54,213
But before asking the
question, I just wanted to

1264
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:58,380
thank you, to say thank
you to Casper for actually

1265
00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:03,057
taking the risk bringing you here.

1266
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:05,867
For all of us in
Copenhagen, small country.

1267
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:08,980
So, I think we should actually
clap it up for Casper.

1268
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,980
(audience applauds)

1269
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,863
And actually that is along
the lines of the question

1270
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:23,782
I've formulated up there,
is because I think Casper

1271
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:28,346
must've suffocated some
excuses to do what he's done,

1272
00:58:28,346 --> 00:58:32,513
and I'm working on all my
excuses, but, and I see you

1273
00:58:33,912 --> 00:58:36,288
working on people's excuses.

1274
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:37,967
- A lot.
- So ...

1275
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:42,079
- [Leanie] Not being Gary
V, how can I sort of inspire

1276
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,037
people around me to work on their excuses?

1277
00:58:45,037 --> 00:58:48,978
- By, you know, it's funny,
long before I was Gary V,

1278
00:58:48,978 --> 00:58:51,397
this is what I was doing
for my high school friends,

1279
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:55,348
who were doing stupid things
like drugs and alcohol

1280
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:57,706
or driving drunk, because
they wanted to act cool

1281
00:58:57,706 --> 00:59:02,700
in front of somebody, this
is just about self-esteem.

1282
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,652
It's so simple, it's almost
overly emotional for me.

1283
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:09,095
This is about self-esteem.

1284
00:59:09,095 --> 00:59:12,264
The way I choose to do it, and
you know this is how I do it,

1285
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:14,181
is I go directly at it.

1286
00:59:16,215 --> 00:59:18,173
Every one of us can think
of somebody we care about

1287
00:59:18,173 --> 00:59:20,493
right now that's just not doing it right,

1288
00:59:20,493 --> 00:59:22,668
and all you have to do is
sit them down and tell them

1289
00:59:22,668 --> 00:59:25,530
they're not doing it right,
but we don't wanna do that,

1290
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:29,435
because we'd rather not
short-term hurt their feelings,

1291
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:33,150
and let them fail long-term,
which is remarkably crazy,

1292
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:36,150
if you give a fuck about somebody.

1293
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,495
So what can you do as not Gary V?

1294
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:41,727
Have the actual conversation,
and tell your sister,

1295
00:59:41,727 --> 00:59:45,285
your mom, your uncle, your
aunt, your child, your

1296
00:59:45,285 --> 00:59:47,739
best friend, the next
time they come up with

1297
00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:51,665
an excuse, that it's a fucking excuse.

1298
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:53,416
The reason I say the thing
that if there's anybody

1299
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:55,794
that ever looked like you
that made it, then there's

1300
00:59:55,794 --> 00:59:58,881
no excuse, is 'cause I believe it.

1301
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:00,487
You know, it's really hard,
you're in an argument,

1302
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:03,344
and your friend tells
you, that's great, Gary,

1303
01:00:03,344 --> 01:00:06,264
but both my parents were alcoholics.

1304
01:00:06,264 --> 01:00:07,859
And that really fucked me up.

1305
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:09,562
Right now, you're on the defense,
that's a good first punch

1306
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:10,395
by them.

1307
01:00:11,796 --> 01:00:14,569
I'm like, cool, we don't need to use me.

1308
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,115
If anybody has ever been
successful, that had two alcoholic

1309
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,847
parents, which by the
way, I know of three.

1310
01:00:21,847 --> 01:00:25,948
Well, then, now what's your excuse, Karen?

1311
01:00:25,948 --> 01:00:29,286
We are just so interested
in blaming everybody else,

1312
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:31,871
and excuses, 'cause we don't wanna take on

1313
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,121
responsibility.

1314
01:00:34,512 --> 01:00:36,876
And somewhere a long time
ago, I went completely,

1315
01:00:36,876 --> 01:00:40,779
I only, you know, I think
everything is my fault?

1316
01:00:40,779 --> 01:00:42,259
Like, all of it?

1317
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:45,215
Like, I think it's weirdly
cloudy outside right now,

1318
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:47,805
and not nice out, my fault.

1319
01:00:47,805 --> 01:00:49,400
(audience chuckles)

1320
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,474
Like, his scar, my fault.

1321
01:00:51,474 --> 01:00:54,384
Like, I fucking just
default into my fault.

1322
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,771
And everybody tries to do everything else

1323
01:00:55,771 --> 01:00:57,080
the other way.

1324
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,994
And let me tell you how
good life becomes when you

1325
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:01,278
take on responsibility.

1326
01:01:01,278 --> 01:01:03,445
It gets real good.

1327
01:01:03,445 --> 01:01:04,930
Some of you, and there's a
lot of you that follow me.

1328
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,699
You know why I keep
bringing up the last scene

1329
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:09,062
of 8 Mile, the Eminem
movie, how many people

1330
01:01:09,062 --> 01:01:10,369
have seen that movie?

1331
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:11,202
Great.

1332
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:14,833
The last scene, they go into the battle,

1333
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:18,627
he makes fun of himself
the whole time, because

1334
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:22,339
it leaves the other person with nothing.

1335
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:25,607
The leverage is in being
accountable of everything.

1336
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:27,914
The leverage is exposing your weaknesses,

1337
01:01:27,914 --> 01:01:30,966
I proudly talk about
passing on Uber twice,

1338
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:33,998
being a DNF student, you
know, I proudly talk about

1339
01:01:33,998 --> 01:01:35,669
my shortcomings.

1340
01:01:35,669 --> 01:01:36,502
Right?

1341
01:01:36,502 --> 01:01:38,687
I can't wait for more
bad things to happen.

1342
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,794
I mean it.

1343
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:41,701
Because I will talk about
them, because, what?

1344
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:43,001
You're so fucking perfect?

1345
01:01:43,001 --> 01:01:44,650
Fuck you.

1346
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:45,483
Right?

1347
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:46,980
So, how do you do it?

1348
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,616
You have the conversation, and you realize

1349
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:51,497
that you're doing a disservice
to the people you love

1350
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:54,538
the most by holding your mouth shut.

1351
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:56,297
Because you're not willing
to deal with the short term

1352
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:57,130
conflict.

1353
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:02,886
(audience applauds)

1354
01:02:08,797 --> 01:02:10,519
- [Woman] Stoem.

1355
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,686
Where are you?

1356
01:02:13,473 --> 01:02:14,413
- Stoem?

1357
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:15,806
- [Woman] Are you here?

1358
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:17,686
Okay, then I will ...

1359
01:02:17,686 --> 01:02:19,119
Then we will take the next one.

1360
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,286
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1361
01:02:22,299 --> 01:02:23,772
- [Woman] What?

1362
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:24,605
(audience members shouting)

1363
01:02:24,605 --> 01:02:25,486
- Oh, it's a good question?
- What's the question?

1364
01:02:25,486 --> 01:02:26,472
- Good.
- Okay, then.

1365
01:02:26,472 --> 01:02:27,305
- Let's do it.

1366
01:02:27,305 --> 01:02:28,313
What is it?

1367
01:02:28,313 --> 01:02:31,492
- [Woman] Do you have a mentor
yourself, or master mind

1368
01:02:31,492 --> 01:02:34,270
group of people you
meet, on a regular basis,

1369
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:36,440
and discuss business matters with?

1370
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,501
- Nope.

1371
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:40,346
(audience laughs and applauds)

1372
01:02:40,346 --> 01:02:42,142
- [Woman] How's that for a good question?

1373
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:44,032
- And this is interesting,
I'm trying to figure out

1374
01:02:44,032 --> 01:02:45,712
if I can bring you value in this.

1375
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:47,045
Nor have I ever.

1376
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,507
My mentor is you.

1377
01:02:51,528 --> 01:02:54,218
It is far better for you
to look up to the 31 people

1378
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:58,385
that leave comments on your
shit, than to watch me more.

1379
01:03:01,355 --> 01:03:03,979
My mentor is the market.

1380
01:03:03,979 --> 01:03:07,903
My mentor is your attentions
and your behaviors.

1381
01:03:07,903 --> 01:03:11,324
So, I've, outside of my
parents, I don't know anything

1382
01:03:11,324 --> 01:03:13,908
about any business person ever.

1383
01:03:13,908 --> 01:03:15,800
I've read five books in
my life, I'm not part

1384
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,717
of any group, I consume no content.

1385
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,417
I consume the market.

1386
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,088
Which is why I see these
things, because I watch

1387
01:03:25,088 --> 01:03:26,161
what you do.

1388
01:03:26,161 --> 01:03:27,757
You know how Wikipedia
and Youtube, you start

1389
01:03:27,757 --> 01:03:29,499
watching something or reading
something, and three hours

1390
01:03:29,499 --> 01:03:33,531
later, you're learning about
like, redheaded Eskimos?

1391
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:34,364
Right?

1392
01:03:34,364 --> 01:03:36,717
That's what I do with people.

1393
01:03:36,717 --> 01:03:39,737
I get a lot of comments now.

1394
01:03:39,737 --> 01:03:41,571
70% of it is I'm the
greatest fucking thing

1395
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:43,749
of all time, which feels nice.

1396
01:03:43,749 --> 01:03:45,600
10% of it is I'm a piece of shit.

1397
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,913
And then 20%, there's
people trying to leave

1398
01:03:47,913 --> 01:03:49,069
something thoughtful.

1399
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:52,113
Of that 20%, 5% of it is thoughtful.

1400
01:03:52,113 --> 01:03:54,367
They figured it out, they
got it, and then I click

1401
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,575
their face.

1402
01:03:55,575 --> 01:03:57,131
Who else do they follow?

1403
01:03:57,131 --> 01:03:59,288
Oh, they're getting tricked by
that one, but they got this,

1404
01:03:59,288 --> 01:04:00,265
why?

1405
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:04,427
Oh, why are they taking
pictures of music festivals?

1406
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:05,628
Why are they drinking beer?

1407
01:04:05,628 --> 01:04:06,948
Why is craft beer moving?

1408
01:04:06,948 --> 01:04:10,250
What, and seven hours
later, I have a pulse

1409
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,273
on something that's
happening in the ecosystem.

1410
01:04:13,273 --> 01:04:15,801
I didn't invest in
Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr,

1411
01:04:15,801 --> 01:04:17,596
by accident.

1412
01:04:17,596 --> 01:04:19,225
I'm not hanging out with the hip-hop stars

1413
01:04:19,225 --> 01:04:23,653
that are the next Kanye,
and Drake, by accident.

1414
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:27,820
I'm doing real hard core research
of the thing that matters.

1415
01:04:29,943 --> 01:04:31,737
You're my mentor.

1416
01:04:31,737 --> 01:04:34,737
(audience applauds)

1417
01:04:41,198 --> 01:04:42,054
- [Woman] Leannie.

1418
01:04:42,054 --> 01:04:42,887
- [Leannie] That's me again.

1419
01:04:42,887 --> 01:04:43,931
- [Woman] That's you again!

1420
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:44,987
Amazing.

1421
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:47,279
- Listen, you're super fucking talented.

1422
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:48,112
Own it.

1423
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,481
How do you bring a plan ...

1424
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:54,219
I can read it, how do you
bring, or plan on bringing,

1425
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:58,348
your own children's perspective, meaning?

1426
01:04:58,348 --> 01:05:00,807
- [Leannie] Well, you talk
about a lot about perspective

1427
01:05:00,807 --> 01:05:01,640
and gratitude.

1428
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,726
- Yes, yes.

1429
01:05:02,726 --> 01:05:05,355
- [Leannie] And I guess in
Denmark, we're sort of all

1430
01:05:05,355 --> 01:05:07,847
very privileged, and you
talk about your own children

1431
01:05:07,847 --> 01:05:12,029
almost having a sort of a, you
know, chip on their shoulder

1432
01:05:12,029 --> 01:05:14,688
coming now, with you, in the, you know,

1433
01:05:14,688 --> 01:05:16,484
- Yeah, 'cause the level of
disrespect I have for them

1434
01:05:16,484 --> 01:05:17,741
is extraordinary.

1435
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:19,534
(laughter)

1436
01:05:19,534 --> 01:05:21,892
No, really, I mean like, you know, that's

1437
01:05:21,892 --> 01:05:24,625
a natural reaction to people
that are handed a lot of stuff,

1438
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:26,822
it can go one of two ways.

1439
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,036
- [Leannie] So ...

1440
01:05:29,036 --> 01:05:30,879
So, my children are privileged.

1441
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,712
- Yep.

1442
01:05:31,712 --> 01:05:33,384
- [Leannie] How do I
give them or bring them

1443
01:05:33,384 --> 01:05:36,760
the perspective, the gratitude?

1444
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,925
They're eight, ten and twelve, sorry,

1445
01:05:38,925 --> 01:05:41,346
eight, twelve, fourteen.

1446
01:05:41,346 --> 01:05:43,601
- This is the great
challenge for so many of us.

1447
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:46,227
So, first of all, there's
something that I watched,

1448
01:05:46,227 --> 01:05:47,771
this is something I've
been passionate about

1449
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:49,808
long before I had them.

1450
01:05:49,808 --> 01:05:51,775
Now, it really fucking matters.

1451
01:05:51,775 --> 01:05:54,278
And it will matter, you
heard me earlier say,

1452
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:57,393
forget about what I'm
doing, how they come out

1453
01:05:57,393 --> 01:06:00,393
is going to be my legacy, so I care.

1454
01:06:02,432 --> 01:06:05,181
First of all, for everybody in here,

1455
01:06:05,181 --> 01:06:07,600
you need to wrap yourself
around something most parents

1456
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,266
don't wanna wrap their
head around, which is,

1457
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:11,516
you can't fake environment.

1458
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:16,758
The amount of rich friends
I have who send their kid

1459
01:06:16,758 --> 01:06:20,702
for four days to Africa to
build a school, and think,

1460
01:06:20,702 --> 01:06:24,934
now, they're grounded,
is fucking ludicrous.

1461
01:06:24,934 --> 01:06:26,741
You can't fake environment.

1462
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:28,895
If you are privileged, you are privileged.

1463
01:06:28,895 --> 01:06:30,606
If you are not, you are not.

1464
01:06:30,606 --> 01:06:32,776
The great gift and curse for all of us,

1465
01:06:32,776 --> 01:06:35,944
if we have too much,
or we have too little.

1466
01:06:35,944 --> 01:06:38,348
Then your DNA, and
parenting, and environment,

1467
01:06:38,348 --> 01:06:41,348
take over, on which path you decide.

1468
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:45,705
What I'm doing, is,
there's a couple things

1469
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:50,387
that are my religious ten
commandments, and I'm sticking

1470
01:06:50,387 --> 01:06:53,993
to those and everything
else I'm unemotional about.

1471
01:06:53,993 --> 01:06:55,631
So number one.

1472
01:06:55,631 --> 01:06:56,464
Kindness.

1473
01:06:57,508 --> 01:06:59,927
Kindness is non-debatable.

1474
01:06:59,927 --> 01:07:04,094
If Xander and Misha ever deploy
meanness on somebody else,

1475
01:07:05,307 --> 01:07:09,311
especially based on how much
money mommy and daddy made,

1476
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:12,728
I will physically punch them in the face.

1477
01:07:14,525 --> 01:07:15,358
That's number one.

1478
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:17,622
Kindness is not debatable.

1479
01:07:17,622 --> 01:07:19,256
Number two.

1480
01:07:19,256 --> 01:07:22,839
They have to really
love what they're into.

1481
01:07:24,655 --> 01:07:27,792
I have no interest in my
kids being an entrepreneur.

1482
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:30,706
I have no interest in
my kids being a showman.

1483
01:07:30,706 --> 01:07:35,007
I want them to be what the
thing they love the most is.

1484
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:36,436
Number three.

1485
01:07:36,436 --> 01:07:40,353
There's no such thing as
fourth place trophies.

1486
01:07:41,476 --> 01:07:44,179
All these privileged
kids are being protected

1487
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:47,666
from hurt feelings, by
parents today, which is why

1488
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:49,533
they're gonna suck.

1489
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:50,560
(audience chuckles)

1490
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,335
Because in real life,
you come in fourth place,

1491
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:56,306
and eight place, so in my upper east side

1492
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:59,365
of Manhattan, culture,
there's a lot of eighth place

1493
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:02,724
trophies and everybody's
fucking great at everything.

1494
01:08:02,724 --> 01:08:05,763
I tell little kids that are six, you suck.

1495
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:07,162
(audience laughs)

1496
01:08:07,162 --> 01:08:09,900
Their parents get mad at me, but I'm like,

1497
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,567
Ricky sucks at golf!

1498
01:08:13,895 --> 01:08:15,562
So, no make-believe.

1499
01:08:18,337 --> 01:08:20,750
And then number four,
almost everything else does

1500
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:22,216
not matter.

1501
01:08:22,216 --> 01:08:25,270
Number five, update the
list as soon as I feel like

1502
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:28,016
I have to, in real-time,
as soon as I see something

1503
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:31,362
that makes me have to update the list.

1504
01:08:31,362 --> 01:08:32,194
- [Leannie] Thank you.

1505
01:08:32,194 --> 01:08:33,605
- You're welcome.

1506
01:08:33,606 --> 01:08:36,606
(audience applauds)

1507
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:41,926
- [Woman] Casper.

1508
01:08:41,926 --> 01:08:44,759
Can we get a mic runner to Casper?

1509
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,973
You look surprised, yeah.

1510
01:08:53,913 --> 01:08:55,475
- [Casper] So, what
personal skill, and not

1511
01:08:55,475 --> 01:08:58,043
a business skill, do you
believe to be the most

1512
01:08:58,044 --> 01:09:00,380
crucial for anyone to
develop in order to catapult

1513
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,819
one's business to the next level?

1514
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:04,652
- Empathy.

1515
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:07,800
I can't let it go.

1516
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,511
I can't let it go.

1517
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:11,183
I need you to have it.

1518
01:09:11,183 --> 01:09:13,384
I don't know how to
develop it, don't go buy

1519
01:09:13,384 --> 01:09:16,439
bullshit courses that teach
it, you know, before you do it,

1520
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:20,082
be thoughtful, but if you have
empathy, you have everything.

1521
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:21,567
It's just so big.

1522
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:22,992
It's so big.

1523
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,911
It makes you incredible at sales.

1524
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:28,446
I'm a great all time sales
man, 'cause I'm empathetic.

1525
01:09:28,446 --> 01:09:30,529
I basically can't even
live my life without,

1526
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:33,707
I watched my mother, and she has it too,

1527
01:09:33,707 --> 01:09:36,800
but we have different,
obviously, we're different.

1528
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,502
She's the centerpiece
of every single person

1529
01:09:38,502 --> 01:09:40,189
that knows her.

1530
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:42,540
Her empathy for everybody
becomes a leverage of everybody

1531
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:43,541
needing her.

1532
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:47,428
And she took it in a way,
and I got the benefit

1533
01:09:47,428 --> 01:09:49,185
of watching it, that I think allowed me

1534
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,283
to find a little bit of a
better lines in the sand

1535
01:09:51,283 --> 01:09:55,253
where to stop and start,
and I'm different,

1536
01:09:55,253 --> 01:09:57,331
in a lot of ways, businessey
and competitive, and

1537
01:09:57,331 --> 01:10:00,347
we're different, but when
you have empathy, you

1538
01:10:00,347 --> 01:10:01,858
have everything.

1539
01:10:01,858 --> 01:10:04,570
And I just, you know,
there's a lot of things

1540
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,805
I care about, right?

1541
01:10:05,805 --> 01:10:08,658
Gratitude, it surely makes
you positive, if you have

1542
01:10:08,658 --> 01:10:11,531
perspective on that, but
if I had to pick one, in

1543
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:13,811
the way you're asking, it's empathy, man.

1544
01:10:13,811 --> 01:10:16,523
If you just, like, all
of you care about you.

1545
01:10:16,523 --> 01:10:19,668
Not your customers, not your
employees, not your vendors,

1546
01:10:19,668 --> 01:10:22,586
and I get it, you have to
take care of your family.

1547
01:10:22,586 --> 01:10:23,561
I get it.

1548
01:10:23,561 --> 01:10:26,525
But it's the way, if you
care about them more,

1549
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:28,301
and figure out what's
left for you and what

1550
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:30,947
to do with it, you will have
for the rest of your life,

1551
01:10:30,947 --> 01:10:34,603
and I'm sure it's very
Biblical and very faith-driven

1552
01:10:34,603 --> 01:10:38,318
and very altruistic, it's, doesn't make it

1553
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,485
any less true.

1554
01:10:40,384 --> 01:10:41,217
Empathy.

1555
01:10:42,992 --> 01:10:45,992
(audience applauds)

1556
01:10:49,897 --> 01:10:52,785
- [Woman] Yes, and we
have gotten some notes

1557
01:10:52,785 --> 01:10:55,162
while you were speaking.

1558
01:10:55,162 --> 01:10:56,829
Li-li-don Keh-lu-ta.

1559
01:10:57,744 --> 01:10:58,577
Yeah!

1560
01:10:58,577 --> 01:10:59,411
Can we get a mic runner to him?

1561
01:10:59,411 --> 01:11:01,001
- All the way back?

1562
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:01,834
Yep.

1563
01:11:05,547 --> 01:11:06,410
- [Lilidon] Hello, Gary.

1564
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:07,303
- How are you?

1565
01:11:07,303 --> 01:11:08,282
- [Lilidon] I'm good, thanks.

1566
01:11:08,282 --> 01:11:09,115
You?

1567
01:11:09,115 --> 01:11:10,007
- Great.

1568
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:12,287
- [Lilidon] (chuckles)
I have a question about

1569
01:11:12,287 --> 01:11:15,434
passive income, and I wanna
know what kind of trends

1570
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:18,941
do you see for a person
interesting in that?

1571
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,314
I don't want to be stuck
in office nine to five

1572
01:11:21,314 --> 01:11:22,373
for the rest of my ...

1573
01:11:22,373 --> 01:11:25,242
- Well, passive income comes in two forms.

1574
01:11:25,242 --> 01:11:28,631
97% of the form is the
douchiest, shittiest thing

1575
01:11:28,631 --> 01:11:32,639
on earth, and 3% is the
tried and true thing

1576
01:11:32,639 --> 01:11:35,168
that has actually created
passive income in the history

1577
01:11:35,168 --> 01:11:36,640
of mankind.

1578
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,791
So, let's find out which side you're on.

1579
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:43,197
How are you thinking about,
when you say passive income,

1580
01:11:43,197 --> 01:11:45,947
do you mean some, what do you mean?

1581
01:11:45,947 --> 01:11:50,159
- [Lilidon] I mean not having
to work all day long ...

1582
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,094
(audience laughs)

1583
01:11:52,094 --> 01:11:55,199
I wanna be on a beach in
Mexico instead of being

1584
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,974
in an office in Sweden in cold November.

1585
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:00,202
- Are you being serious right now?

1586
01:12:00,202 --> 01:12:01,035
- [Lilidon] Yes, yes, I'm serious.

1587
01:12:01,035 --> 01:12:02,118
- Okay.

1588
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:04,350
(audience laughing)

1589
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:08,070
(audience applauds)

1590
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:12,238
The quickest way to not
be on a beach in Mexico

1591
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:15,775
is to think that passive income exists.

1592
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:17,577
It's a bad mindset.

1593
01:12:17,577 --> 01:12:18,605
I really believe that.

1594
01:12:18,605 --> 01:12:20,784
I think the reason so many
scumbuckets are making

1595
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:23,386
so much money, is because
you're buying stupid fucking

1596
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:26,128
courses over and over, thinking
there's some fucking magic

1597
01:12:26,128 --> 01:12:28,413
formula for passive income.

1598
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:29,964
Passive income looks like this.

1599
01:12:29,964 --> 01:12:32,576
You take money that you
can afford to go to zero,

1600
01:12:32,576 --> 01:12:34,378
and you put them into two
places that have historically

1601
01:12:34,378 --> 01:12:36,097
created passive income.

1602
01:12:36,097 --> 01:12:37,977
Public markets that you
don't care if it goes

1603
01:12:37,977 --> 01:12:41,394
up and down and you just wait
to the end, or real estate,

1604
01:12:41,394 --> 01:12:43,193
and you hope that your
real estate area doesn't

1605
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:44,375
get crushed.

1606
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:46,749
Everything else almost doesn't exist.

1607
01:12:46,749 --> 01:12:48,395
- [Lilidon] I'm thinking
more of real estate,

1608
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:50,641
because I've been
involved in it in Sweden.

1609
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:51,474
- Love it.

1610
01:12:51,474 --> 01:12:53,108
- [Lilidon] And for all the Danish people,

1611
01:12:53,108 --> 01:12:57,425
it's pretty like the
government is very restricting

1612
01:12:57,425 --> 01:13:00,438
on creating a real estate business, it's

1613
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:02,438
a lot of taxes, it's really
hard if you don't have

1614
01:13:02,438 --> 01:13:05,430
the money in the beginning.

1615
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:07,813
- So shouldn't you work
your face off to get money,

1616
01:13:07,813 --> 01:13:10,270
not buy dumb shit like
a watch and put it into

1617
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:11,571
the real estate?

1618
01:13:11,571 --> 01:13:12,882
- [Lilidon] (chuckles)

1619
01:13:12,882 --> 01:13:14,319
Yes, I should.

1620
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:15,659
(audience laughs and applauds)

1621
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:16,492
- Okay.

1622
01:13:18,343 --> 01:13:20,343
Look, look, you know ...

1623
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,628
And I think you know,
and I'm happy I could see

1624
01:13:23,628 --> 01:13:26,869
your energy, I'm so
passionate about this issue.

1625
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,572
There are people that
are ripping people off

1626
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:32,193
at the level of hundreds
of millions of dollars,

1627
01:13:32,193 --> 01:13:33,986
because they're selling this
dream, because they made

1628
01:13:33,986 --> 01:13:37,272
a video with pretty girls in
a beach in the background,

1629
01:13:37,272 --> 01:13:40,322
and are making people spend a
thousand, two, it's breaking

1630
01:13:40,322 --> 01:13:41,579
my heart.

1631
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:44,108
Passive income doesn't exist
and anything that starts

1632
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:46,743
with I don't want to work,
is already a problem.

1633
01:13:46,743 --> 01:13:49,480
What you need to do, is,
I understand, I don't want

1634
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,716
to work in an office or
something I'm not passionate

1635
01:13:51,716 --> 01:13:52,714
about.

1636
01:13:52,714 --> 01:13:56,468
What I, the best way to make
money, is to make less money

1637
01:13:56,468 --> 01:13:59,428
than you're making now,
enough to still live,

1638
01:13:59,428 --> 01:14:01,222
'cause you gotta live.

1639
01:14:01,222 --> 01:14:03,302
Around something that
does interest you, because

1640
01:14:03,302 --> 01:14:05,351
you wake up eight years
later, and it's something,

1641
01:14:05,351 --> 01:14:07,321
good is actually happening.

1642
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:09,690
So, it's not, the, everybody
wants to make it the

1643
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:13,104
extreme of, I'm sitting
in my job, I hate it,

1644
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:16,535
this sucks, all the
way to beach in Mexico.

1645
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,740
But there's a real
in-between, which is why

1646
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:22,377
I wrote Crush It, which is at
night, when you're done with

1647
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:24,580
your shit job that is paying for the life

1648
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:28,128
that you have to live right
now, A, you don't take some

1649
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:31,043
of that money and buy
dumb shit like 17 beers

1650
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:32,890
watching the World Cup.

1651
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:35,092
What you do instead is
you work on something

1652
01:14:35,092 --> 01:14:38,023
on the internet that costs
you nothing to start,

1653
01:14:38,023 --> 01:14:40,138
save all those dollars,
build something for yourself

1654
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:42,323
over seven years, and then transition from

1655
01:14:42,323 --> 01:14:45,240
the shit job, to your own business.

1656
01:14:47,392 --> 01:14:48,904
That's passive.

1657
01:14:48,904 --> 01:14:51,106
- [Lilidon] (chuckles)

1658
01:14:51,106 --> 01:14:52,632
Okay, thank you.

1659
01:14:52,632 --> 01:14:55,632
(audience applauds)

1660
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:01,884
- [Woman] And now for a
very exciting question.

1661
01:15:01,884 --> 01:15:02,967
Yaka Bierman!

1662
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:06,454
Yeah, can we get a mic runner up here?

1663
01:15:06,454 --> 01:15:07,804
Thank you!

1664
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:09,861
I'm looking forward to hearing this, Gary.

1665
01:15:09,861 --> 01:15:10,694
- Yeah?

1666
01:15:10,694 --> 01:15:11,527
- [Woman] Yeah, very much.

1667
01:15:11,527 --> 01:15:12,388
- Okay, good.
- It's an exciting question.

1668
01:15:12,388 --> 01:15:13,712
- [Yaka] Don't put pressure on me, now.

1669
01:15:13,712 --> 01:15:15,166
- Yeah.
- Yeah (laughing).

1670
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:15,999
- [Yaka] Hi, Gary.

1671
01:15:15,999 --> 01:15:16,832
- Hey, brother.

1672
01:15:16,832 --> 01:15:17,799
- [Yaka] Hey, I've been
following you since

1673
01:15:17,799 --> 01:15:18,966
2010.

1674
01:15:18,966 --> 01:15:19,799
- Thank you.

1675
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:21,544
- [Yaka] Been applying both Crush It

1676
01:15:21,544 --> 01:15:24,515
and the Thank You, Economy,
and it's really changed

1677
01:15:24,515 --> 01:15:25,744
everything I've done.

1678
01:15:25,744 --> 01:15:26,577
- Thank you.

1679
01:15:26,577 --> 01:15:28,143
- [Yaka] I published a book this year.

1680
01:15:28,143 --> 01:15:29,377
- Congrats.
- In doing the content

1681
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:32,072
- [Yaka] Marketing ever since,
with the Guilt Marketing

1682
01:15:32,072 --> 01:15:33,084
perspective.

1683
01:15:33,084 --> 01:15:37,215
I wanna show it to you
later, because I've tried to

1684
01:15:37,215 --> 01:15:39,444
give you some attention
in the book, even though

1685
01:15:39,444 --> 01:15:40,963
it's on strength training.

1686
01:15:40,963 --> 01:15:41,824
- Thank you.

1687
01:15:41,824 --> 01:15:44,468
- [Yaka] My question for today
is, you have been talking

1688
01:15:44,468 --> 01:15:48,169
a bit about meditation, and
mental practice as being

1689
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,682
the next big thing, if
you would call it that.

1690
01:15:51,682 --> 01:15:55,660
But I kind of feel like it
seems that you're a bit afraid

1691
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,088
of doing it yourself.

1692
01:15:57,088 --> 01:15:58,047
- I am.

1693
01:15:58,047 --> 01:15:59,434
- [Yaka] For what, and why?

1694
01:15:59,434 --> 01:16:01,805
- Because my head is perfect,
and I don't want to fuck

1695
01:16:01,805 --> 01:16:02,700
with it.

1696
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,997
(audience laughs and applauds)

1697
01:16:03,997 --> 01:16:05,639
I'm being dead serious.

1698
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:07,556
I'm being dead serious.

1699
01:16:09,538 --> 01:16:13,396
I could be completely
out of my mind, but I am

1700
01:16:13,396 --> 01:16:14,396
so happy ...

1701
01:16:16,191 --> 01:16:17,024
Always.

1702
01:16:17,983 --> 01:16:20,307
That the thought that
meditation may do something

1703
01:16:20,307 --> 01:16:24,626
and open up some tunnel
in my brain, that takes,

1704
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:27,293
when you are 100% happy ...

1705
01:16:28,661 --> 01:16:30,504
The fuck would you fuck with that with?

1706
01:16:30,504 --> 01:16:33,023
(audience laughs)

1707
01:16:33,023 --> 01:16:33,856
But ...

1708
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:36,628
- [Yaka] But, as you
said, it's good to grow,

1709
01:16:36,628 --> 01:16:39,004
but why not grow even
more, in a business sense?

1710
01:16:39,004 --> 01:16:41,634
- You're right, what I'm
scared of is, I genuinely think

1711
01:16:41,634 --> 01:16:45,801
it's 100, and unlike
business, 100% of something

1712
01:16:46,788 --> 01:16:48,539
doesn't have 101.

1713
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:50,636
- [Yaka] But what if it's 80?

1714
01:16:50,636 --> 01:16:52,227
- That's a great question.

1715
01:16:52,227 --> 01:16:56,560
But, in a world where my
intuition has been everything

1716
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,408
for my entire life and my
entire intuition is like,

1717
01:16:59,408 --> 01:17:01,777
fuck you, I'm gonna listen
to me, I'm gonna listen

1718
01:17:01,777 --> 01:17:02,820
to me.

1719
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,989
(audience laughs)

1720
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:05,508
That's why.

1721
01:17:05,508 --> 01:17:07,091
That being said ...

1722
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:10,704
As you may know, 'cause
you've been paying attention,

1723
01:17:10,704 --> 01:17:14,371
I did meditate twice
now, once in a company.

1724
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,084
(audience laughs)

1725
01:17:16,084 --> 01:17:17,212
I'm telling you.

1726
01:17:17,212 --> 01:17:19,337
I'm telling you my truth,
I mean, this is, you know,

1727
01:17:19,337 --> 01:17:20,892
I invested in a company called Inscape,

1728
01:17:20,892 --> 01:17:23,233
it has a studio in New York and an app.

1729
01:17:23,233 --> 01:17:25,468
And then I did a podcast where
Dan Harris made me meditate

1730
01:17:25,468 --> 01:17:26,468
on the show.

1731
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:30,096
It didn't go well.

1732
01:17:30,096 --> 01:17:31,180
(audience chuckles)

1733
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,180
I tried to shut off, but I couldn't.

1734
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:38,680
I'm making some jokes,
on a very serious kick,

1735
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,106
I'm not super duper scared
of it, there's a lot of truth

1736
01:17:42,106 --> 01:17:43,856
in what I just said,
but I'm not against it,

1737
01:17:43,856 --> 01:17:46,794
I've already done it twice,
I could see myself meditating

1738
01:17:46,794 --> 01:17:47,627
in the future.

1739
01:17:47,627 --> 01:17:50,264
I genuinely think I'm
meditating in real time always,

1740
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:51,490
I really mean it.

1741
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:54,495
I'm, I'm pulling, you
know, some of you that

1742
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:57,751
are meeting me right now,
I'm a real enigma, I'm

1743
01:17:57,751 --> 01:17:59,550
pulling in a lot of
contradictions, I'm carrying

1744
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,572
a lot of conflicting thoughts.

1745
01:18:02,572 --> 01:18:04,794
I desperately care about you so much

1746
01:18:04,794 --> 01:18:07,046
that I'm reading every
one of your comments,

1747
01:18:07,046 --> 01:18:08,304
yet I actually don't
give a fuck about what

1748
01:18:08,304 --> 01:18:10,178
you're saying.

1749
01:18:10,178 --> 01:18:11,011
Right?

1750
01:18:11,011 --> 01:18:12,446
Like, I'm doing a lot of
weird shit, and I feel like

1751
01:18:12,446 --> 01:18:14,060
it's creating that balance and I think

1752
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,957
when I audit the market
of what meditation can do,

1753
01:18:16,957 --> 01:18:19,277
it lets people close out the
noise that's bringing them

1754
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:22,135
into negativity, reset,
refresh, whatever it may be.

1755
01:18:22,135 --> 01:18:25,422
But, you're absolutely
right, on the record,

1756
01:18:25,422 --> 01:18:27,623
in the same way that health fitness became

1757
01:18:27,623 --> 01:18:30,444
an incredible industry
over the last 30, 40 years.

1758
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:33,489
I believe that mental fitness, meditation,

1759
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:36,803
is going to be quadrillion
drillion billion trillion

1760
01:18:36,803 --> 01:18:41,045
dollar industry, apps and
studios and the T-shirt

1761
01:18:41,045 --> 01:18:44,378
brand and the headband, and food that is

1762
01:18:45,799 --> 01:18:49,110
enables better meditation,
and every cockamanian thing

1763
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:51,304
that every fucking
entrepreneur comes up with,

1764
01:18:51,304 --> 01:18:53,951
meditation is going to
be one of the massive

1765
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,517
commercial plays, and
then, people that have

1766
01:18:56,517 --> 01:18:58,013
been in it for a long time in the far east

1767
01:18:58,013 --> 01:18:59,770
and India are gonna be super
pissed, 'cause they got

1768
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:01,371
commercialized.

1769
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:03,530
(audience chuckles)

1770
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:07,571
And that's fine, because
more people, I'm excited

1771
01:19:07,571 --> 01:19:09,198
to watch it, because I
think a lot of people are

1772
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:11,660
gonna be helped, because
we're just starting to have

1773
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:15,161
the right conversation with
each other around mental

1774
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:19,004
illness, and for some of
us, like myself and others

1775
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:22,057
who've been around people they
love so much that have it,

1776
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,451
and you didn't know it
for all those years,

1777
01:19:23,451 --> 01:19:25,256
you just thought it was a bad attitude or

1778
01:19:25,256 --> 01:19:29,280
a bad personality, I'm
excited that we're gonna

1779
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,719
start putting this in the
right place in our culture

1780
01:19:31,719 --> 01:19:33,721
over the next 50 years,
and I think a lot of people

1781
01:19:33,721 --> 01:19:35,143
are gonna be helped.

1782
01:19:35,143 --> 01:19:36,750
- [Yaka] Also, because
you've been talking a bit

1783
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:39,842
about Silicon Valley also,
with the problems with

1784
01:19:39,842 --> 01:19:44,274
suicide and so on, in
that sense, it would ...

1785
01:19:44,274 --> 01:19:46,192
- And to be honest with you,
it's more entrepreneurship

1786
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:47,646
than Silicon Valley.

1787
01:19:47,646 --> 01:19:50,280
The biggest fear I have right
now with entrepreneurship

1788
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,906
is it's such a personal loss.

1789
01:19:52,906 --> 01:19:55,025
Guys, there's a very
big difference between

1790
01:19:55,025 --> 01:19:57,285
your business failing and
everybody watching it,

1791
01:19:57,285 --> 01:20:00,254
and you getting fired from a job.

1792
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:03,597
And if you don't have the
makeup to being an entrepreneur

1793
01:20:03,597 --> 01:20:05,919
and dealing with that, and
you were meant to having

1794
01:20:05,919 --> 01:20:08,021
a job, but you're doing
entrepreneurship 'cause

1795
01:20:08,021 --> 01:20:11,019
it's cool right now,
you are gonna struggle.

1796
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:12,443
And I'm scared.

1797
01:20:12,443 --> 01:20:14,411
'Cause I get the emails every day.

1798
01:20:14,411 --> 01:20:16,217
I'm not guessing.

1799
01:20:16,217 --> 01:20:17,558
I'm not predicting.

1800
01:20:17,558 --> 01:20:21,873
I get 15 to 20 emails a
week that allude to suicide,

1801
01:20:21,873 --> 01:20:23,813
that tell me that a video they saw,

1802
01:20:23,813 --> 01:20:27,155
huh, Mons, have you gotten
an email about people,

1803
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:28,989
emailing you and saying they
were gonna commit suicide

1804
01:20:28,989 --> 01:20:30,947
Thursday but they saw a video?

1805
01:20:30,947 --> 01:20:31,780
- [Mons] Quite a lot.

1806
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,613
- That's right.

1807
01:20:32,613 --> 01:20:33,817
Now, whether they're
telling the truth or not,

1808
01:20:33,817 --> 01:20:36,868
even if one in the
thousands of emails that him

1809
01:20:36,868 --> 01:20:40,670
and I have gotten, even if one
of them is telling the truth,

1810
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:43,322
think about what that feels like.

1811
01:20:43,322 --> 01:20:47,320
We have to have
straightforward conversations,

1812
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,510
no fourth place trophies, you
gotta tell people the truth,

1813
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:53,760
because we're playing fake,
and then when real shit

1814
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,177
happens, people are not equipped to deal.

1815
01:20:59,959 --> 01:21:02,959
(audience applauds)

1816
01:21:04,011 --> 01:21:08,178
(makes farting noises with mouth)

1817
01:21:09,635 --> 01:21:11,135
- [Woman] Kirsten!

1818
01:21:12,575 --> 01:21:13,408
Yeah?

1819
01:21:13,408 --> 01:21:15,639
So right here, can we get
a mic runner over here?

1820
01:21:15,639 --> 01:21:16,472
Thank you.

1821
01:21:20,935 --> 01:21:22,409
- [Kirsten] Thank you, and
thank you for allowing me to

1822
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:24,248
add in the question last moment.

1823
01:21:24,248 --> 01:21:26,180
- [Woman] It's a good question.

1824
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,920
- [Kirsten] I'm the head of
sales at an old family company

1825
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,825
here in Denmark, called Flensted Mobiles.

1826
01:21:30,825 --> 01:21:31,881
- One more time?

1827
01:21:31,881 --> 01:21:33,800
- [Kirsten] I'm the head of
sales at a family company

1828
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,552
here in Denmark, for
three generations, we've

1829
01:21:35,552 --> 01:21:38,926
been selling mobiles to the world, art,

1830
01:21:38,926 --> 01:21:39,759
basically.

1831
01:21:39,759 --> 01:21:40,592
- Art?

1832
01:21:40,592 --> 01:21:41,425
- [Kirsten] Yes.

1833
01:21:41,425 --> 01:21:44,899
Not phones, but pieces of
art hanging from the ceiling.

1834
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:45,732
- Amazing.

1835
01:21:45,732 --> 01:21:48,392
- [Kirsten] And for many
years, our sole customers

1836
01:21:48,392 --> 01:21:50,234
have been brick and mortar shops.

1837
01:21:50,234 --> 01:21:51,067
- (chuckles)

1838
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:52,012
- [Kirsten] Yes.

1839
01:21:52,012 --> 01:21:54,217
See where I'm going
with this, because now,

1840
01:21:54,217 --> 01:21:55,477
we have more and more customers who either

1841
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:58,285
set up their own online
shop, or even start

1842
01:21:58,285 --> 01:22:00,568
dealing by Amazon.

1843
01:22:00,568 --> 01:22:02,496
So now, my wholesellers are calling me up

1844
01:22:02,496 --> 01:22:04,665
saying, that guy is
selling into my market,

1845
01:22:04,665 --> 01:22:06,076
you gotta stop him.

1846
01:22:06,076 --> 01:22:08,078
This one is dumping the prices.

1847
01:22:08,078 --> 01:22:08,911
Stop them.

1848
01:22:10,003 --> 01:22:12,463
And legally, I can't,
and I'm not even sure

1849
01:22:12,463 --> 01:22:13,992
I want to.

1850
01:22:13,992 --> 01:22:16,647
But I want to ensure the
coexistence of the two.

1851
01:22:16,647 --> 01:22:18,309
The online shop, and the
brick and mortar shop.

1852
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:19,654
- It won't happen.

1853
01:22:19,654 --> 01:22:22,915
You don't have enough
leverage to make them coexist.

1854
01:22:22,915 --> 01:22:24,513
- [Kirsten] Yeah?

1855
01:22:24,513 --> 01:22:27,646
I was hoping you might, you
know, provide me one tip

1856
01:22:27,646 --> 01:22:31,399
in a way I could support
my old and faithful

1857
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:34,434
customers, some of them
don't even have email.

1858
01:22:34,434 --> 01:22:36,110
- By telling them to get fucking email.

1859
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:38,822
(audience laughs)

1860
01:22:38,822 --> 01:22:40,307
I'm trying to help you.

1861
01:22:40,307 --> 01:22:41,694
- [Kirsten] Yeah, I know.

1862
01:22:41,694 --> 01:22:46,168
- 'Cause if you hold on
even 1%, you're gonna lose.

1863
01:22:46,168 --> 01:22:49,085
And I can see you have good intent.

1864
01:22:49,085 --> 01:22:50,083
Tell old man John

1865
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,034
- To get a fucking email.
- Well, to be honest, we want

1866
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:52,712
- [Kirsten] To support our old customers,

1867
01:22:52,712 --> 01:22:56,357
and we don't even have our
own online shop, because

1868
01:22:56,357 --> 01:23:00,031
this old family company
didn't want to compete

1869
01:23:00,031 --> 01:23:01,052
with our own customers.

1870
01:23:01,052 --> 01:23:02,682
- I understand.

1871
01:23:02,682 --> 01:23:03,943
- [Kirsten] But I guess I'm realizing

1872
01:23:03,943 --> 01:23:05,352
that we need to ...

1873
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:06,350
(laughs)

1874
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:09,348
- There's a very good reason
third generation companies

1875
01:23:09,348 --> 01:23:11,304
go out of business.

1876
01:23:11,304 --> 01:23:13,900
They hold the past on a higher pedestal

1877
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,317
than the current.

1878
01:23:17,395 --> 01:23:21,242
You got the answers,
listen, I'm empathetic.

1879
01:23:21,242 --> 01:23:24,174
You cut into a third, you
not being a family member,

1880
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:27,329
in a third generation family
business, that has had

1881
01:23:27,329 --> 01:23:29,829
success for 100 fucking years,

1882
01:23:32,001 --> 01:23:34,609
the problem is, tough shit.

1883
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,280
- [Kristin] (chuckles softly)

1884
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,175
I'll tell them.

1885
01:23:37,175 --> 01:23:38,153
- You got it.

1886
01:23:38,153 --> 01:23:40,802
(audience laughs and applauds)

1887
01:23:40,802 --> 01:23:41,635
You know?

1888
01:23:42,554 --> 01:23:45,011
The quicker, you know what you can do?

1889
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:47,725
Something you can do is create a workshop

1890
01:23:47,725 --> 01:23:52,360
for all your old-school
customers, and bring in speakers

1891
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,066
that are talking, you're
gonna have to educate them,

1892
01:23:55,066 --> 01:23:57,887
that's you doing the
noble thing to help them,

1893
01:23:57,887 --> 01:23:59,904
but you can only do so much.

1894
01:23:59,904 --> 01:24:01,658
But you're gonna have to
educate them, and you're gonna

1895
01:24:01,658 --> 01:24:03,866
have to start sending
signals that you're not

1896
01:24:03,866 --> 01:24:06,164
gonna protect them.

1897
01:24:06,164 --> 01:24:08,677
'Cause they're playing
defense and think you will,

1898
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:12,974
and the quicker you don't
play fourth place trophies,

1899
01:24:12,974 --> 01:24:15,541
we have to trade on merit.

1900
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:17,213
It's too bad.

1901
01:24:17,213 --> 01:24:20,257
But I wanna remind you,
that those shop owners,

1902
01:24:20,257 --> 01:24:22,884
who are about to go out of
business, they put somebody else

1903
01:24:22,884 --> 01:24:24,217
out of business.

1904
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:30,559
Why are we protecting the
current establishment?

1905
01:24:30,559 --> 01:24:33,942
They put the people that
used to sell art outside,

1906
01:24:33,942 --> 01:24:35,275
out of business.

1907
01:24:37,334 --> 01:24:38,392
Right?

1908
01:24:38,392 --> 01:24:42,738
Like, anybody who's winning
now, means they took it

1909
01:24:42,738 --> 01:24:44,321
from somebody else.

1910
01:24:45,926 --> 01:24:48,499
People like, we've gotta
protect supermarkets.

1911
01:24:48,499 --> 01:24:49,602
Why?

1912
01:24:49,602 --> 01:24:52,540
Why do you think they're
called "super" markets?

1913
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,996
'Cause there used to be markets.

1914
01:24:54,996 --> 01:24:57,503
And then they came along
and made them super,

1915
01:24:57,503 --> 01:24:59,272
and put the other fuckers out of business.

1916
01:24:59,272 --> 01:25:02,105
(audience laughs)

1917
01:25:02,999 --> 01:25:03,973
Right?

1918
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:06,096
And one day, somebody's
gonna say, we've gotta keep

1919
01:25:06,096 --> 01:25:07,179
Amazon alive.

1920
01:25:09,348 --> 01:25:11,519
That will happen.

1921
01:25:11,519 --> 01:25:13,274
And to that person,
'cause I'll put it on film

1922
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,361
right now, fuck Amazon.

1923
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:19,023
They had their time, and now
it's time for Schmamazon.

1924
01:25:19,023 --> 01:25:21,856
(audience laughs)

1925
01:25:24,002 --> 01:25:24,988
That's it.

1926
01:25:24,988 --> 01:25:27,400
(audience applauds)

1927
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,233
That's it.

1928
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:34,042
- [Woman] Now, isn't it amazing
that you came to Elevate?

1929
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:36,504
Maybe we will save a 100 year old company,

1930
01:25:36,504 --> 01:25:38,743
just because you came here today.

1931
01:25:38,743 --> 01:25:41,645
Now, to another question that your answer

1932
01:25:41,645 --> 01:25:46,212
might help, that he can
become a 100 year old company.

1933
01:25:46,212 --> 01:25:47,267
Thomas Sinding?

1934
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,434
Where are you?

1935
01:25:49,396 --> 01:25:50,229
- [Thomas] Yeah.

1936
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,062
- [Woman] Yeah!

1937
01:25:51,062 --> 01:25:53,604
Microphone, over here?

1938
01:25:53,604 --> 01:25:54,871
Thank you.

1939
01:25:54,871 --> 01:25:56,715
They're really snappy, aren't they?

1940
01:25:56,715 --> 01:25:57,548
Yeah.

1941
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,222
- [Thomas] First of all,
I run a small company,

1942
01:26:04,222 --> 01:26:07,722
two persons, we do a lot content creating.

1943
01:26:09,108 --> 01:26:13,118
I've been, for the past year,
working with a Danish athlete,

1944
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:14,829
creating his content.

1945
01:26:14,829 --> 01:26:17,349
He's a race car driver,
driving LeMons and stuff

1946
01:26:17,349 --> 01:26:18,334
like that.

1947
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:21,803
We're doing it for free for
him, for a whole year now,

1948
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:24,366
and it's about time that stuff happen.

1949
01:26:24,366 --> 01:26:25,305
- Yep.

1950
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:26,850
- [Thomas] What is your ...

1951
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:28,386
- Ask him for money.

1952
01:26:28,386 --> 01:26:32,387
- [Thomas] Yeah, and I know
that, but my thought is

1953
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,986
should I be very honest
with him and ask him,

1954
01:26:34,986 --> 01:26:36,285
how much do you earn?

1955
01:26:36,285 --> 01:26:39,313
I'm thinking about, can I get five or 10%

1956
01:26:39,313 --> 01:26:40,439
of what you earn ...

1957
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:41,944
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

1958
01:26:41,944 --> 01:26:42,845
- [Thomas] What?

1959
01:26:42,845 --> 01:26:44,850
- You're not gonna get five
to 10% of what he earns!

1960
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:45,702
- [Thomas] I don't know!

1961
01:26:45,702 --> 01:26:47,543
- No shit you don't know!
- That's why I'm asking you!

1962
01:26:47,543 --> 01:26:49,460
- So, let's start over.

1963
01:26:50,652 --> 01:26:52,402
How much do you want?

1964
01:26:54,986 --> 01:26:56,332
- [Thomas] I want to make a living?

1965
01:26:56,332 --> 01:26:58,437
- With respect, off of one fucking guy?

1966
01:26:58,437 --> 01:27:01,669
- [Thomas] No, because
actually, I work full time,

1967
01:27:01,669 --> 01:27:04,527
or more than full time, at my day job.

1968
01:27:04,527 --> 01:27:05,360
- Understood.

1969
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,817
- [Thomas] And I work like,
30, 35 hours in my own company.

1970
01:27:08,817 --> 01:27:11,550
Like, almost no sleep,
and stuff like that.

1971
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:13,056
- Do you have any sense
of what other people are

1972
01:27:13,056 --> 01:27:15,954
charging personal brands for content?

1973
01:27:15,954 --> 01:27:16,787
- [Thomas] Nope.

1974
01:27:16,787 --> 01:27:18,894
- How much output are you giving him?

1975
01:27:18,894 --> 01:27:22,190
- [Thomas] I'm giving him
almost all of his output ...

1976
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,454
- What is it?

1977
01:27:23,454 --> 01:27:25,818
- [Thomas] We've done
ten episodes on Youtube,

1978
01:27:25,818 --> 01:27:29,522
with like, ten minutes of content ...

1979
01:27:29,522 --> 01:27:30,355
- Good stuff.

1980
01:27:30,355 --> 01:27:31,741
- [Thomas] I think it's good quality.

1981
01:27:31,741 --> 01:27:33,075
- Let's assume it is.

1982
01:27:33,075 --> 01:27:34,729
How about Instagram?

1983
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:35,995
- [Thomas] All of his posts, almost.

1984
01:27:35,995 --> 01:27:36,982
- How many?

1985
01:27:36,982 --> 01:27:38,892
- [Thomas] Like, five a week.

1986
01:27:38,892 --> 01:27:40,370
- Five a week, okay.

1987
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:41,795
And what else?

1988
01:27:41,795 --> 01:27:42,895
- [Thomas] Facebook.

1989
01:27:42,895 --> 01:27:45,544
The real old school
PR, like press releases

1990
01:27:45,544 --> 01:27:47,160
and stuff like that.

1991
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,465
- Why are you doing that?

1992
01:27:48,465 --> 01:27:49,528
(audience chuckles)

1993
01:27:49,528 --> 01:27:52,303
- [Thomas] Because some
of his, in Denmark,

1994
01:27:52,303 --> 01:27:54,187
we still read the papers
and stuff like that.

1995
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:55,020
- No, I understand.

1996
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:55,978
(audience laughs)

1997
01:27:55,978 --> 01:27:57,724
Everyone still reads the papers.

1998
01:27:57,724 --> 01:27:59,728
- [Thomas] Yeah, but, the
paper's also online now,

1999
01:27:59,728 --> 01:28:00,968
so, it's ...

2000
01:28:00,968 --> 01:28:02,313
- But when you say press
release, you're writing

2001
01:28:02,313 --> 01:28:03,910
a press release, or
you're updating his fans

2002
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:07,401
on what he's doing, in
written form, on Facebook?

2003
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:08,234
- [Thomas] Both.

2004
01:28:08,234 --> 01:28:09,403
- Okay.

2005
01:28:09,403 --> 01:28:10,236
What else?

2006
01:28:11,488 --> 01:28:13,406
- [Thomas] Like, I don't know ...

2007
01:28:13,406 --> 01:28:15,659
- Do you engage, do you
guys reply on his behalf

2008
01:28:15,659 --> 01:28:16,576
on Twitter?

2009
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,414
- [Thomas] Yeah, not on
Twitter, but on Facebook

2010
01:28:19,414 --> 01:28:20,805
and Instagram, yes.

2011
01:28:20,805 --> 01:28:21,638
- Okay.

2012
01:28:21,638 --> 01:28:22,596
- [Thomas] And emails.

2013
01:28:22,596 --> 01:28:24,531
- And how many hours are
you guys putting in a month?

2014
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:25,834
- [Thomas] I don't know.

2015
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:28,186
Maybe 30, 40 hours?

2016
01:28:28,186 --> 01:28:32,156
- And you and your partner, or just you?

2017
01:28:32,156 --> 01:28:33,053
Overall hours.

2018
01:28:33,053 --> 01:28:34,747
- [Thomas] Overall hours.

2019
01:28:34,747 --> 01:28:38,057
Like, 40, or something like that.

2020
01:28:38,057 --> 01:28:40,307
- So, you know, I think ...

2021
01:28:42,854 --> 01:28:46,816
You know, $1,500 to $5,000
a month is what you need

2022
01:28:46,816 --> 01:28:48,025
to be thinking about.

2023
01:28:48,025 --> 01:28:50,194
- [Thomas] And then one
more thing, you talked about

2024
01:28:50,194 --> 01:28:52,277
the DM guys on Instagram.

2025
01:28:53,405 --> 01:28:57,074
Actually did that yesterday,
but it didn't work out.

2026
01:28:57,074 --> 01:28:58,455
- How many times did you do it?

2027
01:28:58,455 --> 01:29:00,078
- [Thomas] Just once, and the guy's name

2028
01:29:00,078 --> 01:29:01,232
was Gary V.

2029
01:29:01,232 --> 01:29:02,372
- Yeah.

2030
01:29:02,372 --> 01:29:04,291
Gary V got 4,000 DMs yesterday.

2031
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,124
- [Thomas] I know.

2032
01:29:05,124 --> 01:29:06,120
- I know, I'm kidding.
- Just to tell you.

2033
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,286
- But, I'm glad you brought
it up, 'cause I want

2034
01:29:08,286 --> 01:29:09,224
people to hear this,
'cause we brought it up

2035
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:10,090
earlier.

2036
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:10,923
- [Thomas] Yeah.

2037
01:29:10,923 --> 01:29:13,361
- You just gotta keep, D
Rock emailed me four times

2038
01:29:13,361 --> 01:29:16,220
to offer me to make a free video.

2039
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,803
Imagine if he stopped at three.

2040
01:29:20,932 --> 01:29:22,726
That's the answer to that question.

2041
01:29:22,726 --> 01:29:23,559
- [Thomas] Thank you.

2042
01:29:23,559 --> 01:29:24,400
- You're welcome.

2043
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,400
(audience applauds)

2044
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:36,741
- [Woman] Now we need to
hear from the Hungry E,

2045
01:29:36,741 --> 01:29:40,176
it's just signed E, who
wants to get hungry again?

2046
01:29:40,176 --> 01:29:41,748
Is that you?

2047
01:29:41,748 --> 01:29:42,664
- My God.
- I didn't picture you as

2048
01:29:42,664 --> 01:29:43,768
- The Hungry E, bro!

2049
01:29:43,768 --> 01:29:45,455
- [Woman] No!

2050
01:29:45,455 --> 01:29:47,543
- Can we get a mic runner?
- Mic?

2051
01:29:47,543 --> 01:29:48,529
- [Woman] Can we get a mic runner?

2052
01:29:48,529 --> 01:29:49,362
Thank you!

2053
01:29:51,672 --> 01:29:52,755
Take it away.

2054
01:29:54,341 --> 01:29:55,591
- How are you?

2055
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:56,424
- [Irvin] Thanks, hi.

2056
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:57,259
I'm Irvin.

2057
01:29:57,259 --> 01:29:58,313
- Pleasure.

2058
01:29:58,313 --> 01:30:00,557
- [Irvin] So, I came to
Denmark five years ago

2059
01:30:00,557 --> 01:30:04,525
with almost nothing, and
I got to work really hard.

2060
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:07,393
I got to work really hard, just night jobs

2061
01:30:07,393 --> 01:30:08,655
and so on.

2062
01:30:08,655 --> 01:30:12,465
Then I start volunteering
a lot, and kind of after

2063
01:30:12,465 --> 01:30:16,632
five years, I made it, so
to say, in my own terms,

2064
01:30:17,967 --> 01:30:22,031
and now I find myself not working anymore,

2065
01:30:22,031 --> 01:30:26,361
from two to seven to night,
and I'm a bit concerned,

2066
01:30:26,361 --> 01:30:28,273
that, is this it?

2067
01:30:28,273 --> 01:30:30,690
How can I push to go forward?

2068
01:30:31,901 --> 01:30:34,607
- Are you worried that you're
content and you're trying

2069
01:30:34,607 --> 01:30:36,077
to get the spark?

2070
01:30:36,077 --> 01:30:37,017
- Yes.

2071
01:30:37,017 --> 01:30:39,552
- Maybe you need to do something else.

2072
01:30:39,552 --> 01:30:42,613
Maybe you're content in what got you here.

2073
01:30:42,613 --> 01:30:43,446
- Yes.

2074
01:30:43,446 --> 01:30:44,528
- Why am I great?

2075
01:30:44,528 --> 01:30:48,971
I built one of the largest
liquor wine stores in America.

2076
01:30:48,971 --> 01:30:50,225
And I did it.

2077
01:30:50,225 --> 01:30:53,706
And I was like, wait a minute,
the liquor laws are bad.

2078
01:30:53,706 --> 01:30:56,820
This doesn't feel like it's it.

2079
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,322
I made it.

2080
01:30:58,322 --> 01:30:59,155
You know.

2081
01:31:00,089 --> 01:31:02,866
I did, I started a Youtube show.

2082
01:31:02,866 --> 01:31:06,366
Maybe you made it, thank God, in what you,

2083
01:31:07,748 --> 01:31:09,195
I don't know what you do.

2084
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:11,397
Maybe you need to do
something completely different

2085
01:31:11,397 --> 01:31:14,121
and have the thrill that
I always have, which is

2086
01:31:14,121 --> 01:31:17,621
the climb is much more fun than the stuff.

2087
01:31:18,928 --> 01:31:21,144
It's what, it's that
great guy in the back,

2088
01:31:21,144 --> 01:31:22,413
the good-looking guy with the beard.

2089
01:31:22,413 --> 01:31:26,017
I want him to love the
process, not the idea of

2090
01:31:26,017 --> 01:31:27,623
the Mexico beach.

2091
01:31:27,623 --> 01:31:30,563
Maybe you're like me and you
love the process so much,

2092
01:31:30,563 --> 01:31:33,415
that now that the process
is not fun, even though

2093
01:31:33,415 --> 01:31:35,744
the money's there, even though
the opportunity's there,

2094
01:31:35,744 --> 01:31:37,952
you're missing the spark, the climb.

2095
01:31:37,952 --> 01:31:40,175
You know why I love
coming to southeast Asia

2096
01:31:40,175 --> 01:31:42,841
or Nordic, I wish none
of you knew who I was.

2097
01:31:42,841 --> 01:31:44,599
That's the climb.

2098
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:45,577
People think it's the
other way, I don't want

2099
01:31:45,577 --> 01:31:47,579
anybody to know who I am.

2100
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:49,372
That's actually probably my
biggest fear, is the game

2101
01:31:49,372 --> 01:31:52,626
of getting known, you
know, I plan on getting

2102
01:31:52,626 --> 01:31:55,504
to all 7.3 billion of you.

2103
01:31:55,504 --> 01:31:56,707
And then when that's
done, it's gonna be like,

2104
01:31:56,707 --> 01:31:59,367
fuck, do I have to go to
Mars, or, you know, like,

2105
01:31:59,367 --> 01:32:01,926
so, I think that I have a
feeling it might just be

2106
01:32:01,926 --> 01:32:05,723
that you're looking for a
new process and a new start

2107
01:32:05,723 --> 01:32:08,224
from the bottom to build up.

2108
01:32:08,224 --> 01:32:10,394
- How can I know what to choose next?

2109
01:32:10,394 --> 01:32:11,913
- Just pick something.

2110
01:32:11,913 --> 01:32:13,386
(audience chuckles)

2111
01:32:13,386 --> 01:32:14,980
It's a really interesting question.

2112
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:17,693
I really believe that,
like, I don't know you,

2113
01:32:17,693 --> 01:32:20,351
right, but there's things
that are on your mind.

2114
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:24,221
I would start with
interests outside of work.

2115
01:32:24,221 --> 01:32:25,928
Like, if I would start something, like

2116
01:32:25,928 --> 01:32:28,562
if you're into video
games, I think esports is

2117
01:32:28,562 --> 01:32:30,120
about to be one of the
biggest industries in

2118
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,958
our society over the next 30 years.

2119
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:33,333
Maybe you don't know anything
about esports, but you like

2120
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:35,503
video games, here's
the chance to start ...

2121
01:32:35,503 --> 01:32:36,929
- [Irvin] I was looking into it, actually.

2122
01:32:36,929 --> 01:32:40,856
- Yeah, so now, from seven
p.m. to two in the morning,

2123
01:32:40,856 --> 01:32:43,099
for the next four months,
you learn everything about

2124
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:45,913
esports, and then you
decide what you wanna make.

2125
01:32:45,913 --> 01:32:48,367
I think you want the
process, which is incredible,

2126
01:32:48,367 --> 01:32:50,409
because it's gonna lead
to a lot of success,

2127
01:32:50,409 --> 01:32:52,382
which is why you've probably figured out

2128
01:32:52,382 --> 01:32:54,438
how to win in five years, because you love

2129
01:32:54,438 --> 01:32:56,733
the process, so you
were willing to eat shit

2130
01:32:56,733 --> 01:32:58,983
and work at night, and be
patient, and that's why

2131
01:32:58,983 --> 01:33:01,333
you got somewhere, now you
got somewhere and you're like,

2132
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:04,614
wait a minute, fuck, you're
calibrating, you're young,

2133
01:33:04,614 --> 01:33:07,159
you need to go out and
do other new processes.

2134
01:33:07,159 --> 01:33:08,743
If you've got complete flexibility,

2135
01:33:08,743 --> 01:33:10,507
I would do it around
other things you like.

2136
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:13,616
Music, sports, beer, like, I
don't know what your interests

2137
01:33:13,616 --> 01:33:16,682
are outside of it, but you
start there, because that's,

2138
01:33:16,682 --> 01:33:19,254
I mean, Vayner sports,
me and AJ are building

2139
01:33:19,254 --> 01:33:20,839
this sports agency.

2140
01:33:20,839 --> 01:33:23,333
It's a real fun thing, like,
we're gonna kill everybody

2141
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:25,301
and it's gonna be a huge
company, and it's fun

2142
01:33:25,301 --> 01:33:27,581
to talk about football,
like, we know about trades

2143
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:29,581
before they come out in public, you know.

2144
01:33:29,581 --> 01:33:30,559
We like it.

2145
01:33:30,559 --> 01:33:33,269
So, I think if you can do it
around something you like,

2146
01:33:33,269 --> 01:33:36,668
I would go and look in the,
discover the business behind

2147
01:33:36,668 --> 01:33:40,483
the things that you're interested in.

2148
01:33:40,483 --> 01:33:41,316
- [Irvin] Thanks a lot.

2149
01:33:41,316 --> 01:33:42,631
- You're welcome.

2150
01:33:42,631 --> 01:33:45,631
(audience applauds)

2151
01:33:49,795 --> 01:33:51,516
- [Woman] Yes?

2152
01:33:51,516 --> 01:33:52,349
Mason?

2153
01:33:53,206 --> 01:33:56,220
Hm, can we get a mic runner, thank you.

2154
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,097
- Mason, Mason, Mason.

2155
01:33:58,097 --> 01:33:59,322
- [Mason] Hello, how are you, Gary?

2156
01:33:59,322 --> 01:34:00,338
- I'm really well, you?

2157
01:34:00,338 --> 01:34:01,453
- [Mason] I never thought
I'd be nervous talking

2158
01:34:01,453 --> 01:34:02,960
to a guy, but ...

2159
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,803
(audience laughs)

2160
01:34:05,803 --> 01:34:07,570
- That's super flattering.

2161
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,771
- [Mason] I just wanna
thank you for two things.

2162
01:34:09,771 --> 01:34:11,456
One of the things, you changed my life.

2163
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,918
And the two years ago, one
year, one and a half year ago,

2164
01:34:13,918 --> 01:34:15,883
I was just sitting at home, doing videos,

2165
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:18,142
professional videos,
and I thought that that

2166
01:34:18,142 --> 01:34:20,021
was gonna change my life.

2167
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:22,025
I'm an artist, first
of all, I learned to be

2168
01:34:22,025 --> 01:34:24,264
a media company first.

2169
01:34:24,264 --> 01:34:26,444
That you talked about,
and I had so many videos,

2170
01:34:26,444 --> 01:34:28,199
like professional videos,
and had a team making

2171
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:30,869
those videos, and didn't do shit for me.

2172
01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:32,826
So I just started seeing
you, listened to what

2173
01:34:32,826 --> 01:34:34,523
you had to say, and was
like, fuck it, I just

2174
01:34:34,523 --> 01:34:37,793
used my phone, started
doing, just started filming,

2175
01:34:37,793 --> 01:34:40,337
you know, and just like,
with the first video

2176
01:34:40,337 --> 01:34:44,262
after I saw you, just got
me like, 700,000 views.

2177
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:45,095
- Jesus fucking Christ.

2178
01:34:45,095 --> 01:34:47,172
- [Mason] The first video,
like four days after

2179
01:34:47,172 --> 01:34:48,005
I saw you.

2180
01:34:49,211 --> 01:34:52,050
For four days after, I
just made another video.

2181
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:54,328
The same amount of views I
got, it changed my whole ...

2182
01:34:54,328 --> 01:34:55,851
- On what platform?

2183
01:34:55,851 --> 01:34:57,045
- [Mason] On Facebook.

2184
01:34:57,045 --> 01:34:58,353
- Go figure.
- On Facebook.

2185
01:34:58,353 --> 01:35:01,899
- [Mason] So it changed like,
my everything, and I'm just

2186
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:03,739
listening to you every day.

2187
01:35:03,739 --> 01:35:07,948
I don't know what to, sorry,
I never, I'm a speaker,

2188
01:35:07,948 --> 01:35:09,030
I don't know.

2189
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:11,157
(audience chuckles)

2190
01:35:11,157 --> 01:35:13,535
Yeah, so what I'm trying
to say is, first of all,

2191
01:35:13,535 --> 01:35:15,820
I know you like, your
story with immigrants,

2192
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:17,654
I'm a refugee, I came
to Denmark, so I know

2193
01:35:17,654 --> 01:35:19,653
the hustle, I came with
nothing, I think Denmark

2194
01:35:19,653 --> 01:35:21,164
is the greatest country of all time,

2195
01:35:21,164 --> 01:35:22,460
it's just like the
opportunity we have here

2196
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:23,846
is just like amazing.

2197
01:35:23,846 --> 01:35:25,672
I'm living the American dream in Denmark.

2198
01:35:25,672 --> 01:35:29,589
(audience applauds and cheers)

2199
01:35:30,881 --> 01:35:34,015
So, when I started doing
those videos on Facebook,

2200
01:35:34,015 --> 01:35:37,289
it just changed everything,
then it just started

2201
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:39,363
giving me opportunities,
and I've just started

2202
01:35:39,363 --> 01:35:41,980
to realize that actually,
I'm doing a living,

2203
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:44,895
I'm living just by
branding, personal branding,

2204
01:35:44,895 --> 01:35:46,854
on Danish and social media.

2205
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:50,528
And just gave me jobs after
jobs after, I don't even know

2206
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,361
what my title is.

2207
01:35:51,361 --> 01:35:53,146
People ask me what I do,
I don't actually know

2208
01:35:53,146 --> 01:35:55,474
what to say because I'm
just, I'm living my dream,

2209
01:35:55,474 --> 01:35:58,011
I don't know why, just
because I have this attention

2210
01:35:58,011 --> 01:36:00,665
on Facebook, just give me so many options,

2211
01:36:00,665 --> 01:36:01,859
so many opportunities.

2212
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:04,307
I'm crippled by opportunities,
just like you say.

2213
01:36:04,307 --> 01:36:05,140
You know?

2214
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:07,364
So, that's amazing, so thank you for that,

2215
01:36:07,364 --> 01:36:09,614
I know you live like
you're running a marathon,

2216
01:36:09,614 --> 01:36:11,705
and it's your legacy, and I respect that,

2217
01:36:11,705 --> 01:36:13,137
I love you for that.

2218
01:36:13,137 --> 01:36:16,137
So first of all, thank you for that.

2219
01:36:17,035 --> 01:36:17,868
Thank you.

2220
01:36:17,868 --> 01:36:19,209
(chuckles)

2221
01:36:19,209 --> 01:36:21,144
(audience applauds)

2222
01:36:21,144 --> 01:36:24,283
The second thing is just
like, just to let you know

2223
01:36:24,283 --> 01:36:26,277
how much of an impact you have on me,

2224
01:36:26,277 --> 01:36:29,028
because like, when everything
starts to get crazy,

2225
01:36:29,028 --> 01:36:31,785
like, I have this year,
like one year after

2226
01:36:31,785 --> 01:36:34,885
I started doing those
video, I have some stage

2227
01:36:34,885 --> 01:36:37,417
called (foreign language) here in Denmark,

2228
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:38,648
it's just like a huge stage.

2229
01:36:38,648 --> 01:36:40,613
I have it, like, in
this month, it's almost

2230
01:36:40,613 --> 01:36:44,961
sold out, 600 seats, just
because I'm using your tactics

2231
01:36:44,961 --> 01:36:46,776
on Facebook, it's crazy.

2232
01:36:46,776 --> 01:36:49,025
Thank you for that.

2233
01:36:49,025 --> 01:36:51,674
(audience applauds)

2234
01:36:51,674 --> 01:36:53,552
So, the number two thing
I wanna thank you for

2235
01:36:53,552 --> 01:36:55,261
is just like, because,
just to let you know

2236
01:36:55,261 --> 01:36:58,011
how much of an impact you are ...

2237
01:36:58,867 --> 01:37:02,518
I have like, this dream,
I wanna buy this car,

2238
01:37:02,518 --> 01:37:06,685
Mercedes, yeah, it's my
dream car, I test drove it,

2239
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:10,394
because now fortunately, I can afford it.

2240
01:37:10,394 --> 01:37:14,060
I test drove it for half an
hour, and all I was hearing

2241
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,573
in those half an hour was your voice,

2242
01:37:15,573 --> 01:37:17,722
what the fuck are you doing, asshole?

2243
01:37:17,722 --> 01:37:18,680
(laughter)

2244
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,839
So I was just like, I
couldn't do it, so I was still

2245
01:37:20,839 --> 01:37:22,756
driving around a shitty ass
car, because I'm pursuing

2246
01:37:22,756 --> 01:37:23,589
my dream.

2247
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:25,413
- My man.

2248
01:37:26,461 --> 01:37:29,289
When you have that mindset,
you become more likely

2249
01:37:29,289 --> 01:37:32,569
to buy Mercedes the company
than that bullshit car.

2250
01:37:32,569 --> 01:37:34,843
(audience laughs and applauds)

2251
01:37:34,843 --> 01:37:36,510
- [Mason] Thank you.

2252
01:37:39,531 --> 01:37:41,699
So my question is, now I look just like,

2253
01:37:41,699 --> 01:37:43,936
I'm still new, I'm still a
baby in this like, I'm still

2254
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:47,356
so new, but I speak
English and I speak Arabic.

2255
01:37:47,356 --> 01:37:48,399
- Love it.

2256
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:49,503
- [Mason] So I started like ...

2257
01:37:49,503 --> 01:37:51,086
- You have a huge upside.

2258
01:37:51,086 --> 01:37:51,919
- [Mason] Yes.

2259
01:37:51,919 --> 01:37:55,614
And I realized that, so I
made a video on Facebook

2260
01:37:55,614 --> 01:37:58,740
in Arabic, and it got
40,000 views, I was like,

2261
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,250
holy shit, what's happening?

2262
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:03,844
And I love Denmark, but we
are only five million here.

2263
01:38:03,844 --> 01:38:06,875
And I know, if I put the
energy that I'm doing right now

2264
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:10,104
in Danish, because
that's not a big market,

2265
01:38:10,104 --> 01:38:14,173
and I have this dream of
being the, you know ...

2266
01:38:14,173 --> 01:38:15,885
- So let me tell you something real quick.

2267
01:38:15,885 --> 01:38:17,402
Unless you've seen this,
this is something I'm about

2268
01:38:17,402 --> 01:38:18,676
to double down on.

2269
01:38:18,676 --> 01:38:22,305
I speak English, I fully
understand Russian,

2270
01:38:22,305 --> 01:38:24,545
but I'm out of practice, so
speaking it, so I'm basically

2271
01:38:24,545 --> 01:38:27,125
one language, I understand two.

2272
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:31,326
But we're transcribing all my
videos into every language.

2273
01:38:31,326 --> 01:38:34,153
So you could do them, in
three different languages,

2274
01:38:34,153 --> 01:38:35,623
but be smart.

2275
01:38:35,623 --> 01:38:37,615
With the technology that we have now,

2276
01:38:37,615 --> 01:38:39,383
and as you keep building up
fame, if you make a video

2277
01:38:39,383 --> 01:38:42,776
right now saying, I'm looking
for interns to translate

2278
01:38:42,776 --> 01:38:47,323
my content from English
to all languages, like,

2279
01:38:47,323 --> 01:38:49,550
whether it's English or Mandarin or Arabic

2280
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:51,386
or whatever you decide to
be the pillar to your point,

2281
01:38:51,386 --> 01:38:54,588
Danish is smaller, you're
better off translating it

2282
01:38:54,588 --> 01:38:58,608
into Danish, in written
word, but the answer

2283
01:38:58,608 --> 01:39:01,131
to your question is,
don't overthink this one.

2284
01:39:01,131 --> 01:39:03,349
I was like, just pick one.

2285
01:39:03,349 --> 01:39:04,197
I'm gonna save you time.

2286
01:39:04,197 --> 01:39:07,301
No more wasting time on
things that don't matter.

2287
01:39:07,301 --> 01:39:09,479
99% of things don't matter.

2288
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:10,911
Technology is here.

2289
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:13,360
You will be able to translate
every one of your videos

2290
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,483
into any language you want, and over index

2291
01:39:15,483 --> 01:39:18,864
in Portuguese in Brazil,
and Mandarin in China,

2292
01:39:18,864 --> 01:39:21,574
so don't over-debate
which language you want,

2293
01:39:21,574 --> 01:39:23,336
I would keep, if I were
you, I would be making

2294
01:39:23,336 --> 01:39:26,604
all three, in Arabic, Danish, and English,

2295
01:39:26,604 --> 01:39:28,528
just to keep testing,
seeing, see what happens,

2296
01:39:28,528 --> 01:39:30,085
you learn.

2297
01:39:30,085 --> 01:39:30,918
Right?

2298
01:39:30,918 --> 01:39:34,546
Don't worry about 40,000
views versus 150,000 views,

2299
01:39:34,546 --> 01:39:36,764
'cause you're learning, it's
not about that one thing,

2300
01:39:36,764 --> 01:39:39,352
it's about buying Mercedes,
not driving the Mercedes,

2301
01:39:39,352 --> 01:39:40,292
got it?

2302
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:42,883
So, that's what I would do.

2303
01:39:42,883 --> 01:39:44,551
- [Irvin] Thank you so much.

2304
01:39:44,551 --> 01:39:45,527
- You're welcome.

2305
01:39:45,527 --> 01:39:48,527
(audience applauds)

2306
01:39:51,973 --> 01:39:54,878
I wish for all of you,
the feeling that that kind

2307
01:39:54,878 --> 01:39:57,459
of exchange feels like.

2308
01:39:57,459 --> 01:39:59,709
I wish for all of you that.

2309
01:40:01,457 --> 01:40:03,502
- [Woman] Alright.

2310
01:40:03,502 --> 01:40:04,419
Now, Kevin.

2311
01:40:05,778 --> 01:40:09,111
Yeah, can we get a mic runner over here?

2312
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:11,124
Over here.

2313
01:40:13,654 --> 01:40:17,946
You can do some stretching
while you wait, Gary.

2314
01:40:17,946 --> 01:40:19,649
- I don't stretch.

2315
01:40:19,649 --> 01:40:20,634
Just kidding, I'm kidding.

2316
01:40:20,634 --> 01:40:21,815
- [Woman] (laughing) Meditating.

2317
01:40:21,815 --> 01:40:22,648
- Exactly.

2318
01:40:23,522 --> 01:40:24,402
- Hey.
- Hello, Gary.

2319
01:40:24,402 --> 01:40:25,235
- How are you?

2320
01:40:25,235 --> 01:40:26,068
- [Kevin] I'm fine, you?

2321
01:40:26,068 --> 01:40:26,934
- Amazing.

2322
01:40:26,934 --> 01:40:28,495
- [Kevin] Perfect.

2323
01:40:28,495 --> 01:40:31,395
Like, if we go back some
years, cookie-based tracking

2324
01:40:31,395 --> 01:40:33,328
were like, really the shit.

2325
01:40:33,328 --> 01:40:34,231
- What was?

2326
01:40:34,231 --> 01:40:36,779
- [Kevin] Cookie-based
tracking, online marketing.

2327
01:40:36,779 --> 01:40:41,044
But now, we are more into
the people-based tracking.

2328
01:40:41,044 --> 01:40:42,907
And I think it's more important, and

2329
01:40:42,907 --> 01:40:44,464
you can do more with it.

2330
01:40:44,464 --> 01:40:46,864
What do you think about
the whole Google and

2331
01:40:46,864 --> 01:40:50,165
only google-based tracking,
versus people-based tracking

2332
01:40:50,165 --> 01:40:52,417
from Facebook and Instagram and so on?

2333
01:40:52,417 --> 01:40:56,709
- You mean, intent based
word versus what we're doing

2334
01:40:56,709 --> 01:40:57,961
behaviorally?

2335
01:40:57,961 --> 01:40:58,944
- [Kevin] Yes.

2336
01:40:58,944 --> 01:41:00,256
- I think they both matter.

2337
01:41:00,256 --> 01:41:01,178
- [Kevin] You think they both matter?

2338
01:41:01,178 --> 01:41:02,135
- Sure.

2339
01:41:02,135 --> 01:41:05,885
I think if somebody, so let
me tell you another tactic

2340
01:41:05,885 --> 01:41:07,371
that maybe somebody wants to try.

2341
01:41:07,371 --> 01:41:08,764
As you can tell, when you do the tactics,

2342
01:41:08,764 --> 01:41:10,484
good things happen.

2343
01:41:10,484 --> 01:41:12,858
There's an ad product on Youtube, which

2344
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:15,517
allows you to run a pre-roll video, based

2345
01:41:15,517 --> 01:41:18,184
on what people search on Google.

2346
01:41:20,086 --> 01:41:23,253
So, I can run ads on people who search

2347
01:41:24,455 --> 01:41:26,806
motivational speakers, but
even though they're watching

2348
01:41:26,806 --> 01:41:30,570
a skiing video, I can
put my pre-roll video

2349
01:41:30,570 --> 01:41:34,963
on them, because I understand
the intent-based data.

2350
01:41:34,963 --> 01:41:36,974
The creative has to be great.

2351
01:41:36,974 --> 01:41:39,063
My first three seconds on
the pre-roll has to be great,

2352
01:41:39,063 --> 01:41:41,288
'cause none of us want it.

2353
01:41:41,288 --> 01:41:44,955
But intent-based marketing
is very powerful,

2354
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:49,129
and extremely good for sales.

2355
01:41:49,129 --> 01:41:52,756
Facebook is much better
for branding, high-impact,

2356
01:41:52,756 --> 01:41:55,896
he's not, he's making
videos, he's not getting jobs

2357
01:41:55,896 --> 01:41:58,768
because he says, and click
this and then on the landing

2358
01:41:58,768 --> 01:42:00,478
page and then, he's getting
it because he's building

2359
01:42:00,478 --> 01:42:03,982
a brand, and then they're
coming to him, the halo effect.

2360
01:42:03,982 --> 01:42:05,283
That's much better.

2361
01:42:05,283 --> 01:42:08,622
But marketing and sales both
matter, and if you're good

2362
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:11,813
at both, you've really got
the game, and so I just

2363
01:42:11,813 --> 01:42:14,099
think both matter quite a bit.

2364
01:42:14,099 --> 01:42:14,932
- [Kevin] Thank you.

2365
01:42:14,932 --> 01:42:16,195
- You're welcome.

2366
01:42:16,195 --> 01:42:19,195
(audience applauds)

2367
01:42:21,716 --> 01:42:24,116
- [Woman] Now for a really personal one.

2368
01:42:24,116 --> 01:42:25,633
Bertil!

2369
01:42:25,633 --> 01:42:27,136
Where's Bertil?

2370
01:42:27,136 --> 01:42:28,132
Bingo!

2371
01:42:28,132 --> 01:42:30,096
Can we get a mic runner to Bertil?

2372
01:42:30,096 --> 01:42:31,883
- That's you right
there, right next to you.

2373
01:42:31,883 --> 01:42:33,050
- [Woman] Yep.

2374
01:42:36,065 --> 01:42:36,898
Super.

2375
01:42:38,242 --> 01:42:39,075
- [Bertil] Hello, Gary.

2376
01:42:39,075 --> 01:42:39,908
- How are you?

2377
01:42:39,908 --> 01:42:40,857
- [Bertil] I'm good.

2378
01:42:40,857 --> 01:42:44,774
And my question is, how
do you deal with people

2379
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:47,362
who don't ...

2380
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:53,035
Like, believe in you or
understand and especially when

2381
01:42:53,035 --> 01:42:56,365
those people are your
friends and your family?

2382
01:42:56,365 --> 01:42:58,032
- I look, I like it.

2383
01:42:59,444 --> 01:43:01,560
I like it a lot, actually,
to be honest with you,

2384
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:04,727
because, no, I really do, I prefer it.

2385
01:43:06,341 --> 01:43:08,765
I even think I communicate
in a certain way to make

2386
01:43:08,765 --> 01:43:11,973
people confused, so that more
people don't believe in me.

2387
01:43:11,973 --> 01:43:14,054
I like it, Bertil, like I think it's,

2388
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:17,011
I think it's the most
fulfilling thing in the world,

2389
01:43:17,011 --> 01:43:19,576
to achieve something and
look at one of your friends

2390
01:43:19,576 --> 01:43:21,481
and say, told you so, asshole.

2391
01:43:21,481 --> 01:43:23,734
(audience laughs)

2392
01:43:23,734 --> 01:43:27,521
Like, you know, look, I said it earlier,

2393
01:43:27,521 --> 01:43:28,662
this is a tough question
for me, and let me tell you

2394
01:43:28,662 --> 01:43:29,495
why.

2395
01:43:30,486 --> 01:43:34,653
Through DNA, through
circumstance, through parenting,

2396
01:43:35,888 --> 01:43:39,138
I actually am not kidding, I prefer it.

2397
01:43:40,417 --> 01:43:44,980
Other of my dearest friends,
my sister, for example,

2398
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,897
she does not prefer it.

2399
01:43:48,126 --> 01:43:50,361
You know, but what I can
tell you is, at the end

2400
01:43:50,361 --> 01:43:52,958
of the day, when you're
94, actually, I got a,

2401
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:55,723
can I recommend something?

2402
01:43:55,723 --> 01:43:59,890
Go spend one day volunteering
at a retirement home.

2403
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:03,147
If you want to fix this,
I've got a way for you

2404
01:44:03,147 --> 01:44:06,470
to fix it, potentially,
and do something very nice

2405
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:08,221
to the world.

2406
01:44:08,221 --> 01:44:11,615
You, as a young man, go
Google retirement homes.

2407
01:44:11,615 --> 01:44:14,057
I don't know if that's,
is that a culture here?

2408
01:44:14,057 --> 01:44:14,890
Okay, good.

2409
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:18,748
'Cause every culture's got, go and email

2410
01:44:18,748 --> 01:44:21,047
every retirement home
near you, and ask them

2411
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:23,210
if you're allowed to volunteer for a day.

2412
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:24,926
Then, go and volunteer.

2413
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:26,676
When you're volunteering,
make sure you do whatever

2414
01:44:26,676 --> 01:44:28,438
they tell you you need
to do, but every minute

2415
01:44:28,438 --> 01:44:30,236
you have, talk.

2416
01:44:30,236 --> 01:44:33,387
'Cause they want to talk to you anyway.

2417
01:44:33,387 --> 01:44:35,621
What you are gonna learn is a lot.

2418
01:44:35,621 --> 01:44:37,689
And the biggest thing
you're gonna learn is,

2419
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:39,770
all those friends and
family's opinions, at the end

2420
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:42,267
of the day, aren't gonna matter.

2421
01:44:42,267 --> 01:44:44,552
And you're gonna have a lot of regret, and

2422
01:44:44,552 --> 01:44:46,626
the scariest thing when
you look an old person

2423
01:44:46,626 --> 01:44:51,538
in the eye, when they know
there is no more ten years,

2424
01:44:51,538 --> 01:44:53,705
it's always about regret.

2425
01:44:53,705 --> 01:44:56,586
It's always much more
about what they didn't do,

2426
01:44:56,586 --> 01:44:58,503
than what they did.

2427
01:44:58,503 --> 01:45:00,375
And I don't want that for
you, and I think the one thing

2428
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:03,509
that may set you straight
is a nice full day

2429
01:45:03,509 --> 01:45:05,259
at a retirement home.

2430
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:09,132
- [Bertil] Thank you.

2431
01:45:09,132 --> 01:45:12,132
(audience applauds)

2432
01:45:15,304 --> 01:45:16,790
- All of you should do that.

2433
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:18,053
It's a really interesting thing.

2434
01:45:18,053 --> 01:45:20,142
I'm about to do an
episode with the D Rock,

2435
01:45:20,142 --> 01:45:22,867
because I've been talking a lot about it.

2436
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:24,350
Perspective.

2437
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:25,183
You know.

2438
01:45:25,183 --> 01:45:26,230
Regret.

2439
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:28,844
I live my whole life,
everything, you wanna capsulize

2440
01:45:28,844 --> 01:45:31,660
everything, a lot of this is about regret.

2441
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:35,534
It's the one that you
can't fix at the end.

2442
01:45:35,534 --> 01:45:38,659
And so many of you right
now are living your lives

2443
01:45:38,659 --> 01:45:42,570
based on what your parents
want you to be doing.

2444
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:46,403
And you're gonna, you're
going to resent them.

2445
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:49,380
You're creating the culture
of a bad relationship

2446
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:51,081
with them, not a good
one, you're just putting

2447
01:45:51,081 --> 01:45:52,414
a bandaid on it.

2448
01:45:53,891 --> 01:45:55,933
(makes fart noise with mouth)

2449
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:58,012
- [Woman] I'm letting it go to the masses.

2450
01:45:58,012 --> 01:46:00,891
So, do we have hands, yeah?

2451
01:46:00,891 --> 01:46:02,736
Do you wanna pick one yourself this time?

2452
01:46:02,736 --> 01:46:04,102
- Yeah, that kid in the corner, actually,

2453
01:46:04,102 --> 01:46:06,094
ironically in the same
area, I noticed him earlier,

2454
01:46:06,094 --> 01:46:06,927
so let's start with him.

2455
01:46:06,927 --> 01:46:07,760
- [Woman] Perfect.

2456
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,593
- Hey, brother.

2457
01:46:08,593 --> 01:46:10,718
- [Man In Audience] Hi Gary,
I want to ask about what's

2458
01:46:10,718 --> 01:46:13,271
your opinion on block chain?

2459
01:46:13,271 --> 01:46:16,213
- I think block chain is the
technology right now that has

2460
01:46:16,213 --> 01:46:19,380
the most potential to disrupt society.

2461
01:46:20,618 --> 01:46:22,290
I think people are grossly
underestimating what

2462
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:24,411
it means, what it's doing.

2463
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:28,669
Block chain is creating
infrastructure around trust,

2464
01:46:28,669 --> 01:46:30,421
and trust between all
of us with each other

2465
01:46:30,421 --> 01:46:34,120
with nobody in between, not central banks.

2466
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:36,092
Not leasing companies.

2467
01:46:36,092 --> 01:46:37,842
Not even governments.

2468
01:46:38,711 --> 01:46:41,556
I think that it has the
potential to create the

2469
01:46:41,556 --> 01:46:44,556
global next war, 'cause it's so big.

2470
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:47,552
- [Man In Audience] Thank you.

2471
01:46:47,552 --> 01:46:49,446
- You're welcome, what do you think?

2472
01:46:49,446 --> 01:46:50,989
- [Man In Audience] My personal ...

2473
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:52,185
- Yeah, go ahead.

2474
01:46:52,185 --> 01:46:53,239
- [Man In Audience] My personal opinion,

2475
01:46:53,239 --> 01:46:54,906
I really like it ...

2476
01:46:56,141 --> 01:46:59,332
I'm really bad at listening
to myself when I talk,

2477
01:46:59,332 --> 01:47:01,497
- No worries, go ahead.
- So I stop accidentally.

2478
01:47:01,497 --> 01:47:03,703
- [Man In Audience]
But I like it a lot ...

2479
01:47:03,703 --> 01:47:05,337
- Why?

2480
01:47:05,337 --> 01:47:06,318
- [Man In Audience] I mean, I think it's

2481
01:47:06,318 --> 01:47:08,485
a really interesting, new,

2482
01:47:09,334 --> 01:47:11,463
architecture, I guess you could say,

2483
01:47:11,463 --> 01:47:14,130
'cause it's almost 100% ...

2484
01:47:17,051 --> 01:47:20,470
I mean, it's decentralized,
so there's no one controlling

2485
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:21,340
it.

2486
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,173
- That's right.

2487
01:47:22,173 --> 01:47:25,226
- [Man In Audience] And ...

2488
01:47:25,226 --> 01:47:27,853
I mean, it has a lot
of power I just think,

2489
01:47:27,853 --> 01:47:29,271
I don't know how to explain.

2490
01:47:29,271 --> 01:47:32,455
- Do you think that China
and America and Russia

2491
01:47:32,455 --> 01:47:35,610
are gonna let it see its power?

2492
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:37,199
- [Man In Audience] I mean,
I don't think they like it,

2493
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,447
but since it's decentralized,
I don't think there's

2494
01:47:39,447 --> 01:47:40,870
any way to stop it.

2495
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:42,203
- Sure there is.

2496
01:47:43,452 --> 01:47:44,711
- [Man In Audience] Can
you give me an example?

2497
01:47:44,711 --> 01:47:49,040
- Sure, they can start
suppressing their citizens.

2498
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,526
- [Man In Audience] Yeah, okay (chuckles).

2499
01:47:51,526 --> 01:47:53,278
I don't have a counter-answer to that.

2500
01:47:53,278 --> 01:47:54,111
- Okay.

2501
01:47:54,111 --> 01:47:55,553
I don't either, by the way.

2502
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:57,922
I'm just super, I don't,
the reason I'm exchanging

2503
01:47:57,922 --> 01:48:00,664
right now, is I don't,
people are like, bitcoin!

2504
01:48:00,664 --> 01:48:04,306
Guys, get educated on what's
actually happening here.

2505
01:48:04,306 --> 01:48:06,227
Like, pay attention to the
conversation we just had

2506
01:48:06,227 --> 01:48:07,632
a minute ago.

2507
01:48:07,632 --> 01:48:09,215
This is a big deal.

2508
01:48:10,144 --> 01:48:10,977
I don't know.

2509
01:48:10,977 --> 01:48:11,810
I don't know either.

2510
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:12,860
You got something on it?

2511
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:14,245
- [Woman In Audience] What is block chain?

2512
01:48:14,245 --> 01:48:15,751
- Block chain is a protocol, I guess,

2513
01:48:15,751 --> 01:48:17,902
it's an infrastructure,
I don't know what people

2514
01:48:17,902 --> 01:48:21,061
are calling it, what is it, a protocol?

2515
01:48:21,061 --> 01:48:23,985
- [Man In Audience] It's
engineer big network,

2516
01:48:23,985 --> 01:48:27,166
which every piece of information is stored

2517
01:48:27,166 --> 01:48:31,419
in blocks, and it's publicly
viewable, so everyone

2518
01:48:31,419 --> 01:48:34,588
can see it and verify
that everything is true.

2519
01:48:34,588 --> 01:48:38,151
- And there's mining technology
that creates the people

2520
01:48:38,151 --> 01:48:38,984
that stamp it.

2521
01:48:38,984 --> 01:48:39,921
- [Man In Audience] Yeah,
that's the ecosystem.

2522
01:48:39,921 --> 01:48:43,036
- The ecosystem is around
miners, which are machines,

2523
01:48:43,036 --> 01:48:47,640
it's basically, you and I,
you will sell me your home

2524
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,671
in 11 years, and our
transaction will happen

2525
01:48:49,671 --> 01:48:51,511
on the block chain.

2526
01:48:51,511 --> 01:48:52,344
- [Woman In Audience] Nobody else.

2527
01:48:52,344 --> 01:48:54,856
- Nobody else, which means all those fees

2528
01:48:54,856 --> 01:48:56,939
in between you and me ...

2529
01:49:00,142 --> 01:49:02,171
So, you know, I don't talk
about it a lot, because

2530
01:49:02,171 --> 01:49:04,122
as you can tell, I don't
even know every terminology,

2531
01:49:04,122 --> 01:49:07,067
I've been paying attention, I
bought bitcoin four years ago,

2532
01:49:07,067 --> 01:49:08,150
I'm watching.

2533
01:49:10,042 --> 01:49:11,222
But ...

2534
01:49:11,222 --> 01:49:13,376
Fuck, it's heady.

2535
01:49:13,376 --> 01:49:15,210
It's, you know, I'm laughing,
'cause everyone's like,

2536
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:16,043
bitcoin!

2537
01:49:16,043 --> 01:49:16,925
I'm like, ugh.

2538
01:49:16,925 --> 01:49:18,196
Do you know what Ethereum is, do you know

2539
01:49:18,196 --> 01:49:22,717
what block chain is, like,
this is very intense.

2540
01:49:22,717 --> 01:49:26,846
What, you know, I think it's youth naivete

2541
01:49:26,846 --> 01:49:29,753
that says, Russia and
China, and America, can't do

2542
01:49:29,753 --> 01:49:31,219
anything about it.

2543
01:49:31,219 --> 01:49:33,720
It is literally, literally, literally,

2544
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:36,276
the thing that can undermine them.

2545
01:49:36,276 --> 01:49:37,109
- [Man In Audience] Yeah.

2546
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:39,165
- They're not that interested in that.

2547
01:49:39,165 --> 01:49:40,150
- [Man In Audience] Of course not.

2548
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:41,289
- Yeah, cool.

2549
01:49:41,289 --> 01:49:42,937
- Thank you.
- Okay, you got it.

2550
01:49:42,937 --> 01:49:45,937
(audience applauds)

2551
01:49:47,779 --> 01:49:50,013
- [Woman] Speaking of
technology, the tech guys

2552
01:49:50,013 --> 01:49:52,556
want you to pull it a
little closer to your mouth,

2553
01:49:52,556 --> 01:49:53,619
can you do that?

2554
01:49:53,619 --> 01:49:54,452
Thank you.

2555
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:57,713
Next question, do you
wanna pick one yourself?

2556
01:49:57,713 --> 01:49:59,193
- Yeah, how about the
dude all the way up in

2557
01:49:59,193 --> 01:50:01,423
the corner there, and then
I wanna go to that, we're

2558
01:50:01,423 --> 01:50:04,301
gonna go to that dude next.

2559
01:50:04,301 --> 01:50:06,722
And then I wanna pick a lady.

2560
01:50:06,722 --> 01:50:08,054
Got you, I see you.

2561
01:50:08,054 --> 01:50:09,282
- Hey.
- Hey, Gary.

2562
01:50:09,282 --> 01:50:11,641
- [Man In Audience] My name is Mess.

2563
01:50:11,641 --> 01:50:15,311
My question contains
business to business sale.

2564
01:50:15,311 --> 01:50:19,281
What is your biggest advice
within business to business

2565
01:50:19,281 --> 01:50:22,448
sale, customer relationships, or is it

2566
01:50:23,728 --> 01:50:27,616
chance through Facebook or
LinkedIn social or something?

2567
01:50:27,616 --> 01:50:31,116
- So, usually the answer is, hold the mic,

2568
01:50:32,172 --> 01:50:34,472
so I love that you started
with customer retention,

2569
01:50:34,472 --> 01:50:35,373
right?

2570
01:50:35,373 --> 01:50:38,239
I think everybody's hunting,
they forget about farming.

2571
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:40,887
Usually, the best way to
build a real big business

2572
01:50:40,887 --> 01:50:43,648
is to keep the ones you got,
as much as getting new ones,

2573
01:50:43,648 --> 01:50:45,156
right?

2574
01:50:45,156 --> 01:50:46,597
- [Mess] To hunt or be hunted.

2575
01:50:46,597 --> 01:50:47,430
- What's that?

2576
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:48,885
- [Mess] To hunt or be hunted.

2577
01:50:48,885 --> 01:50:49,718
- That's right.

2578
01:50:49,718 --> 01:50:51,222
Well, to me, it's more
about hunting and farming.

2579
01:50:51,222 --> 01:50:53,030
Being hunted is your
competitors, at least, how I

2580
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:54,266
think about it.

2581
01:50:54,266 --> 01:50:55,172
To me, it's farming.

2582
01:50:55,172 --> 01:50:57,519
You got something, you got a seed, and now

2583
01:50:57,519 --> 01:50:59,213
you cultivate it, right?

2584
01:50:59,213 --> 01:51:00,855
You don't want customers
for one year, you want them

2585
01:51:00,855 --> 01:51:02,400
for 11.

2586
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,736
It's a far more interesting model.

2587
01:51:04,736 --> 01:51:08,990
My question to you is, what's
the biggest vulnerability

2588
01:51:08,990 --> 01:51:09,895
in your opinion?

2589
01:51:09,895 --> 01:51:11,731
The hunting or the farming, right now?

2590
01:51:11,731 --> 01:51:13,064
In your company?

2591
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:17,037
Retention, or acquisition?

2592
01:51:18,497 --> 01:51:20,208
- [Mess] It's actually acquisition.

2593
01:51:20,208 --> 01:51:21,085
- Great.

2594
01:51:21,085 --> 01:51:22,754
It's probably 'cause you're
spending marketing money

2595
01:51:22,754 --> 01:51:24,685
in dumb places.

2596
01:51:24,685 --> 01:51:25,518
- [Mess] Probably, yeah.

2597
01:51:25,518 --> 01:51:26,351
- Good.

2598
01:51:26,351 --> 01:51:27,207
So don't.

2599
01:51:27,207 --> 01:51:28,387
(audience chuckles)

2600
01:51:28,387 --> 01:51:29,377
- [Mess] That's a good advice.

2601
01:51:29,377 --> 01:51:30,637
- Thank you (chuckles).

2602
01:51:30,637 --> 01:51:33,889
But like, you know, I think
it's Facebook and LinkedIn,

2603
01:51:33,889 --> 01:51:35,629
I think it's influencers,
I think it's long form

2604
01:51:35,629 --> 01:51:37,608
content, I think it's starting a podcast

2605
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:40,022
for the industry, I
think it's white papers,

2606
01:51:40,022 --> 01:51:42,483
I think it's videos, short
and long form on Facebook,

2607
01:51:42,483 --> 01:51:44,858
I think all that stuff works.

2608
01:51:44,858 --> 01:51:47,543
And as you know, when you look
under the hood, most B to B

2609
01:51:47,543 --> 01:51:49,791
companies are spending
5% of their money on

2610
01:51:49,791 --> 01:51:53,322
all the things I just
said, and 95 on Google,

2611
01:51:53,322 --> 01:51:57,489
spamming on LinkedIn, B to
B magazines, direct mail,

2612
01:51:58,497 --> 01:52:01,330
trade shows, sponsoring dumb shit.

2613
01:52:03,962 --> 01:52:05,712
- [Mess] Actually, was
a good advice, earlier,

2614
01:52:05,712 --> 01:52:09,984
about the targeting
the co-workers and the,

2615
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,648
in the companies that you want to target.

2616
01:52:11,648 --> 01:52:13,804
- And then make creative,
'cause I want to make sure

2617
01:52:13,804 --> 01:52:15,958
everybody's listening, it's
not just the targeting,

2618
01:52:15,958 --> 01:52:17,878
you gotta make the video, say, does

2619
01:52:17,878 --> 01:52:20,570
your head of finance
understand, or, you know,

2620
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:23,188
you gotta set that person
up, because that employee

2621
01:52:23,188 --> 01:52:27,140
may be a secretary, a salesman,
you know, an IT department

2622
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:30,443
person, they're not gonna
just, it's not for them.

2623
01:52:30,443 --> 01:52:32,365
So the way to make it
for them is asking them

2624
01:52:32,365 --> 01:52:35,535
does your CEO know, to,
you know, you're looking

2625
01:52:35,535 --> 01:52:36,953
for somebody who cares about
the business and's like,

2626
01:52:36,953 --> 01:52:38,503
oh, shit, you know?

2627
01:52:38,503 --> 01:52:42,670
So be smart, but content
is the variable of success.

2628
01:52:44,687 --> 01:52:47,170
I got in front of you here today.

2629
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:49,862
Now the talk was gonna
be the variable of what

2630
01:52:49,862 --> 01:52:52,362
happens with us going forward.

2631
01:52:53,552 --> 01:52:56,997
The content is the variable of success.

2632
01:52:56,997 --> 01:53:01,101
He looked at, you know, I
smiled, I almost stopped him,

2633
01:53:01,101 --> 01:53:03,719
but he was on a roll,
he said I owe it to you,

2634
01:53:03,719 --> 01:53:06,052
your tactics, his execution.

2635
01:53:07,497 --> 01:53:09,701
He heard me, he understood Facebook video.

2636
01:53:09,701 --> 01:53:11,378
Facebook video has more
upside than Youtube,

2637
01:53:11,378 --> 01:53:13,170
it's easier to break out.

2638
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:14,781
The end.

2639
01:53:14,781 --> 01:53:18,371
Like, he understood, he watched
carefully, I got to him,

2640
01:53:18,371 --> 01:53:22,414
but it was his charisma, and
capability to story tell,

2641
01:53:22,414 --> 01:53:23,969
that has made him successful.

2642
01:53:23,969 --> 01:53:26,457
There's plenty of people
that have listened to me.

2643
01:53:26,457 --> 01:53:30,457
And made a video, and
nobody fucking watched it.

2644
01:53:31,705 --> 01:53:32,724
Cool.

2645
01:53:32,724 --> 01:53:34,034
- [Mess] Thank you.

2646
01:53:34,034 --> 01:53:37,034
(audience applauds)

2647
01:53:39,275 --> 01:53:41,185
- [Man In Audience] Hello, is it on?

2648
01:53:41,185 --> 01:53:42,018
- Yep.

2649
01:53:42,018 --> 01:53:42,851
- [Man In Audience] So, thank you so much

2650
01:53:42,851 --> 01:53:46,655
for your time, and I'm a
guy who's, I like systems

2651
01:53:46,655 --> 01:53:47,687
and practical stuff.

2652
01:53:47,687 --> 01:53:48,899
- I'm sorry?

2653
01:53:48,899 --> 01:53:51,124
- [Man In Audience] I'm a
big fan of practical things,

2654
01:53:51,124 --> 01:53:53,375
and so recipes in terms
of how to do things.

2655
01:53:53,375 --> 01:53:54,208
- Okay.

2656
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:55,324
- [Man In Audience] And
what I want to know is,

2657
01:53:55,324 --> 01:53:58,200
what would you do to grow
an influencer organically

2658
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:02,079
on social media, Facebook,
Youtube, these platforms?

2659
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:03,032
- Organically?

2660
01:54:03,032 --> 01:54:03,990
- [Man In Audience] Yeah.

2661
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:06,958
- On Instagram, I would use 15 hashtags

2662
01:54:06,958 --> 01:54:10,069
as the first comment after
the post, after I spent

2663
01:54:10,069 --> 01:54:13,799
40 to 60 hours
understanding which hashtags

2664
01:54:13,799 --> 01:54:16,915
were the perfect balance
between a lot of people

2665
01:54:16,915 --> 01:54:20,219
use them, but they're
not one of the top 25,

2666
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:22,141
because I'll never
penetrate it, because I'm

2667
01:54:22,141 --> 01:54:22,974
too small.

2668
01:54:23,869 --> 01:54:25,227
Got it?

2669
01:54:25,227 --> 01:54:28,596
Number two, I would DM as many influencers

2670
01:54:28,596 --> 01:54:32,445
in the same 50 mile radius,
or interests, if the person

2671
01:54:32,445 --> 01:54:36,300
can travel, as me, and I
would DM them to figure out

2672
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:39,326
what I could do for them, in
return for them collaborating

2673
01:54:39,326 --> 01:54:41,854
with me, and taking a
picture on their account

2674
01:54:41,854 --> 01:54:45,687
and tagging me to siphon
their audience to me.

2675
01:54:47,606 --> 01:54:49,378
- [Man In Audience] Yeah, perfect, got it.

2676
01:54:49,378 --> 01:54:52,256
What about Facebook and Youtube?

2677
01:54:52,256 --> 01:54:54,214
- Youtube I'm gonna punt,
because the organic nature

2678
01:54:54,214 --> 01:54:57,551
of Youtube is so
predicated on the creative

2679
01:54:57,551 --> 01:54:59,969
and collaborating is far more intense than

2680
01:54:59,969 --> 01:55:03,144
taking a photo, so I'm just gonna punt it.

2681
01:55:03,144 --> 01:55:06,977
Facebook I would email
people that have media pages

2682
01:55:06,977 --> 01:55:11,227
around, what does the
influencer do, what genre?

2683
01:55:11,227 --> 01:55:12,615
- [Man In Audience] So, entrepreneurship.

2684
01:55:12,615 --> 01:55:13,512
- Entrepreneurship.

2685
01:55:13,512 --> 01:55:16,612
I would go to every
entrepreneur media site

2686
01:55:16,612 --> 01:55:20,075
on Facebook and email them and ask them

2687
01:55:20,075 --> 01:55:22,035
if they wanted any of the
content that this person

2688
01:55:22,035 --> 01:55:25,868
was producing for free,
to post on their page.

2689
01:55:27,185 --> 01:55:28,018
- [Man In Audience] Okay, perfect.

2690
01:55:28,018 --> 01:55:31,076
- Now, everything I
just told you, on the DM

2691
01:55:31,076 --> 01:55:33,473
and the emailing, you're
gonna get one out of

2692
01:55:33,473 --> 01:55:35,317
every 50 people responding, so you need

2693
01:55:35,317 --> 01:55:36,484
to hit 37,000.

2694
01:55:38,061 --> 01:55:39,451
- [Man In Audience]
Perfect, okay (chuckling).

2695
01:55:39,451 --> 01:55:41,951
I got one last thing, punt it?

2696
01:55:42,928 --> 01:55:45,334
- It's an American term, when in football,

2697
01:55:45,334 --> 01:55:47,242
when you play, if you
don't get a first down,

2698
01:55:47,242 --> 01:55:49,663
you punt to the other
team and they start over.

2699
01:55:49,663 --> 01:55:51,876
I'm just saying, take Youtube and fuck it,

2700
01:55:51,876 --> 01:55:55,777
win on Instagram and
Facebook first, and then

2701
01:55:55,777 --> 01:55:57,654
leverage that to build on Youtube.

2702
01:55:57,654 --> 01:55:59,961
The stakes are, it's just too hard,

2703
01:55:59,961 --> 01:56:03,825
supply and demand and tactics
on Youtube, to break through,

2704
01:56:03,825 --> 01:56:06,235
there's a lot of titles and thumbnails,

2705
01:56:06,235 --> 01:56:08,043
even I haven't really fully penetrated.

2706
01:56:08,043 --> 01:56:09,361
There are people that are better at it.

2707
01:56:09,361 --> 01:56:12,011
I don't like to give advice
when I don't know everything,

2708
01:56:12,011 --> 01:56:14,093
and so, and I also know
the other two right now

2709
01:56:14,093 --> 01:56:15,426
are underpriced.

2710
01:56:18,302 --> 01:56:19,258
- [Man In Audience] Perfect, thank you.

2711
01:56:19,258 --> 01:56:20,405
- You're welcome.

2712
01:56:20,405 --> 01:56:23,405
(audience applauds)

2713
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:26,808
My friends, I know a lot
of you don't know me,

2714
01:56:26,808 --> 01:56:28,809
and we've been hanging for a little while,

2715
01:56:28,809 --> 01:56:30,482
that was a very tactical question.

2716
01:56:30,482 --> 01:56:33,065
Others have been so fucking philosophical.

2717
01:56:33,065 --> 01:56:35,483
I just need people to
understand, we'll go right to

2718
01:56:35,483 --> 01:56:37,150
this lady over here.

2719
01:56:38,278 --> 01:56:42,531
The philosophical strategy
stuff is way more important.

2720
01:56:42,531 --> 01:56:44,548
Like, a lot of you like
that last question,

2721
01:56:44,548 --> 01:56:45,937
like a lot of you liked it.

2722
01:56:45,937 --> 01:56:47,812
I know your personalities.

2723
01:56:47,812 --> 01:56:52,005
But I'm telling you, that's the commodity.

2724
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:54,793
There's 8,000 answers to that question.

2725
01:56:54,793 --> 01:56:57,083
On Google, if you search
how to grow organically

2726
01:56:57,083 --> 01:56:58,166
on Instagram.

2727
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:02,510
Finding somebody that
communicates to you, that

2728
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:05,888
breaks through your mindset
and creates a new strategy,

2729
01:57:05,888 --> 01:57:07,138
that's the ROI.

2730
01:57:08,648 --> 01:57:10,643
And I may be that person
today and I may not,

2731
01:57:10,643 --> 01:57:14,058
but continue to seek somebody
to get you in the right place.

2732
01:57:14,058 --> 01:57:15,897
If you can't get there yourself.

2733
01:57:15,897 --> 01:57:17,136
Hi.

2734
01:57:17,136 --> 01:57:18,357
- [Fabiola] Hi, Gary.

2735
01:57:18,357 --> 01:57:20,607
My name is Fabiola, and ...

2736
01:57:21,455 --> 01:57:25,397
There is a lot of men fans
of you, and there is also

2737
01:57:25,397 --> 01:57:27,909
a lot of women, and I'm one of them.

2738
01:57:27,909 --> 01:57:29,164
- Thank you.

2739
01:57:29,164 --> 01:57:30,713
- [Fabiola] And ...

2740
01:57:30,713 --> 01:57:34,448
Maybe people look at you, and think

2741
01:57:34,448 --> 01:57:38,537
Gary V, he's so confident,
and, but what about me,

2742
01:57:38,537 --> 01:57:40,878
I'm not that confident.

2743
01:57:40,878 --> 01:57:41,711
- Right.

2744
01:57:41,711 --> 01:57:45,878
- [Fabiola] So, what is your
biggest secret, to become ...

2745
01:57:47,681 --> 01:57:48,657
- More confident?

2746
01:57:48,657 --> 01:57:51,913
- [Fabiola] Yeah, be more
fearless and take chances

2747
01:57:51,913 --> 01:57:55,576
to step up where maybe people are hiding.

2748
01:57:55,576 --> 01:57:56,719
- Yep.

2749
01:57:56,719 --> 01:57:58,483
So, you know how earlier,
I said I don't know how

2750
01:57:58,483 --> 01:57:59,968
to teach you empathy?

2751
01:57:59,968 --> 01:58:01,145
'Cause I don't.

2752
01:58:01,145 --> 01:58:04,447
I used to answer this
question the same way.

2753
01:58:04,447 --> 01:58:06,996
And then the cool thing
about life is, you get

2754
01:58:06,996 --> 01:58:09,952
wiser, you watch and
something breaks through,

2755
01:58:09,952 --> 01:58:11,290
and I actually have an answer for this,

2756
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:13,456
and I don't say it a
lot, and I'm super pumped

2757
01:58:13,456 --> 01:58:16,501
you asked me, so thank you.

2758
01:58:16,501 --> 01:58:18,668
You need to do two things.

2759
01:58:19,984 --> 01:58:22,528
You need to start hanging out with people

2760
01:58:22,528 --> 01:58:24,783
that are overly confident.

2761
01:58:24,783 --> 01:58:27,098
You need to look around your world.

2762
01:58:27,098 --> 01:58:31,057
Friends of friends, go to
meetups, look in your office.

2763
01:58:31,057 --> 01:58:33,764
Remember a friend from
college or high school.

2764
01:58:33,764 --> 01:58:36,867
You need to become
friends with more people

2765
01:58:36,867 --> 01:58:40,836
that are confident, and
tomorrow, you have to cut out

2766
01:58:40,836 --> 01:58:44,369
one of your friends who's
pessimistic and negative,

2767
01:58:44,369 --> 01:58:45,972
out of your life.

2768
01:58:45,972 --> 01:58:47,516
Not totally.

2769
01:58:47,516 --> 01:58:49,559
But you don't need to talk to her or him

2770
01:58:49,559 --> 01:58:52,928
three times a day, maybe
three times a month.

2771
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:54,845
This is an energy game.

2772
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:59,092
- [Fabiola] So, are there something that,

2773
01:58:59,092 --> 01:59:01,563
when you are thinking
about it, you are still

2774
01:59:01,563 --> 01:59:02,396
afraid of?

2775
01:59:04,061 --> 01:59:06,376
- I'm afraid of snakes.

2776
01:59:06,376 --> 01:59:08,177
(audience chuckles)

2777
01:59:08,177 --> 01:59:10,262
I'm not afraid of anything
emotionally, other than

2778
01:59:10,262 --> 01:59:14,100
death, even that, I'm
starting to finally get there,

2779
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:16,683
in the last two or three years.

2780
01:59:18,188 --> 01:59:19,688
Nothing emotional.

2781
01:59:21,013 --> 01:59:24,395
Nothing emotional, I'm afraid
of the health of my family.

2782
01:59:24,395 --> 01:59:25,576
- [Fabiola] The health of your family.

2783
01:59:25,576 --> 01:59:29,651
- That's it, the only thing
I ever, like, eh, you know,

2784
01:59:29,651 --> 01:59:32,827
is thinking that my
kids and wife are flying

2785
01:59:32,827 --> 01:59:35,080
to Florida the other
day, what if that plane,

2786
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:36,663
like, that's tough.

2787
01:59:38,556 --> 01:59:40,824
But only that extreme.

2788
01:59:40,824 --> 01:59:44,016
Not, I don't think anybody
can do anything to me.

2789
01:59:44,016 --> 01:59:46,549
Which puts me way ahead of everybody.

2790
01:59:46,549 --> 01:59:50,145
I do not believe that anybody
can do anything to me,

2791
01:59:50,145 --> 01:59:53,078
and that is more about
me taking responsibility,

2792
01:59:53,078 --> 01:59:55,615
more than anything else.

2793
01:59:55,615 --> 01:59:58,644
Once you eliminate that,
once you don't think

2794
01:59:58,644 --> 02:00:01,235
anybody else has any effect on you,

2795
02:00:01,235 --> 02:00:04,176
once I have, I have something
else, which is the cousin

2796
02:00:04,176 --> 02:00:06,388
to that, that makes me strong.

2797
02:00:06,388 --> 02:00:08,520
I don't expect anything from anybody,

2798
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:11,733
and I've never done
anything ever in my life,

2799
02:00:11,733 --> 02:00:15,979
with an expectation of
something in return.

2800
02:00:15,979 --> 02:00:19,317
That's ahead of 99% of people.

2801
02:00:19,317 --> 02:00:22,084
- [Fabiola] But when
you started, there must

2802
02:00:22,084 --> 02:00:25,163
be something you were scared
of, where you just was,

2803
02:00:25,163 --> 02:00:27,162
oh my God, I cannot handle this.

2804
02:00:27,162 --> 02:00:28,017
- No.

2805
02:00:28,017 --> 02:00:28,925
- [Fabiola] No?

2806
02:00:28,925 --> 02:00:31,384
- The only thing that was
different, when I started

2807
02:00:31,384 --> 02:00:34,422
professionally, then
everything I just told you,

2808
02:00:34,422 --> 02:00:36,557
is I was fearful that
people would feel that

2809
02:00:36,557 --> 02:00:38,934
my dad handed it to me,
and I would never get

2810
02:00:38,934 --> 02:00:42,474
the credit I deserved,
but that was a 17 year old

2811
02:00:42,474 --> 02:00:45,364
mindset that evolved pretty quickly.

2812
02:00:45,364 --> 02:00:46,915
I took care of that in the first 24 months

2813
02:00:46,915 --> 02:00:49,362
by growing the business
from three to $20 million

2814
02:00:49,362 --> 02:00:50,195
like that.

2815
02:00:52,155 --> 02:00:53,915
- [Fabiola] Okay.

2816
02:00:53,915 --> 02:00:54,832
Yeah, so ..

2817
02:00:56,091 --> 02:00:57,829
- Thank you so much, Gary!
- You're welcome.

2818
02:00:57,829 --> 02:00:59,287
(audience applauds)

2819
02:00:59,287 --> 02:01:00,800
- Listen.

2820
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,626
For all of you.

2821
02:01:02,626 --> 02:01:05,938
Two new friends that are
confident and positive

2822
02:01:05,938 --> 02:01:08,717
cut out one person that's
negative, including

2823
02:01:08,717 --> 02:01:11,353
if that's your sister.

2824
02:01:11,353 --> 02:01:12,873
I'm being fucking serious.

2825
02:01:12,873 --> 02:01:14,094
- [Fabiola] Already did.

2826
02:01:14,094 --> 02:01:15,117
- Good.

2827
02:01:15,117 --> 02:01:15,968
(audience chuckles)

2828
02:01:15,968 --> 02:01:16,801
I mean it.

2829
02:01:16,801 --> 02:01:18,219
It's not like you cut them
out, you never talk to them,

2830
02:01:18,219 --> 02:01:20,016
but you have to reframe the conversation,

2831
02:01:20,016 --> 02:01:22,535
because negative energy,
misery loves company,

2832
02:01:22,535 --> 02:01:26,285
is the currency that
nobody is talking about.

2833
02:01:28,859 --> 02:01:30,935
That's how you get more confident.

2834
02:01:30,935 --> 02:01:32,864
You're around people who want you to win,

2835
02:01:32,864 --> 02:01:34,917
and they make you ...

2836
02:01:34,917 --> 02:01:37,201
I'm doing it for you!

2837
02:01:37,201 --> 02:01:38,994
For my hardest core fans,
I'm the one doing it

2838
02:01:38,994 --> 02:01:40,622
for you!

2839
02:01:40,622 --> 02:01:43,509
I'm so confident that you, you know why

2840
02:01:43,509 --> 02:01:45,335
I've made more people do things?

2841
02:01:45,335 --> 02:01:47,252
Because we create such
a intimate relationship

2842
02:01:47,252 --> 02:01:48,647
in the way that I'm producing content and

2843
02:01:48,647 --> 02:01:50,590
interacting with you, that there's almost

2844
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:53,509
a weird friendship, even
though I don't know you yet,

2845
02:01:53,509 --> 02:01:56,805
so that if you fail, you
feel like you could be like,

2846
02:01:56,805 --> 02:02:00,022
Gary, you could like blame me!

2847
02:02:00,022 --> 02:02:01,464
And I love it.

2848
02:02:01,464 --> 02:02:03,859
I'll take every blame.

2849
02:02:03,859 --> 02:02:06,900
- [Fabiola] Okay, I just have
the last question, because

2850
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:10,567
how are you actually
communicate to influence like

2851
02:02:10,567 --> 02:02:14,506
you, as, I really want
you, I can be honest,

2852
02:02:14,506 --> 02:02:16,198
you say I should be honest?

2853
02:02:16,198 --> 02:02:18,784
I really want you on my
podcast, Fabiola Share,

2854
02:02:18,784 --> 02:02:22,057
because I want the greatest
leaders and the biggest

2855
02:02:22,057 --> 02:02:22,890
visionary people ...

2856
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:23,766
- I'll do your podcast.

2857
02:02:23,766 --> 02:02:24,599
- [Fabiola] Okay!

2858
02:02:24,599 --> 02:02:25,556
That's a deal.

2859
02:02:25,556 --> 02:02:28,529
(audience cheers and applauds)

2860
02:02:28,529 --> 02:02:29,426
Thank you.

2861
02:02:29,426 --> 02:02:30,611
- You're welcome.

2862
02:02:30,611 --> 02:02:32,157
- [Fabiola] That was all I needed.

2863
02:02:32,157 --> 02:02:35,425
- Email me at gary@vaynermedia,
say I was the woman

2864
02:02:35,425 --> 02:02:37,886
that waited to the bitter end to ask to be

2865
02:02:37,886 --> 02:02:40,723
on the podcast, I will get Tyler involved,

2866
02:02:40,723 --> 02:02:43,268
tschmidt@vaynermedia,
you can watch the videos

2867
02:02:43,268 --> 02:02:46,136
of this if you forget,
but I'm gary@vaynermedia,

2868
02:02:46,136 --> 02:02:47,562
and I'll do your podcast,
and then you'll go

2869
02:02:47,562 --> 02:02:49,940
to every other leader, and
because I did your show,

2870
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:52,526
they'll do it too, and because you asked,

2871
02:02:52,526 --> 02:02:53,748
something good will happen.

2872
02:02:53,748 --> 02:02:55,255
- [Fabiola] I fucking love you, thank you,

2873
02:02:55,255 --> 02:02:56,571
thank you, thank you!

2874
02:02:56,571 --> 02:02:57,759
(audience cheers and applauds)

2875
02:02:57,759 --> 02:02:58,717
(screams with enthusiasm)

2876
02:02:58,717 --> 02:03:00,634
- Let's give it to her.

2877
02:03:03,065 --> 02:03:04,148
To this lady.

2878
02:03:05,814 --> 02:03:06,647
- [Woman In Audience] Hi, Gary!

2879
02:03:06,647 --> 02:03:07,480
- How are you?

2880
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:08,682
- [Woman In Audience]
I'm your favorite fan,

2881
02:03:08,682 --> 02:03:09,626
you know why?

2882
02:03:09,626 --> 02:03:10,459
- Why?

2883
02:03:10,459 --> 02:03:11,337
- [Woman In Audience] No,
actually, favorite public.

2884
02:03:11,337 --> 02:03:12,660
It's because I don't know you!

2885
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:14,793
And the only reason I'm here today

2886
02:03:14,793 --> 02:03:17,565
is actually very funny,
because you probably DM

2887
02:03:17,565 --> 02:03:20,690
Tony Robins, and I saw you
on a video with Tony Robins

2888
02:03:20,690 --> 02:03:23,221
and I'm a Tony Robins girl,
and that's why I'm here ...

2889
02:03:23,221 --> 02:03:25,808
- I didn't DM Tony Robins,
seven years ago, Tony

2890
02:03:25,808 --> 02:03:28,505
Robins emailed me and asked
me to speak at his conference,

2891
02:03:28,505 --> 02:03:31,740
because I create content,
so people ask me, instead

2892
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:32,881
of the other way around.

2893
02:03:32,881 --> 02:03:34,939
- [Woman In Audience] Then
I should ask Tony how ...

2894
02:03:34,939 --> 02:03:36,444
But congratulations.

2895
02:03:36,444 --> 02:03:38,531
(audience cheers and applauds)

2896
02:03:38,531 --> 02:03:40,407
- So I did that episode
with Tony, and that's how

2897
02:03:40,407 --> 02:03:42,259
you first became aware
and that's how it started.

2898
02:03:42,259 --> 02:03:43,092
- [Woman In Audience] Yes, exactly.

2899
02:03:43,092 --> 02:03:43,925
- Okay, go ahead.
- And because the name of

2900
02:03:43,925 --> 02:03:44,952
- [Woman In Audience] My
company doesn't matter, but

2901
02:03:44,952 --> 02:03:47,661
it has something with elevating people,

2902
02:03:47,661 --> 02:03:49,500
and the reason I'm here
and I've been sucking out

2903
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,923
everything you said, because
I've been writing every word

2904
02:03:51,923 --> 02:03:53,695
that comes out of your
mouth, because I believe

2905
02:03:53,695 --> 02:03:55,824
we learn from people with experience,

2906
02:03:55,824 --> 02:03:57,696
I talked about it with Casper.

2907
02:03:57,696 --> 02:04:00,627
A lot of people think
that knowledge is power,

2908
02:04:00,627 --> 02:04:03,304
and I think that application
of knowledge is power,

2909
02:04:03,304 --> 02:04:05,850
and learning from somebody
who takes all that knowledge

2910
02:04:05,850 --> 02:04:08,476
and puts it into, applies into his world,

2911
02:04:08,476 --> 02:04:09,596
I can learn something from you.

2912
02:04:09,596 --> 02:04:11,395
- I agree with you.
- So, I started

2913
02:04:11,395 --> 02:04:12,657
- [Woman In Audience]
My company two days ago,

2914
02:04:12,657 --> 02:04:14,707
it doesn't matter what I sell, what I do.

2915
02:04:14,707 --> 02:04:17,123
But I'm in a place where everybody here

2916
02:04:17,123 --> 02:04:21,678
would love to be, because,
I have a market, and

2917
02:04:21,678 --> 02:04:25,866
I want to be very smart with
how I come out with my product.

2918
02:04:25,866 --> 02:04:28,474
I have been giving value
to people for the last

2919
02:04:28,474 --> 02:04:29,947
three and a half years without asking

2920
02:04:29,947 --> 02:04:32,167
for anything, so I have a market ...

2921
02:04:32,167 --> 02:04:33,000
- How?

2922
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,754
- [Woman In Audience] By
showing up, giving talks,

2923
02:04:36,754 --> 02:04:39,771
doing voluntary work for ...

2924
02:04:39,771 --> 02:04:40,844
- Go ahead.

2925
02:04:40,844 --> 02:04:43,046
- [Woman In Audience]
Non-profitable organizations,

2926
02:04:43,046 --> 02:04:47,024
and 1.2 million people
know who I am today,

2927
02:04:47,024 --> 02:04:48,872
and they basically say, what is it you do,

2928
02:04:48,872 --> 02:04:50,393
what is it you sell we can buy?

2929
02:04:50,393 --> 02:04:52,010
- How do you quantify that number?

2930
02:04:52,010 --> 02:04:53,273
- [Woman In Audience]
Rotary International.

2931
02:04:53,273 --> 02:04:54,106
- What's that?

2932
02:04:54,106 --> 02:04:55,359
- [Woman In Audience]
Rotary International?

2933
02:04:55,359 --> 02:04:56,347
- I don't know what that is, but go ahead.

2934
02:04:56,347 --> 02:04:59,033
- [Woman In Audience] Well,
Rotary is a non-profitable

2935
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:01,528
organization doing good
in the world, and I

2936
02:05:01,528 --> 02:05:04,398
promote fundraising for
doing good in the world.

2937
02:05:04,398 --> 02:05:05,231
Doesn't matter.

2938
02:05:05,231 --> 02:05:08,221
I have a product at the
moment, which is a service,

2939
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:11,744
and I am standing in a
place where two days ago

2940
02:05:11,744 --> 02:05:14,240
I started my company, and
I haven't really come out

2941
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:16,872
with the product, because I wanna ask

2942
02:05:16,872 --> 02:05:19,039
the very crucial question.

2943
02:05:20,117 --> 02:05:23,091
Fast first, or second safe?

2944
02:05:23,091 --> 02:05:26,216
Should I let somebody
else go out with my idea

2945
02:05:26,216 --> 02:05:29,648
and try it, and learn
from all the mistakes,

2946
02:05:29,648 --> 02:05:32,306
or should I be the first one, now, I'm an

2947
02:05:32,306 --> 02:05:36,065
entrepreneur in my core, because
I started two organizations

2948
02:05:36,065 --> 02:05:38,315
and I know I'm good at
it, and I put 18 hours

2949
02:05:38,315 --> 02:05:39,823
a day and I don't see my children.

2950
02:05:39,823 --> 02:05:42,005
I know I can do it.

2951
02:05:42,005 --> 02:05:44,098
But now it's money, until now,

2952
02:05:44,098 --> 02:05:46,785
I've been doing it for fun,
I've been doing it voluntarily,

2953
02:05:46,785 --> 02:05:49,539
but now it's like, putting
my own money out there.

2954
02:05:49,539 --> 02:05:52,121
Should I let somebody
else do it first and then

2955
02:05:52,121 --> 02:05:53,951
learn from all the mistakes?

2956
02:05:53,951 --> 02:05:56,239
Or should I just go head first and learn

2957
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:58,685
from my own mistakes, but
then, somebody else will learn

2958
02:05:58,685 --> 02:06:01,181
from my mistakes, and go faster?

2959
02:06:01,181 --> 02:06:03,717
- Why can't you learn
from your mistakes first

2960
02:06:03,717 --> 02:06:05,132
and go faster too?

2961
02:06:05,132 --> 02:06:06,803
- [Woman In Audience]
Well, because until now,

2962
02:06:06,803 --> 02:06:09,307
I wasn't attached, I
started two organizations.

2963
02:06:09,307 --> 02:06:12,810
- No no no, real quick, not
the personal mental question.

2964
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:16,426
You said that you're gonna
go, you know, you painted

2965
02:06:16,426 --> 02:06:18,756
a picture, and you said,
and what I'm worried about

2966
02:06:18,756 --> 02:06:19,895
or debating.

2967
02:06:19,895 --> 02:06:22,464
Is if I go first, somebody's
gonna see the mistakes

2968
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:26,684
I make, they'll go second
faster, and I understand.

2969
02:06:26,684 --> 02:06:29,077
You know, everybody,
early bird gets the worm,

2970
02:06:29,077 --> 02:06:31,705
the second mouse gets the cheese, right?

2971
02:06:31,705 --> 02:06:33,372
I understand the theory.

2972
02:06:33,372 --> 02:06:34,509
It's very basic.

2973
02:06:34,509 --> 02:06:35,540
- [Woman In Audience] Because
my market is there ...

2974
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:39,133
- Let me tell you something
you need to reconcile.

2975
02:06:39,133 --> 02:06:43,300
No purebred entrepreneur ever
thought about going second.

2976
02:06:44,653 --> 02:06:46,567
So you have to wrap your head around that.

2977
02:06:46,567 --> 02:06:47,706
(audience applauds)

2978
02:06:47,706 --> 02:06:50,556
When it wasn't money, you
were deploying entrepreneurial

2979
02:06:50,556 --> 02:06:54,185
tendencies, you weren't
being an entrepreneur.

2980
02:06:54,185 --> 02:06:56,902
So, you've gotta wrap
your head around that.

2981
02:06:56,902 --> 02:06:59,981
The fact that you're even debating it ...

2982
02:06:59,981 --> 02:07:00,915
- [Woman In Audience] Actually
I'm not, it's something

2983
02:07:00,915 --> 02:07:03,824
that came up since I met you.

2984
02:07:03,824 --> 02:07:06,488
Because you have applied
all those things that

2985
02:07:06,488 --> 02:07:08,977
you're teaching us on your
own business, and you got

2986
02:07:08,977 --> 02:07:11,457
better, and you're very
good at saying, okay,

2987
02:07:11,457 --> 02:07:13,411
17 years ago, I wasn't so good at it.

2988
02:07:13,411 --> 02:07:15,235
I wish I could've done
it better, and today,

2989
02:07:15,235 --> 02:07:17,484
people are doing it better
because of your experience.

2990
02:07:17,484 --> 02:07:19,362
- And so you should just do it.

2991
02:07:19,362 --> 02:07:20,213
- [Woman In Audience] Just do it.

2992
02:07:20,213 --> 02:07:23,630
- Because the only thing, I can't see,

2993
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:25,436
we're not spending enough
time here, unless you're

2994
02:07:25,436 --> 02:07:27,401
worried about the failure ...

2995
02:07:27,401 --> 02:07:28,234
- [Woman In Audience] I'm not.

2996
02:07:28,234 --> 02:07:29,385
- Or other peoples' opinions?

2997
02:07:29,385 --> 02:07:30,262
- [Woman In Audience] Absolutely not.

2998
02:07:30,262 --> 02:07:32,931
- Then you've created a fake narrative.

2999
02:07:32,931 --> 02:07:37,026
Amazon and Google and me
and others, we went first,

3000
02:07:37,026 --> 02:07:39,562
we failed, plenty other
people here, they went first,

3001
02:07:39,562 --> 02:07:40,830
so forget about, I'm
not, I don't want to put

3002
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:43,526
myself with them, people that've won here

3003
02:07:43,526 --> 02:07:46,737
have gone first, failed, fixed it,

3004
02:07:46,737 --> 02:07:49,456
and gone faster before, you've
created a fake narrative

3005
02:07:49,456 --> 02:07:51,291
that somebody's gonna be second.

3006
02:07:51,291 --> 02:07:53,826
First of all, nobody
gives a shit about you.

3007
02:07:53,826 --> 02:07:54,860
- True.
- Or me.

3008
02:07:54,860 --> 02:07:57,643
- So nobody's really watching.

3009
02:07:57,643 --> 02:07:59,508
So let's start with that.

3010
02:07:59,508 --> 02:08:02,363
That should make it much
easier for you to go first.

3011
02:08:02,363 --> 02:08:05,507
Second of all, the person
that goes first and fails,

3012
02:08:05,507 --> 02:08:08,216
nine out of ten times,
is the one that adjusts

3013
02:08:08,216 --> 02:08:09,726
and goes fast again.

3014
02:08:09,726 --> 02:08:11,394
This second mouse?

3015
02:08:11,394 --> 02:08:13,811
Is not as cool as you think.

3016
02:08:17,078 --> 02:08:18,101
- [Woman In Audience] Thank you.

3017
02:08:18,101 --> 02:08:21,101
(audience applauds)

3018
02:08:25,255 --> 02:08:27,906
- Yeah, we would love
to take more questions,

3019
02:08:27,906 --> 02:08:31,431
but unfortunately, you're
also moving forward,

3020
02:08:31,431 --> 02:08:34,616
and we have a lot scheduled
for the rest of you.

3021
02:08:34,616 --> 02:08:37,327
But I would like to ask
a question, regarding

3022
02:08:37,327 --> 02:08:39,831
the whole mass in here, because Elevate,

3023
02:08:39,831 --> 02:08:42,599
for several years have been a community.

3024
02:08:42,599 --> 02:08:45,502
A community of people
coming back every year,

3025
02:08:45,502 --> 02:08:47,982
I can recognize many of you sitting here,

3026
02:08:47,982 --> 02:08:50,843
but we have also many new people here.

3027
02:08:50,843 --> 02:08:55,010
So, what is your best advice
to Casper, and everybody else

3028
02:08:56,509 --> 02:09:00,102
about how to create an amazing community?

3029
02:09:00,102 --> 02:09:03,639
- An amazing community for
the organization's benefit,

3030
02:09:03,639 --> 02:09:05,357
I assume, which would be right ...

3031
02:09:05,357 --> 02:09:07,942
- No, also for each other,
many of the people here

3032
02:09:07,942 --> 02:09:10,902
do business together and
have learned each other ...

3033
02:09:10,902 --> 02:09:12,173
- So, it's super simple.

3034
02:09:12,173 --> 02:09:14,288
You create a framework that
allows them to communicate

3035
02:09:14,288 --> 02:09:15,621
with each other.

3036
02:09:16,571 --> 02:09:18,290
Whether that's through
email or a Facebook group

3037
02:09:18,290 --> 02:09:21,540
or an app that you build,
you'll decide how to do it,

3038
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:24,252
but the biggest ROI for
people here, is for the people

3039
02:09:24,252 --> 02:09:27,253
that are the least extroverts
and won't go up to somebody

3040
02:09:27,253 --> 02:09:31,133
right now and say hello
and exchange who are you,

3041
02:09:31,133 --> 02:09:34,343
is the ability to
interact with each other.

3042
02:09:34,343 --> 02:09:38,040
There's, the reason I
ever go to anything is for

3043
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:41,018
the follow up email, I don't
go to many conferences,

3044
02:09:41,018 --> 02:09:42,728
but I'll go to a lot of
dinners where I don't know

3045
02:09:42,728 --> 02:09:44,149
anybody else.

3046
02:09:44,149 --> 02:09:46,607
And it'll be 12 people
from different backgrounds.

3047
02:09:46,607 --> 02:09:51,411
The 99% reason is because,
once I make context,

3048
02:09:51,411 --> 02:09:53,071
the email that comes the next night

3049
02:09:53,071 --> 02:09:56,292
that puts everybody on the
same thread, I can pick

3050
02:09:56,292 --> 02:09:58,161
the three people that I
wanna email out of that

3051
02:09:58,161 --> 02:10:00,620
and say hey, let's follow
up on that, or let's

3052
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:03,122
do business together, or I
can help you, or I've got

3053
02:10:03,122 --> 02:10:05,499
an employee that's ready
to move on, who's great,

3054
02:10:05,499 --> 02:10:07,462
she wants to be an entrepreneurial person,

3055
02:10:07,462 --> 02:10:09,713
not an agency, you should hire her.

3056
02:10:09,713 --> 02:10:11,966
The great thing that you
could do for everybody here

3057
02:10:11,966 --> 02:10:15,529
in this community is build
a framework that allows them

3058
02:10:15,529 --> 02:10:18,681
and pushes them, and helps
them, and coddles them.

3059
02:10:18,681 --> 02:10:21,587
That woman almost didn't
ask, if we didn't hold on

3060
02:10:21,587 --> 02:10:24,811
100th of a second longer,
she almost didn't ask for

3061
02:10:24,811 --> 02:10:28,327
the thing she wanted to
ask, and since she did,

3062
02:10:28,327 --> 02:10:31,180
it's going to change at
some level, her business

3063
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:32,482
and her life.

3064
02:10:32,482 --> 02:10:34,530
She, we all were just here.

3065
02:10:34,530 --> 02:10:37,867
She was this close to not asking.

3066
02:10:37,867 --> 02:10:39,831
She didn't ask!

3067
02:10:39,831 --> 02:10:42,410
Luckily, we putzed around
for a couple more seconds,

3068
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:45,370
and she fucking finally got
the, and she went there,

3069
02:10:45,370 --> 02:10:46,203
right?

3070
02:10:47,402 --> 02:10:49,211
There's a lot of people here who are

3071
02:10:49,211 --> 02:10:51,983
literally right now
sitting next to a person

3072
02:10:51,983 --> 02:10:56,148
that can change the course
of their lives and career,

3073
02:10:56,148 --> 02:10:58,373
and they're not gonna say
anything to each other,

3074
02:10:58,373 --> 02:11:00,993
because that's not the way they interact.

3075
02:11:00,993 --> 02:11:02,391
In life.

3076
02:11:02,391 --> 02:11:04,129
And if you could do
anything that gets them

3077
02:11:04,129 --> 02:11:08,264
to do that, then you're
doing them a great service.

3078
02:11:08,264 --> 02:11:11,264
(audience applauds)

3079
02:11:14,017 --> 02:11:15,646
Listen, we've talked about
two cents, four cents,

3080
02:11:15,646 --> 02:11:17,198
six cents, let's go, we gotta go.

3081
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:19,818
No, no, let me close it.

3082
02:11:19,818 --> 02:11:22,205
You kind of missed, you missed the, yeah.

3083
02:11:22,205 --> 02:11:24,245
Vlog, but we love him.

3084
02:11:24,245 --> 02:11:27,392
A little bit more than D
Rock, slightly behind, what,

3085
02:11:27,392 --> 02:11:29,625
anyway, nonetheless, would love to get

3086
02:11:29,625 --> 02:11:32,079
your thoughts, would love
to get your two cents

3087
02:11:32,079 --> 02:11:33,839
on this keynote.

3088
02:11:33,839 --> 02:11:35,339
We'd love to get your
favorite quote, because

3089
02:11:35,339 --> 02:11:37,174
the team is starting to
suck and these Instagram

3090
02:11:37,174 --> 02:11:39,009
quotes, so now I need my community.

3091
02:11:39,009 --> 02:11:40,264
What was your favorite quote?

3092
02:11:40,264 --> 02:11:41,971
Actually, that's it, fuck your two cents.

3093
02:11:41,971 --> 02:11:44,580
What was your favorite
quote from this keynote?

3094
02:11:44,580 --> 00:00:00,000
(piano music)
