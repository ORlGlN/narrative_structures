1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:03,023
A vlog, this is a keynote,
my second keynote.

2
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:05,356
I gave two at ComplexCon and

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,176
this one had a lot of juice to it,

4
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:09,856
a lot of young entrepreneurship.

5
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:13,492
The framework of how I
see the game being played

6
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,315
right now and I hope you really enjoy it

7
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,803
and I'll talk to you soon.

8
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:20,470
(intense music)

9
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,670
(audience cheers and applauds)

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,825
Thank you, thank you.

11
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,289
Thank you, guys.

12
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:34,861
Appreciate you, how's everybody?

13
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,714
(crowd cheers)

14
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,279
Good,

15
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,369
so Ferg didn't make it this morning,

16
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,668
so we switched it to this afternoon.

17
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,814
Now Ferg's not making it again so,

18
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,395
he asked me to apologize on his behalf,

19
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:50,210
you know how rapper's do, so,

20
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,042
what I really wanna do,

21
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,697
the mic is set up here.

22
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:55,203
I'm gonna rant a little bit

23
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:58,354
but for a lot of you, I
know that a lot of you

24
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:01,289
know my two cents, my
spiel, I know a bunch

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,589
of you came through the booth,

26
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,589
so I wanna thank you so much for that.

27
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,827
I appreciate you supporting K-Swiss and I

28
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:09,418
but the mic's there, I highly recommend,

29
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:11,499
I'm probably gonna go into
it like 10 or 15 minutes,

30
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:12,967
so if you've got questions,

31
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,331
this is kind of the opportunity,

32
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:17,121
so feel free to start
lining up over there.

33
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,788
My man, that's not wasting time.

34
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:23,358
So cool, let me set up a
little bit of a framework

35
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:25,561
before we get into the Q and A,

36
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,598
talk about a little bit
what I wanna talk about.

37
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:31,790
First of all, it's super
amazing to be here because

38
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,357
just the vibe of this event
is a lot of fun for me

39
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:37,479
because, as some of you know,

40
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,573
I grew up a baseball card kid and

41
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:42,246
as soon as I walked
down to the convention,

42
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:44,519
I was like, oh shit, I know this flavor.

43
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,680
This was baseball cards, 1989, like,

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,639
the level of entrepreneurship
that I saw downstairs,

45
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:54,663
people literally wanting to
fight over their position

46
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:57,037
in line because they knew
they had to get a better one

47
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:59,633
to flip their shit, I respect that shit.

48
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,138
I know people are
frowning on the fighting,

49
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:02,893
I recommend it.

50
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:04,719
(audience laughs)

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,074
People are trying to eat, you know, so,

52
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,293
that was amazing and
just the level of culture

53
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:13,854
and more importantly,
I'm old, so I grew up

54
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:16,289
where everybody was kind
of divided when it came

55
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:18,552
to hip-hop and culture and everybody kind

56
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,347
of stayed in their own lanes,

57
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,487
just watching this generation
bleed into each other,

58
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,940
white, brown, yellow, black, green,

59
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,999
it's just fucking incredible and honestly,

60
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,574
people shit on millennials all the time.

61
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:33,390
I think some of you know
I'm like the reverse,

62
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,563
I think the fucking
millennials are the best.

63
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:39,070
I know nothing but lazy
people that are older,

64
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,429
so, maybe a little
entitlement just 'cause things

65
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,385
have been good so you
don't know the difference.

66
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:48,676
How many people under 30, raise your hand.

67
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:50,183
Right so, for all of you,

68
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:51,939
the big thing that you
need to keep in mind

69
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,188
is you haven't been punched
in the fucking mouth yet,

70
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:59,355
2008, 2001, 2000, 9/11,
the stock market crash,

71
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:03,783
the Bear Stearn shit, the
biggest thing that you

72
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,178
don't know yet is when
the whole economy crashes,

73
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:09,539
you go from being an
entrepreneur of a t-shirt company

74
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,539
to working at Bank of
America because the money

75
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,112
gets sucked out of the system so,

76
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,983
I'm not trying to frown on anything,

77
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:19,311
I'm trying to put everybody
in the right perspective.

78
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:21,746
Everybody under 30 here
understands it better,

79
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:24,101
the places that people pay attention to,

80
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,658
which is the only thing
I give a fuck about,

81
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:28,449
the way you guys
collaborate with each other

82
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:29,719
and have love for each other,

83
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,853
way better than ever before,

84
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:35,151
the only vulnerability
that this room has is

85
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:38,345
lack of blood pouring out of their mouth

86
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,085
and I mean that, 'cause
there's so much money

87
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:42,710
in the system, like it
feels normal to sell

88
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,207
shit through Instagram
until 20% more people

89
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:48,185
don't have money to spend
on stuff and then the

90
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,808
shit gets tight and so,

91
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,176
I highly recommend, where
I'm going with that,

92
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:54,998
is not like (groans), where
I'm going with that is

93
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:56,840
get practical.

94
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,751
A lot of people are just not practical.

95
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,046
A lot of people take in money,

96
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,474
instead of investing it
back into their business,

97
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:04,708
buying dumb shit.

98
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,829
There was a whole lot of dumb
shit buying downstairs today.

99
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,643
(audience laughs)

100
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:09,476
There was.

101
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,030
There was a bunch of
people that bought shit

102
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,465
to make money, that's good buying shit.

103
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:16,067
There's a lot of people
buying shit downstairs today

104
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:19,632
to close the gap on
insecurities that they have.

105
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:22,916
(audience cheers)

106
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,183
A lot of people bought
shit because they think

107
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:27,233
the logo on their hoodie or on their kicks

108
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,999
is gonna make them feel
better, but it's not

109
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:32,663
and it's gonna speed up
the process of you losing,

110
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,456
not the other way around so,

111
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:37,686
we need more practicality in
this space, that's for sure

112
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:41,907
but if you came to this
and clearly you did,

113
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,645
'cause we're here,

114
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:45,764
but I'm talking to the people watching,

115
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:48,788
if you came to this,
you're fucking so much more

116
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,120
ahead of people.

117
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,242
I was trying to tell people downstairs,

118
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:53,533
for a lot of you, you've
been fucking with this

119
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,392
kind of game, whether
it's hip-hop or sneakers

120
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:57,452
or street or urban, you've
been fucking with it,

121
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:59,685
probably maybe even your whole life, right

122
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,625
or maybe for a little while.

123
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,632
The number one thing and I'm gonna say it,

124
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:05,591
as an outsider, even though I fuck with it

125
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,868
and it fucks with me,

126
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:09,500
the number one thing that
you guys need to understand

127
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,733
is this shit hasn't even started yet.

128
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,509
Everything that's happening here is what

129
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:15,901
it's gonna be,

130
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,702
you think that's what it is right now

131
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:20,357
'cause that's your reality
because you haven't lived

132
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:22,965
in enough places, tasted
enough shit and been

133
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,910
in enough rooms.

134
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,895
For example, Nike's a big shot downstairs

135
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,600
but why do they spend 90%
of their advertising money

136
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,068
on dumb shit that you
don't pay attention to?

137
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,346
Why did Under Armour go
from being in the game

138
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:39,435
to being completely out of the game,

139
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:42,651
nobody gives a fuck
about Under Armour here.

140
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,671
How did that happen in 36 months?

141
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:47,095
'Cause they acted like Nike.

142
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:50,578
So, be real smart about what's going on.

143
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:51,896
Be real smart about what's going on,

144
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,482
I heard somebody say Durant,

145
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:55,447
fucking Under Armour was
sitting on Steph Curry

146
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:58,434
at the fucking apex, right,

147
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:01,115
Jordan Spieth at the apex,

148
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:04,241
they got Tom fucking piece
of shit Brady, right?

149
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:06,393
- [Audience Member] Take it easy.

150
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:07,488
I get it.

151
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:08,986
(audience laughs)

152
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:12,486
My man, this is me taking it easy, my man.

153
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,944
And so, and so they have
all that and you know

154
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,013
what they couldn't do?

155
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,084
The thing that comes natural
to everybody in this room.

156
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:24,110
They couldn't trade culture.

157
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,829
They put out piece of shit sneaker after

158
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,765
piece of shit sneaker,

159
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:29,677
they took for granted
where your attention was

160
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,504
and they thought if they're
gonna drop the Steph Curry's,

161
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:33,280
they're gonna do that as
a three minute commercial

162
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,721
during the NBS finals
and you guys were all off

163
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,014
watching the finals,
it went to commercial,

164
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:39,709
you took out your phone
and you're looking at

165
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,559
highlights at @dunk on Instagram,

166
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:43,747
not the fucking commercial.

167
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:44,985
People don't get it.

168
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:46,106
You get it.

169
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,577
Here's what you don't get.

170
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:49,823
You fucking lack patience.

171
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,478
All of you that just
came through my booth,

172
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,410
all your fucking questions,
they all came down

173
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,827
to the same shit.

174
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,408
Too many of you talk about being it,

175
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,313
but you're not living it.

176
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,006
You wanna be about patience and hustle,

177
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:04,039
it's fun to say to me, it's fun to tweet

178
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:06,140
that you're a fucking entrepreneur.

179
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,776
It's a lot harder to bleed
15 hours a day, everyday,

180
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,081
for 15 years.

181
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,279
One of my best friends in
the world, Dustin Sing,

182
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,671
fourth row back, that
man and I drove back from

183
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:19,171
Mount Ida College the day we left college.

184
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:22,868
We drove back, yapped it up, reminisced,

185
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,364
this was it, it was over,

186
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:27,621
reminisced, got to the parking
lot around 3:00 that day,

187
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:29,903
we hugged it out, he went on his way,

188
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:32,386
took a train, I walked
into the liquor store

189
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,257
as a 22 year old and I talked to that man

190
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:39,257
five to 15 times for the
next eight years, true?

191
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,238
It fucking worked, it was patient,

192
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,867
fucking bled, grinded, for real,

193
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,951
not, now it's made up my
narrative as an entrepreneur

194
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,725
and it's cool, I lived it.

195
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:52,893
There's not a lot of people that know it

196
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:54,923
but he does, he knows the truth.

197
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:57,558
He knows in college I went
fucking home every weekend

198
00:07:57,558 --> 00:08:00,285
on the Amtrak, not Acela,
I wasn't fancy back then

199
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:03,569
and fucking went and
worked and I'd come back.

200
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,207
I left for the weekends.

201
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:08,624
He also knows I didn't go to class, ever.

202
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:12,951
He was also phenomenal at video games.

203
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,260
He should be an E-Sports star,

204
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,427
but that's another story for another day.

205
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,403
Nonetheless, the bottom line is,

206
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:19,730
when people ask me
questions or when I talk

207
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,938
or things of that nature,

208
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:22,899
the difference is, I lived it.

209
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:25,566
I don't just talk about it and

210
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,258
I get why you don't wanna do it

211
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,166
and it comes from insecurity.

212
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,307
You're worried.

213
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,828
You know why you guys aren't patient?

214
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:35,147
'Cause you wanna win
already to fucking stick it

215
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,731
to your fucking parents, right?

216
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:42,825
The reason you're
impatient is less about you

217
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:44,601
wanting to buy certain shit,

218
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,437
though a lot of you are fucked
up on that bullshit game,

219
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:49,851
it's more because people
are telling you you can't,

220
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:52,018
you decide to do your
own thing and now you're

221
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,954
on the clock and everybody's
watching and your

222
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:56,808
grandma's telling you you
should have stayed in school

223
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,980
but you've gotta understand,

224
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,104
it doesn't matter if you
win in the first half,

225
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:04,600
it doesn't matter if you're up 17

226
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,767
going into the 4th quarter,

227
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,421
you've gotta win the actual game.

228
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:12,331
You need to be shit on
in your 20s and 30s,

229
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,279
so then you can fucking
clown on people in your 40s

230
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,256
and I tell them I fucking told you.

231
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,305
You understand?

232
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:20,914
(audience applauds)

233
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:25,041
And the best part is you
gotta love the fucking losses.

234
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,289
Do you know how happy I am right now

235
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,918
that they put a c before
the k in my last name

236
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:29,975
and misspelled it?

237
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:32,252
(audience laughs)

238
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,045
I'm being dead serious.

239
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:36,227
This is going great, I
love your admiration,

240
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,091
the number one thing I'm excited about

241
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,052
right this fucking second onstage,

242
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:41,611
is they misspelled my fucking name.

243
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:44,179
(audience laughs)

244
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:45,340
'Cause I look at that and I'm like yes,

245
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,090
'cause I love losing.

246
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:50,353
You know why I gave up on
the Rangers and the Yankees?

247
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:51,585
'Cause they won championships.

248
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,126
You know why I fuck with
the Jets and the Knicks?

249
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,459
'Cause they suck

250
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:57,173
and that is the fundamental difference

251
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:58,506
and I promise you, my friends,

252
00:09:58,506 --> 00:09:59,904
it's binary.

253
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:02,696
This whole thing, your
fucking life if binary.

254
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:05,555
It's a one or a zero, it
is black or is it white,

255
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,934
you are either gaining
or you're declining.

256
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,534
There is no in between,
you're not kind of passive

257
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:12,486
right now, you're not
kind of in the middle,

258
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,864
you're either winning
or you're losing, right,

259
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,532
and you've gotta understand
that all the things

260
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:20,400
that you want, of course
they should be hard.

261
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,366
Do you understand the
audacity, do you understand

262
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:25,437
that if you make $400,000 a year,

263
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,039
that means you've entered

264
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,372
the top 1% earners in this country?

265
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:33,643
People talking about millions as like,

266
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:36,503
I gotta make a million as an entry point

267
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,278
and they don't even
understand that 99% of people

268
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,445
in America don't make $400,000 a year.

269
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,599
We've got the whole game mis-framed.

270
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,668
Everybody confused.

271
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,420
Let me tell you what you should focus on.

272
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,419
A, you need to do some shit you like,

273
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,108
'cause if you don't,

274
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:57,032
you will be outworked by
somebody who loves that thing

275
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,949
and they will beat you.

276
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:01,893
Uh-huh, that's the problem.

277
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:03,396
If you don't love it,

278
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,366
somebody will beat you
because they love it

279
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,316
and that means they'll work 18 hours a day

280
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,241
'cause you fucking love it

281
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:12,357
and you're working 11
'cause you like the money

282
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:15,748
that comes along with it
or eight or supposedly

283
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:17,846
you're working 10 but it's really four

284
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:20,273
and you're bullshitting and
watching YouTube for six

285
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:24,440
and so, I am confused by
people's inability to be humble,

286
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:29,758
especially this audience
and I'm stereotyping

287
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,741
but let me tell you something
that's pissing me off

288
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:33,761
that is the great advantage

289
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,844
of the collective culture downstairs.

290
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:39,917
I think the reason I'm patient and I think

291
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,773
all the strengths I have
about all the things

292
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:44,537
I'm preaching right now is
'cause when you don't come

293
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,870
from much, you already know.

294
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:50,469
You already know that you can be happy if

295
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:51,827
you have a good household.

296
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,742
You already know that you don't
need a whole lot of stuff.

297
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:56,748
You already know one nice
pair of kicks is enough

298
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:58,314
if you can't afford another.

299
00:11:58,314 --> 00:12:00,049
You already know.

300
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:04,072
In life, you have two situations, binary

301
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:08,239
and they're both winning formulas
or they're losing formulas

302
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:11,485
and they start the same way.

303
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:13,006
You were born

304
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:15,246
and you were either born with too much

305
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:17,841
'cause your parents are
rich and they got shit,

306
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:19,580
like my kids,

307
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,507
or your born with too little,

308
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,800
the way I was born in a
fucking piece of shit house

309
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,303
in Belarus in Russia, right?

310
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:27,751
That's it.

311
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:29,849
You're either born with
too much or too little

312
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,099
and boths are strengths and weaknesses.

313
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:37,195
You're fucking mindset decides it.

314
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:42,005
I sit in rooms everyday
and you guys know I love

315
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:44,925
to sit with kids and jam and do shit,

316
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,474
almost everyday I have a
situation, every month,

317
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,738
I will meet at least one
person that's gonna cry to me

318
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:53,058
that they don't have
anything and it's hard

319
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:56,069
and they didn't get lucky
and they got nothing

320
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:59,328
and it's hard and then I
will equally have dinner

321
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,928
with somebody else who
will tell me that it's hard

322
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,508
and difficult, happened today downstairs

323
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:07,190
because they had too much.

324
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,482
They're not hungry 'cause their parents

325
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:09,746
did everything for them.

326
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:11,548
Their mom and dad fucked them up because

327
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:13,216
they gave them too much,

328
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:14,761
which the people that have nothing,

329
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,276
a bunch of you just sat,

330
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:18,836
I have people who have 50
million dollar trust funds

331
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:21,177
cry to me at dinner that their life sucks

332
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:23,991
because they've never fought for anything.

333
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:26,579
They never did anything and
they don't have any purpose

334
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,745
and they're lost and they're suicidal,

335
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:31,177
which, the people in here
that were born with nothing

336
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,622
are like, fuck you.

337
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:34,983
(audience laughs)

338
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:36,289
Right?

339
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,180
A bunch of you are like, fuck that, right?

340
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,969
It's 'cause you don't
know the alternative.

341
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:43,434
Everybody's pointing at everybody else

342
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:44,681
without understanding.

343
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:47,141
Nobody's deploying empathy.

344
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:49,383
Nobody's deploying empathy.

345
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:52,270
Everybody's worried
about what's their issue,

346
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,175
without realizing everybody's
got fucking issues.

347
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:57,390
My friends, let just get to the punchline.

348
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,041
Nobody gives a fuck about your problems.

349
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,908
Nobody gives a fuck about
your problems because either,

350
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,406
it's true,

351
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:10,995
either, either, they've got
their own fucking problems,

352
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:14,264
or they're just focused on some other shit

353
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:17,170
but they can't empathize with
you and more importantly,

354
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,408
if you think that somebody
owes you something

355
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:21,115
'cause you started at a disadvantage,

356
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,032
you're a fucking loser.

357
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:27,194
You have to understand,
that's your advantage.

358
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:29,337
Who do you think fucking rises and wins?

359
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:30,832
Have you guys paid attention to what's

360
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:32,903
actually happening on Earth?

361
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:35,359
Have you guys paid attention
to who actually wins?

362
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,067
It's fuckers that had nothing,

363
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,830
that had motivation to get something.

364
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,381
We don't fucking know
stories about he had this

365
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:45,260
and then all of a sudden he made it big,

366
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,849
nobody gives a fuck about that story.

367
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:50,135
There's no glory in that
story and guess what?

368
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,701
That story doesn't exist a whole lot.

369
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,874
You've got a lot of second
generation people doing stuff,

370
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:55,892
but by the third generation, everybody got

371
00:14:55,892 --> 00:14:59,108
so fucking soft, they're
even doing non-profits

372
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,111
all the time or they wasted all the money.

373
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:03,686
(audience laughs)

374
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,457
I just ask you, would you much rather

375
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,478
do you know I used to cry
in college 'cause my dad

376
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:09,140
had a liquor store and I was like,

377
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,195
nobody's ever gonna give
me credit because they're

378
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:12,673
gonna always think I got like,

379
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:14,498
I was upset that there
was a little something

380
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,975
and he was around, he knows,

381
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,766
it's not what everybody
wants it to be when

382
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,214
they're fucking coming
up with excuses why I won

383
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:25,864
and they didn't, I won 'cause
I fucking outworked you.

384
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,622
I won because I had enough
self-awareness to understand

385
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,315
what I was good at.

386
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:31,873
There's a lot of shit I wish I was,

387
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:33,549
I just figured out what
I was and what I liked

388
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,632
and then I just fucking outworked you

389
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:41,613
and I will always outwork
out because I love the game

390
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:43,280
more than the stuff.

391
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:45,985
You just have to understand that.

392
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:47,544
When you fucking love it,

393
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:49,709
you can't beat me because
I wanna do it every second

394
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,752
that I'm breathing and so I need people

395
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,579
to get to that place.

396
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,412
The reason I'm doing
everything I'm doing right now

397
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:59,639
that you're paying
attention to is 'cause I'm

398
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,442
trying to become your excuse, your shield,

399
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:06,320
your thing that you can point to

400
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,333
because if you trip and fall,

401
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,697
you guys are worried about failing

402
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:12,760
and I'm trying to get you to point at me

403
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,802
and blame me that it didn't
work versus blaming yourself

404
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:17,760
so that it gives you
the courage to actually

405
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,177
start doing shit.

406
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,435
The only way you're gonna
get the thing that's

407
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:23,791
been running through your mind,

408
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,279
the only way you're
gonna get on that plane

409
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,049
that you think you wanna be on

410
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,242
when you were sitting
downstairs eating french fries

411
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:31,089
with your homie and
chopping it up and saying

412
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:33,217
what we're gonna be in seven years,

413
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:35,478
is if you fucking outwork everybody,

414
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,348
figure out what you're good at,

415
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:39,921
bring value to the people
you're trying to sell

416
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:43,754
and just rinse and repeat
forever till the end

417
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:47,540
and so everybody looks at
the people that made it.

418
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,085
(audience member sneezes)

419
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:50,424
Bless you, everybody looks
at the people that made it

420
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:53,917
and none of you looked
at how they got there,

421
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:55,167
simple as that.

422
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,407
Everybody in this room, I promise you,

423
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:01,128
my superpower is empathy.

424
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:02,292
I never make--

425
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,302
- [Audience Member] It's true.

426
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,135
It's true.

427
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:07,938
(muffled speaking by audience member)

428
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:09,503
It's because, my man, I
don't think my employees

429
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:12,212
should work as hard as I do and a bunch of

430
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:15,579
dumb fucking business people do.

431
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,087
If my employees should
work as hard as I do,

432
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,810
they should have as much equity as I do.

433
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,490
How the fuck do you want somebody to work

434
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,688
for as much as you do when it's yours,

435
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:27,688
you fucking audacious piece of shit?

436
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:30,803
I have empathy, I don't
know what's going on.

437
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:33,632
If you're not performing, it
might not be work-related,

438
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:36,363
your grandma might be sick,

439
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:39,065
I'm empathetic, that's
why I'm a great salesman.

440
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:40,710
You know why I can sell you anything?

441
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,906
'Cause I think about you first.

442
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,914
I'm not worried about what's in it for me,

443
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,713
I'm trying to figure
out what's in it for you

444
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:48,902
and then give you more
than you even expected,

445
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,058
I'm trying to guilt you
fuckers into my shit.

446
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:54,152
(audience laughs)

447
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:56,742
And that's it and that's
why I fucking put scrutiny

448
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,875
on everybody who's trying
to do courses and prerolls,

449
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,782
trying to get you to pay 4,000 for this

450
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,027
and 10,000 for that and all this.

451
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:04,596
This shit is simple.

452
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:07,450
All the information is
free, you don't need any

453
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,469
of that other shit.

454
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:09,706
It's fucking free.

455
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:13,289
People are paying for shit
to make them feel better

456
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,433
about not doing shit.

457
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,581
Let me say it again.

458
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:19,034
Watch this, how many of you,
when you first came across me,

459
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:20,953
don't lie, lying is the devil,

460
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:24,322
how many of you, when
you first came across me,

461
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:28,077
said fuck this guy, I hate
this guy, raise your hands.

462
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:29,327
Raise 'em high.

463
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,539
You know why?

464
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,372
I was suffocating you.

465
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:36,617
I was suffocating your fucking excuses.

466
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,327
There's a lot of people who's
much rather, much rather,

467
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,075
pay somebody to make
them feel good about why

468
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,157
they're not doing 'cause
there's some so fucking secret

469
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,528
process that's gonna get you on.

470
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,542
Let me give you the secret,
once and for all, right here.

471
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:55,542
Work, a lot, based on
what your mouth is saying.

472
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:59,361
You wanna be a millionaire?

473
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:01,961
You need to become a workaholic.

474
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:03,064
Right?

475
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:05,138
You wanna have a good work/life
balance and great family

476
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:07,282
and be on the softball
team and raise your kids

477
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:11,042
and make 100 thousand, let
me just say it real quick,

478
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:13,924
that's a ridiculous life,
making a 100 thousand,

479
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:15,098
that's a ridiculous life,

480
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,825
and like 47 thousand, and see your kids,

481
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,855
and do you thing and
be happy, that's great

482
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:23,105
but don't talk shit, talk your reality.

483
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,148
Talk your truth, create a framework

484
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,000
that you can fucking follow

485
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,859
because the only people
listening to your excuses

486
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:34,579
or your bullshit are your
loser fucking friends

487
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:36,960
and you've got to, it's true, man,

488
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,542
people sit in little
circles with four people,

489
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,600
everybody gassing each
other up to not do shit.

490
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,433
(audience laughs)

491
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:48,014
It's true, I'm watching,
I'm watching all of you,

492
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:50,290
I was downstairs taking
selfies, signing shoes

493
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,673
and watching and listening.

494
00:19:52,673 --> 00:19:55,327
I listen real fucking careful,
I watch you real quick,

495
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,699
nobody, nobody is putting
on marathon sneakers,

496
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,720
everybody wants to be sprinter.

497
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,231
Everybody wants it tomorrow

498
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:04,314
and I get it.

499
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:07,757
It seems like it's real
delicious over there

500
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,412
but let me tell you what
happens when you start

501
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:12,125
getting higher and higher
and Diddy said it right,

502
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,481
more money, more problems is real.

503
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,171
You wanna have a million dollar business

504
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:17,947
that you're the CEO and
the entrepreneur of?

505
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:19,309
Let me tell you what happens.

506
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,186
You're eating shit for a living.

507
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,773
You're a firefighter.

508
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:24,146
I'm about to get off this stage right now

509
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:27,395
and there's seven things I
gotta fix, problems, issues,

510
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:31,817
so, grass is fucking
greener until you live it

511
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,161
and so, if you leave with anything,

512
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,967
let's break down the core
things and then we'll

513
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,062
get into Q and A.

514
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:37,443
Number one, first and foremost,

515
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:39,764
we need to put empathy on a pedestal.

516
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:42,043
It is the fucking trait.

517
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:44,113
You know what's fun for me?

518
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:47,238
I'm all alpha and
competitive and dude it out,

519
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:50,858
the shit I believe in is
the most emotional, crying,

520
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:54,624
real things, girly, as
people try to tell me,

521
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:57,124
it's not girly, it's strength.

522
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,546
Do you know what happens
when you expect nothing

523
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:02,546
from nobody?

524
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:05,104
Do you know what it
feels like to live a life

525
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:07,721
when you just give, give,
give and you never ask

526
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,631
for anything in return?

527
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:11,786
Do you know what it feels
like to, in every situation,

528
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,862
think about how the
other person's feelings,

529
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:16,889
even if they're fucking you up?

530
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,660
Right, what was it, Bronx
Tale where the guy was like,

531
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,840
is that the movie where he's like,

532
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,686
you're better off, it
only costs you 20 bucks?

533
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:24,865
I believe in that shit.

534
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:27,545
That fucking scene was
legit, that's right.

535
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,820
You know how people
sitting here still dwelling

536
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,888
about some dumb shit
that happened in 2011?

537
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:34,712
(audience laughs)

538
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:36,863
Like, it's a fact, man.

539
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:39,855
People send me emails, like,
my mom stole $50 from me

540
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:44,214
in 2013, I'm like,
cool, I'll send you $50,

541
00:21:44,214 --> 00:21:45,377
shut the fuck up.

542
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:46,592
(audience laughs)

543
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:48,358
These are the DM's I'm getting.

544
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:50,058
My best friend's not
working as hard as me,

545
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,222
cool, split up and let's see who wins.

546
00:21:53,222 --> 00:21:55,384
Everybody knows the answers,

547
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:57,313
people just don't wanna do shit.

548
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:59,929
Even as I'm standing here, I'm like, fuck,

549
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,403
why am I talking about anything else,

550
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,007
people don't wanna do it.

551
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:05,803
People are gonna come up with
a million different reasons

552
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:08,274
why they can't and that's
why the next pillar

553
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:09,496
matters to me the most.

554
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,839
You know why I have so much energy?

555
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,488
You know I've been going
the whole time here?

556
00:22:12,488 --> 00:22:16,671
I'm grateful, gratitude
and I've been grateful

557
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:18,790
from the get, not 'cause I got stuff now,

558
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,440
I was grateful when I was
building my dad's liquor store

559
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,948
for him, making $31,000 a
year, having no social life.

560
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:28,229
I was grateful because I
was conditioned and was in

561
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:30,251
a place that I was paying
back my parents for

562
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:32,040
putting me on, right?

563
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,336
I'm grateful everyday when
I wake up and people I

564
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:37,841
care about aren't stick.

565
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:39,508
I just don't get it.

566
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:42,447
Why do people start caring
about the shit that matters

567
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,106
when they get scared?

568
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:46,145
Everybody's living life, you
know like when you're driving

569
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:48,587
and the cop lights go on and
then your fucking heart goes

570
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:50,478
but then when the cop drives by,

571
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:52,825
you're like (sighs), you feel real good

572
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,307
and then you start driving with two hands

573
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,006
and the speed limit for about four minutes

574
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:58,792
and then you go back to
being like ridiculous?

575
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,477
That's how people are living their lives.

576
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:03,939
Like Grandma gets sick
or Mom has a cancer scare

577
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,913
or they get sick or
something and then they

578
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:07,660
start caring about real shit.

579
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,039
Nobody's giving a fuck
about a Supreme backpack

580
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:13,122
when your health isn't going anywhere

581
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:16,234
and so I just don't understand why people

582
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,464
are living their lives like that

583
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,811
and so, fucking gratitude.

584
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:24,735
Whatever you got, listen,
if you could afford $90

585
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:29,483
or $60 or whatever the fuck
you paid for this conference,

586
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:32,127
you are so much further
along than the majority

587
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:34,999
of the Earth, you just haven't
put the right perspective

588
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:35,832
in place.

589
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,412
You have not put the right
perspective in place.

590
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:44,025
People complaining downstairs
wearing $213 shoes.

591
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:46,215
Shut the fuck up.

592
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:47,824
Get perspective.

593
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:49,740
What the fuck do you think
is going on in the world?

594
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,569
Get out of your fucking bubble.

595
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:54,190
People talking about being in
the 'hood and they're like,

596
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,907
then I start poking and they're like,

597
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:59,324
in lower middle class, right, in America,

598
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,086
with the fucking internet,
do you guys understand

599
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:05,432
that you have a fucking
thing on you that is more

600
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:07,856
powerful than fucking
every media company had

601
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:11,939
fucking 25, 30 years ago,
in your fucking pocket?

602
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:17,544
We could just laugh about,
listen, I could go on forever.

603
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:20,551
People are lacking gratitude,
people are lacking empathy,

604
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:21,598
you know why people like me?

605
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:23,681
'Cause I like them first.

606
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:27,297
That's it and so everybody's
watching what I'm doing

607
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:28,592
and this and that,

608
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,695
and then I'm saying things and
you guys are really helping,

609
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:32,216
you guys are like my Puff Daddy,

610
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:33,677
the hmms are coming in.

611
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:34,865
(audience laughs)

612
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:36,969
You're feeding me, keep
doing it, I love it,

613
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:39,345
I'm like, I was about to
sit down but those hmms

614
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,617
are like, oh shit, I
better say something else

615
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:41,972
fucking fresh.

616
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:45,177
I need a couple more hmms
before I sit the fuck down.

617
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:46,659
I'm gonna come up with
a little more fresh.

618
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,839
(audience applauds)

619
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,323
And everybody hears this and listen,

620
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,944
some of you have been consuming
this for a year or two,

621
00:24:51,944 --> 00:24:53,374
you watched those videos
on Instagram or YouTube,

622
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:55,301
you've watched my vlog or this and that,

623
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:57,185
you listen to podcasts, you get hyped,

624
00:24:57,185 --> 00:25:00,371
you get hyped and you're like right

625
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:02,153
and then you stop
listening and you walk out

626
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:05,011
into your real life and
you go back to dumb shit.

627
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:06,547
Here's why.

628
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,579
A lot of that stuff happened early.

629
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:10,313
Where you grew up, how you were raised,

630
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:11,611
biggest problem is,

631
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,505
if you have parents that are pessimistic,

632
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:16,222
misery loves company,
it's hard to break that.

633
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:18,245
It's hard to face the fact that your mom

634
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:20,770
wants you to actually lose.

635
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,673
She doesn't realize it,
you know that, right?

636
00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:24,415
Your mom doesn't want you to lose,

637
00:25:24,415 --> 00:25:25,906
it's her framework.

638
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:27,673
I watched my grandma, it's true,

639
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,688
I watched my grandma parent my dad,

640
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:31,071
well, I didn't watch her parent my dad

641
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,277
but I watched a lot of shit.

642
00:25:32,277 --> 00:25:34,190
I watch what my mom did with me,

643
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,715
I watch other people like

644
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:38,051
your mom fucked you up.

645
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,184
Your dad fucked you up.

646
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:42,641
That's real but you've got to understand,

647
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,829
instead of sitting here and
dwelling and blaming them,

648
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:47,302
you're in control of your own shit.

649
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:49,978
You got one fucking at bat,

650
00:25:49,978 --> 00:25:53,328
do something with it and now, honestly,

651
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:56,209
now that you have this, guys,

652
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:58,829
do you understand why Harvey
Weinstein and Kevin Spacey

653
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,342
are getting called out?

654
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:03,474
It's because the internet
is now the middleman,

655
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:07,641
not five to 10 media companies
run by 10 old white guys.

656
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:10,530
You can tell me anything
you want about Trump this

657
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,272
or this, that or the other thing,

658
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,764
you're missing the point.

659
00:26:14,764 --> 00:26:16,166
You're missing the point.

660
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:19,392
You know why Champion
can come back real quick?

661
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:21,765
'Cause they did the
right shit for 24 months.

662
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:23,957
You know why everybody
wears fucking Stan Smith's?

663
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,992
'Cause they put them on
cute girls on Instagram

664
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:27,455
three years ago.

665
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:30,132
You know why people drink
LaCroix fucking sparking water?

666
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,134
'Cause they spent their
money on Instagram.

667
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:34,215
You know why Under Armour isn't winning?

668
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:35,809
'Cause they didn't.

669
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:37,645
I'm not mad at Under
Armour, I'm just using it

670
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:39,206
'cause you just lived the last five years

671
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,414
and watched which brands
won and which ones didn't

672
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:44,116
and so like, it's funny
to me just watching it,

673
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:46,581
you get it, you got the part that matters,

674
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:47,941
you get it.

675
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,353
What, you think Under Armour
and Nike wanted Adidas

676
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:53,229
and Supreme and all
these things to happen?

677
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:54,411
They didn't.

678
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:55,819
They just did the wrong shit.

679
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:57,070
You know why?

680
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,445
They took their spot for granted.

681
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:02,888
They just took it for granted

682
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,984
and that made the vulnerability
and now, it's over.

683
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:08,502
Just so everybody knows,
just like the internet,

684
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,722
this whole culture, fashion, street,

685
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:12,509
all that, it's over.

686
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:15,380
My K-Swiss deal with Barney
and Patrick and those guys,

687
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,962
that's the preview, not the anomaly.

688
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:20,297
Every brand's about to do
collaborations with things

689
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:22,942
that matter, forever and ever and that's

690
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,167
where the equity is.

691
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:26,491
Yeah, there might be a
Jordan and a couple things

692
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,324
in sports but in life,

693
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:32,126
there's unlimited
opportunities and everybody's

694
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:35,543
starting to kind of figure it out and so,

695
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,661
huge opportunity in this space,

696
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,465
huge opportunity in everything,

697
00:27:40,465 --> 00:27:45,221
the problem is, do you have
the next pillar, number three,

698
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:47,804
which is, do you have humility?

699
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:50,538
Do you have humility?

700
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:53,943
Andy K, you here?

701
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:57,098
Yo, check your DM because
I just engaged with

702
00:27:57,098 --> 00:27:59,765
two influencers on our
sneaker thing while I was

703
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,688
in the backroom one second
before I came out here.

704
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,521
Thank you.

705
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:08,610
Because I'm still back
there with the humility

706
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,945
of thinking somebody
who's got 47,000 followers

707
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:13,251
on Instagram, that it might do something

708
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:15,468
for my K-Swiss joint, that
I'm willing to personally

709
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:17,828
write it and be like, hey,
you wanna do something

710
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:21,445
and people here that got
nothing, aren't even started,

711
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:24,672
aren't willing to DM
a hundred people a day

712
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:27,268
'cause you're fucking fancy
and you think you're somebody

713
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:29,798
and guess what, you haven't even started,

714
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:31,519
no one even knows who the fuck you are.

715
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,109
I'm confused as fuck by that.

716
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,155
Do you have humility?

717
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:40,528
Do you have the humility to put
in the fucking work, period.

718
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:42,313
Everybody's trying to graduate

719
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:46,420
into some place, my
friends, the bigger you get,

720
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,338
the more you have to work for them.

721
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:51,421
I have 800 bosses, not 800 employees.

722
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:54,233
I work for everybody at VaynorMedia,

723
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,191
not the other way around.

724
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:57,544
You've got it twisted.

725
00:28:57,544 --> 00:28:59,516
This world that you think exists doesn't,

726
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:02,105
for the people really out there doing it,

727
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:04,762
not playing it on YouTube,

728
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:06,786
you've got to figure out
what's really happening.

729
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,940
You need to wake up and you need to put in

730
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,137
the fucking empathy for
your audience because

731
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:12,382
you'll never make a good product,

732
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:14,655
never sell shit unless
you actually worry about

733
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,912
them being happy with it.

734
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:18,982
You need to put in real
gratitude that you're even

735
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:20,809
lucky enough, do you
understand your grandparents,

736
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,504
think about your fucking grandparents,

737
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:23,944
they didn't have no internet.

738
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:26,539
They had to work the job and go to sleep.

739
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,858
The fact that you can
work your nine to five

740
00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:29,656
to pay off your debt or
pay your rent or take

741
00:29:29,656 --> 00:29:31,373
care of what you can
have to and then you can

742
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:33,227
take out your phone and fucking work from

743
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:36,130
7PM to two in the morning,
that's a fucking blessing.

744
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,745
That's a fucking opportunity
and nobody can stop you

745
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:41,892
and nobody decides but
us, it's fucking crazy.

746
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,189
So you better start really
fucking deploying gratitude

747
00:29:44,189 --> 00:29:47,206
and everybody, change your
fucking mindset today.

748
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:49,389
Make this the fucking talk
that changes your mindset.

749
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:51,651
Stop fucking bitching, nobody's listening,

750
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:53,631
nobody gives a fuck, stop expecting shit

751
00:29:53,631 --> 00:29:56,666
and go fucking take yours
by doing the last part,

752
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,556
which is having number
three, the fucking humility

753
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:02,959
to put in the fucking
work because if you don't,

754
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:05,855
somebody with real fucking
chops is going to deploy it

755
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:08,105
and take yours, understood?

756
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:10,586
(audience murmurs yes)

757
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:11,419
Cool.

758
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:14,419
(audience applauds)

759
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,561
Now, now that you've got your mind right,

760
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:23,330
it's about one thing,

761
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,536
understand where the attention
is and make shit for it.

762
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,053
Everything I've been kind
of nuanced over there

763
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:32,720
about the Under Armour
and Champion thing is

764
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,791
if you would have told

765
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:41,955
anybody in business 24 months ago that at

766
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:46,632
ComplexCon, where thousands
of kids that are cool

767
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:50,384
are hanging out, that more
of them would be wearing

768
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:53,301
Champion product than Under Armour,

769
00:30:54,845 --> 00:30:57,253
you would have been laughed
out the fucking room.

770
00:30:57,253 --> 00:30:59,086
That took two minutes.

771
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:03,153
That's why attention is so important.

772
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,385
Attention's so important
because if you're not smart

773
00:31:06,385 --> 00:31:08,896
about it, you will lose.

774
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:11,319
When MTV came out, they went
to the biggest rock bands

775
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,146
in the world and they
asked them to make videos

776
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:18,437
and most of them said no
because they weren't willing

777
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:22,154
to give away free music and
they were playing stadiums

778
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:25,597
and getting paid and 36 months later,

779
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:28,453
nobody gave a fuck about
them and they gave a fuck

780
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:32,061
about Madonna and Michael
Jackson and Rod Stewart

781
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:35,847
and Duran Duran and
whoever made shit for it.

782
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:38,834
Our MTV sits in this place,

783
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,704
our MTV comes across in
four or five platforms,

784
00:31:41,704 --> 00:31:44,935
Instagram and Snapchat, right?

785
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:49,031
Instagram and Snapchat are
MTV and BET, you understand,

786
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,639
except it's not 1992 anymore

787
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:54,012
and so what you are trying to do everyday

788
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,593
is become the TRL, right,

789
00:31:56,593 --> 00:32:00,050
you're trying to become the
show and every one of you

790
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:03,871
can do it and it doesn't
cost you any money.

791
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:05,743
The problem is, most of
you are losing because

792
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:07,452
you're fronting on your content because

793
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:09,174
you're not willing to be
authentic 'cause you think

794
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,802
you gotta play a part

795
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:13,312
and the ironic thing is,
all the magic is in the shit

796
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,479
that is corny, it just is,

797
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:19,524
because you all look the same.

798
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:24,138
If you're all playing
up to the same standards

799
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:25,989
of what's cool and what's
good and what's good content,

800
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:28,395
you end up all looking the same.

801
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:31,307
(audience member mumbles)

802
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:35,621
100% my man, I mean, I now
have declared every single

803
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,540
human on Earth ridiculously hot because

804
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,797
everybody's figured
out angles and lighting

805
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:43,094
and filters and I go on
fucking Instagram, I'm like,

806
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,390
fuck, everyone's hot.

807
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,171
(audience laughs)

808
00:32:47,171 --> 00:32:50,256
How are you a point of
differentiation if you know

809
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:52,393
how to kick up your heel
and kick your ass out

810
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:56,560
and that's all you see for 74
people in a row in your feed?

811
00:32:57,446 --> 00:33:00,491
I don't know your fucking name

812
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:02,559
and every dude's doing the same dumb shit,

813
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,956
like taking off their, it's the same shit,

814
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:09,107
whatever it is, whatever
it is all the shit

815
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:12,782
that got me to where I was
was I never gave a fuck

816
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,962
about you, I was never
going to pander to what

817
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:18,223
you decided at that moment was cool.

818
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:20,157
I was gonna live my life
and then I got lucky

819
00:33:20,157 --> 00:33:22,456
and it stumbled into entrepreneurship

820
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:24,287
getting a little cooler.

821
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:26,013
Everything that's gonna make your shit pop

822
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:29,281
is in the stuff that your
parents and your sister

823
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:33,373
knows about you but not
even your best friend.

824
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:37,776
The corny shit in your
stomach is the magic,

825
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:40,712
you just need to share it with the world.

826
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:42,374
Please think about that

827
00:33:42,374 --> 00:33:44,523
because everything else becomes noise

828
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,989
but your real personality, your nuance,

829
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:49,621
that's the only currency
you can trade on 'cause

830
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:52,572
that's the only thing not replicable.

831
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,126
Got it?

832
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,050
Like the video I posted
just now, right now,

833
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,890
that's doing super well about like,

834
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,435
fuck up on purpose, you guys see this?

835
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:02,848
In it, my voice got so high,

836
00:34:02,848 --> 00:34:04,265
you saw that?

837
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:05,260
How many of you saw that?

838
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,676
Everybody in the comments like,

839
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,447
yo, fuck this Mickey Mouse pussy shit.

840
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,532
(audience laughs)

841
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:13,815
And I read it and I
click on it and the guy's

842
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:17,023
living at home with 106
followers and I reply

843
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:21,304
to him like, that Mickey
Mouse shit is why this won.

844
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:25,337
The nuance, be you, be
fucking you 'cause it's

845
00:34:25,337 --> 00:34:29,107
the only shot you got
at beating somebody else

846
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:31,688
and I'm very proud of this space,

847
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:34,322
this space, culture, street, hip hop,

848
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,592
was a space when I was a kid,

849
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:39,402
that rappers made of their origin story

850
00:34:39,402 --> 00:34:41,486
because if they grew up
in a middle class family,

851
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:44,154
the market wouldn't accept them.

852
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,732
People made up their shit,

853
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:50,518
they once visited their uncle in Compton

854
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:53,101
and like, yo, I'm from Compton.

855
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:56,370
I'm so proud of this
space that now we accept

856
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,460
regardless of the angle, skin tone,

857
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,261
it's incredible what you
guys have done with it,

858
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:04,544
so you can't be scared
of anything, just be you.

859
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:06,297
It's all you got.

860
00:35:06,297 --> 00:35:07,328
Thank you.

861
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:10,341
(audience applauds)

862
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,341
Let's do it.

863
00:35:14,658 --> 00:35:15,712
- [Audience Member] What's up, Gary.

864
00:35:15,712 --> 00:35:16,553
I just want to say thank you.

865
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:17,424
Yo, for the two guys leaving,

866
00:35:17,424 --> 00:35:19,237
this is the best fucking part.

867
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:20,818
The Q and A's where the fire is.

868
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,403
This is gonna be the best question too.

869
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:23,949
I know you were in Oslo
just a few days ago

870
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:24,782
and now you're here,

871
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:26,985
I know my parents never
had this communication,

872
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:29,377
so I just want to say
thank you for giving back,

873
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,271
when we didn't, like my
parents never had this

874
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:32,775
and we have this now, it's awesome.

875
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,960
So, my question's kind of

876
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,592
left side, I don't know but,

877
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,840
I don't really get to have this,

878
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,469
so entrepreneurs that are making it,

879
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:40,577
that have a lot of success,

880
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:41,753
let's say you become a multimillionaire,

881
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:43,201
so I'm gonna use you for an example,

882
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,173
it's like a marriage question but

883
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:47,551
how do you, not balance but,

884
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:50,846
if you make it, how effed
up is your family life,

885
00:35:50,846 --> 00:35:52,507
like bouncing it with your wife?

886
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:54,724
It just depends on who
you're fucking with, right?

887
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:56,237
Like it depends on who your partners are.

888
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,365
You got to over-communicate.

889
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:59,242
Everybody wants different shit.

890
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,972
Like, it could be really fucked up.

891
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,573
Or your kids are like, hey dad,

892
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:04,117
why aren't you ever
home, I know you're out

893
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:05,036
spending time with--

894
00:36:05,036 --> 00:36:05,869
My dad was never home.

895
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:06,809
I didn't see him until I was 15

896
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:08,311
and dragged into his
liquor store and we had

897
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:09,529
the best relationship ever and I love him

898
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:11,029
with all my heart.

899
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:15,166
Like, guys, the current state
of political correctness

900
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,738
and how you should parent,
how you should live,

901
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:18,887
what age you should get married at,

902
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,554
that's all bullshit.

903
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,420
There's only one story, yours.

904
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,066
You need to communicate
with the people you give

905
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:31,757
a shit about in your inner
circle and the next circle,

906
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:34,339
there's people that are
home nine to five everyday

907
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:35,922
that are fucked up.

908
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,896
There's people that spend
everyday with their spouse,

909
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:41,854
everyday, they both
work in the home office,

910
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:43,312
and they're gonna get
divorced in nine minutes

911
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:44,819
'cause it's fucked up.

912
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:47,143
There's no right size fits all.

913
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:49,566
Let me tell you how you
really solve what you're

914
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,922
trying to say.

915
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:54,082
You guys wanna be selfless
and be good and give back?

916
00:36:54,082 --> 00:36:55,991
Be selfish first and get
your shit to the place

917
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:57,741
where you need to be.

918
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:01,587
So when you were like in the
process of getting married,

919
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,746
were you like, hey dude, I'm gonna be.

920
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,144
Yes, I looked at her and said hey dude.

921
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:06,524
(audience laughs)

922
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,559
No but like, real quick.

923
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,422
I'm just using your, I was
like, I'm gonna buy the Jets

924
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:13,600
and you think I'm gonna slow
down and I'm gonna gear up.

925
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,364
I'm working harder now than ever.

926
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:18,826
This is the hardest I've ever
worked in my life, right now.

927
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:20,911
I went to Oslo and then Copenhagen,

928
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:22,765
connected to Moscow, got here,

929
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:26,108
leave for Australia, tomorrow
night I'm in Australia,

930
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:27,570
fucking, Tyler,

931
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:32,082
Tyler fucked me the fuck,
not you Baben, Tyler Schmidt,

932
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:33,550
Schmidt really fucked me up.

933
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,676
I'm in fucking Australia
for 30 hours, four keynotes,

934
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:38,716
he gave me two hours of sleep.

935
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:39,747
- [Audience Member] Wow, thanks Tyler.

936
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:40,746
You know and so like,

937
00:37:40,746 --> 00:37:42,038
this is like the hardest I've ever worked

938
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:43,706
and it is what it is, right?

939
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:46,211
You just do the best you can, bro.

940
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:49,301
That's it, you just do
the best you fucking can

941
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,702
because the truth is

942
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,431
when you get to that
place in your own head

943
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:53,798
and you're living in your own head,

944
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:55,806
you don't care what other people think.

945
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,627
I don't care what my parents think.

946
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:59,492
I don't care what my spouse thinks.

947
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:00,735
I don't care what my kids think, I don't.

948
00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:02,704
I want it to be awesome

949
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:05,045
but I got to start with me.

950
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:07,114
So do we come in to a
relationship thinking.

951
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:08,670
Over-communicate.

952
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,671
Be like, hey dude, I wanna be big.

953
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,565
(audience laughs)

954
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:13,799
- [Audience Member] For sure, thank you.

955
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:17,402
(audience applauds)

956
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:19,980
Check, check, oh, they fucked
up, they gave me the mic.

957
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,156
First off, give a shout out
to whoever put this complex

958
00:38:23,156 --> 00:38:25,462
'cause this is an amazing event.

959
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:27,907
I came from the real estate wealth expo

960
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:29,759
and I saw GaryVee coming and it was like

961
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:31,533
Brendon Burchard or
GaryVee and I was like,

962
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:33,745
oh, fuck Brendon Burchard, I
wanna see GaryVee, you know?

963
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,343
So, but attitude, gratitude,

964
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:37,412
I just want to thank you
for spitting real shit.

965
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:40,457
That's it, the thing's
you're saying is so right,

966
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:44,885
what really matters is all
fun and happy and everything

967
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:47,208
but what really matters is
tomorrow, Monday morning,

968
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,211
what are you doing by yourself
with the rah, rah, rah,

969
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:51,441
all that stuff, so I just
wanna say, I appreciate you.

970
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:52,274
It's true, man.

971
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:54,637
Everybody's acting a role
here and you're right,

972
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:56,697
the ones that are gonna
win are the same role

973
00:38:56,697 --> 00:38:59,671
that was played out today
is played out tomorrow.

974
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,377
Now you may have a job but is
your head in that same place?

975
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:04,676
Are you happy that you're
eating shit for 11 hours

976
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,434
at your job and you can't
wait to pick up some fast food

977
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:10,122
and then go home and then
grind and have nothing

978
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:13,927
good happen and then start again Tuesday?

979
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:14,760
I mean it.

980
00:39:15,914 --> 00:39:18,198
Do you love the grind?

981
00:39:18,198 --> 00:39:19,811
Do you love the negativity?

982
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:20,846
Do you have that patience?

983
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:22,475
Do you like when you
lose 100 followers a day

984
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:25,362
instead of gaining a thousand?

985
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,703
Do you like it, I do.

986
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:29,672
I do, I like it.

987
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,777
I think it's part of the fucking process.

988
00:39:31,777 --> 00:39:34,714
You can't have the
riches without the shit.

989
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:35,653
So thank you, appreciate you, man.

990
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:37,056
You got it, man

991
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:38,336
and I want to say one more thing on that,

992
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:40,714
the reason I spit real shit

993
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,417
is 'cause I'm selfish.

994
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:43,956
I know I'm gonna be right

995
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:45,480
and after you're done fucking with a bunch

996
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,147
of bullshit artists,
you're gonna come back.

997
00:39:50,627 --> 00:39:51,838
Hey guys, just in the interest of time,

998
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:53,541
let's please keep it at
one question and really

999
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:56,017
quick please, thank you.

1000
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:58,156
Alright hi, thank you
so much for being here.

1001
00:39:58,156 --> 00:40:00,945
So, I come from this world, I
was pretty entrenched in this

1002
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:04,018
about 10 years ago, around
2009 when everything

1003
00:40:04,018 --> 00:40:05,452
kind of fell to shit.

1004
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:07,919
I changed my life and

1005
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:10,067
I just moved into another
industry and now I have

1006
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:13,381
a start-up called Superfood
School that is an online

1007
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:15,288
course that helps people
to just get more plants

1008
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,207
on their plate, regardless of their diet.

1009
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,341
My big question is,

1010
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:20,337
I come from this world,
was pretty entrenched,

1011
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,830
arts and entertainment,
this whole business thing

1012
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,394
is a big thing for me,
so my question is just

1013
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:28,423
someone moving from creative
to really moving into business,

1014
00:40:28,423 --> 00:40:30,450
like I just learned the words scalability

1015
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,950
like two years ago,
listening to Frank Kern,

1016
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,886
Eben Pagan, all of those
guys, you and just,

1017
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:38,274
not wanting to go back to business school

1018
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:42,013
but really trying to
just get on this wave,

1019
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:45,486
plant based and the online
courses are just like,

1020
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,299
it's the wave, so just, yeah.

1021
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:48,861
Here's the problem,
those other guys you just

1022
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:50,815
mentioned, I know them
both, I got love for them

1023
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:54,221
but they're trying to make
you monetize short-term.

1024
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:56,060
They're taking to you
about short-term funnels,

1025
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,914
landing page optimization,
trying to get that money

1026
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,308
and what happens is,
Frank Kern gets you to ask

1027
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:04,014
your audience for money
too quick when you don't

1028
00:41:04,014 --> 00:41:05,764
have an audience yet.

1029
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,324
Do you understand?

1030
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:09,157
Yes.

1031
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:09,990
And you know what else?

1032
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,266
You know I'm right.

1033
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:12,642
You know what I mean?

1034
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:13,475
Yeah.

1035
00:41:13,475 --> 00:41:14,308
You can taste it,

1036
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,623
so cool, they're not wrong, in my opinion,

1037
00:41:16,623 --> 00:41:19,970
other than they want you
to monetize too quick.

1038
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,543
Everything's about create the persona,

1039
00:41:21,543 --> 00:41:23,595
drive the fucking traffic,

1040
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:26,901
optimize, get emails, free e-book,

1041
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,251
but then you sell them the thing,

1042
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:31,269
JV, this guy's got a list,
all this fucking bullshit,

1043
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:32,997
do you understand?

1044
00:41:32,997 --> 00:41:33,830
Yes, I do.

1045
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,136
And I know you know it is.

1046
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:37,234
What you like about what they're saying is

1047
00:41:37,234 --> 00:41:38,878
it's gonna happen fast
and you're gonna make

1048
00:41:38,878 --> 00:41:40,602
a buck thirty a year quick

1049
00:41:40,602 --> 00:41:44,255
on fucking $12,000 a
month recurring revenue.

1050
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:46,224
30K on a launch, like one launch, yeah.

1051
00:41:46,224 --> 00:41:50,766
Fuck that bull fucking
shit, do you understand?

1052
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:54,694
So, instead, there's
tried and true methods,

1053
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:56,656
which is, run the fucking marathon,

1054
00:41:56,656 --> 00:41:58,764
keep it humble, put out good content,

1055
00:41:58,764 --> 00:42:01,871
it's super okay to ask to sell something

1056
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:03,919
but you gotta believe
in it and if you don't

1057
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:06,649
believe in your $439 e-book because it's a

1058
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,954
compilation of shit that they can find,

1059
00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:10,110
then you don't do it, but
maybe it's a buck ten,

1060
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,223
maybe it's 47, maybe it's something else

1061
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:15,852
but just don't waver for the short term.

1062
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:16,767
- [Audience Member] Okay.

1063
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,094
That's all this is.

1064
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:20,025
- [Audience Member]
Okay, got it, thank you.

1065
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:21,021
You're welcome.

1066
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:24,593
(audience applauds)

1067
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:25,426
How you doing, Gary?

1068
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:26,259
- [Gary] Good, brother.

1069
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:28,521
Name is James Eucala,
handle's a bolakills,

1070
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:29,354
I was doing my thing.

1071
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:30,735
- [Gary] Respect.

1072
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:32,174
So two years, I just want to get this

1073
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,756
out of the way, it's kind
of surreal just speaking

1074
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:35,323
to you in person 'cause
I've been seeing you

1075
00:42:35,323 --> 00:42:36,736
for such a long time but,

1076
00:42:36,736 --> 00:42:39,607
two years, I hit kind of
rock bottom and I found

1077
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:41,640
you on a Facebook on
that five minute rant,

1078
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,118
randomly and it was
just like, what the fuck

1079
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:45,798
and it just completely changed my mind.

1080
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:47,306
Makes me happy.

1081
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:48,736
Fucking one hour drives everyday,

1082
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:50,549
I changed my health as well.

1083
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:52,053
I took your advice, I lost 30 pounds,

1084
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:54,616
everything very well for me.

1085
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:56,177
(audience applauds)

1086
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:57,010
You look fucking great.

1087
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,131
Thank you.

1088
00:42:58,131 --> 00:42:59,778
So I took your advice
and I've been doing it

1089
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,751
but now, my question is,

1090
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:04,443
I'm at that point now where it's,

1091
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:06,816
I hit my limit, I had
done everything I can but

1092
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:09,051
now I need people to help me out.

1093
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:10,459
Why?

1094
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:13,076
Like you said, I had tripled
down on all of my strength

1095
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:14,826
but I don't want to--

1096
00:43:16,038 --> 00:43:18,084
- [Gary] I got it, so
let's go to the next part.

1097
00:43:18,084 --> 00:43:19,352
So my next part is,

1098
00:43:19,352 --> 00:43:20,889
I'm trying to find people to help me out

1099
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,572
and there's a lot of people
that don't wanna help

1100
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:24,762
me out but I have this
weird issue in my head

1101
00:43:24,762 --> 00:43:27,257
where it's like, I feel
like I need to repay them.

1102
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:28,445
That's good.

1103
00:43:28,445 --> 00:43:29,847
A lot of people are always like,

1104
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:31,508
don't worry, they just
want to help you out

1105
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:32,808
but, I don't know, at the end of the day.

1106
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:33,641
No, I think that's good.

1107
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:34,474
I have the same thing.

1108
00:43:34,474 --> 00:43:35,307
When people come through on my team,

1109
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:36,467
work for free, work for cheap, I'm like,

1110
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:37,804
I fucking owe them for life.

1111
00:43:37,804 --> 00:43:39,278
There's nothing wrong with that.

1112
00:43:39,278 --> 00:43:41,882
Take the chance, have people come on,

1113
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:43,400
they might bring you value,

1114
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,377
then it's easy to do right by them,

1115
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:47,259
the other ones, even more interesting,

1116
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:48,312
you bring somebody on,

1117
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:49,985
sorry to point at you,

1118
00:43:49,985 --> 00:43:52,980
you bring somebody on
and they suck, right,

1119
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,471
and you still do good by them because

1120
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:55,639
that's your operating system,

1121
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,331
there's nothing wrong with that.

1122
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:58,471
But how do you?

1123
00:43:58,471 --> 00:43:59,304
Pick people?

1124
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,669
Not pick people because
there's people that are

1125
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:02,420
on my team that want to help me out and

1126
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,014
want me to succeed but

1127
00:44:04,014 --> 00:44:06,495
I know a lot of people in my team are

1128
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:09,210
financially unstable and things like that

1129
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,993
and then, I know you say, do internships,

1130
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:13,578
do blah, blah, blah, just kind
of give them value for it,

1131
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:14,953
but they don't want that stuff.

1132
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:16,118
So find somebody who does.

1133
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:17,971
And for those people
I try to bring them on

1134
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:20,272
and kind of give them an
opportunity and they're grateful

1135
00:44:20,272 --> 00:44:23,183
but as a HR point-of-view,
what do you do to kind of

1136
00:44:23,183 --> 00:44:24,016
repay them?

1137
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:25,329
So I do, I'm thinking of--

1138
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,771
Let me, real quick, 'cause I see he wants

1139
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:28,307
to take you off, we got
other people, I got this,

1140
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:29,140
real quick.

1141
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:29,973
- [Audience Member] I'm so sorry.

1142
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:31,578
It's super simple, it's
super simple, hear me out.

1143
00:44:31,578 --> 00:44:33,487
You're overthinking too much shit.

1144
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:34,612
Here's what you do.

1145
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:35,923
You bring people on

1146
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,986
and you take the risk that
you won't get enough value

1147
00:44:37,986 --> 00:44:40,292
back in return but then
you do right by them.

1148
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:42,597
You ask them what the fuck
they give a fuck about,

1149
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,813
there's 8,000 in my
inbox that literally say

1150
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:46,903
they will work for me
for free for two years

1151
00:44:46,903 --> 00:44:49,367
because they know the
Baben and D-Rock and Andy

1152
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:51,795
and Tyler story, because
I'm good enough to pay back

1153
00:44:51,795 --> 00:44:54,045
everybody if they do right by me.

1154
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:55,929
Take the risk with a
couple people that doesn't

1155
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:57,860
cost you anything so you can afford it

1156
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,127
and just play it out, instead
of overthinking it in theory,

1157
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:02,801
just do it a couple times,

1158
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:05,141
you're gonna learn from the doing.

1159
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:06,719
It's simple as that.

1160
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,119
Just give more than you got.

1161
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:09,952
- [Audience Member] Thank you, Gary.

1162
00:45:09,952 --> 00:45:10,785
You're welcome.

1163
00:45:10,785 --> 00:45:13,785
(audience applauds)

1164
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:19,984
Hi, Gary.

1165
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:20,817
- [Gary] How are you?

1166
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:21,650
I'm good.

1167
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,981
My name is Mai and

1168
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:27,934
I came to America in 1975 as
a boat person from Vietnam.

1169
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:28,767
- [Gary] Amazing.

1170
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,425
Thank you.

1171
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:34,570
I dealt with racism, bullying,
poverty, the whole bit,

1172
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,015
so I decided to write a book.

1173
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:38,622
What, in your opinion,
would be the best way

1174
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:41,852
to market this book because
I'm an unknown writer.

1175
00:45:41,852 --> 00:45:43,390
No one knows who I am.

1176
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,707
So I would go to
Instagram and I would type

1177
00:45:46,707 --> 00:45:50,457
in #bully, #Vietnam,
#everything in your life

1178
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:53,981
and I would look at
the most popular people

1179
00:45:53,981 --> 00:45:56,472
on that hashtag, every hour, everyday,

1180
00:45:56,472 --> 00:45:59,463
and then you would look at them and

1181
00:45:59,463 --> 00:46:01,265
somebody put #Vietnam because that's

1182
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:02,598
where their family's from and they have

1183
00:46:02,598 --> 00:46:04,563
7,000 followers and you
DM them and you tell

1184
00:46:04,563 --> 00:46:06,896
them you want to send them the book and it

1185
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,611
would mean the world to you
if they would shout it out.

1186
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,769
You do that 100 times a day,

1187
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,622
you'll probably get one in
every thousand to say yes,

1188
00:46:13,622 --> 00:46:15,906
once you wrap your head around that,

1189
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,096
you just keep doing it over and over.

1190
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:19,426
I'm okay with rejection.

1191
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,056
Of course you are, you
were bullied and you faced

1192
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:24,785
racism, you're fucking
set, you've won already.

1193
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:27,442
I'm being, guys, I'm being serious.

1194
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:30,827
If I could ever convince all
of you that your shortcomings

1195
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:34,994
and your detriments are your
strengths, you would win.

1196
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,814
If I was six foot four
and ran like a gazelle,

1197
00:46:39,814 --> 00:46:43,564
I'd play for the Jets
instead of owning them.

1198
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:47,923
I really need everybody
to have that one sink in

1199
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:49,886
'cause it's the most
important one, so that's it,

1200
00:46:49,886 --> 00:46:50,884
do that.

1201
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:51,846
- [Mai] Okay, thank you.

1202
00:46:51,846 --> 00:46:54,846
(audience applauds)

1203
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:57,971
Hey, Gary, so I'm a little nervous,

1204
00:46:57,971 --> 00:46:59,440
I'm sorry if I'm a little
close to the microphone

1205
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,513
or whatever.

1206
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:02,036
- [Gary] You're great.

1207
00:47:02,036 --> 00:47:03,659
So, I own a media company, I just founded

1208
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,358
about three months ago,
I'm very passionate

1209
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:06,910
about what I do, I feel like
I have a very good drive

1210
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,390
and a good product.

1211
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,614
So my question is, how can
I get more of that product

1212
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:11,932
in front of the right people,

1213
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:14,223
how can I get the right collaborations,

1214
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:15,357
I mean, obviously

1215
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:16,190
- [Gary] Ask.

1216
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,392
Ask?

1217
00:47:17,392 --> 00:47:19,719
Yeah, but I mean, for example--

1218
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:22,296
You go to Instagram, you
DM a hundred people a day.

1219
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:23,669
(audience laughs)

1220
00:47:23,669 --> 00:47:26,257
You ask, one in every
500 is gonna say yes.

1221
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:27,770
Actually, I guess, let me
ask a different question.

1222
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,892
So yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1223
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:30,725
Go ahead.

1224
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:32,777
It's cool, it's cool, go fast.

1225
00:47:32,777 --> 00:47:34,619
If were in my shoes--

1226
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:35,452
- [Gary] I'd ask.

1227
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,365
Starting a media company--

1228
00:47:36,365 --> 00:47:37,198
I'd ask.

1229
00:47:38,286 --> 00:47:41,826
My man, my man, that's what I did.

1230
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,053
Everybody thinks I was put on,

1231
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:46,237
I built my dad's liquor business for him.

1232
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:49,156
I was 30 fucking two years old,

1233
00:47:49,156 --> 00:47:51,822
34 years old when I started VaynerMedia

1234
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:54,720
and I had no equity in my
library, I had nothing.

1235
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,559
I built my dad's liquor store for him.

1236
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,575
I had zero.

1237
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:58,820
I was 34 years old

1238
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,857
and I'd never made more
than $150,000 a year,

1239
00:48:00,857 --> 00:48:03,014
even though I built a 60
million dollar business

1240
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:04,205
for my dad.

1241
00:48:04,205 --> 00:48:05,378
I had no money.

1242
00:48:05,378 --> 00:48:06,747
AJ was graduating from school.

1243
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:08,575
I had no savings 'cause
I bought an apartment

1244
00:48:08,575 --> 00:48:10,566
from everything I saved
and, as some of you know,

1245
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:12,715
I finally invested in
Facebook and Twitter,

1246
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:14,380
that launched me but I finally did that.

1247
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,674
I had no money.

1248
00:48:15,674 --> 00:48:17,128
Do you know how VaynorMedia started?

1249
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,157
I asked a bunch of people
that were buying wine from me

1250
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:22,430
if they wanted the way
they saw wine library grow

1251
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,454
for their own business
and some dude gave us

1252
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:25,949
an $80 thousand dollar thing,

1253
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:27,671
four of AJ's friends worked for free.

1254
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,236
Mike Boyd, Boyd, you here?

1255
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:31,117
- [Mike] Over here.

1256
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,422
Hey Boyd, tell these
fuckers how we did it,

1257
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:37,089
Mike, tell them where
you slept some nights.

1258
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,413
On the floor, multiple nights.

1259
00:48:40,413 --> 00:48:41,252
- [Gary] Say it again.

1260
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,880
I slept on the floor of
the office multiple nights,

1261
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,254
on purpose, 'cause I wanted to.

1262
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:47,854
People didn't get paid.

1263
00:48:47,854 --> 00:48:49,185
People didn't get paid.

1264
00:48:49,185 --> 00:48:50,517
People didn't get paid.

1265
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:53,517
(audience applauds)

1266
00:48:54,883 --> 00:48:57,211
It's so fun to have Boyd
and have Dustin here,

1267
00:48:57,211 --> 00:48:59,265
'cause they know the truth.

1268
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:02,012
They know me before this.

1269
00:49:02,012 --> 00:49:03,546
You think I'm joking,

1270
00:49:03,546 --> 00:49:05,490
you think my daddy gave me a liquor store,

1271
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,764
you're fucking confused.

1272
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:08,952
Do you understand?

1273
00:49:08,952 --> 00:49:10,041
You know what I did, bro?

1274
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,712
I fucking asked, you know why?

1275
00:49:11,712 --> 00:49:14,097
I don't give a shit when people say no.

1276
00:49:14,097 --> 00:49:15,549
You know what that means?

1277
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:18,548
Somebody finally says yes
and you fucking start.

1278
00:49:18,548 --> 00:49:21,021
You want collabs, ask them.

1279
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:22,926
You want to do something with A Boogie,

1280
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,454
you wanna do something with Champion,

1281
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:26,029
you wanna do something Cristall,

1282
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:27,788
fucking ask them.

1283
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:29,280
- [Audience Member] Yes, sir.

1284
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,531
That's it.

1285
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:32,208
- [Audience Member] So
let me ask you this.

1286
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:33,724
Can I collab with you?

1287
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:34,872
Let's go.

1288
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:37,805
(audience laughs)

1289
00:49:37,805 --> 00:49:39,537
You should have started with the ask.

1290
00:49:39,537 --> 00:49:41,473
(audience laughs)

1291
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:43,802
Hi, I'm Lila Hart, stand-up comedian

1292
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:46,371
living in Los Angeles,
originally from Seattle.

1293
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:47,813
My question for you is

1294
00:49:47,813 --> 00:49:50,126
how do you remain so fearless
in your entrepreneurial

1295
00:49:50,126 --> 00:49:54,499
endeavors and why does
kindness matter so much to you?

1296
00:49:54,499 --> 00:49:55,738
Kindness matters 'cause
my legacy matters to me

1297
00:49:55,738 --> 00:49:57,530
way more than anything else and that's how

1298
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,724
I live my life and the
way I stay fearless is

1299
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:02,359
there's no alternative.

1300
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:04,006
I'm not scared of losing
because I don't allow

1301
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:06,532
any of you to judge me.

1302
00:50:06,532 --> 00:50:08,066
Guys, you're only scared
to lose 'cause you're

1303
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:11,134
worried about what other
people are gonna say.

1304
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:12,734
My losses are my losses,

1305
00:50:12,734 --> 00:50:15,035
get the fuck out of my system.

1306
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,304
They're my losses.

1307
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,065
You think I give a fuck what you think?

1308
00:50:18,065 --> 00:50:19,142
You think if I lost everything

1309
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,844
your comment of I fucking knew it,

1310
00:50:20,844 --> 00:50:23,069
he was snake oil salesman,
he never had anything,

1311
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:24,765
you think that would bother me?

1312
00:50:24,765 --> 00:50:26,348
That shit would fucking motivate me 'cause

1313
00:50:26,348 --> 00:50:27,963
when I rise again like a phoenix,

1314
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:30,963
I'll stick it in your fucking mouth.

1315
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:34,337
I'm fearless because, listen,

1316
00:50:34,337 --> 00:50:36,022
I know your story, we've
interacted a little bit

1317
00:50:36,022 --> 00:50:38,050
at that Vid Summit, now here,

1318
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,658
you've dealt with way fucking worse

1319
00:50:40,658 --> 00:50:44,751
than fucking somebody firing
you or your business failing,

1320
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,784
so you're fucking good too.

1321
00:50:47,784 --> 00:50:48,810
Thank you.

1322
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,810
(audience applauds)

1323
00:50:53,598 --> 00:50:56,505
ComplexCon, makes some noise!

1324
00:50:56,505 --> 00:50:59,505
GaryVee's in the house, baby, sorry.

1325
00:51:00,616 --> 00:51:01,921
- [Gary] He's feeling it, he's feeling it.

1326
00:51:01,921 --> 00:51:02,938
Come on, come on.

1327
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:03,771
- [Gary] Respect, respect.

1328
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:04,604
So real quick.

1329
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:05,912
- [Gary] They keep it tight around here.

1330
00:51:05,912 --> 00:51:07,364
So just to give people some context,

1331
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,420
I met Gary for the first time downstairs,

1332
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,015
definitely became the
biggest fanboy of all time.

1333
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:14,447
D-Rock definitely captured it.

1334
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,126
I was just like, yo Gary,
I love this shit, man,

1335
00:51:16,126 --> 00:51:17,138
you hook me up but,

1336
00:51:17,138 --> 00:51:19,383
14 months ago, launched a podcast

1337
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:20,862
called Purpose in the Youth,

1338
00:51:20,862 --> 00:51:22,720
it's about unfolding the
stories of passionate people

1339
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,028
after graduating college, you
need to find that passion.

1340
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:27,465
You've given me so much value,

1341
00:51:27,465 --> 00:51:30,752
D-Rock, shout out to Baben,
he's been on the podcast,

1342
00:51:30,752 --> 00:51:31,947
thank you, bro,

1343
00:51:31,947 --> 00:51:33,376
shout out to your entire team.

1344
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:34,209
- [Gary] Thank you.

1345
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:35,524
You've given me so much
value and I know for a fact

1346
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:37,810
that one day we will be in
some type of partnership

1347
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,260
for this podcast.

1348
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,253
In the meantime,

1349
00:51:41,253 --> 00:51:43,674
what value can I bring to
you through my podcast?

1350
00:51:43,674 --> 00:51:45,526
Just keep doing your thing.

1351
00:51:45,526 --> 00:51:46,654
I need nothing, man.

1352
00:51:46,654 --> 00:51:49,292
You fucking winning is fucking all I want.

1353
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:52,374
I'm gonna get mine by
myself, you go do you.

1354
00:51:52,374 --> 00:51:54,606
(audience applauds)

1355
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:57,367
Nothing, not even like
a Gary shout out in it?

1356
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,450
I was yelling at fucking Schmidt 'cause

1357
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,696
the sneaker release on the
14th I thought was gonna

1358
00:52:01,696 --> 00:52:04,561
be like me being there and
doing what I did downstairs,

1359
00:52:04,561 --> 00:52:07,225
instead he's like, yo,
we're doing this party

1360
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:10,569
and we're gonna invite 150
VIPs and I'm like fuck,

1361
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:11,486
that sucks.

1362
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:13,820
I don't like stuff.

1363
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,761
I don't want you to do anything for me.

1364
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:18,220
You fucking executing on the thesis,

1365
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,190
the shit that I'm trying
to penetrate people's

1366
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,023
skulls and hearts in here with,

1367
00:52:22,023 --> 00:52:25,940
you doing that fucking
pays me back 10x, do it.

1368
00:52:26,828 --> 00:52:27,725
- [Audience Member] All day.

1369
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:30,725
(audience applauds)

1370
00:52:32,466 --> 00:52:34,301
Yo, how you doing, I'm Marcus Terell,

1371
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:35,529
I have eight million followers

1372
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:36,668
on all social media platforms,

1373
00:52:36,668 --> 00:52:37,685
hello to everybody.

1374
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:39,335
- [Gary] I'm aware.

1375
00:52:39,335 --> 00:52:41,729
So, basically in 2016, you emailed me,

1376
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:43,883
you said come see me, it never happened.

1377
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:45,711
Alright, so we gonna get to that, alright,

1378
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:47,292
but my question is,

1379
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,138
since you're an investor and you invested

1380
00:52:49,138 --> 00:52:50,816
in so many companies
like Twitter and Snapchat

1381
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:52,930
and Facebook, are you invested into

1382
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:55,110
Blockchain and Bitcoin?

1383
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,610
So I bought Bitcoin in 2014,

1384
00:52:59,382 --> 00:53:03,382
I just need all of you
to eat that for a minute.

1385
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:07,762
I love showing my Coinbase to people,

1386
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:09,345
they're like, fuck.

1387
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:14,535
I put in 25K, it's worth like a million,

1388
00:53:14,535 --> 00:53:16,526
so, Marcus, listen,

1389
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,123
I think Blockchain's way
bigger than people realize,

1390
00:53:19,123 --> 00:53:21,727
like people are fucking with
it like on a Bitcoin level

1391
00:53:21,727 --> 00:53:25,054
then people a little smarter
are on the Ethereum level,

1392
00:53:25,054 --> 00:53:26,784
but when you understand
what the Blockchain is,

1393
00:53:26,784 --> 00:53:29,701
my big thing with the Blockchain is

1394
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:34,499
it can literally overthrow
America and China and Russia.

1395
00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:35,588
It's that powerful.

1396
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:39,319
It's a platform of trust and
we can do shit with each other

1397
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:42,095
and everybody else is out.

1398
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:43,964
It's so heady, man,

1399
00:53:43,964 --> 00:53:46,223
I understand it theoretically,

1400
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,403
I haven't spent a lot
of time in it, right,

1401
00:53:48,403 --> 00:53:51,320
but I've been spending more lately.

1402
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:56,330
There's a lot of bullshit
ICOs, get rich quick bullshit

1403
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,585
that's starting to happen.

1404
00:53:57,585 --> 00:53:59,095
I need all the dust, thank you,

1405
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:01,016
I need all the dust to
settle a little bit.

1406
00:54:01,016 --> 00:54:02,309
I'm watching.

1407
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:04,872
My favorite time is
when I'm like the cobra

1408
00:54:04,872 --> 00:54:08,071
in the grass, I loved social media like

1409
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:10,507
2006, '07,'08, 'cause I
was just like creeping,

1410
00:54:10,507 --> 00:54:12,336
I was like in there, I was watching it,

1411
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:15,074
that's how I am with Blockchain right now,

1412
00:54:15,074 --> 00:54:16,477
that's how I am with AR,

1413
00:54:16,477 --> 00:54:18,244
with Voice I'm a little
louder 'cause I was in

1414
00:54:18,244 --> 00:54:20,918
the grass two years ago
with Voice and Alexa,

1415
00:54:20,918 --> 00:54:23,221
Scales and podcast but now I'm out.

1416
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:24,992
I think it's super fascinating.

1417
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:26,427
I think there's a lot of
people that know a lot more

1418
00:54:26,427 --> 00:54:28,535
than me, which is why I
don't spit on it a whole lot

1419
00:54:28,535 --> 00:54:32,915
but it's big big, like
building on top of it,

1420
00:54:32,915 --> 00:54:34,827
building on top of Ethereum
and taking advantage of it,

1421
00:54:34,827 --> 00:54:35,839
there's real things.

1422
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,421
The same way you hacked,
I watch how you hacked

1423
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:39,482
your social, you did
it a little different,

1424
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:41,624
we can talk about it any way you want but,

1425
00:54:41,624 --> 00:54:44,915
I think if you would deploy
some of that hacker culture

1426
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:49,289
into Blockchain, you might
find some real fruitful shit.

1427
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,122
Alright, thank you.

1428
00:54:50,122 --> 00:54:53,602
(audience applauds)

1429
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:54,799
Yes, hello, my name's Luke Penco,

1430
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,046
I met you downstairs.

1431
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:57,788
- [Gary] I remember.

1432
00:54:57,788 --> 00:54:58,868
Quick question about audio.

1433
00:54:58,868 --> 00:55:00,503
I teach English to Italians, right?

1434
00:55:00,503 --> 00:55:01,336
- [Gary] I'm aware.

1435
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:02,731
About starting a podcast and for them,

1436
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:04,527
obviously more advance
I'd give them transcripts

1437
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:07,596
and stuff like that but
what's the best way to deploy,

1438
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,862
I know you're talking about
not monetizing too early,

1439
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:12,242
doing the whole Frank Kerns stuff, right

1440
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,075
but obviously you gotta make

1441
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:14,515
some money at the same time, right?

1442
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:15,682
Well, you do

1443
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,059
but real quick before you go anywhere.

1444
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:19,892
How much?

1445
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:24,607
To me, I'm doing this more for everybody,

1446
00:55:24,607 --> 00:55:26,235
I'll get back to you.

1447
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:28,266
Of course you have to make money,

1448
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:30,734
my question is, how much?

1449
00:55:30,734 --> 00:55:33,787
Like if you want it real, real
bad and you can't breathe,

1450
00:55:33,787 --> 00:55:36,656
why can't you at 28
live with four roommates

1451
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:38,323
in a bullshit place?

1452
00:55:40,718 --> 00:55:44,413
I thought you told me
you wanted it so bad?

1453
00:55:44,413 --> 00:55:45,648
There's a great Russian saying,

1454
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:46,907
it doesn't translate into English,

1455
00:55:46,907 --> 00:55:48,650
I've never heard it as
an English expression

1456
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,082
but it basically translates into

1457
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:53,965
you can't put your ass on two toilets

1458
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:56,851
and that's what everybody's
trying to do here.

1459
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:59,303
Everybody wants it and want
to build a big business

1460
00:55:59,303 --> 00:56:02,478
but they also want the
money in the short term

1461
00:56:02,478 --> 00:56:05,111
to live that lifestyle.

1462
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,146
So, we've talked four times already here,

1463
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,037
my big thing, I mean it and I'm excited,

1464
00:56:09,037 --> 00:56:11,911
we've talked, my big
thing with you that I'm

1465
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,104
trying to figure out is at 27, 28, right,

1466
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:17,678
I need you to really realize
that you should just,

1467
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:19,114
I feel like you could win based

1468
00:56:19,114 --> 00:56:21,873
on our four interactions here.

1469
00:56:21,873 --> 00:56:23,093
No listen, I'm being serious with you,

1470
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:24,309
I don't think it's a negative.

1471
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:25,602
I'm trying to make everybody understand

1472
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:28,401
that I've been paying attention
for the last 12 hours.

1473
00:56:28,401 --> 00:56:30,252
I just think you're impatient.

1474
00:56:30,252 --> 00:56:31,257
I guess I'm trying to balance,

1475
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:33,028
I don't need this crazy.

1476
00:56:33,028 --> 00:56:35,491
You need almost nothing,
you know that, right?

1477
00:56:35,491 --> 00:56:36,495
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1478
00:56:36,495 --> 00:56:38,633
You could legitimately go
on a social media campaign

1479
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:41,014
and sleep in people's houses
and have no rent, right,

1480
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,205
you know that, right?

1481
00:56:42,205 --> 00:56:44,372
You guys know that, right?

1482
00:56:46,198 --> 00:56:49,868
You just don't need
that much money to live.

1483
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:51,223
But you gotta make some, right?

1484
00:56:51,223 --> 00:56:52,061
- [Gary] Why?

1485
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:54,511
Just give all free shit?

1486
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,949
The longer you give free
shit and you're good,

1487
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:59,990
the more you'll get back at the end.

1488
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:03,931
The person that can hold
the breath the longest wins.

1489
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:05,147
Well, then you gotta have like a side job

1490
00:57:05,147 --> 00:57:05,980
or something.

1491
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,130
Yeah.

1492
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:07,963
- [Luke] For like ever?

1493
00:57:07,963 --> 00:57:08,987
Yeah.

1494
00:57:08,987 --> 00:57:09,820
For 10 years anyway.

1495
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,174
Yeah, that's exactly what you should do.

1496
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:13,876
I brought the 27th team flip challenge

1497
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:15,458
to all the creators
because if you're going

1498
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,606
to the Goodwill and garage
sales and shit like that

1499
00:57:17,606 --> 00:57:19,231
and making $400 a week that way,

1500
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:21,821
well then you don't have to sell bullshit

1501
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:23,343
fucking courses on your podcast,

1502
00:57:23,343 --> 00:57:27,857
which makes everybody
unsubscribe to your bullshit.

1503
00:57:27,857 --> 00:57:29,152
Will you be on my podcast?

1504
00:57:29,152 --> 00:57:29,985
- [Gary] What's that?

1505
00:57:29,985 --> 00:57:30,818
Will you be in my podcast?

1506
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:32,800
You do 40 episodes and
I'll be on your podcast.

1507
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,633
Alright.

1508
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:35,016
Can I shake your hand?

1509
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:35,950
No, okay.

1510
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,950
(audience applauds)

1511
00:57:40,304 --> 00:57:41,137
- [Bobby] Hello.

1512
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:42,055
Hello.

1513
00:57:42,055 --> 00:57:43,520
I'm not comfortable on mic,

1514
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,647
so I'll just start off
by saying that hello,

1515
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:45,889
nice to meet you, Gary.

1516
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:46,722
- [Gary] Good to meet you.

1517
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:47,555
Huge inspiration, my name's Bobby Torrez,

1518
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:48,542
I'm from Orlando, Florida.

1519
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:49,375
- [Gary] What up, Bobby?

1520
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,131
Quick question, I work in the tech sector

1521
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:53,416
so I'm asking you as an investor,

1522
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:54,904
what's your thoughts on augmented reality

1523
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,301
and virtual reality and the
opportunity in this industry

1524
00:57:57,301 --> 00:57:58,762
and for our generation?

1525
00:57:58,762 --> 00:58:00,872
I think AR is huge and it's here and

1526
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:02,390
you should look at it
and with the new update

1527
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,762
in the iPhone and the kit,

1528
00:58:03,762 --> 00:58:05,780
everybody here should
understand augmented reality.

1529
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,027
You're living it, that's why all that shit

1530
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:10,915
that Snapchat's doing,
little butterfly pops up

1531
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:13,146
or you throw up fucking
rainbows, it's here.

1532
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:15,553
It's here, I like it.

1533
00:58:15,553 --> 00:58:17,286
Consumer VR I hate.

1534
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:18,674
I think it's 10 years away,

1535
00:58:18,674 --> 00:58:21,555
nobody here has spent
three hours in a VR world

1536
00:58:21,555 --> 00:58:23,330
in the last month,

1537
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,729
that shit's super far away
but when it gets here,

1538
00:58:25,729 --> 00:58:27,812
that shit is gonna be big

1539
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,027
and I think when everybody realizes,

1540
00:58:30,027 --> 00:58:31,473
it's fun to talk to a young crowd,

1541
00:58:31,473 --> 00:58:33,047
the fact that all of you are
gonna wear contact lenses

1542
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:35,751
in your life and your
brain is gonna switch from

1543
00:58:35,751 --> 00:58:38,358
real life to augmented reality,

1544
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:39,847
like Santa Claus is
sitting here and having

1545
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:41,815
this keynote with me, to virtual reality

1546
00:58:41,815 --> 00:58:43,287
where you switch into a world,

1547
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,888
this mixed reality world that
you're all gonna live in,

1548
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:48,833
you think all this
technology's crazy and fly now,

1549
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:51,490
you think the iPhone X is
rad, facial recognition,

1550
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,779
this is fucking garbage.

1551
00:58:53,779 --> 00:58:56,895
This shit's garbage to where
we're going in 10 years

1552
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,940
and so, there's some kid
in here who's gonna make

1553
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,608
10 million dollars a year selling virtual

1554
00:59:00,608 --> 00:59:04,067
fucking sneakers, but
it's gonna take 15 years.

1555
00:59:04,067 --> 00:59:05,070
Fair enough, fair enough.

1556
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,277
I'm working in that space right now,

1557
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:07,388
so it's yeah.

1558
00:59:07,388 --> 00:59:08,886
If you're doing it for b to b,

1559
00:59:08,886 --> 00:59:09,991
there's a lot but if you think consumers

1560
00:59:09,991 --> 00:59:11,640
are gonna fuck with VR,

1561
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,495
it's gonna take a much
longer time than you think.

1562
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:17,513
We started in the consumer
space and then pivoted.

1563
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:18,346
No shit.

1564
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,653
Cool.

1565
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:20,486
Thank you very much.

1566
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:21,319
You're welcome.

1567
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:24,319
(audience applauds)

1568
00:59:26,506 --> 00:59:27,923
She gets the mic.

1569
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:32,012
Hi, I'm Bianca Richelle,
I'm from California,

1570
00:59:32,012 --> 00:59:33,521
well, not California, San Francisco.

1571
00:59:33,521 --> 00:59:34,532
(Gary laughs)

1572
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:35,365
- [Gary] How old are you?

1573
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:36,198
I'm nine.

1574
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,336
It's so nice to meet you.

1575
00:59:37,336 --> 00:59:38,826
Nice to meet you too.

1576
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:42,057
I'm a rapper and a business owner.

1577
00:59:42,057 --> 00:59:44,819
I come to events like ComplexCon,

1578
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:48,023
I come to network because I push myself

1579
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:51,356
and create partnerships with the brands.

1580
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,087
Do you think I'm going
at it the wrong way?

1581
00:59:55,087 --> 00:59:57,009
You are definitely not going
about it the wrong way.

1582
00:59:57,009 --> 00:59:58,553
(audience laughs)

1583
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:01,553
(audience applauds)

1584
01:00:03,088 --> 01:00:04,956
Little one, you might be going about it

1585
01:00:04,956 --> 01:00:06,429
the best fucking way here.

1586
01:00:06,429 --> 01:00:09,705
(audience laughs)

1587
01:00:09,705 --> 01:00:10,707
Are you enjoying it?

1588
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,540
Yeah.

1589
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,373
You love it?

1590
01:00:12,373 --> 01:00:13,206
Yeah.

1591
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:14,396
What are you gonna do when you grow up?

1592
01:00:14,396 --> 01:00:17,229
Well, I'm a rapper, so I really,

1593
01:00:18,873 --> 01:00:21,901
I dream about going on tours,

1594
01:00:21,901 --> 01:00:25,389
everybody here, they're coming to see you,

1595
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,265
I want them to be like that to me.

1596
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:28,098
I love that.

1597
01:00:28,098 --> 01:00:29,131
Listen to me,

1598
01:00:29,131 --> 01:00:32,308
can I give you a real, real,
real good piece of advice

1599
01:00:32,308 --> 01:00:33,714
that's gonna be really
hard for you to take

1600
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:35,573
but please remember it
and hopefully when we

1601
01:00:35,573 --> 01:00:37,648
chop up this video, we'll send it to you?

1602
01:00:37,648 --> 01:00:39,025
- [Bianca] Uh-huh.

1603
01:00:39,025 --> 01:00:42,825
The number one thing you have is time.

1604
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:45,430
You have something in
here that all of us envy,

1605
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,907
which is an extra 30
years, an extra 20 years,

1606
01:00:47,907 --> 01:00:49,657
an extra 15 years, do you understand?

1607
01:00:49,657 --> 01:00:50,855
- [Bianca] Yeah.

1608
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,062
You can't get caught up
in the game that most

1609
01:00:53,062 --> 01:00:55,301
nine to 11 year old
entrepreneurs are getting

1610
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:56,639
caught up in that I talk to.

1611
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,617
(audience laughs)

1612
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:02,934
Oh what, you don't see
what I'm doing on music.ly?

1613
01:01:02,934 --> 01:01:04,017
Listen to me,

1614
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:06,955
that was funny, right?

1615
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:07,973
My life's funny.

1616
01:01:07,973 --> 01:01:10,424
Listen, listen to me,

1617
01:01:10,424 --> 01:01:13,561
the thing that a lot of
single digit entrepreneurs

1618
01:01:13,561 --> 01:01:16,472
are getting caught up
with is you care too much

1619
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,822
about how many subscribers
and followers you got.

1620
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:23,134
If you promise me this,
it will help you so much.

1621
01:01:23,134 --> 01:01:26,915
If you just make the songs
that are in your heart.

1622
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:29,116
If you just make the content you want.

1623
01:01:29,116 --> 01:01:31,117
If I could get you to
just never look at how

1624
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:33,748
many followers you have
for the next 10 years,

1625
01:01:33,748 --> 01:01:35,548
you will win, it's gonna be hard,

1626
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:37,557
all your friends are gonna ask how many,

1627
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:40,139
everybody here cares how
many and they're grown

1628
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:44,448
but if you can get to that
place where you don't care

1629
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:46,838
about that one thing,

1630
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:49,973
it will help you so much
you could never imagine.

1631
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:51,649
Can I tell you something else?

1632
01:01:51,649 --> 01:01:52,982
- [Bianca] Yeah.

1633
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:56,009
If you talk about your real life,

1634
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:58,483
which is obviously very
different than our real life,

1635
01:01:58,483 --> 01:02:00,822
based on how you see things in the world,

1636
01:02:00,822 --> 01:02:04,560
it will be really interesting shit.

1637
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,050
Yeah, that's how my songs are.

1638
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,050
I don't tell fake stuff,

1639
01:02:09,595 --> 01:02:11,371
I don't wanna tell fake stuff,

1640
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:14,490
I wanna tell my life
story and how I got here.

1641
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:15,503
I love it.

1642
01:02:15,503 --> 01:02:16,851
Keep getting your thing, girl.

1643
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:17,684
I love you.

1644
01:02:17,684 --> 01:02:20,684
(audience applauds)

1645
01:02:24,852 --> 01:02:25,959
Can you come up here.

1646
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:28,464
I want to take a picture with you.

1647
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:29,457
- [Crew Member] That's it guys,

1648
01:02:29,457 --> 01:02:30,647
thank you so much for coming out.

1649
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,875
All of Gary's team, please
just meet right here

1650
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,321
and we're gonna have you guys
standing by to go backstage.

1651
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:37,306
All of Gary's team, just right here.

1652
01:02:37,306 --> 01:02:41,473
All the rest of audience,
go home (laughs).

1653
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,211
Thank you guys, have a good night.

1654
01:02:44,211 --> 01:02:45,210
Yeah, yeah, hold on, hold on,

1655
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,655
you know what,

1656
01:02:46,655 --> 01:02:48,176
yeah, yeah, let's do this real quick,

1657
01:02:48,176 --> 01:02:49,548
this would really matter a lot to me.

1658
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:50,933
This is when we can give some real love.

1659
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:51,766
It's real fun.

1660
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:52,599
Do you have an Instagram yet?

1661
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:53,432
Yeah.

1662
01:02:53,432 --> 01:02:54,265
What is it?

1663
01:02:54,265 --> 01:02:57,186
It's Bianca Rochelle,
B-I-A-N-C-A underscore,

1664
01:02:57,186 --> 01:02:58,156
R-I-C-H-E-L.

1665
01:02:58,156 --> 01:02:59,563
Hold on, hold on.

1666
01:02:59,563 --> 01:03:01,063
We're fucking old.

1667
01:03:01,947 --> 01:03:04,209
Bianca underscore, there you go, hold on,

1668
01:03:04,209 --> 01:03:06,784
you know what I'll do, this
is an even better move.

1669
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:08,123
I'm gonna follow you right now

1670
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:09,579
and then everybody will go to my account

1671
01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:13,302
and look at the last
person I followed, B-I-A?

1672
01:03:13,302 --> 01:03:15,265
B-I-A-N-C-A.

1673
01:03:15,265 --> 01:03:16,403
Underscore?

1674
01:03:16,403 --> 01:03:20,403
R-I-C-H-E-L-L-E.

1675
01:03:23,186 --> 01:03:24,609
Okay, that's you, right?

1676
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:25,442
Yeah.

1677
01:03:27,194 --> 01:03:29,314
Yo, she's got 28 five.

1678
01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:31,814
(audience applauds)

1679
01:03:31,814 --> 01:03:33,402
Let's get her to 50K, uh.

1680
01:03:33,402 --> 01:03:34,235
Okay.

1681
01:03:36,607 --> 01:03:37,625
Thank you guys so much,

1682
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:38,901
I have nothing but love for you.

1683
01:03:38,901 --> 01:03:41,901
(audience applauds)

1684
01:03:44,462 --> 01:03:45,569
That's real cute.

1685
01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:46,750
I wish you well.

1686
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:50,083
(relaxed hip hop music)

1687
01:03:57,494 --> 01:03:58,510
Hope you enjoyed,

1688
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,211
what was your biggest takeaway other than

1689
01:04:00,211 --> 00:00:00,000
I have a shit load of Jet's jerseys?
