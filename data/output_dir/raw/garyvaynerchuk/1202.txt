14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,140
of you know vaynermedia was built on

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,329
coming into companies and taking the

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,640
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> media away from PR companies some</font>

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,780
of the bigger PR companies in the world

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,000
right now have built out social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media</font>

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,260
departments and they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a nice job</font>

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,920
to varying degrees I wanted to answer

<font color="#E5E5E5">people around the psychology of the</font>

23
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,890
difference between PR and social and why

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,379
I do think that of course there's people

25
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,989
look hundreds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this company</font>

26
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,629
have worked in PR before so there's some

27
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,030
great things about PR being able to hang

28
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,160
a no-pressure the speed of it the

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,339
difference though is PR is very b2b when

30
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,320
you're a PR person and you're working

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,189
when you're doing social you're gearing

37
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,930
with all the fans that it's much more
