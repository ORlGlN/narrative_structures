1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,899
- Reporting live from the end of CES.

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:07,429
This happened two days ago, this episode.

3
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:08,816
Babin and I were just walking,

4
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:10,090
and he said to me, "Fuck, dude.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,717
"I don't think we can put any of it out."

6
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:13,936
There was so much important information,

7
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:15,346
like secret information, it was just

8
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,933
something we couldn't put out.

9
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:19,056
That's today's episode.

10
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:22,073
Bottom line is like, some days

11
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:24,133
it just fucking works
out that way. (laughs)

12
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:24,966
Enjoy it.

13
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:28,466
(dramatic rhythmic music)

14
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,692
("The Coast" by Sample and Hold)

15
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:45,637
Hey, guys, CES 2018 off to a good start.

16
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,844
Some good meetings, called Andrea,

17
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:49,285
our new Chief Client Officer.

18
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:50,118
She's right there.

19
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:51,526
(Andrea gasps)
- [Voiceover] Back seat!

20
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:52,658
- (laughs) And so it's going well.

21
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:55,601
We're going to a dinner party right now

22
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:58,184
that we put on and little wine,

23
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,818
little senior executives,
a little networking,

24
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:04,397
and then the MediaLink Party,

25
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,426
which I'm not sure I'm gonna go to.

26
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:06,776
Last night was a pretty exciting night.

27
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,987
Do not understand, if I lose tonight?

28
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:10,404
It's even better.

29
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:12,568
And so I didn't sleep actually.

30
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:13,990
I was just excitement,
which never happens,

31
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,819
so I'm gonna try to get some rest

32
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:17,254
'cause it's a long week, but I'll sneak

33
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:20,157
in there real quick, kiss some babies.

34
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:22,141
It's (laughs) I'm gonna
get mobbed this week.

35
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:22,974
(laughter)

36
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:23,807
- So need to be careful with myself.

37
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:24,950
- Here we are.
- See ya.

38
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,016
How are the kids?

39
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,849
- [Shelley] Everyone is really good.

40
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:27,682
- Everyone's good?
- Everyone is really--

41
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:29,147
Jay?
- Good holiday?

42
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:31,760
- You have changed his life, truly.

43
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,971
- So awesome.
He,

44
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,040
not knowing that we

45
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,998
were connected--
- I know, I know.

46
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:36,339
- He's been following
you, you realize that?

47
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:37,239
- Yes, yes, yes.
- He said to me,

48
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,968
"Mom," do you know Gary Vee?

49
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:40,027
- Yes, I remember this story.

50
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:40,971
- Okay?

51
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:45,273
And now he writes like Gary
Vee on his LinkedIn, and as--

52
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,478
- I saw that, but there are

53
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:47,630
words!
- 15,000

54
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,042
views in a minute?
- (laughs) I love it!

55
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,521
- Like something like that, like--

56
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,494
- I love it.
- He's not

57
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:52,910
the Gary Vee status yet,
but I gotta tell you,

58
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,154
watch him.
- On his way?

59
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:55,491
- 'Cause he's damn close.
- I better--

60
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,842
Time to get back to work!
- You better watch out!

61
00:01:56,842 --> 00:01:58,323
- Let's go, Babs!

62
00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:00,021
I love it, good for him.
- He's catching up,

63
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,603
and his confidence, I mean he always had

64
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,364
that confidence--
- Yeah, but now it's--

65
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:09,208
- It's an educated confidence, you know?

66
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,104
- Yeah!

67
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:12,545
- And so it's really quite remarkable.

68
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:13,503
- That makes me happy.
- You know, you gotta

69
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:16,565
bottle that, so I really
cannot thank you enough.

70
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,540
- That makes me super happy, but listen,

71
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,213
we can create the
framework, but it takes them

72
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:22,274
to take advantage of it.
- Absolutely.

73
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:24,409
- You know, he did.
- But even--

74
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,018
- Here we are in a partnership dinner

75
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:27,784
with the Female Quotient, Shelley Zalis

76
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:30,395
is one of the most interesting and dynamic

77
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:32,395
executives that I know in the game,

78
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:34,589
and VaynerX, PureWow, and VaynerMedia

79
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:37,969
have teamed up with FQ,
the Female Quotient,

80
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,787
or the Girls' Lounge,
all her incredible energy

81
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:43,537
on the most important issues like

82
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,903
quality, not only on the
female scale, but just life.

83
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:49,587
Just an incredibly fascinating woman

84
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,084
that I've gotten to know
over the last five years,

85
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,329
who I have an enormous
amount of respect for.

86
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,637
Sharp as a tack, heart
of gold, big time brain.

87
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,518
Just love her energy, character.

88
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:03,658
Wait 'til you see her
puffy (laughs) pink coat,

89
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:05,083
but nonetheless, we're gonna do a little

90
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,936
fireside chat here and talk about

91
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,680
the quality issues in the marketing world

92
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,184
as we see across the world, and how do you

93
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:12,434
not over-pander, how do
you not under-pander?

94
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:15,190
Should be a good, great question

95
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,823
to a great group, and I like these

96
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,534
kinda small dinners
where you get to think,

97
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,228
and that's what tonight'll be about.

98
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:23,286
I think, you know--

99
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,456
The thing that's been running through

100
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,176
my mind quite a bit around change

101
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:28,843
is respectful disrespect, right?

102
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,121
You know, you were talking about--

103
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:34,203
This is a true scene, we actually

104
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:35,509
have it on film in the back room

105
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:36,572
before this started.
- Oh, no!

106
00:03:36,572 --> 00:03:39,430
- We're talking about
the main stage at CES

107
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,517
and the issues that I'm
sure we'll get to tonight.

108
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:43,665
And I literally asked Shelley,

109
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:46,575
I'm like, "Where is the main stage?"

110
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:47,432
(Shelley and audience laugh)

111
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:48,315
What is the main stage?

112
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,371
I've been coming to CES for six years.

113
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:52,917
I've never gone to the conference.

114
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:53,900
(laughter)

115
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,298
I didn't know there was a main stage

116
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:58,941
at CES until some of my friends texted me

117
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:02,774
about like, let's break
the main stage, right?

118
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:05,247
In that moment back there, I'm like,

119
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,897
"It's respectful disrespect."

120
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,953
I'm not disrespecting CES.

121
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:11,544
I'm not mad at the status quo.

122
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,893
I'm just not spending any time on it

123
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,459
because the only way you can change

124
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,800
is when you don't accept
what's already been accepted.

125
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,720
You're just only focused on one thing,

126
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,762
which is the reality of the marketplace,

127
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,099
the young consumer, whatever
you're doing for a living.

128
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,061
So for me I think, you know, listen,

129
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:29,658
when you're an entrepreneur, you don't

130
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:31,475
have somebody judging you,
the results judge you,

131
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:33,196
and so maybe it's been easier for me

132
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:34,900
than a lot of you that are executives,

133
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,693
so I have a lot of empathy to that.

134
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,111
But I do think that respectful disrespect

135
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:43,425
is what comes to mind in
making change, which is

136
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,916
I'm fascinated by people looking backwards

137
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,486
because nothing that happened yesterday

138
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:50,285
is what gets you to the next place

139
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:52,083
except the thematics, but the details

140
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,336
and the execution change, and so

141
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,709
to me, when we were talking about this,

142
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,383
I asked you, "Who picks
the people for the panel?"

143
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,841
(laughter)

144
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,530
This stuff is so simple!
- (laughing) He did say that!

145
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,430
- I have a lot of CEOs
who are always like,

146
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,643
"I'm mad at my
salespeople," and I ask her,

147
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:10,276
"Well, change their bonus structure."

148
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,417
You can get any salesperson
to do anything you want

149
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:15,146
in the world by making the bonuses

150
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,864
reflect what you want to happen.

151
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:19,629
If you wanna do more
Facebook stuff, make an

152
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,381
arbitrary bonus that if you do seven

153
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:24,780
Facebook things, you
receive 80% of your bonus.

154
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,326
And then everybody will do that,

155
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,121
and so for me, I think we shouldn't

156
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,831
even talk about this tonight.

157
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,580
I think we need to figure out who's

158
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,334
picking it, and mandate, and move on.

159
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:38,875
- But there's been a lot of conversation.

160
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,428
I don't want to say controversy,

161
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,049
but a lot of conversation with CES

162
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,826
this year on women on the main stage.

163
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:48,497
I think you've all seen a lot of press

164
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:50,521
and more importantly, a lot of tweets

165
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:53,772
around it, and people kinda arguing

166
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:57,182
about why this and why that, and so

167
00:05:57,182 --> 00:06:00,735
Steven has been instrumental with UM

168
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,860
and CBS Interactive, so I wanna thank

169
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,197
all of our amazing
(Gary applauds)

170
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:06,653
partners for bold leadership.

171
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:09,204
(applause)

172
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:11,037
We'll be having--

173
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,286
- I agree 100%, I love the concept.

174
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:14,844
What we're gonna do is go around.

175
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:15,840
We're gonna give you a little bit of time

176
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,848
to think about this, but this is not about

177
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:19,366
four to seven, or eleven people

178
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:21,543
getting up here and taking the mic.

179
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:22,682
When you look at the pedigree of everybody

180
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,615
in this room, whether they're in

181
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,338
the beginning of their
career or later in it,

182
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:26,683
everybody here has something to add,

183
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:29,388
so we're gonna go around
and ask everybody for what

184
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,600
their point of view is,
as an actionable item

185
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,975
to make this better,
and take all 50 thoughts

186
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:38,103
and consolidate them and create an output.

187
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,860
That's what we wanna challenge
everybody to think about.

188
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,173
Like what's the actionable item,

189
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:44,994
like if you're the Lord
of executing this fix.

190
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:45,975
- Or the Lordess.

191
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,809
- Or the Lordess of fixing--
- Just saying.

192
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:51,441
- Just saying, of executing this fix,

193
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:52,914
what is your point of view?

194
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:57,081
(soft, inspirational electronic music)

195
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:14,637
And I've just been listening, and I think

196
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:16,108
about things quite a bit, about

197
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:19,584
in a very basic term
of offense and defense.

198
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:20,684
I think a lot of what we're talking

199
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:23,476
about tonight is defense, or reacting.

200
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,363
So Battle of the Sexes, Billie Jean King

201
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,577
did not convince the
UTA to change the rules.

202
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:32,782
They created the Virginia
Slims Tournament.

203
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:34,333
Nice, but we're not
talking about the reality

204
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,889
of that situation, which is they built

205
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,830
a different thing, which
they were in control of,

206
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,506
and so whether it's my idea of dictating

207
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:44,900
or grassroots, it's still,
there's a gatekeeper.

208
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,161
We need to understand real life.

209
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,470
I think everybody here
does, and so instead

210
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,456
of pandering to the
gatekeeper, to me it's binary.

211
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:53,447
Either we go back to let's figure out

212
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,686
who the 54 gatekeepers
are and collectively

213
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:58,718
put pressure on them, and/or create

214
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:01,897
our own thing and all go there.

215
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:05,035
I really just genuinely
believe it's A or B.

216
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,861
One of my favorite
things about even coming

217
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,528
to events like this and then micro-events

218
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:11,576
within events like this,
is meeting new people.

219
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,616
So fun little thing on your way out

220
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:15,872
to the elevator, I think
there's a lot of people here

221
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,137
that don't know each other that should,

222
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:20,126
so one face that you don't recognize,

223
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,331
and say, "Hello," I think would be

224
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:23,911
a really good, tangible execution.

225
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:26,647
Hope you have a great
CES and a healthy 2018.

226
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:27,480
Thanks for coming.

227
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,801
(applause)
(indistinct chatter)

228
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,130
(dramatic piano music)

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,947
♪ I don't know what you see in me ♪

230
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,346

232
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,445
