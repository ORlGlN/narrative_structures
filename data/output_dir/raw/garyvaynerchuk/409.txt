1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:04,417
- I don't do any email at all,
which is how I do my work

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:05,667
when I'm actually working.

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:08,291
The only time I do
email is when I fly,

4
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,542
even though it's
what I'm supposed to do.

5
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:14,250
Because when I'm on the ground,
that's the time to do this.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,500
So you're answer, and
your advantage is time.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,208
You need to outwork
the people that have money.

8
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:25,166
There's three variables, three
pillars: time, money, talent.

9
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,333
Talent is hard to control.

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,375
Money, you don't have yet.

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,500
Time is your only friend.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,750
What you do between
7 P.M. and three in the morning

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,583
will ultimately probably be
the variable of your success.

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,083
Now if you lack talent,
you can work for the rest

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,917
your life, you're not gonna win.

16
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:45,417
So you need to
be smart about that.

17
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,250
And then there's the strategy
of what you're building.

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,000
If you're building a
piece of shit, you've lost.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,417
But the thing that's most
controllable in sales is time.

20
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,041
- [Man] Okay, thank you.
- You got it.

21
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,583
- [Man 2] Hi Gary.
- How are you?

22
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,834
- Fine, thank you.

23
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,917
I'm one of the
co-founders of Flavor.

24
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:03,125
Flavor is an online platform
where everyone between everyone

25
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,959
can sell homemade meals online

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,125
to other people
in the neighborhood.

27
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,542
- Interesting, there was
a company that I looked at

28
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:12,417
several years ago
that had a similar concept.

29
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,291
And I love the theory, go ahead.

30
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,083
- [Man 2] We're now
selling over 100 meals

31
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,583
per day here in Belgium only,
Antwerp and the surroundings.

32
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,417
My question, very obvious,
but how do you build

33
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,291
a sustainable
two-sided marketplace?

34
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,125
So meaning growing both supply

35
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,875
and demand side
at the same time.

36
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:33,542
- It's hard, it's why
Uber and Airbnb are special.

37
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:36,959
You need to always
obsess about both.

38
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,125
And the thing that I've seen
most two-way marketplaces,

39
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:43,625
'cause everybody's the
Uber and Airbnb of X, right?

40
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,959
They over-index on one side or
the other and then it breaks.

41
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,708
The tension of making
both great is all you've got.

42
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,250
So you have to literally,
you basically have to be a

43
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,708
perfect parent of two children.

44
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,458
You actually have to
love both of them equally.

45
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,458
So whenever you feel,
and one of the challenges of

46
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,875
loving your children equally
is they live their lives.

47
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,708
And when one's seven
and one's six, maybe that

48
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,542
six year old is having
a tough time and you're

49
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:14,500
spending 80% there, because
the seven year old's okay.

50
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,959
But you better not spend
too much time, because then

51
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,917
if you don't spend too much
time on the seven year old,

52
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:18,959
it might crack.

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,667
And that's a
two-way marketplace.

54
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:24,250
You have to figure out
what the health of both are,

55
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,917
and you have to
equally have, from strategy,

56
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,333
real strategy against both,

57
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,917
and then you have to
adjust on a day-to-day basis

58
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,875
if one is underperforming.

59
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,500
- [Man 2] And probably
start fairly local

60
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,166
and see how it goes there?

61
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,917
- Yeah, nobody's ever
won two-way marketplaces

62
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,792
by going global right away.

63
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,708
They always lose, they raise
too much capital, it's hard.

64
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,500
I loved the way you explained
it, like a hundred (inaudible).

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,250
I'm like, okay
good start, you know?

66
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,542
Now the question becomes
what's the addressable market?

67
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,834
How big should and
could you get here?

68
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:00,417
If that answer is
40,000 meals a day,

69
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,333
you got a lot of work to do.

70
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,375
If that answer is 1,500,

71
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,875
not so long before you start
thinking about where else.

72
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,500
My intuition is it's
closer to 40,000 than 1,500.

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,417
So you got a lot of work to do.

74
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:12,208
- [Man 2] Well yes, yes.

75
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,166
- Yeah.
(audience laughter)

76
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,875
But it's about
keeping the eye on the ball.

77
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,500
And about caring
about both sides,

78
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,542
and by doing, back to time,
unscalable things.

79
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,375
You know everybody wants to
find that perfect ad product

80
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,792
that gets awareness,
but they don't want to go to

81
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,333
the farmer's market
and shake people's hand,

82
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,625
or like, tried-and-true
things always work.

83
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,208
Like you still
have eight good friends

84
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,417
and family members who
don't use your product.

85
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,500
- [Man 2] Probably yeah.

86
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,291
- That's insane, fix that.
- [Man 2] Okay.

87
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,291
- You should have
108 people every day.

88
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,458
Do you know what I mean though?

89
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,166
- [Man 2] I'll start
calling them.

90
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,041
- But you know what I mean?
That's important.

91
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,834
That's important, I think
people forget, everybody's

92
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,250
thinking about scale,
and they're not looking at

93
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,625
what's in front of them.

94
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,750
Like, every single
person you went to school with,

95
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,542
every acquaintance,
like everybody.

96
00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:00,834
How many people are using it
every day, raise your hand?

97
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:01,834
(group laughter)

98
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:04,959
How many people have used it?

99
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,542
You got work to do.

100
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,375
I look at that as awesome.

101
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,333
Like that's fun, that means
you have a lot of opportunity.

102
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,500
- [Man 2] It is.
- You know what I mean?

103
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,959
- [Man 2] Yeah.
- Cool.

104
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,000
- [Man 2] Okay, thanks.
- You're welcome.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,625
- [Yannick] Hello.
- Hey.

106
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,000
- [Yannick] I am Yannick
from Seal Jobs.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,125
- How are you?
- [Yannick] Good, thank you.

108
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,542
And I have a more
personal question.

109
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:24,375
- Good.

110
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,583
- [Yannick] How would you
describe the best

111
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,333
possible startup
CEO/cofounder?

112
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:35,291
- That's interesting,
so I'm big on sales.

113
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,250
In general, for me
personally, and this is not a

114
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,667
tried-and-true answer, for me.

115
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,458
I love people that have
sold stuff in their life.

116
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,708
There's something consistent
about it that's really

117
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,417
worked out for me
in the last 20 years.

118
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,708
And they could be
tech nerdy, you know they,

119
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,375
the kids I liked coming
up the game with like

120
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,458
ripped music from Napster put
on CDs and sell it in schools.

121
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,875
So it was a little tech, it
was a little product right?

122
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,417
I was baseball cards
and lemonade,

123
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,250
some people
were candy.

124
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,291
So I like sales.

125
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:11,375
I try to figure out as
hard core as I can,

126
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:15,542
do they need to do this
because they can't breathe

127
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,041
if they did anything else?

128
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,792
Or are they doing it
because they think there's more

129
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,458
money in it, or
because it's cool now?

130
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,458
I think that 95% of the
startup founders that I meet

131
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,291
are doing it for
the other two things.

132
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,333
They're either doing it cause
they think the most money

133
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,875
is there, 'cause they
get seduced by the exits

134
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,166
they read about.

135
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,291
Or because it's now cool
to be a startup founder.

136
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,166
So I hate the current
state of startup, hate it.

137
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,583
I've not been investing at all

138
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,166
for the last year and a half.

139
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,500
Nothing, I've made a
couple big investments

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,333
and things that
I'm really involved in.

141
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,208
But, the kinda stuff that
you guys are mainly doing,

142
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,125
I'm not even taking meetings.

143
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,959
Because I feel like
we have the greatest era

144
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,083
of fake entreprenuership ever.

145
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,959
In the U.S., it just
became so big and powerful

146
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,792
and popular, everybody did it.

147
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,708
And in other places,
it was good for the country,

148
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,959
the region, it was
the right thing to do.

149
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,000
Which is both true,

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,417
the problem is it brings a
lot of people into the game

151
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:10,542
that aren't meant to be.

152
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,542
So my biggest things
that I'm looking for the best

153
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,125
entrepreneur and
founder is are they

154
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:18,166
an entrepreneur and founder,
or are they acting like one?

155
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,750
And that takes,
and that's too hard.

156
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,166
And unlike the advice I gave
downstairs about hire and fire,

157
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,041
you can't unfire a
$100,000 investment, you know?

158
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,875
And so, I think that I look
for people that are driven,

159
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,166
patient and not fancy.

160
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,375
The amount of people
that are founders of companies

161
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,041
who go skiing on the weekend,

162
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,333
who go to every
marketing meetup event,

163
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,959
who take selfies with
micro-celebrities.

164
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,250
We're in such a bullshit era.

165
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,125
Basically, club promoters have
taken over entrepreneurship.

166
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,583
- It's the truth.

167
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,750
And the reason there's giggles
and head nods is we know it.

168
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,625
Just became cool.

169
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,458
Do you know what a
startup tech entrepreneur

170
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,500
looked like 10 years ago?

171
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,667
Not like this.

172
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,708
And not meaning,

173
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,875
I'm sure there's
some in this room.

174
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,750
But none were attractive,

175
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,458
none were cool.

176
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,166
It was some nerd-ass shit.

177
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,333
Like I got in it pretty early,

178
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,542
and I was like, "Where the,"

179
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,667
It was like,

180
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,000
and I was
friends with everybody.

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,375
But this was like geek culture.

182
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,458
Web 2.0 were geeks.

183
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,708
Period, end of story.

184
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,500
If you were a
startup founder in 2006,

185
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,417
you were a geek, geek, geek.

186
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,208
You know what else I look for?

187
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,667
A lot of people are
building tech companies

188
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:47,083
with no tech person
in their company.

189
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,834
They're an
entrepreneur with an idea,

190
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,750
and they think they can
outsource the development.

191
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,083
And they're in
the tech business.

192
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,583
So there's just a lot
of fake shit going on.

193
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,458
Cool.

194
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,708
- [Yannick] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

195
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,542
Hey.
- [Lucie] Hi.

196
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,417
- How are you?

197
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:01,667
- [Lucie] Fine, thank you.
- Good.

198
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,834
- [Lucie] I'm Lucie,
I'm from BookWidgets.

199
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,375
We have platform for teachers,

200
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,792
where they can
create interactive exercises

201
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,208
for their students,

202
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,667
to motivate them more.

203
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,250
- Love it.

204
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,500
And the content would
be used in the classroom?

205
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,708
Or outside the classroom?
- In the classroom, or iPads.

206
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,750
- Okay. Yep, whatever.

207
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,250
Right, go ahead.

208
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,417
- [Lucie] Well, the problem is

209
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,500
that teachers
are very traditional.

210
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,625
- Yes.
- [Lucie] So my question is,

211
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:29,792
how do you
convince traditional people

212
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,166
to be not traditional?

213
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,041
- You don't.

214
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,375
You do one of two things,

215
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,750
you either
emphatically, aggressively,

216
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,000
through your sheer will,

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,792
and being not politically
correct get them there,

218
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,667
or you wait
until they get there.

219
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,625
You can't fight the market.

220
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,041
Now, couple of questions,

221
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,208
and I don't know the
school system here very well,

222
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,375
is there
anything within the system

223
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,166
that won't let them do that?

224
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,917
Like does the teacher
actually make the decision,

225
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:01,166
or does she or he
have to play in the rules

226
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,166
of the superintendent,
the government,

227
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,875
is there something else that's
not letting them use it?

228
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,417
It's not that
they don't believe,

229
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,583
it's that they can't,

230
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:12,333
because they can have an
issue if something happens.

231
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,291
- [Lucie] There
is a little issue.

232
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,500
Actually, a big issue
that technology in schools,

233
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,708
it's not update-to-date,

234
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,959
not every school
has the technology.

235
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,500
But it's getting there,

236
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,041
so we are convincing
the teachers to get,

237
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,375
even one iPad is
enough to use it.

238
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,834
So to convince them to
use an iPad, that's all--

239
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:34,500
- Can you give them the iPad?

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,834
- [Lucie] That's not
our intention--

241
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,417
- Why?

242
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,417
- [Lucie] Just because--

243
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,291
- You haven't
thought about it yet?

244
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,208
- [Lucie] No.
- Okay.

245
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,291
(audience laughter)

246
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,000
- It's okay.

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,375
And do you guys
have the money to do it?

248
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:47,917
- [Lucie] No.

249
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,792
- Right, so I would reach out,

250
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:52,875
and so I would go home tonight,

251
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,000
and I would send an email

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,959
to Samsung, and Apple,
and Microsoft, and Google

253
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
and I would ask
one of those companies.

254
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,208
So Windows, Microsoft's
tablet is not doing great.

255
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,959
You might be able to
get 50 of them for free.

256
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,417
Go ask.

257
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,750
And then give it.

258
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,917
And now you've
eliminated one of your problems.

259
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,125
But a lot of startups
will go out of business

260
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,041
'cause they were too early.

261
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,208
And so one of the naive
things that all of us do,

262
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,166
including me,

263
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,458
is we think it's
going to happen faster than

264
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,208
it actually happens.

265
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,417
So you've gotta be careful with

266
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:30,959
what I heard
really quickly here,

267
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,625
to make sure that
you're not too early.

268
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,500
And if you are,

269
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,041
how do you adjust to stay alive,

270
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,750
until the market comes to you.

271
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,041
You're welcome.

272
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,375
DRock?

273
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,041
No?
Okay, next.

274
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,792
- Hi, Gary--
- Oh I'm sorry.

275
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:46,875
I'm sorry, brother.

276
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,708
- [Nico] I was
supposed to sit over there.

277
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,792
- DRock fucked you up.
(audience laughter)

278
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:51,875
Jesus, DRock.

279
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:52,625
- [Man 3] I was trying to
sit close to you guys.

280
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,375
- Yeah, I get it, I got it.

281
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,708
Too much to the light.

282
00:10:55,708 --> 00:11:00,041
- [Nico] I'm Nico, cofounder
of startup Impovide,

283
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,125
another question for you.

284
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,583
In this globalized world,--
- Yes?

285
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,959
is the USA still an
important market--

286
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,208
- USA?
- [Nico] USA.

287
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,333
- Yes.
For many European startups?

288
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,458
- Yes.

289
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,125
- [Nico] Of course.

290
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:20,125
Do you expect big impact of
the ambition of President Trump

291
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,375
to protect this market?

292
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,166
- That's a good question.

293
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,583
- [Nico] How can we counter it?

294
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,583
And what for SaaS?

295
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,500
- My intuition is, right now,

296
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,166
and by the way, the answer
is I have no fucking idea,

297
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,375
comma, based on what I'm
seeing him doing right now,

298
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,041
he's more worried about
getting jobs to stay in America

299
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:45,458
for very old school
construction, manufacturing.

300
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,458
He's worried about the states

301
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,625
that he has to win
in his next election.

302
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,333
So he's more worried
about Ohio, and Pennsylvania,

303
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,417
and Michigan.

304
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:56,417
And so I don't know.

305
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,834
But I'll be honest with you.

306
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,917
With the amount
of European startups

307
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:02,542
that have had real
success in the U.S. market,

308
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,542
President Trump
might be your last problem.

309
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,625
(audience laughter)

310
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,291
Do you know what I mean?
- [Nico] Also no borders,

311
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,542
so it he cannot protect it.

312
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,333
- Well, be careful,
anything can happen.

313
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,083
Russia and China have proven
that the internets has borders.

314
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,041
And I take nothing for granted.

315
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,041
Especially,
being born in Russia.

316
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,834
I wouldn't rely on that.

317
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,542
I would remind you
to be more practical,

318
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:28,750
which is there are not that
many winning startups in Europe

319
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,250
dominating in a U.S.
market environment.

320
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,875
I think your bigger problem
is the other U.S. startups,

321
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,542
that are doing
what you're going to do,

322
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,667
much more than the
President of the United States.

323
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,750
- [Nico] What's the reason
you think for that?

324
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,750
Europeans startups
not making it in the U.S.?

325
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,875
- Well, I think a
lot of it is talent.

326
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,959
I think that one
advantage that U.S. has

327
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,792
is that the most
talented kids from America,

328
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,917
all migrate to Silicon Valley,

329
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:56,500
and then you
basically have this ecosystem

330
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,625
of a lot of talented
engineers and product people

331
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,542
that are teaming up.

332
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,959
It's just a talent game,

333
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,291
and it's very easy to
move within the U.S. from,

334
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,208
to San Francisco.

335
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,458
So the talent,
I actually think plays out.

336
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,834
I think entrepreneurship

337
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:11,333
is inherently rewarded
in the United States,

338
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,875
while it's still
historically in Europe,

339
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,500
it's finally chipping away,

340
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,750
it's why I'm so
happy to be here.

341
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,208
But historically,
failing in America,

342
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,667
though tough,
is not a deathblow.

343
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,583
Failing in Europe
is a scarlet letter.

344
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,834
And that has been the death
of entrepreneurship over time,

345
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:31,834
in Europe.

346
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,542
I think that
there's infrastructure

347
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,792
in history of consumer behavior.

348
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,667
The internet is just,

349
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,458
though you see
interesting things,

350
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,917
like the U.K. market has a
healthier e-commerce business

351
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:45,083
than the U.S.
market in a lot of ways.

352
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,000
But I think a
couple of those factors,

353
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,417
Venture Capital
money is consolidated,

354
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:50,792
which is giving a lot of people

355
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,208
the ability to build businesses

356
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,500
that don't have
to be profitable,

357
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,583
and have been
able to get through

358
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,875
and build very big businesses.

359
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,959
And the
infrastructure of communication.

360
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,375
The biggest
websites in the world,

361
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,291
the far majority of
them outside of China,

362
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,667
East-based companies
are based in the U.S.,

363
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,333
and China is a closed door.

364
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,750
So nobody's
really doing much there.

365
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,041
It's insular nationalism.

366
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,625
Whereas a lot of
people are doing it.

367
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,708
Now, that being said,

368
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,166
Spotify, SoundCloud,
there's amazing accomplishments

369
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,250
that have worked over there.

370
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,458
But I think
you're going so macro,

371
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,875
I'm way more
concerned about the micro.

372
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,083
I think you can't focus,
or be crippled by that,

373
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,166
you just need focus on even
being able to win that game,

374
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,792
if that's your ambition.
You know?

375
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:30,625
The good news is,

376
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,041
if you win that game,

377
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,667
that means that
you've raised a lot of money

378
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,375
from a lot of
very important people,

379
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,125
who will deploy that
political and financial capital

380
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,208
against you staying alive.

381
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,208
To win in the U.S.,

382
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,667
you've built a
billion dollar company.

383
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,542
Unless you're looking

384
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,041
to build a very
practical small business,

385
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,458
and then I would
diversify, period.

386
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,458
Then you don't
need the U.S. necessarily.

387
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,959
Do you know what I mean?

388
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,625
You need the US if
you're going global

389
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,959
and building a
billion dollar company.

390
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,500
You don't need
the U.S. to build a 10,

391
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,917
or even $100 million business.

392
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:00,750
You got it.

393
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,583
Hey, man.

394
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,792
- [Dries] I'm
Dries from LifePower.

395
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:03,625
- How are you?

396
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,750
- [Dries] Good, good, thanks.
- Good.

397
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,500
- [Dries] We're building a next
generation of power products

398
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,125
among which an
electric motorcycle.

399
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,667
My question to you is
since time is so limited

400
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:17,166
and precious for
us as entrepreneurs,

401
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,583
how do you decide
whether or not to go

402
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,542
for a business opportunity
when it presents itself?

403
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,458
For example,
a customer pops up and says,

404
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,667
"Hey, but can't you
do this custom for us?"

405
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,792
and we're like, "That
could be possible, but--"

406
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,667
- But it takes away
from our core mission.

407
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:32,875
- [Dries] Exactly.
- So classic.

408
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,125
- [Dries] Exactly.

409
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,291
It's a go or no go strategy.

410
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,041
- That is gonna be
predicated on how good you are.

411
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,041
- [Dries] Okay.

412
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,625
- Those are decisions
I can't make for you.

413
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,792
There's not tried-and-true.

414
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:46,583
There's been plenty of
people who did a side project,

415
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,834
customized, which did two
things: gave them the money

416
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,750
to stay alive and
showed them something

417
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,834
they never thought of

418
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,500
which then built
their biggest product.

419
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,333
Then, there's been
companies that got distracted

420
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,417
and became an agency in
the client service business

421
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,583
and missed their opportunity.

422
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,041
Both have
happened a trillion times.

423
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,708
No guy from the U.S.
who's been successful

424
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,458
is gonna tell
you the right answer.

425
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,667
You're gonna make those calls

426
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,875
and your success is
gonna be predicated on it.

427
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,583
You know what the
best part about that is?

428
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,083
That's the way it should be.

429
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,959
That's what capitalism
and meritocracy is.

430
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,000
How good are you?

431
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,959
Did you make the right call?

432
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,458
'Cause they're both right,

433
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,625
but they're not
both right for you.

434
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,708
Question is will you make the
right call when it matters?

435
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,417
- [Dries] We'll see.
- We'll see.

436
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:27,166
But that's the answer.

437
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,083
Don't be crippled by it and
more importantly, don't--

438
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:30,917
(laughing)

439
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,458
- [Dries] Fast, make that
decision really, really fast.

440
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,125
- [Man] Flip coin.

441
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,250
- They're literally
potentially both right.

442
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,959
If it doesn't
come to you right away,

443
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,125
it's only gonna get harder.

444
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,959
The more you sit on something,
it gets harder, not easier.

445
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,667
- [Dries] True.

446
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:46,041
- People think like
they're gonna figure it out.

447
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,291
They're gonna figure
it out by tasting it.

448
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,458
Should I eat this cherry?

449
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,917
Will I like it?

450
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,792
The right strategy is
to fuckin' eat the cherry.

451
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,000
Right?

452
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,583
Then you'll know.

453
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,291
Truth is, you
should probably do both.

454
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,500
- [Dries] If we can, 
but if we can't.

455
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
- If you can.

456
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,583
- [Dries] That
works a couple of times,

457
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,915
but if a tenth person
is ringing at your door,

458
00:17:06,915 --> 00:17:08,082
it's like, oh.

459
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,125
- Yeah, but then if the tenth
person's ringing at your door,

460
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,040
you need to
figure out why the fuck

461
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,790
they're ringing at your door.

462
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,164
Maybe the right move is
to actually build a business

463
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:17,083
that does do that
and is highly profitable

464
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,083
so that you have cash
when the world dries up of cash

465
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,000
and you're not at the
mercy of VCs and raising money,

466
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,790
but you actually made
cash 'cause you were an agency

467
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,749
for four years and then you're
37Signals and Jason Fried

468
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,500
which is they were an
agency and they converted

469
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,000
into their product and
they became a huge business.

470
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,750
People are fancy.

471
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,375
People when they have
nothing say dumb shit like,

472
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,792
"Yes, but the economics are
in building our own product,

473
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,417
"not in services."

474
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,417
You don't have anything.

475
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:45,834
- [Dries] Yet.

476
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:46,875
- Yet.

477
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,208
But the best way to
have something is actually

478
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,500
do something
that's bringing you money.

479
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,834
- [Dries] Good choice.

480
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:54,917
- I think so.

481
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,041
- [Josef] Hi, Gary.
- Hey.

482
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,083
- [Josef] I'm Josef for Audiome.

483
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,959
We do iPhone repair
on location, on spot.

484
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:02,708
- That's cool.

485
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,708
- [Josef] My question for
you was how do you expand?

486
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,083
- How quickly?

487
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,542
- [Josef] Like in 30 minutes.
- Great.

488
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,667
- [Josef] How do you
expand in new cities

489
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,583
without being there
yourself to promote it?

490
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,917
- By being there
yourself through either you

491
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:18,250
or the person you
trust the most in the world.

492
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,166
The end.

493
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,875
When Travis was expanding Uber,
he either went to the market

494
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,375
or Ryan Graves
went to the market

495
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,625
'cause he trusted him the most.

496
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,500
- [Josef] Okay.

497
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,458
- And he did that
for five or six markets

498
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,375
until Patrick in Chicago showed
that he was worth trusting

499
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,750
and now Patrick
and Ryan and Travis.

500
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,667
Everybody's trying to scale.

501
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:42,959
Scaling the unscalable is how
you get to the point of scale,

502
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:46,375
so either your number
two has got Belgium on lock

503
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,166
and you can go to Paris

504
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:52,041
or she or he can go to Paris,

505
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,959
but don't hire
somebody on a whim

506
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,000
because you don't know
what you're dealing with

507
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,625
and then you lose.

508
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,708
Or you can win.

509
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,667
- [Josef] Yeah, yeah.

510
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:02,834
- But you're risking it.

511
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,875
I don't think opening a
new market is worth risk

512
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,500
'cause it can take you down.

513
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,834
So what I like
to do is over hire.

514
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:14,583
I would probably hire
an extra person or two here

515
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,333
and really start testing and
tasting and understanding them

516
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,250
to be ready to
move one of 'em there.

517
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,041
- [Josef] Nice.

518
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,667
- If you're only in one market,

519
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,917
I'd probably move
to the second market.

520
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,625
- [Josef] Thanks.
- You got it.

521
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,291
- [Nicholas] Hi, Gary.
- Hey, man.

522
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,125
- [Nicholas] I am
Nicholas from Plannr.

523
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,375
- How are you?
- [Nicholas] I'm really good.

524
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,792
I'm really grateful to
be here right here with you.

525
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:33,708
- Thanks, bro.

526
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,375
- [Nicholas] We created
a solution for businesses

527
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,500
to make group meeting
scheduling a lot more easier.

528
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,250
- Okay.

529
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,625
- [Nicholas] My
question for you is

530
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,708
how can you use storytelling
in a more B2B setting?

531
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,041
- Okay.
Let's go back to the product.

532
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,417
What are you solving?

533
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,625
- [Nicholas] The problem
of scheduling meetings,

534
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,708
but more like for
businesses 'cause for example,

535
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,667
I'm a consultant.

536
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:54,500
- Yes.

537
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,959
- [Nicholas] And if I
have to work in the company,

538
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,000
I need to meet with the CEO,

539
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,708
meet with the marketing advisor,

540
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,708
and they all have
really busy schedules.

541
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,875
With my tool, I can
just send you one invite,

542
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,083
it takes 30 seconds,

543
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,375
and we find the perfect
moment to have that meeting.

544
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,041
- Are you integrated
into Google Calendar's API?

545
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,959
- [Nicholas] Of course.

546
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,792
Google Calendar,
Office 365, Exchange, iCloud,

547
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,667
all of the big players and we
even have really smart plugins

548
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,917
that work in your
Gmail, in your Outlook.

549
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,208
One click and that's it.

550
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,041
- Got it.

551
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,125
Look, it takes all that data

552
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,291
and surfaces up what
the right opportunity is?

553
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,667
- [Nicholas] Yeah, it takes
the data in your calendar,

554
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,917
but also your location,
your travel time,

555
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,792
your personal preferences,
like a sniff of AI on top

556
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,792
to make like all the stuff
that your personal assistant

557
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,917
would do, we do that for you
and just pick the right moment.

558
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:40,125
- If you put in the inputs or
through only API integrations?

559
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,000
- [Nicholas] Yeah,
we use the information

560
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,583
that's in your calendar already.

561
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,083
- Got it.

562
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,375
So you're trying to figure out

563
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,875
how to build top-of-the-funnel
awareness for the product?

564
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,041
- [Nicholas] Yeah, but
I really like the concept

565
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,458
of storytelling and I would
like to use it somehow

566
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,041
in our B2B marketing strategy.

567
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,542
- Right, so storytelling in
the way that you want to do it

568
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,500
comes in the form of
making a three-minute video

569
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,125
that is a scene out of a sitcom

570
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,625
that shows how your
utility fixes the problem.

571
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,708
- [Nicholas] Yeah.

572
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,208
- So what I would do is like,

573
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,959
I don't know if you guys
have "The Office" as a show?

574
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:17,583
Good.

575
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,959
So I would make
a four minute video.

576
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,083
Here's storytelling.

577
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:25,125
You make a four minute video
that starts with an executive.

578
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,083
You just tell the story, right?

579
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,834
The executive's like,
"Fuck, I need to see Karl,

580
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:29,834
"but where's he?"

581
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:32,583
You just show the
problems or it's a scene

582
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,875
of two administrative assistants
having a beer and saying,

583
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,875
"You know what
really fuckin' sucks?

584
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,000
"When you've got
to schedule all three

585
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,583
"senior vice presidents
and they're all

586
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,917
"in three different markets."

587
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,250
You've basically got to
show a scene from a movie

588
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,667
or a sitcom, then you make
the video, then you run ads

589
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:52,375
on Facebook against
employees of the companies

590
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,333
that you're trying to sell to.

591
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,000
Then, people will see the video

592
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,208
and then they'll share
it with the decision maker.

593
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,166
- [Nicholas] Cool.

594
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:04,458
- That's just tangible
black and white B2B marketing.

595
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:08,000
Employees of
segmentation in Facebook is

596
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,834
one of the great underused

597
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:13,333
marketing tactics in a B2B
world.

598
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,250
So for example, if you
were selling a B2B product

599
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,000
and you're trying to get
to the CIO, you make a video

600
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,208
that the opening
line of the video is,

601
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,625
"Does your CIO know?"

602
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,667
If you do that, if
the person who watches it

603
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,000
is in a different department,

604
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,083
but they think it's interesting,

605
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,917
they click one button and
they share it with the CIO.

606
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,625
This is LinkedIn's
miss right now

607
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,417
and Facebook's opportunity.

608
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:42,083
If you care about storytelling,
then you go for humor.

609
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,375
- [Nicholas] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

610
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,208
- Or sad.

611
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,959
In storytelling, there's
tried-and-true emotions.

612
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:54,375
Humor, fear, sadness,
inspirational, you know.

613
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,375
Paint a picture.

614
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,041
Show me.
- [Nicholas] Cool.

615
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,166
- Right?
- [Nicholas] Yeah.

616
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,834
- Two people
walking into office,

617
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,500
getting coffee at nine o'clock.

618
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,375
How's your day?

619
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,208
Gonna suck.

620
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,750
Yours?
Gonna suck. Why?

621
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,083
He's traveling to 14 cities

622
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,667
and I have nine
meetings to make.

623
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,000
Me too.

624
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Two secretaries,
guy and gal talking.

625
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,125
Duh, duh, duh, duh,
duh, some nerd kid comes up.

626
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,000
He's like, "Why don't you use,"

627
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,959
what's the name of your company?

628
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,792
- [Nicholas] Plannr.

629
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:17,708
- "Why don't you use Plannr?

630
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,458
"What the fuck is Plannr?"

631
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,458
Duh, duh, duh,
duh, duh, duh, duh.

632
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,708
Everybody's happy.

633
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,959
(audience laughter)

634
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:24,750
Got it?

635
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,667
- [Nicholas] Yes, very good.

636
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,000
- Cool.
- [Nicholas] Thank you.

637
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
- [Ruben] Hi, Gary.

638
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,125
- By the way, real quick,
that's how Dollar Shave Club

639
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,083
created a one
billion dollar company.

640
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,250
One video.

641
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,041
Now, that's hard.

642
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:38,125
You might have to make 11
videos before that happens

643
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,500
and that might
cost you so much money

644
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,917
you go out of business,
but that's what it takes.

645
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,041
- [Josef] Okay, okay.

646
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,375
Hi Gary, I'm Ruben.

647
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,125
I hope you're enjoying
your time in Tech Summit.

648
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,000
- [Gary] I am,
thank you brother.

649
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,542
- [Ruben] Nicholas
already explained a bit

650
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,417
about the product, but
what I really want to know is

651
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:54,792
since you like predictions,
for B2B companies,

652
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:57,750
what are the new big players
in social media landscape

653
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,542
and how to define which
to use for your company?

654
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:04,208
- [Gary] B2B has
the same opportunity

655
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,667
and has the same
platforms as B2C,

656
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:11,375
but not every product works for
B2B the way it does for B2C.

657
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,375
So for example, Snapchat.

658
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,250
Snapchat's very
effective in the U.S.

659
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,041
It's very big,
obviously it's lost some steam

660
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,250
because of
Instagram copied features,

661
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,625
but it's still much bigger.

662
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,792
I mean people are so
funny, people are so lazy.

663
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:23,834
They're like "Oh it's dead!"

664
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes, it's dead.

665
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,208
Hundreds of
millions of active users!

666
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,083
Super dead! Ya know?

667
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,959
Might not work for
every single company

668
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,834
because the target of
who they're trying to get to

669
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,875
might not be using Snapchat.

670
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,375
But, if they are,
so for example,

671
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,917
if you guys decided the people

672
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,417
that actually would use Plannr

673
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,166
are actually 20 to 
30-year-old admins.

674
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,792
Now you're saying
"maybe they are on Snapchat."

675
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:51,959
Now, you know that
there's an open API.

676
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,333
There's an open
platform now where

677
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,917
Snapchat allows you
to make custom filters.

678
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:58,959
It's one of the
great deals of all time.

679
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,834
You wanna win
in the U.S. market?

680
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:05,083
It's five dollars for
20,000 square feet

681
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,500
for an hour.

682
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
So I don't think
this is open for here yet,

683
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,458
but if it was, or when it was,

684
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,083
I could have put a
filter for my B2B company

685
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:17,959
over all 300 people here,
let's say 80 of them used it,

686
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:20,000
for all three hours
that events were going on,

687
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,125
it would have cost
me $15 and the time that

688
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,917
it would have cost
me to create a filter,

689
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:28,166
and the 31 coolest people here,
youngest, most tech savvy,

690
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,041
would have seen my
filter, and that probably

691
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:33,792
would have been worth $15.

692
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:37,291
Or, I promise you
when it opens up here,

693
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,083
and now let's get
even more interesting,

694
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,834
there's an enormously big
match for your national team,

695
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,542
and you know the 15
biggest bars or pubs

696
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:49,041
or gathering places,
and now you buy it there

697
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,166
and that's just
general awareness.

698
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,583
That's just brand marketing.

699
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,917
So, nobody's thinking
that Snapchat's good for B2B

700
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,708
but what if the
biggest conference

701
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,125
for secretaries
and admins in the world

702
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,208
is happening in Hong Kong and
you buy your filter there?

703
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,500
(Ruben laughs)
Do you see?

704
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,125
People, I said it downstairs
and I'll say it here.

705
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,041
The key. back to your
first question my man.

706
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,708
The key for
if you're an entrepreneur

707
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,417
startup founder
of a young company,

708
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:18,125
you have to be the architect,

709
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,417
you have to be the
general contractor,

710
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:25,041
you have to be the mason,
the plumber, the garbage man.

711
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,792
The reason I am so fearful
of startup founders right now

712
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:32,041
is everybody wants
to be the architect.

713
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,333
You know?

714
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,875
You gotta be the executor.

715
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,166
The reason I have
so much bravado

716
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,041
around my
social media strategies

717
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,875
is I'm a practitioner,
I use it every day.

718
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:41,750
Everyone one of 'em.

719
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,417
Lots of them. Always.

720
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,625
You know?

721
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,875
And that's a big deal.

722
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:50,542
So, to be good at marketing,

723
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,917
you have to be doing marketing.

724
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:55,208
You have to try these things.

725
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,917
I would say that Facebook is

726
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,500
number one, two,
three, four, and five.

727
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,291
(group laughter)

728
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,083
- [Ruben] Just one prediction,
the one next, here

729
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:04,959
- [Gary] I don't,
you know what's funny?

730
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,583
People think I
predict, I don't predict.

731
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,458
I just move quickly
when it's happening.

732
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,875
- [Ruben] Yeah
but you recently said

733
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,291
Musical.ly is
the way to go for B2C

734
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,834
- [Gary] Yeah
after 40 fuckin' million

735
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,375
kids downloaded Musical.ly.

736
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,166
(group laughter)

737
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,917
- [Ruben] But it's not as
big as in here, as in--

738
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,250
- [Gary] Yeah, I mean here,
by the way,

739
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,667
the greatest advantage
of being in Belgium

740
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:24,125
is you get to see the
future and just do it here.

741
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,041
Now, not every time,
Pinterest doesn't always

742
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,959
become huge here,
but it's worth the risk.

743
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:32,834
You should move fast on
every U.S. platform every time

744
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,041
because all you
need is one of them

745
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,458
to be the next Facebook or

746
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,250
Twitter or
Instagram or Snapchat,

747
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,417
or whatever, I know Twitter
never popped here asmuch

748
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:44,333
but all you need is one, and
it was worth all 15 failing

749
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:48,291
because the 16th time paid for
all the other times combined.

750
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,166
- [Ruben] Okay.
- [Gary] Got it?

751
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,458
That's how I predict,
I just use 'em all,

752
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,291
and then I look like a genius.

753
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,625
(group laughter)
He did it!

754
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:56,083
And I'm like "Yeah, you didn't
talk about social camera,

755
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,333
you know, remember Vine?

756
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,208
But, here's what's
funny, it's like a hit show.

757
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:03,417
Vine is dead, but I got
a lot of value out of Vine.

758
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,208
For the 13 months
that it mattered,

759
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,083
I got what I needed out of it.

760
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,750
Everybody wants all these
platforms to last forever,

761
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,125
but they don't want
every television show

762
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,291
to be number one,
to run commercials.

763
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,875
You just run commercials
when it is number one.

764
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,166
- [Ruben] Thanks.

765
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,542
- [Teegan] Hi,
my name is Teegan.

766
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,291
I'm here on behalf of
GingerWald

767
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,917
which is a B2B cold-pressed
juicing company.

768
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,583
- Very cool.

769
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:27,875
- [Teegan] I do their marketing.

770
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,083
The reason why they
contacted me is basically

771
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,250
because I have a Facebook
page with over 36K likes,

772
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,041
which is something.

773
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,291
- Yep.

774
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:40,708
- [Teegan] It covers all
the hip spots in Antwerp,

775
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:43,250
so if you don't know
where to go tonight look it up.

776
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,083
(group laughter)

777
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:44,917
- I will.

778
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:48,000
- [Teegan] Anyway, I
kind of feel like a fraud.

779
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,834
- Because?

780
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:53,000
- [Teegan] Because I
don't know how to generate

781
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,834
money out of my Facebook page.

782
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,000
- Yep.
It's really hard.

783
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,708
I have the impression that
nobody wants to pay for content,

784
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:02,959
or ads, they're
willing to pay for ads.

785
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:06,083
But the numbers for ads are

786
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,667
way higher than
you have for content.

787
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:13,458
I'm asking, basically, for
example, for GingerWald,

788
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,333
how can I sell myself to them?

789
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,083
I mean, I already
sold myself to them,

790
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,041
that's not the question.

791
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,291
But the question is-

792
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,583
- How do you stay there?

793
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:24,083
- [Teegan] How do I stay there?

794
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,875
- How do you provide value for
what you're being paid for?

795
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,041
- [Teegan] Yes.

796
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,625
- First of all, the
fact that you care about that

797
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:31,291
already puts you way
ahead of everybody else.

798
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,208
So that makes me happy.

799
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,083
I don't know.

800
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,875
I always say sell
your truth, right?

801
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,708
You heard that.

802
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:39,583
I agree with you.

803
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:41,750
I think it's funny that
we're in this era right now

804
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,625
where a lot of
people are getting hired

805
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,959
just 'cause they're
young or they've got pay dirt

806
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,750
and hit some magic on some
sort of social media account.

807
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,625
Then traditional companies
just think that's the magic.

808
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:55,000
It's very hard to
generate money from anything,

809
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
not just social media, from
print and radio and television.

810
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,333
So I think that being up front

811
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,250
with the client
is always the best.

812
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,166
I think I don't
have a great, so,

813
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:07,000
are you looking
for the short term,

814
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,375
is the real question
just a very short term,

815
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,542
practical answer of how
to drive business for them,

816
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,083
or are you going more macro?

817
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,500
- [Teegan] Actually,
I was looking up stuff

818
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,083
and I read a bunch
of articles online.

819
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,542
I think they're really
focused on U.S. market,

820
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,333
and I was actually
wondering if there might

821
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,417
be a cultural difference.

822
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:27,500
For example, that Belgians
aren't really interested

823
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,291
in paying for
content on social media

824
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,291
because they have the
impression-

825
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,667
- When you say
paying for content,

826
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,875
you mean the
generation of creative?

827
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:34,708
- [Teegan] For example.

828
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:38,500
- Well, Belgians are paying
tons of money for content.

829
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,875
- [Teegan] That
wasn't my impression.

830
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,083
- Yeah, so your
impression's wrong.

831
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:46,625
There's a ton of companies
paying creative agencies money

832
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,333
to produce pictures
and videos to put out

833
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,625
on social networks.

834
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:52,291
How many companies
have you talked to?

835
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,542
- [Teegan] A bunch.

836
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:55,625
I mean, for my page, or for-

837
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,625
- No, so one more time,

838
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,625
I want to really
know what you're asking,

839
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,000
'cause you're dancing,
which is cute,

840
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,959
but I wanna
answer your question.

841
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,166
Are you asking for people

842
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,291
to sponsor
creative on your page?

843
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:09,291
What are you asking me?

844
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,583
- [Teegan] Okay, so for my page.

845
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:11,959
- I can't answer
you if you don't ask me.

846
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,208
- [Teegan] No, so for my page-

847
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,041
- Fine.

848
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,375
- [Teegan] I mainly
talk about restaurants,--

849
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,083
- Yes.

850
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,000
- [Teegan] ask them to
pay to put content

851
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,166
about their
restaurant on my page.

852
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:26,333
- And they say no

853
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,166
How many restaurants
have you asked for money?

854
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,875
Tell me the number,
bunch isn't interesting.

855
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:32,834
- [Teegan] About a hundred.

856
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,375
- And how many
restaurants are in Belgium?

857
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,208
- [Teegan] All of them.

858
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,041
- Good, go ask all of them.

859
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,583
Even if you're
zero for a hundred,

860
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:43,417
you need to figure out
if you're zero for 40,000.

861
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,041
How much are you asking for?

862
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,708
Can it be performance based?

863
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,834
So, for example, what
are you pitching them?

864
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:51,250
Because if 
you go into a restaurant

865
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,542
and say the following,
"Hey, Mack.

866
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:55,166
"I cover your restaurant,
I like your restaurant.

867
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,125
"Let's make a deal.

868
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:59,417
"You're gonna pay me
500 bucks for three months

869
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,583
"to put out some
original content,

870
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:04,750
"but I'm gonna
assure you 15 clients

871
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,417
"because I'm gonna do a call
to action for a free beer,

872
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:08,875
"and then you'll make it up."

873
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,792
If you're just walking
in and say, "Hey, Mack,

874
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:13,083
"pay me 500 bucks
for pictures and videos

875
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,750
"on my Facebook
page," he may say no.

876
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,417
But if you say,
"I'll give you the money back

877
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:19,708
"if you don't get 15," 
maybe he'll say yes.

878
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:23,166
Maybe what you're trying to
sell isn't interesting to them.

879
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:26,083
Also, maybe you haven't asked
the other 7,000 restaurants

880
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,166
and you just serendipitously
got zero out of a hundred,

881
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:32,291
but the next batch
of hundred you get 11.

882
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,792
Or maybe you're
asking for too much.

883
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:35,625
- [Teegan] I highly doubt that.

884
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,458
- I believe you.

885
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,500
So what are you asking for?

886
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,417
- [Teegan] I'm just asking

887
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,083
if they wanna post
on my Facebook page,

888
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,917
I'll provide for
the pictures, the copy...

889
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,667
- And how much
are you asking for?

890
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:47,667
- [Teegan] Like, the number?

891
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:50,125
- Yes.
- [Teegan] Euros, 150.

892
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,083
- And they're saying no?

893
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:51,917
- [Teegan] And
they're saying no.

894
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:54,834
- And you're zero for a hundred?

895
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:57,750
They just don't believe you.

896
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,667
You gotta figure that part out.

897
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,792
That happens to
youngsters all the time.

898
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:02,750
Youngsters always ask me,

899
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,959
"How do I sell because
they think I'm too young?"

900
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,792
I'm like, "You don't."

901
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:07,875
You don't convince people.

902
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:11,375
You're not gonna walk in
with a gray-haired wig.

903
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,625
So I think, remember,
don't try to sell somebody

904
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,125
who's not sellable.

905
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,041
You're dealing with
small, traditional businesses.

906
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:22,041
A lot of those people are
saying no to their own children

907
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,542
to do Facebook marketing,
let alone you coming

908
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:27,417
out of nowhere and
wanting 150 bucks for it.

909
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,083
Got it?
- [Teegan] Mhmmm.

910
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,667
- Here's what I would do.

911
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:33,583
I would do a post
on a single restaurant

912
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:37,583
and do unbelievable writeup
about the single best drink

913
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,834
or meal they have and

914
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:43,041
push hard your entire audience

915
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,875
about go in
Friday and order this.

916
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,834
And then I would call
Saturday morning and find out

917
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:50,834
how many of those they sold.

918
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,417
If you call in Saturday
morning to Mack and go,

919
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:55,625
"Hey, Mack, did you sell a bunch
of french fries yesterday?"

920
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,125
He's like, "Fuck, we did."

921
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,542
You're like, "No
shit, dick, I did that."

922
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,792
(audience laughter)

923
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:03,708
- [Teegan] Okay, fair enough.

924
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:09,291
- Different strategies.

925
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,583
- [Hans] Hello, I'm
Hans from Temple Twin.

926
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:15,166
We are frustrated by the
state of advertisements still.

927
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,500
There's a lot of push still.

928
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:22,708
But we see a lot of
opposition to this change

929
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:23,542
that is coming.

930
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:25,250
- From the client
or from other agencies?

931
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,083
- [Hans] From agencies, yeah.

932
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,125
From media partners that
we are trying to convince.

933
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,291
- Yep.

934
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,125
What're you selling them?

935
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,708
- [Hans] We're selling
them, well, our approach is

936
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,125
that it will be
better for all parties--

937
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,125
- No, I understand the
thesis, what do you do?

938
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,000
- [Hans] We sell them
advertisement space,

939
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,041
but in a 
consumer-friendly approach.

940
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:45,875
- What is it?

941
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,041
Where, how, what?

942
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,041
- [Hans] Well, it's not in
the middle of your movies,

943
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:50,750
or in the middle of your music,

944
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,667
but it's time that you pick

945
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,875
like on the breakfast
table or on the toilet,

946
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:58,959
a lot of our
users use on the toilet.

947
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:03,250
You watch or you get
inspired by commercial messages

948
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,750
and you get credits
that you can exchange

949
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,875
for Spotify Premium or Netflix
or something like that.

950
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,125
- So I personally
hate your business model

951
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,125
even more than theirs.
(audience laughter)

952
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,625
I'm being honest with you.

953
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:15,750
But I could be wrong.

954
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,583
But I've looked at "incentivized
marketing" for 40 years.

955
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:22,875
I hate the idea that the
only reason you're watching

956
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:25,125
my video of this, is
'cause you actually want

957
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,166
Spotify credits.

958
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,792
And that's what
I believe the model

959
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:31,750
of incentivizing
advertising looks like.

960
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,542
So, I'm probably not the
guy to give you the model

961
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,375
to convince people
because I've talked

962
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,500
a lot of my clients out of it.

963
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
If I'm reading
what's right, I feel like

964
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,542
that's what I'm hearing.

965
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:45,875
Now, every business
that I've seen in that world

966
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,750
has short-term victory and
long-term down,

967
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,708
and so, again, if you
just think about the thesis

968
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:54,583
of what you're saying,
you're asking a consumer

969
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,667
to consume an
"inspirational message"

970
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,125
or whatever you wanna call it,

971
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,333
that was very
clever and I liked it,

972
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,917
but the only reason
that person is watching,

973
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,542
especially, are you your
own platform, your own app

974
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:05,542
or thing of that nature?

975
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:06,792
That's even crazier.

976
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,792
The only reason
somebody's downloading it

977
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:13,875
is to go through that
motion to sell their time

978
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:16,250
in return for
something they actually want.

979
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,041
The last thing they're
actually giving the advertiser

980
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,291
is their attention.

981
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:22,750
You're just whoring
out that transaction.

982
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,750
- [Hans] We have a 
nice numbers with our--

983
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,208
- Of course you do.

984
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:28,834
- [Hans] 1200 users--
- No, no, you have nice numbers,

985
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,417
but are you actually
getting people to buy

986
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:33,291
my grapefruit soda is
a very different thing

987
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,375
from a branding
standpoint because the intent

988
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:39,917
of the interaction
was not for that.

989
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:42,208
I hung out with this
person 'cause I wanted

990
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,458
to date that person.

991
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,000
There's nothing
good happening here.

992
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,583
(audience laughter)

993
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,458
By the way, by the way,
let me just say this;

994
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,667
I've been wrong
about a lot of things,

995
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,417
but as you can tell, I'm
very passionate about this

996
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,417
'cause I've looked
at it for a long time.

997
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:59,333
I'm just not a big
fan of incentivizing

998
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:03,959
advertising consumption
because of something else.

999
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:06,417
I want you to buy my
grapefruit fuckin' soda

1000
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,458
not to get credits
to buy an Apple iPhone.

1001
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,458
- [Hans] But the focus in the
app is not only credits,

1002
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:14,375
but it's a nice
side effect, that's it.

1003
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:17,041
- But it's the engine
that drives it, right?

1004
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,083
- [Hans] It's part of the drive.

1005
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,625
- Yeah.

1006
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:23,834
So you're trying to
convince media spending agencies

1007
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,250
to drive dollars into you guys.

1008
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,208
Yeah I mean look,
I would definitely go through

1009
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:32,458
very hardcore performance
based agencies.

1010
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,333
If you go to the 
media-centric people,

1011
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,333
they're gonna be more
in the branding, right?

1012
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:39,250
I think the people that
are real digital performance

1013
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,375
media buyers,
they'll look at metrics

1014
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:44,750
and make a math decision,
not an emotional decision,

1015
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,625
and I think you'll
have more opportunity there.

1016
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,917
- [Hans] Yeah good because we
have nice return on investment--

1017
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,750
- Correct, correct, correct.

1018
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,959
You're gonna win
that game because

1019
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,750
people have to,
you're forcing them to,

1020
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,959
watch the whole video before
you get the get the free stuff,

1021
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,792
which for me as a
marketer means you didn't

1022
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:00,750
accomplish the goal, but
for all the math marketers,

1023
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,959
you appease them
in the short-term.

1024
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,250
- [Hans] Thanks.
- Yeah.

1025
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,250
You know, and I want you to win,

1026
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,500
but I can't bullshit
you how I feel about it.

1027
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,208
- [Hans] Sure,
that's why I'm here.

1028
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,417
- I appreciate it.

1029
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,834
But go to the performance only

1030
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,959
'cause that's who'll go for it.

1031
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,750
- [Hans] Thanks.

1032
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,542
That was the last one.

1033
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,625
- [Man 4] I'm
actually an oldened career

1034
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:25,083
compared to most
of the people here.

1035
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,333
- Thank God, me too.
(audience laughter)

1036
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,959
- [Man 4] What would you
recommend, by the way,

1037
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,333
what do you think of your soda?

1038
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,625
- Mm, I like it.
- [Man 4] It was my company's.

1039
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,250
Is that right?
(audience laughter)

1040
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,917
Phew, that woulda been
even worse than that, right?

1041
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,000
I like it, I like
grapefruit flavors.

1042
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,250
- [Man 4] So what do you
recommend old entrepreneurs?

1043
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,875
Because, yeah, I got a
family, I got all the things

1044
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,333
which the young guys don't have.

1045
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,959
- Mhmmm. So,
I understand the circumstances,

1046
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,000
I actually don't think
they're any different, right?

1047
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,583
You have experience, you may
have some wins under your belt.

1048
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,834
You may have different
things that they don't have.

1049
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:07,250
I'm not worried about what one
has, what one doesn't have.

1050
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,333
My question is what're
you asking specifically.

1051
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,041
Like what do you wanna do?

1052
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:14,959
- [Man 4] Well I jumped, so 
I did it, I'm going through it.

1053
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,333
- So you were doing what?

1054
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,333
- I was marketing
director for a big companies.

1055
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:19,959
- Got it, and you
decided to start your own brand?

1056
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:20,667
- [Man 4] Correct.

1057
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:22,333
- Awesome.
And so what's happening?

1058
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,750
- [Man 4] It's going very well.
Good.

1059
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,625
So what next?

1060
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:28,959
- [Man 4] Okay, people
around me say, "You're 48.

1061
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:32,500
"You're starting
a business now?"

1062
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,625
- Sounds like losing players.

1063
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,333
(audience laughter)

1064
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,542
- [Man 4] Good, okay.

1065
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,708
- Is that good enough?
- [Man 4] Yeah, no that's fine.

1066
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:40,917
Sometimes you doubt yourself,

1067
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,291
well not doubting yourself,--
- I get it.

1068
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,250
- [Man 4] because you know
what you want to do.

1069
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,417
But yes, you are 48--

1070
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,917
- Here's what's
happening, it's interesting.

1071
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,417
You're very
interesting to me, here's why:

1072
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,834
you either were an entrepreneur
and you suppressed it

1073
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:57,625
to do the practical thing and
work in corporate America,

1074
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:02,375
or you were kind
of maybe 50/50 right?

1075
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,750
Like you had
safety but you also had

1076
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,917
entrepreneurial tendencies.

1077
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,333
You weren't 100% purebred.

1078
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,083
Like for me, I would die.

1079
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:11,417
You know, like I can't breathe
if I'm not entrepreneuring,

1080
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:14,208
and I mean,
since I was like nine.

1081
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,125
I mean that's why I got
very bad grades in school.

1082
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:20,041
This wasn't, "It's cool now,"
I was disaster in school

1083
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,542
and the immigrants got A's,

1084
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:24,750
that's how you got out,
you know?

1085
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,166
So what's interesting is,
the reason you're letting

1086
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:30,333
outside forces seep
in is 'cause you're not,

1087
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,458
when you're 100%,
you don't give a fuck.

1088
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:34,583
You're crazy to begin with.

1089
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,250
The whole thing's crazy, right?

1090
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,250
So if you're in-between, 
I would tell you this,

1091
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,125
let the results and
the way you feel speak.

1092
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:45,792
The last people you should be
listening to is anybody else.

1093
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:47,834
If you feel it.
- [Man 4] Yeah.

1094
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,500
- You know what I mean?
- [Man 4] Yeah, I know.

1095
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,208
- I mean, now, if your
whole circle, if your spouse,

1096
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:54,542
if your parents, if your
siblings, if your best friends

1097
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:58,917
are all pushing,
"Hey, hey," it can get hard.

1098
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,750
What I would say is
find an outlet for support.

1099
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,917
Keep hanging out
with these people, right?

1100
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:05,959
Offset the voices.

1101
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,125
You need the other voices.

1102
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:09,792
Watch content from other people.

1103
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,250
Like if you need that. 
So I don't.

1104
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,375
I don't consume anything
'cause I don't need ideas

1105
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:18,041
or a reformation or
motivation from anything.

1106
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,041
I keep insular, but
if you're feeling it,

1107
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:22,959
and I understand
because you're practical, right?

1108
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:25,583
You feel a huge
sense of responsibility?

1109
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,417
- [Man 4] That's correct.

1110
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,166
- And so you're always
thinking, "What could go wrong?"

1111
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,542
I would remind
you a couple things.

1112
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,375
Did you have a fairly
successful corporate career

1113
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,208
being a marketer?

1114
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,458
Good.

1115
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,166
How long has this been going?

1116
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,834
- [Man 4] Two and a half months.
- And how's it going?

1117
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:39,250
- [Man 4] Very good.
- Good.

1118
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,291
It sounds like
you're just a winner

1119
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:45,041
and so if you happen to
lose here, which we all do,

1120
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,917
I have a funny feeling
you're going to be able

1121
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:48,375
to go get a job.

1122
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,125
- [Man 4] Yeah, yes,
but I want this.

1123
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,875
- No shit,
that's why you did it.

1124
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:57,083
But you have to understand
upside versus downside.

1125
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:59,083
The upside is 
you build a whole life

1126
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,208
around something you
wanna do and it's the best

1127
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,834
and you make more
money and you're happy

1128
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:04,500
and you're doing your thing.

1129
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,792
The downside is the
other thing you left.

1130
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,708
So as long as
you're not worried about

1131
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:13,458
what everybody says
about you losing here,

1132
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:16,959
if you have to go back,
then you're risking nothing.

1133
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,125
Yeah.

1134
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,208
- [Man 4] Nice.
- You got it.

1135
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,083
- [Man 5] Alright,
so we have some time,

1136
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,667
because,
actually you make time go

1137
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:28,708
slower
(snaps)

1138
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,083
(audience and Gary laughing)

1139
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,792
People can ask four
questions or there are...

1140
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:33,625
- Yeah.

1141
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:37,750
- [Man 6] Well,
talking about content creation,

1142
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,208
and content marketing,
when do you think,

1143
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,667
you for instance,
upload a lot of stuff.

1144
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,208
- Yes.

1145
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,583
- [Man 6] When does
a lot become--

1146
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:47,500
- Too much?

1147
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:50,959
Based on how good you are.

1148
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,041
So it's in
parallel with quality.

1149
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,583
Quantity axis
curve of too much is

1150
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,375
when you're not good enough.

1151
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:04,875
For some reason, the
numbers show me that,

1152
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,250
even though I'm saying
the same thing over and over,

1153
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,583
as you guys can tell in here,

1154
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,250
especially the ones
that are closest to me,

1155
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:14,125
I'm so improv, it comes so
natural to me as a communicator,

1156
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,708
I can still say
it in different ways,

1157
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:19,041
paint different pictures,
and it makes it interesting.

1158
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,083
And maybe this analogy
finally got you to understand,

1159
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,583
or maybe that analogy
finally got you to understand.

1160
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:26,959
It's the reason 
I continue to do Q&amp;A.

1161
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:30,500
Left to my own way, I'm gonna
get into the same patterns.

1162
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,166
When I realized that,
I started forcing more of this,

1163
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,083
because you're forcing me
into new ideas, new thoughts,

1164
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,750
teaching me
different analogies, right?

1165
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,708
So, it's too much if
you have nothing new to say,

1166
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:47,542
or nothing to say
that's relevant in a new way.

1167
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:52,125
Yeah, I mean, notice
how there's not a lot

1168
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:53,291
of blog posts for me?

1169
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:56,333
I finally figured out my team,
they team transcribe,

1170
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,583
and I've got some
blog posts of my words,

1171
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,875
but I'm not a talented
communicator in a written word,

1172
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,875
so I don't do it, right?

1173
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,792
So you also have to know
your skills in communicating.

1174
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:07,750
A lot of you have
a lot of good ideas.

1175
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,333
You should be taking
them, taking your phone,

1176
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,542
recording it, and
putting it out in the world.

1177
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:15,125
You know how a lot
of you have good ideas?

1178
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,333
First of all, the
amount of people in here

1179
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,542
who have a lot of good ideas

1180
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:20,250
and aren't even recording it
for themselves to use later,

1181
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,000
they're just letting it...

1182
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,708
That's really one of
the other big reasons

1183
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:24,583
I started doing DailyVee.

1184
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,417
I was like, fuck, there's a
lot of good shit I'm saying.

1185
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,375
(audience laughter)

1186
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:32,667
And I mean for me not just
for you, that I'd like to have.

1187
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:34,667
And then it became
like, man, all those things

1188
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:39,166
I said back in 1996, 
1999, 2003, 2000...

1189
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,041
You think I've got a
good thing going now,

1190
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:42,834
if I'd been doing
this from the beginning,

1191
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:44,792
fuck, you would think
I did predict the entire...

1192
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:46,083
I fuckin'...
(audience laughter)

1193
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,792
I mean, now there's
some things that were wrong.

1194
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:50,500
I remember for four months,
I was massively passionate

1195
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,834
that all email
would become video.

1196
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:54,000
(audience chuckling)

1197
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,792
But that would be fun too.

1198
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,792
You know, when everybody puts
me too high on a pedestal,

1199
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:00,041
I'd play that video and
be like, "what about that?"

1200
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:03,208
You have to balance, you know?

1201
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:06,875
But I think the
market decides too much,

1202
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,750
and I think some
people have one move,

1203
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,917
and I think some
people have one million moves,

1204
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:13,125
just gotta figure out
where you sit in that.

1205
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,166
Some people are
better off writing

1206
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:17,166
a very thoughtful
ten thousand word essay

1207
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:19,458
once every two months that
everybody looks forward to,

1208
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,375
'cause they're a great writer.

1209
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,542
You can see, I'm fast.

1210
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:25,417
I can give real
business advice, (snaps)

1211
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:28,834
I'm really in it, I can do this.

1212
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:30,750
And shit, a lot of
times it's really right too,

1213
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,959
I'm a good entrepreneur, right?

1214
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:36,333
But I can't write an
amazing 20,000 word expo.

1215
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,041
Do you know how sad
I am, I can't do that?

1216
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:41,291
Some of my thoughts,
I never fully get there,

1217
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:44,291
they get to 73 percent,
but I don't have the ability

1218
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,667
to make it deep
enough, 'cause I'm just...

1219
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:48,000
You know?

1220
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,917
And so, sometimes it takes
me two or three years,

1221
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,291
document over create. How many
of you heard that from me?

1222
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,667
Document over create?

1223
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:57,333
Great, so that took
me a long time to get to.

1224
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,417
Maybe seven years,
but it was the thing

1225
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:03,000
that really unlocked
it for a lot of people.

1226
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,542
Just for a lot of you, my
point on creating content,

1227
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:08,250
is, instead of trying
to think what you make,

1228
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,708
just document
everything you're doing.

1229
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:11,750
Do you know that
two or three of you,

1230
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,500
if you just documented the
journey of figuring this out,

1231
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,125
that people would watch your
video on YouTube everyday,

1232
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,291
of you trying to
figure out the school system,

1233
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,500
and that in itself is
what would build your business.

1234
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,291
- [Man 2] A story.

1235
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:28,625
- Yeah, it's a story, it's the
journey of an entrepreneur.

1236
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:31,458
The legacy that I'm
creating with DailyVee?

1237
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,542
Fuck, you know how
cool that's gonna be

1238
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:36,166
when there's ten
years worth of my everyday?

1239
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,000
(audience laughter)

1240
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,708
Especially if I pull
off very big things?

1241
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,083
You know how fun it would
be to watch the three years

1242
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,959
before "Drake" became
famous, everything he did?

1243
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:46,875
You know how
fascinating that is?

1244
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,083
You know how cool it
would be the watch everything,

1245
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:51,917
especially Steve Jobs, perfect.

1246
00:46:51,917 --> 00:46:54,083
I'm not at that level yet,

1247
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,333
(audience chuckling)
but I would tell you

1248
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:57,333
that I'm in the
same place right now.

1249
00:46:57,333 --> 00:47:00,166
Steve Jobs had Apple,
then he got kicked out,

1250
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:03,041
then he had a
failure called NeXT, failure.

1251
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:06,291
And then he came back to Apple
and it all went crazy, right?

1252
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:09,083
It would've been
awesome if he did daily vlog

1253
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,792
for that last year of
NeXT, that in between year,

1254
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:14,041
and that first year
when he launched the iPod.

1255
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,959
Fuck, we'd all
watch it, everybody.

1256
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,041
So there's a lot, you know.

1257
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,583
And by the way, even if it
never changed your business,

1258
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,542
do you know how
much fun it would be

1259
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:24,250
for your granddaughter
to watch you do it?

1260
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,667
Really, think about life.

1261
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,166
You know how
inspiring that would be?

1262
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,875
She'd be like, "damn,
grandma was a huslter."

1263
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,625
(audience laughter)

1264
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:33,500
"I wanna be one too."
No, really, right?

1265
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,083
You know how much fun it
would be for me right now

1266
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,667
to see my dad making
two dollars an hour in 1979

1267
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:41,458
waking up at 4:30,
driving, working 15 hours

1268
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,750
in a liquor store
and then coming back?

1269
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,834
That's cool.

1270
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:48,458
So, I don't think we
think long-term enough,

1271
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:51,166
what it really means.

1272
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,375
You know, I look at
stuff now, I'm like,

1273
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,333
"Oh, man, I was so young."

1274
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:56,166
"Oh shit, I was
pretty fat," you know?

1275
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:58,917
It's cool.

1276
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,417
It's why I do it.

1277
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,583
Yeah, let's do it.

1278
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,125
Hi
- [Man 7] Hi.

1279
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:10,000
15 years ago
I was lucky enough

1280
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,875
to invest in nerds.

1281
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,750
- Nerds candy?
- [Man 7] Nerds, no no.

1282
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:14,583
- No what?

1283
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:18,041
Nerds. I was like
that's super cool.

1284
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,125
I love Nerds candy.

1285
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:20,625
Got it. Yep.

1286
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:21,959
- [Man 7] First of all,
thank you

1287
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:25,125
for inviting this
guy and paying for him.

1288
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:27,333
(audience laughter)

1289
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:31,542
In those 15 years 
and again yesterday

1290
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:34,417
I realized that
the biggest pains

1291
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:38,542
in building up confidence
are also the biggest assets.

1292
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,792
What's your
biggest pain in your story?

1293
00:48:42,834 --> 00:48:44,333
- [Gary] So I want to make sure

1294
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,834
I'm interpreting your question.

1295
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:51,583
The adversities that
lead to the successes?

1296
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,083
Give me an example
of one of yours so I can

1297
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,708
use that as a proxy
to give you my answer.

1298
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:58,583
- You mentioned
about, not your family,

1299
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:01,083
but your environment.

1300
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:05,250
This old guy, colleague
of mine, also shared it.

1301
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,959
- [Gary] Adversity?

1302
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:08,834
- [Man 7] I don't believe
that you can

1303
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:10,083
become an
entrepreneur, sorry for all

1304
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:10,875
those who are dreaming about it.

1305
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:13,500
- [Gary] I agree.
I think it's a natural--

1306
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,583
- [Man 7] You are or you aren't

1307
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:18,750
but besides that
what I meant is it's hard.

1308
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,208
You can't show
that you are in pain.

1309
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,375
Yesterday I was in pain.

1310
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,875
- Do you know how many
people have committed suicide

1311
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,583
in the tech startup community in

1312
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:29,875
the last five years and
there's not a peep about it?

1313
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,000
Tons.

1314
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,041
- I don't want to.

1315
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:33,125
(audience laughter)

1316
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,166
- I personally know
of more than a handful

1317
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:38,458
and I know that
I'm not looking for it.

1318
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:41,708
I know that Warton,
one of the leading

1319
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:44,333
startup, entrepreneur 
schools in the U.S.,

1320
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:47,500
suicide rate has
doubled each year with the

1321
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,583
growth of this
because entrepreneurship is

1322
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:52,667
on the pedestal and
everyone thinks it's easy.

1323
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:55,667
It's the loneliest,
it's his emotion,

1324
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:57,542
you know how hard that is?

1325
00:49:57,542 --> 00:49:59,875
There's no blaming anybody.

1326
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,583
If this wins, you.

1327
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,041
If this loses, you.

1328
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,125
That's lonely as fuck.

1329
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,500
That's why I keep saying, you
know what the best game is?

1330
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,417
To be the number 2.

1331
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:12,708
You get a lot of the money.
You get a lot of the action

1332
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,583
but you don't get that.

1333
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:15,250
Right?

1334
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,500
Rick, I was just
number 2. Rick fucked up.

1335
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,917
He was the CEO.
I was just the COO.

1336
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:23,750
I told Rick.

1337
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,708
- [Man 7] Again, 
not to interrupt you--

1338
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:26,875
- Yes sir? Please.
- [Man 7] You know you're doing

1339
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,041
the same thing as a girl.

1340
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,291
You're dancing
around professionals ...

1341
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,291
(audience laughter)

1342
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,583
- Yeah, I'll tell
you why I'm dancing.

1343
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,834
- [Man 7] Sorry.
- No, I appreciate what you did.

1344
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,041
The reason I'm
dancing is because

1345
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:39,792
I don't think you know
how purebred I really am.

1346
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:42,208
I'd be lying to you. I
don't wanna lie to you.

1347
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,917
I feel like you
deserve an answer

1348
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,917
and I don't think
I have one for you.

1349
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,000
Zero.

1350
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,959
The day I stopped
being a student,

1351
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:51,583
my whole life changed forever.

1352
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,625
I never had one bad day.

1353
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,792
When I'm in pain I go to sleep

1354
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:56,417
for five minutes
and I wake up the next

1355
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:57,917
day and I kiss the world.

1356
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:59,959
I don't give a fuck
about entrepreneurship.

1357
00:50:59,959 --> 00:51:01,542
I care about the
health of my parents

1358
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,875
and my children and
my wife and this thing

1359
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:06,291
called entrepreneurship
is easy as fuck.

1360
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:09,125
I'm the best.
You understand?

1361
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:11,250
So the reason I'm
dancing is I didn't want

1362
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,625
to give you such a
ridiculous answer that

1363
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,333
I know does not map.

1364
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,333
I'm gonna end up
being the guy, my man.

1365
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,333
When's it's all said
and done, when I die,

1366
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:22,125
I'm gonna be on the fucking
pedestal at the tippy top.

1367
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:23,875
That's not everybody.

1368
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:26,125
So for me to give that
answer is very difficult

1369
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,125
because I have pain.

1370
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,375
There's always problems.

1371
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,375
My brother walked
in and said "I quit.

1372
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,291
"I have Chron's Disease.
I want to leave VaynerMedia.

1373
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,250
"It's all on you."

1374
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,083
That's not fun. That's hard
but it took me 8 seconds

1375
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:42,041
to absorb and I started
smiling and saying good.

1376
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:43,250
Just who I am.

1377
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,375
So for me I was
dancing because I can't even

1378
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:51,417
give you an answer
because every day's hard

1379
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:53,792
and that's the
best fucking part of it

1380
00:51:53,792 --> 00:51:55,750
and so that's my truth.

1381
00:51:55,750 --> 00:00:00,000
