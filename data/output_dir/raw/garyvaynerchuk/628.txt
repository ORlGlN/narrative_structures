1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:02,469
- [Gary] What if I told you this

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,671
was the last Monday 
morning of your life?

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,240
What if I told
you died this week?

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,476
Would you complain about your
crap job or that test you don't

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,011
want to take?
I doubt it.

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,614
You'd go to much
higher level thinking.

7
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:18,585
We cram a ton of
all-time shit into this day.

8
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,487
I was on a fuckin'--

9
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,256
- [DRock] There was a lot today.

10
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,058
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,536
- Aren't we doing
the barbaresco?

12
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:40,140
Also, let's start promoting one
of those Cinderella clearance

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,709
sales 'cause we need
to clear that out.

14
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,785
So is that entrance is open?

15
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,487
If you come from the High Line?

16
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,089
As you leave, you can walk 
to the High Line? That's cool.

17
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,093
Morning.

18
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,995
Do I have a lot of
time in Orlando?

19
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,463
Am I there like the night--

20
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,666
- You land, I think
you land at midnight.

21
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,333
- [Gary] Okay.

22
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,936
- You have the night to sleep
and to workout and

23
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,873
an hour on stage and 
then you'll leave at 12:30.

24
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,508
- So we're gonna go with no.

25
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,443
- [Tyler] Yeah.

26
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,012
- [Woman] Very 
different from my office.

27
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,347
Good to see you.
- [Gary] Good to see you.

28
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,548
How's your office?

29
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,584
- [Woman] Um, it's great. 
The views are amazing.

30
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,986
- I know. The views 
are crazy here, right?

31
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:26,954
- [Woman] Yeah.

32
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,157
I was noticing the differences
between our space and yours.

33
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,859
Next time we'll have to have
the meeting with Frédéric.

34
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,361
- Yeah, just for him to see it.

35
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,496
- [Woman] Yeah.
- Okay.

36
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:38,999
Hey.
- [Nate] Hey.

37
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:39,733
How's it going?

38
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,635
- Good, you sent me a
(censored) so I can sell it.

39
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,436
- [Nate] Yeah.
(censored).

40
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,470
- The same thing
we did last time?

41
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,005
- [Nate] Pretty much,
you're comfortable with that.

42
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,708
- [Gary] How much did we
charge and how much did we do?

43
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,912
- [Nate] Our fee for the media
spend was (censored) if they

44
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,314
paid us for all our
efforts into it (censored).

45
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,783
So a difference (censored).

46
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,852
- Okay.

47
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,254
So this girl in Arizona, 
Little Lou and you?

48
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,190
- [Nate] Me,
Little Lou, Phil, AJ.

49
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,059
- [Gary] What a crew.
- [Nate] And Ally.

50
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,463
- [Gary] Oh Ally,
the Patriot fan?

51
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,732
- [Nate] She might
come to the game.

52
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,468
- [Gary] She really?
- [Nate] That's what AJ said.

53
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,336
- [Gary] Where you guys sittin'?

54
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,804
- [Nate] Visitor side, 
50 yard line.

55
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,308
- [Gary] Nice. Love it.

56
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,376
Proper.

57
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,211
- [Tyler] Believe he
traveled here from Paris.

58
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,179
- [Gary] Okay.

59
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:28,915
- [DRock] Really?

60
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,385
- Yeah, he just 
had emailed Gary,

61
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,819
I pulled him out and figured.

62
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,121
- [DRock] Just for a selfie?

63
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,390
- [Gary] Not from
Paris for a selfie.

64
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,190
- [DRock] I don't know.

65
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,726
- His opening line, I'm from
Paris across the ocean to spend

66
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,962
two weeks in 
New York City just to meet you.

67
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,597
Yesterday I waited 
over three hours

68
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,465
in the lobby of Hudson Yards.

69
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:47,734
- [Man] 'Sup Gary?
- [Gary] How are you?

70
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,369
- Real pleasure.
- [Gary] Such a pleasure.

71
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,437
- Wow, that's something.

72
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,539
Hey. This is DRock?

73
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,707
- [Gary] This is DRock.
- [DRock] How are you?

74
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,541
- [Man] Hi, nice to meet you.

75
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,276
- [Gary] How are things?
- Great, great.

76
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:56,910
- Good.

77
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,078
- I have something to tell you.
- Okay.

78
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,379
- Can we do it right there?
- Sure.

79
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,782
- [Man] Is that okay?

80
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,053
Do we really have 
three minutes or--

81
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,421
- [Gary] I have two minutes.
Yeah.

82
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,188
- [Man] Oh. Okay.

83
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,322
- [Gary] Yeah, I have to run to

84
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,058
a thing but maybe 
three or four minutes.

85
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,526
- [Man] Okay.

86
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,028
There's two parts,
first what it is.

87
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,564
We saw the (inaudible)
marketing platforms.

88
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,766
They were too expensive.

89
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,635
It's almost
advertising agencies--

90
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,369
- Yep.

91
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,238
- But with some
profiles you can scroll.

92
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,340
- Of course.
- It's for big brands.

93
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,208
- Yes.
- Logos--

94
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:28,909
- Yeah, of course.

95
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,077
- So we're like 
we're gonna break

96
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,812
this 'cause it's a pattern.

97
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,848
The guys who make the big
bucks, except Facebook.

98
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,950
- Two minutes?
- [Man] Okay.

99
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,456
We did this and then I went to
New York and Montreal and Paris

100
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,058
and basically the marketing
agencies say go fuck yourself.

101
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,561
- So you're trying to figure out
how to get me to be an investor

102
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,196
or be involved?

103
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,564
- I'm doing, you
know, Facebook ads.

104
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,098
- Yeah.

105
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,265
- I'm dong the best
targeting I could do.

106
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:52,866
- Yeah.

107
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,201
- Word of mouth guy.
When I read your book.

108
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:54,734
- Yeah.

109
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,203
- The full
chapter on what I do--

110
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:56,736
- Yeah.

111
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,438
- I was like I have to go.

112
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,340
For a year I was
watching your videos--

113
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,074
- Yep.

114
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,542
- I was like he talks
about this all the time.

115
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,143
- Yes.

116
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,611
- And I bought the
book a month ago--

117
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,780
- Yes.
- And I was long tail,--

118
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,049
- Let's go, walk with me.

119
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,593
- [Man] Summary for you.

120
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,060
- Are you a developer per se

121
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,229
or are you the 
architect of the product?

122
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,597
- No, my partner is a developer.

123
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,932
Basically, he goes you
tell me what to do--

124
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,801
- And I'll build it.
- Yeah.

125
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:32,005
I know everybody's telling you
hey I'm gonna grind for you,

126
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,341
I don't want to tell
you this 'cause--

127
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,243
- [Gary] I hear it every day.
- That's not what I do.

128
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,077
- [Gary] Yeah, I understand.

129
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,279
So, are you gonna
be able to build it?

130
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,580
Are you just gonna build it?

131
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,184
Ty? Tyler?

132
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,990
Are you gonna be
able to build it now?

133
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,024
- What you mean build it?

134
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,860
- Like, you and your partner are
going to be able to build it?

135
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,632
- [Man] It's already existing.
- I'll take a look.

136
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,467
- The thing is we were 
very arrogant and we went

137
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,502
all the kind of advertising--
- Go ahead.

138
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,237
- [Man] I was like we
have to niche this.

139
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:08,675
- [Gary] I see. I see.
I'll send you an email.

140
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,177
This weekend.

141
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:14,481
Good luck.

142
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,482
Did we tell him
where we're going?

143
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,116
- [DRock] Yeah.

144
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,685
45th and 5th.
- 4-5?

145
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,489
- [DRock] Yep. 4-5-5.

146
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:30,230
("Who Do I Work For" by
MatMusicPage)

147
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,900
- Hello, my friend, how are you?

148
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,702
Really good, my friend.
Really good.

149
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,673
Quick thing, 
we run a media site,

150
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,208
VaynerMedia does for

151
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,845
(censored) called
(censored), right?

152
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,047
And it's going well and 
we really want to

153
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,316
make a 2017 version of it.

154
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:53,053
Listen, by the way,
I'm not against it.

155
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,223
I don't have enough of a plan
that I have to have that I would

156
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,924
stop you from it.
You know what I mean?

157
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,497
I don't know.

158
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,499
That I have to
really think about.

159
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:10,103
Flags and said man we're
about to be hiring in London.

160
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,105
@EricFulwiler get ready.

161
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,779
I think I put him in a tough
spot which is created some

162
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,384
context that would make
you trepidatious and others.

163
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,529
You coming? Yeah.

164
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,304
- [Mark] 30th and 10th,
Hudson Yards.

165
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,373
- [Gary] When you're playing a
different game, we have so many

166
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,509
benefits going in our favor
but we have to respect playing a

167
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,812
different game when it's
not going in our favor.

168
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,748
- [Mark] Exactly.
- People don't get it.

169
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:59,819
I will give up short-term
for long-term every time.

170
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,122
- We played a different game
and that's why we win so much.

171
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,923
And this is part of that.

172
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,958
This is a facet of that.

173
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,927
- 100, it's the
hardest facet of it.

174
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,129
- Oh, absolutely.

175
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:14,067
- It's super fun to be
egotistical and awesome but when

176
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,969
you're deploying
humility it's not as fun.

177
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:16,970
- Yes, I was gonna say.

178
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,540
Well there's a great line that 
I think my eighth grade bus

179
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,208
driver said to me once.
(Gary and DRock laughing)

180
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,576
He said, he goes, 
"You got to know

181
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,179
when to kick ass, you got to
know when to kiss ass," and

182
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,916
I was like you know what that
really and it stuck with me.

183
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,984
- That's interesting.

184
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:35,088
- And it harder, the kiss ass
part is harder but you know.

185
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,156
- It's way harder.

186
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,966
'Sup, brother?
How you been?

187
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,801
- How you doing?

188
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,968
- [Gary] Have you been
playing ball at all?

189
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,036
- No, I haven't
balled in a while.

190
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,805
- [Gary] I haven't
balled in a long time either.

191
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,406
- They still doing it at the Y?

192
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,775
- Yeah, I've just been
stretching so much but I want to

193
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,443
get back into it.

194
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,143
- Yeah, I need to
get back into it.

195
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,111
- Dude, get back into it.

196
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:58,678
- Let's do it.

197
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,746
- Put yourself on
GroupMe, alright?

198
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,826
Yeah, good stuff.
I'll talk to you soon.

199
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,128
- [Mark] Absolutely.

200
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,863
- [Gary] Did you see my email?
- About?

201
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:17,831
- I sent it yesterday.

202
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:22,135
The Teaberry font, 
I love it on the back and

203
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,803
on the front--
- You want that on the front?

204
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,106
- I do. I like it way better.
'Cause at one point you had it

205
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,640
that way and then it
switched, right?

206
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,308
- [Zak] Yeah.

207
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,210
- [Gary] 'Sup, Greg?
Yeah, if you don't mind.

208
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,212
I really do like it.

209
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:39,352
Hey guys.
Where were you?

210
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,354
Hello.

211
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,857
On your Instagram you were
like you looked like you were at

212
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,460
Burning Man but you weren't.

213
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,561
Where were you?
- Miami.

214
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,830
- Miami. 
- It's gonna be a fun one.

215
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:59,272
What?
How are you? Morning.

216
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,442
How are you?
Good.

217
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:07,480
Kitchen's become like
a really good place.

218
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,149
- [DRock] It'd be cool to 
do a meeting in here.

219
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:09,916
- What?

220
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,253
- [DRock] A meeting in here.
- Yeah, I think you're right.

221
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,721
It's really great.

222
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,989
How you doing?
- Good.

223
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,057
- [Gary] Good week?
What?

224
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,660
- [Andy] Do you
have the cohost?

225
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,661
- What?

226
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,697
- [Andy] On the Facebook
page I'm doing an #AskGaryVee.

227
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,468
You can pick the five questions
you want to answer or the cohost

228
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,538
could pick the five or not.

229
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,539
- Yeah, cohost can do it.

230
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,673
Today, you mean?
- [Andy] Yes.

231
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,041
- Have Jake pick 'em?
- [Andy] On the Facebook page.

232
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,409
We're doing the 
#AskGaryVee at 3:30,

233
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,511
ask your questions in
the comments.

234
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,380
- Okay, yeah.
Let Jake pick 'em.

235
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,716
Is that a new row already?
- [DRock] Yep.

236
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,886
- [Gary] (laughs)
That didn't take long.

237
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,888
Shit is real already.

238
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:50,790
What?

239
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,559
Can you show me the back?

240
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,361
That.

241
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,029
- Or do you want--
- That.

242
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,631
Yeah, really like
the way that looked.

243
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,766
- So just--

244
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,869
- [Gary] They may not make it.
- Yeah. I'm not sure.

245
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,237
They had this address.

246
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,572
- [Gary] They know that.

247
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:06,773
- [Tyler] It's tight.
- Yep.

248
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,876
- [Tyler] Yeah.

249
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,012
- [Gary] How did, she's here?
How did the mix up happen?

250
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,415
- (censored).
- [Gary] Yeah.

251
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,650
Who created the invite?

252
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,720
- Hudson Street and I just...
- [Gary] That's fine.

253
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,955
- I just fucked up.

254
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,256
- [Gary] That's comfortable.
- Yeah.

255
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,724
- [Gary] That has logic.

256
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,827
Yeah, I don't want you to ever
do that again but at least it's

257
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,330
Hudson Street not like,
you know what I mean.

258
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,133
At least I can see
how your eye did that.

259
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,935
- So that's that.

260
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:40,039
- [Gary] My sister is gonna
shit when she sees this wine.

261
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,843
Here's why 'cause it, we
grew up on Teaberry Lane.

262
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:48,481
53 Teaberry Lane and my sister's
whole life is like revolves

263
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,817
around the nostalgia.

264
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,086
I didn't know I had it so
good with you and I should of...

265
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,622
(laughs).

266
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,689
- This is gorgeous.
- Thank you.

267
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,557
- [Hollis] This
is unbelievable.

268
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,158
- Crazy, right?

269
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,429
- [Hollis] I'm like
we're slumming it downtown.

270
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,199
Gary, this is just--
- Crazy, right?

271
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,601
- And you have 500 people here?

272
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,004
- I actually think
there's 600 here.

273
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:16,009
I'm gonna open up 5 or 6
offices in smaller city markets.

274
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,979
The reason I'm building
VaynerMedia is because I'm going

275
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:24,817
to buy businesses like my
clients and then run them

276
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,955
through this machine and if 
I buy something that sells at

277
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:32,425
Dollar General and Walmart 
I love the fact that I'll have

278
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,427
DNA in Des Moines.

279
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,165
Listen, you know me probably
pretty well from a business

280
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,402
standpoint, I'm so long-term.
- [Hollis] Yeah.

281
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,837
- I'm such a weird guy
for people 'cause I'm so--

282
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,572
- [Hollis] Sure.

283
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:49,142
- I'm so high-energy that it
feels but I'm so long-term.

284
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,310
- [Hollis] So the long game

285
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,712
is you want to be in 
a product business.

286
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,414
- [Gary] The long-term is
I want to buy the Jets.

287
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,214
- [Hollis] I know that.

288
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,918
- I know you know and so my
belief is that the way I'm gonna

289
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,755
do it is by buying
(censored) for $113 million,--

290
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,691
- [Hollis] And then
doing it through--

291
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,592
- our way,--
- [Hollis] Yeah.

292
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:10,263
- and then selling it for 780.
- [Hollis] Right.

293
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,533
Those heritage brands?
- Yes.

294
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,101
I think nostalgia
is underpriced.

295
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,103
And then I want to talk about
whatever you want to talk about.

296
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:22,141
So Crushed It if I was to
subtitle it now I would say how,

297
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,244
you know, the sentence would
read
somewhere to the degree of like

298
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,114
how these 97
people read "Crush It!"

299
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,717
and crushed it and
how you can too.

300
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:31,918
Got it?
- [Hollis] Yeah.

301
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,653
- 'Cause I think, you
see where I am going?

302
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,923
I like the, visually in my mind
I like the idea like the word

303
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,059
crush it being green like 
I don't know from a design

304
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,061
standpoint but that's really
cool.

305
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,198
That's A, kind of clever because
you might have a scenario where

306
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,133
people you could 
sell the first book in

307
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,268
a weird way but 
this is absolutely.

308
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,637
- [Hollis] We want to
talk about repackaging.

309
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,572
- Okay.

310
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:56,876
This can be a very thick
book, here's why I,

311
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,645
if I was to rewrite "Crush It!"

312
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,414
which is what I plan on doing,
personal brand has happened like

313
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,183
what I wrote
about in "Crush It!" transpired.

314
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,021
So, A, there's a lot
more to talk about.

315
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,524
I'm basically, no kidding,
rewriting at some level.

316
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,325
- [Hollis] Right.

317
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,495
- Meaning like okay
it's 2018, what do you do?

318
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,763
It's a phone first world.

319
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,699
It used to be a TV first world.

320
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,001
Pinterest and 
Snapchat and Instagram

321
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,037
these are the ABC, NBCs.

322
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,905
You have to find your passion.

323
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,607
There's a lot, I've
really evolved, right?

324
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,777
They'll be a lot
on self-awareness.

325
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:31,444
- [Hollis] Yes.

326
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:35,515
- They'll be a lot on it's okay
to make $84,000 a year and

327
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,983
sell pots and pans.

328
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:41,254
There'll be a lot in there so
like I feel, it's definitely,

329
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:45,091
at some level it's my best
content even though I've not.

330
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,027
Only with DailyVee have 
I gotten back to Crush It!

331
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:48,728
- [Hollis] Yeah.

332
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,063
- I went into marketing.
- [Hollis] Yes.

333
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,497
- This is back to personal brand

334
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,133
and inspiration and
live your best life. Right?

335
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,368
So it's gonna do well

336
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,769
for the same reason 
Crush It! did well.

337
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,038
What I'm very excited about guys
and why I do think it could be a

338
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:03,943
pretty big book is that's a lot
of content and then I want to

339
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:04,977
build a lot of profiles.

340
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,480
There are a lot of people.

341
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,684
You're gonna basically have 
to tell me at some level

342
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,519
what's too exhausting.

343
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,588
Yeah, because 
I really want to do it.

344
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,390
My team's gonna
be able to do it.

345
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,358
I'm gonna make them
video every interview.

346
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,126
- I was going to say.

347
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,530
- So we have this insane thing
where we like so what I think

348
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,867
what I'm probably pushing you 
with and my intuition from a

349
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,636
selling standpoint is I'd like 
to make it as big as you guys

350
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,872
feel comfortable with.

351
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,007
I really think
there's something to that.

352
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,376
- [Hollis] Alright, cool.
- Okay.

353
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,912
- [Hollis] Great.
- [Man 3] Pretty exciting.

354
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,850
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

355
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,785
- Okay, good.

356
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,221
- We'll get it done this year.
- That's what I thought, okay.

357
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,956
Okay, I need to manage for that.

358
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,125
Bye.

("I Want It All" by Jura Kez)

360
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,166
- [Gary] I think with especially

361
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,337
with limited time, 
anything, to me, this is

362
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,238
how I love to start stuff.

363
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,174
What's the biggest value?

364
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,544
Completely agnostic, almost as
if I was like a search engine.

365
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,245
- Yeah.

366
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,880
- [Gary] What's the biggest
value that you guys can bring to

367
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,815
your guys' world?

368
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:20,353
- [Man 4] I'm a big believer
in all our of businesses are

369
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,722
structured around relationships.

370
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,125
We've had a 30 year relationship
with GE and all those guys are

371
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,527
now part of a team.

372
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,197
Those types of, we're family
oriented company and business

373
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:35,735
and my dad's dad was a plumber
and from Kamenesti (inaudible)

374
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,671
from Belarus to Kamine
because it sounded too Jewish.

375
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,139
- Sure. Of course.

376
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,075
- [Man 4] And so my dad's
been in this business for 20,

377
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,144
30 years and so it's now okay

378
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,979
I'm leveraging a lot 
of his network.

379
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:47,747
- [Gary] Of course.

380
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,982
- And want to build my own
story and be my own man, right?

381
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,619
- [Gary] Yeah, of course
which is a real thing.

382
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,823
As I've gotten to know 
well off guys and gals,

383
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,193
there's the one version where,

384
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,696
you know, it's like
you come from zero and it's got

385
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,632
it's advantages and
disadvantages but establishing,

386
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,435
like when I look at my kids I'm
like if one of them is really

387
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:14,207
ambitious or both of them 
that's gonna be a lot of,

388
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,908
that's stuff.
- [Man 4] Yeah.

389
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,744
Making your own course
in that shadow is real.

390
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,814
- [Man 4] There is nothing worse
than being "you're the son of".

391
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,182
- 100%, man.

392
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,319
I even had a little 
bit of that with my,

393
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,987
what the fuck are 
those guys doing?

394
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,225
- [DRock] I think
they're filming your office.

395
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,427
- [Gary] What are
you guys doing?

396
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,430
- Mind?

397
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,133
Awesome.
- Wish you well.

398

Thank you brother,
I appreciate it.

Best of luck with everything.

You too. Thank you, brother,
really appreciate it.

Hey that was awesome that
that kid got me GaryVee.com.

404
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,482
I'm pumped about that actually.

405
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,217
Yeah, that's very nice.

406
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,588
I don't know if he's expecting
something in return or if he's

407
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,757
being smart and waiting a few
minutes but whenever he comes

408
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,993
back up make sure Tyler
knows, I'll jam with him.

know about (censored)?

Are you guys close?
Are we almost ready?

probably 5 minutes.

Great, awesome.

Can you send me whatever 
is being recording right now?

unconventional idea in life do

you subscribe to
that most people don't?

Just one?
- You mean all of it?

426
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,273

The whole thing.

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,681
That the balance of

extreme ego

429
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,852
and humility is the secret.

430
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,422
- [Emily] Concise.

431
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,259
Okay, this is about life hacks,
what's one of your best life

432

hacks or unique shortcut that's

immediately usable 
for other leaders?

434
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:22,501
- Ah, well other leaders,
I think that in the age of

435
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,971
technology people are
underestimating the

436
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,973
value of more people.

437
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,509
I hack with people.

438
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,380
Look at all these
fucking characters.

- [Emily] Hack with people to?

440
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,484
- Every leader should hire one
more person to be in their inner

441
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,753
circle and help them scale.

what we can do together.

gonna do more stuff.

I mean you look cool.

want the reminder for it?

I haven't looked at it.

what do you want to do?

481
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,545
- What do they want?

482

from you or her in terms of...

483

- Awesome.

484
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:39,305
You can do these interviews from
the outside but using the audio

485
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:42,541
I'd like to, you know?

486
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,676
I'm ready, Ty.

487
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,044

recent college graduate.

488
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,813
I graduated in May.

489
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,482
- [Tracy] SUNY Purchase.
- Awesome.

490
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,518
- [Tracy] I started out as an
economics major but then I took

491
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,354
a marketing course and
completely fell in love with it.

492
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,021
- Flipped.

493
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,090
- [Tracy] I was first introduced
to you and to VaynerMedia.

494
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,791
- Yep.

495
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,026
- [Tracy] We studied your book
"Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook,"--

496
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:01,694
- Awesome.

497
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,095
- [Tracy] and since
then I was hooked.

498
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,364
I knew ever since sophomore 
year in college that

499
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,466
I wanted to work here.
- That is insane.

500
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,801
- [Tracy] This is
a dream come true.

501
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,903
- That is so awesome.
That makes me so happy.

502
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:14,707
- [Tracy] Yeah, I wake up every
day so excited to come to work

503
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,442
and I just love it here.

504
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,411
Joe Beth told me on my very
first day that I had to tell you

505
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,246
that I was the on who made

506
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,181
a Snapchat filter 
for my interview.

507
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,749
- Yes, I know all
about that actually.

508
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,251
That's awesome.
I'm glad you brought that up.

509
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,886
That was such a good job.
- [Tracy] Thank you.

510
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:30,389
I actually made one for today.
- No way. Do you have it?

511
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,223
- [Tracy] I was so excited.
Yeah, I do.

512
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,258
- Let's take that
picture right now.

513
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,059
- [Tracy] I think I made 
it so I had an excuse to

514
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,327
take a selfie with you.

515
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,329
- Hold on, I'm gonna
give you even more love.

516
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,101
Okay, this is a real effort.

517
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:45,471
You made a filter for 
our gathering,

518
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,872
our quick little meeting.

519
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,040
- [Tracy] I did.
- I love you.

520
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,008
- [Tracy] I was so excited.

521
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:53,479
- Alright, what's
your Snapchat handle?

522
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,880
- [Tracy] TraceGoldb.

523
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,518
- T-R-A-C.
- [Tracy] T-R-A-C-E-G-O-L-D-B.

524
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,088
So I did opportunity knocked.

525
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,457
- [Gary] (laughs)
That's awesome.

526
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,931
Anything I can answer for you?

527
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:16,702
- [Tracy] I'm very interested
in how you balance everything.

528
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,739
You have so many commitments
and so many responsibilities--

529
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,540
- Yeah.

530
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,378
- [Tracy] you do such an amazing
job of putting yourself out

531
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,815
there but also
making time for family.

532
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,416
- Yep.

533
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,317
- [Tracy] That's
something you value.

534
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:31,951
- Yep.

535
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,453
- [Tracy] I'm very curious
about how you balance it all.

536
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,155
- I just try.

537
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,258
I think when you don't cripple
yourself to some standard that

538
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,561
you can't achieve, I just try.

539
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,898
I make every minute count to the
best of my ability and I just

540
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,100
try like, you know?

541
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,702
It's super simple.
- [Tracy] I do, yeah.

542
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:54,607
- I just try and I think that
in itself like is really how you

543
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,343
pull it off and like if I'm
feeling I'm not spending enough

544
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,078
time with family,
I'll try more there.

545
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,713
If I feel like I need to 
spend more time at Vayner,

546
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,714
I'll try more there.

547
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,083
If I feel like I need to put out
more content for my community,

548
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,618
I'll try there.

549
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:09,788
I adjust to the way I feel and
the signals I'm getting at all

550
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,893
times, always, forever.
- [Tracy] Mhmmm.

551
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,828
Awesome.
I love that answer.

552
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,896
- Cool. It's the truth.

553
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,798
Awesome, well, listen I'm here
for you if you ever need it.

554
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,433
- [Tracy] Yeah, 
I really appreciate that.

555
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,502
Love that you make
time for every employee.

556
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,470
- Of course.

557
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,105
Awesome.
Have a great day.

558
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,106
Yeah.
- [Tracy] You too.

559
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,073
- Don't lose that picture.

560
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,410
- [Tracy] Yeah, I won't,
I saved it immediately.

561
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,811
Thank you.
- [Gary] Take care.

562
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,515
And then when you graduated
then you came right to New York?

563
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,783
- [Sophie] Mhmmm.

564
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,219
Yeah, so my first job was
working out of a coworking space

565
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,054
called The Yard.
- The Yard.

566
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:42,855
- [Sophie] It's like
very similar to WeWork.

567
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:43,522
- Yeah.

568
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,590
- [Sophie] Little bit
smaller boutique version.

569
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,658
- Yeah.

570
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,126
- [Sophie] And then 
I worked at the Barbarian Group.

571
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:47,660
- Yes.

572
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,560
- [Sophie] Which
I know is like--

573
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,095
- Did you work with Rog?
- [Sophie] Yeah, it's so funny.

574
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,797
I actually worked
directly under Roger.

575
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,532
- No way.
- [Sophie] Yeah.

576
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,135
- That's so cool.
Did you know he was here?

577
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,003
- [Sophie] Yeah.
I did know.

578
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,205
- Did he, when you 
thought about it, actually,

579
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,373
how'd you get here?

580
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,509
- [Sophie] So Alex Klein
just messaged me on LinkedIn.

581
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,843
- And where were
you at that point?

582
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,512
Barbarian or somewhere else?
- [Sophie] Barbarian.

583
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,547
- And Barbarian's gone
through a lot of stuff, right?

584
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,882
- [Sophie] Yeah and so it was at

585
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,017
a point right after 
the CEO was let go.

586
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:12,685
- Yeah.

587
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,386
- [Sophie] So I was 
like I want to start

588
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,354
looking at other places.

589
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,489
- 'Cause she was
like great and--

590
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,290
- [Sophie] Yeah.

591
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,860
And the structure there for what
I wanted was not working for me

592
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,065
and Roger was also gone at
that time too so there was that.

593
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:29,034
- When Rog left, did you,
had you heard about Vayner?

594
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:29,935
Did you know?

595
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,503
- [Sophie] I had not heard
about Vayner at that point.

596
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,404
- Yep.

597
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,138
- [Sophie] I heard
he was coming here.

598
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:33,806
- Yeah.

599
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,908
- [Sophie] So after that I was
a little more familiar with it.

600
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:36,608
- Yep.

601
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,110
- [Sophie] So Alex reached
out to me and of course I like

602
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,311
immediately went to Roger.

603
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,514
But was funny was that 
I was looking for jobs and Alex

604
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:46,852
reached out to me and Barbarian
was going through lay offs,

605
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,120
myself included in that.

606
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,289
So the morning I was laid
off was the same day I had my

607
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,791
interview here and I got the
offer the following Tuesday so

608
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,727
it was absolutely perfect.

609
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,962
- (laughs) That
makes me so happy.

610
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:57,996
- [Sophie] So I was able to 
take a two week vacation

611
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,798
and then started here.
- How's it goin'?

612
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,866
- [Sophie] It's been
going really well.

613
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,668
- Good. That makes me happy.
- [Sophie] Yeah.

614
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,769
- Awesome.
This was fun.

615
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:04,603
- [Sophie] Yes.
Thank you so much.

616
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,504
- Have a great day.
- [Sophie] You too.

617
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,706
- Yeah, take care.

618
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:11,110
("Save My Life" by Jura Kez)

619
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,919
- We're getting a ton of
response on the video that went

620
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,488
with the Hustler's Digest.

621
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,490
Most I've seen in a long time.

622
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,091
- [Gary] Well which one was it?

623
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,960
- [Tyler] The no
regret or one at-bat.

624
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,264
- Interesting.
- 2:00 to 2:15, cool.

625
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,368
Need anything?
- [Gary] No.

626
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,170
Hi. How are you?
- Good. How are you?

627
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,205
- It's good to see you again.
- Yeah, I know.

628
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,709
- It seems like from my
perspective the net score is at

629
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,746
least on the most macro level
for 750 people, people feel like

630
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,615
the transition's
the right thing.

631
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:52,718
I think for the people most
affected by it, do you feel

632
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:57,689
like, I'm glad you're sitting
with me, we have nothing but

633
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,058
good intent for
every individual.

634
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,662
So, all we need to do is know.

635
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,864
What's scary, what's not, 
what can I help with,

636
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,433
you know what I mean?
- [Woman 3] Yeah.

637
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:12,237
Yeah, I think it's 
just trying to figure out

638
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:17,276
how to scale 
that really quickly.

639
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,111
- Which part?
Which part?

640
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:23,982
The IP part or just the
whole transition as a whole?

641
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:24,783
Awesome.

642
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,551
Have a great day, yeah.
- [Woman 3] Thanks so much.

643
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,654
Yeah, talk to you soon.

644
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,590
It's only 12?
- [DRock] I know.

645
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,092
(laughs) 
I literally just saw that.

646
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,694
- How is it only 12?

647
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:40,933
Oh the media stuff, yeah.
- Yes. (censored) conversation.

648
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,568
- Yeah, keep it
separate for now.

649
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,002
- Cool, and 
I'm assuming everything

650
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,205
we're doing there is 
driving to Wine Library.

651
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,207
- Where?
- If we're doing content.

652
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,710
- Yeah, we're gonna say these
are the best six wines, yes, the

653
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,513
reason I'm willing to give free
content is pointing some of it

654
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,482
to Wine Library.
- Some, got it.

655
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,816
- Yeah. Doesn't have to be all.
- [Alex] Cool.

656
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,118
- It's not a advertorial.
- Got it.

657
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:05,190
- And even if it's like 
Gary Vaynerchuk was founder of

658
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,559
Wine Library TV and it links to
the and you know what I mean?

659
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,728
- Yep. Find ways to make it fit.

660
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,597
- Yeah.
- [Alex] Thank you.

661
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:12,264
- Where is this?

662
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,867
Where is this?
Which one?

663
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,408
Hey!
- [Woman 4] How's it going?

664
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,511
- [Gary] 'Sup, brother?
Great to see you, how you been?

665
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,411
It's really good to see you.

666
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,080
Hi.
- Hi.

667
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,581
- [Gary] How are you?
- [Woman 4] Good.

668
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,916
- [Gary] All well?
- [Woman 4] How's things?

669
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:31,683
- [Gary] It's good to see you.

670
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,285
- Yeah, I love the new office.
- [Gary] It's crazy.

671
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,721
- [Denniss] (inaudible).
- [Gary] About us?

672
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,489
Yeah, great.

673
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,992
Anything, got any update?
- Yes.

674
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,059
- [Gary] Can I steal
him for one second?

675
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,461
- Yeah, of course.
Go for it.

676
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,538
Last night was fun,
that was so great.

677
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,705
You love that stuff.

678
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,053
This is a serious room.

679
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,156
Lindsey.

680
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,892
(group laughter) 
Alright, cool.

681
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:14,560
Can you guys hear?

682
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,695
Actually send it over here a
little bit for my little part

683
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,997
and then you'll take it.

684
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,700
So this is super fun.
Great to see everybody.

685
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,070
We don't get to do this
super much and I appreciate

686
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,772
everybody's hustle and
thanks for making time.

687
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:30,375
So we're gonna announce this
pretty soon and I thought it'd

688
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,411
be important to
announce it to you guys first.

689
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,413
Give you some clarity around
what's happening 'cause I think

690
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:38,216
there's gonna be a lot of
reaction and questions about it.

691
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,285
All in a positive way, 
I actually just anticipate a lot

692
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:44,389
of people wanting to work in
this division, maybe even more

693
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,994
reaction than the 700
emails I have for VaynerSports.

694
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:53,332
So in the last six months I've
gone, think about this, for

695
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:57,302
five, six, seven years I've gone
from zero to 550, and in

696
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:00,405
six months I've gone from
550 to 1.2 million. Right?

697
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,207
And I think even
you probably know it.

698
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,209
My brand's at a little bit of a
different place than it was even

699
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:08,547
six months ago and all of it,
all of it has to do with what

700
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,783
I've been building with
Andy and DRock and India.

701
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,453
It's been the content, 
the punchline is it's been the

702
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,689
production company
that I built around me.

703
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,359
And it's going to be what

704
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,427
every single person 
does in the future.

705
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,863
Every single person is not gonna
have a social media team which

706
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,065
is like their cousin, right?

707
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:31,670
Everybody's not gonna
pay $7,000 to a PR person.

708
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,673
Take that with a grain of salt.
(group laughter)

709
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,043
I know, I know,
I know, I just want to create

710
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,578
clarity that we're
aligned, don't worry.

711
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:42,481
I wasn't killing Rebecca.
(group laughter)

712
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:45,350
The evolution of pay,

713
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,086
if you're Tyra Banks

714
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,922
the evolution of paying
your PR person $7,000 a month

715
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,660
and paying your social media
person that writes tweets for

716
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,664
you $3,000 a month is going to
evolve into VaynerTalent and so

717
00:29:58,664 --> 00:29:59,531
that's what we're gonna build.

718
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,235
We're gonna build a division
that basically takes what we've

719
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,704
done and do it for
individual people.

720
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,907
We are basically, for Todd and
a couple others we're basically

721
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:12,077
going back to a price point like
early VaynerMedia which is like

722
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,946
you pays $20,000 a
month and we do this.

723
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,281
And that's what we're
gonna do for humans.

724
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:20,018
What we've done really well is
I create an obnoxious amount of

725
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,388
content because of the strategy
of how we do it, not because,

726
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,224
by the way, it's my five players
versus three players video that

727
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,726
I sent all of you.

728
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:31,630
When your strategy
is right, you win.

729
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,001
And so we have figured 
out that pillar content

730
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,371
creates content
underneath it at scale,

731
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,706
predicated on your talent.

732
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:44,409
I'm massively quotable and
charismatic and unbelievable.

733
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,478
If you're boring and 
don't say anything interesting

734
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:52,184
it's gonna be harder.
I mean that.

735
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,720
So this meeting is mainly like,

736
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,687
we do enough things that nobody

737
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,622
knows what the fuck is actually
going on 'cause I don't

738
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,658
announce it, this, I don't think
we can build a whole division

739
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,694
without it least
being announced.

740
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,096
(group laughter)

741
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,564
- [Woman 4] Gotcha.
That's fair.

742
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,699
- Yes, though
sometimes I like doing it.

743
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,534
'Cause they're unofficial.

744
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,570
What (censored) office?

745
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,474
(group laughter)
Alright, cool. Good?

746
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:16,708
(group affirms) 
Awsome.

747
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,642
Cool.
Awesome.

748
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,245
(group applause)

749
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,248
I'm just saying hello, 
one more second.

750
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,483
Who you meeting with today?

751
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,785
- You.
- You are? What time?

752
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,454
- 2:00?
- What?

753
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:34,326
Come, that's what 
I was worried about.

754
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,360
Hey, Tyler.

755
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,763
I want you to figure
out what's going on here.

756
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:39,698
We'll figure it out.

757
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,534
Thinks he's seeing me.

758
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,872
Mhmmm.
- [Zak] Okay.

759
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:56,047
- Oh, Shoots, what do you want?

760
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,683
- [Dan] DRock.
- Dan.

761
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,518
- I'll still come back every

762
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,953
day just to be on 
the show, you know?

763
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,289
- It'll be interesting, you
will be in it at times, right?

764
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,557
- Yeah.

765
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,958
I'm gonna be in LA
Monday through Thursday.

766
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,994
- I don't know if we ever had
a situation quite like that at

767
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,262
Vayner, right?

768
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,329
I don't think so.

769
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,731
- [Dan] No worries,
be in the building.

770
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:16,234
- Yeah, like you'll be
here probably a lot.

771
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,068
- Yeah.
- [Gary] You know?

772
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,738
Probably seven, nine
times a year kind of thing.

773
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,840
- I thought you were going
to say nine times a week.

774
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,009
(group laughter) 
Well...

775
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,012
- This one's for a client.

776
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:28,914
- [Tyler] Did you see what
the Dodgers did last night?

777
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,249
- I did.
- [Tyler] With their closer.

778
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,450
- I did.
They brought him in.

779
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,685
- [Tyler] In the seventh.
- Yep.

780
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,187
- [Tyler] And that whole
movement that's going on.

781
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,054
- That what?

782
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,156
- [Tyler] Just that whole
movement of saving your closer

783
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,759
to the ninth is stupid.

784
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,729
- Because of what
happened with the Orioles.

785
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,833
- [Tyler] Stats show that first
off, two through four hitters

786
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,035
come up in the eighth more times
than not and that's who you

787
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,637
should put your
best pitcher against.

788
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,676
The data's just coming out,

789
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:01,012
like Mariano who 
lost a ton of leverage in

790
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,215
that they always put him in
the ninth inning and then had a

791
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:07,819
reliever pitch in the eighth
against their best hitters and

792
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,689
give up runs there and then
Mariano wouldn't even get to...

793
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,057
- That's why the Yanks 
were so dominant when it

794
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,426
was Mariano and Wetteland.

795
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,760
- [Tyler] And then when
it was just Mariano--

796
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,329
- Yep.

797
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,470
- [Brandon] Call you back in 10.

798
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,474
- Of course you have prices
on every wine in the flyer.

799
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,376
- [Brandon] Right but what we're
saying is $14.99 if you come in

800
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,845
the store and $12.99 if
you do it online, right?

801
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,413
- You do that everyday.

802
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,150
It's called a discount code.
- [Brandon] Yep, okay.

803
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,621
- Am I right?

804
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,889
- [Brandon] We've never said it

805
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,124
in this way, 
you know what I mean?

806
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,393
That's all.

807
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,566
Maybe I'll reword it a
little bit to make it easier.

808
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:58,036
- [Gary] Sure.
Make yourself feel better.

809
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,004
- [Brandon] Fine.

810
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,672
- Hey.
- [Brandon] Yeah?

811
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,041
- Did we sell anything today?

812
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,846
- [Brandon] Sold a little,
nothing great yet but I will

813
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,781
have more stuff for
you soon, promise.

814
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,983
- [Gary] And what
about the try this?

815
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,985
- [Brandon] Three cases.
- Of what?

816
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,719
- [Brandon] Of the
Healdsburg Ranches Merlot.

817
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,023
- Yep. Alright, see you.
- [Brandon] Yeah, alright, bye.

818
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,203
- Feel good.
I like when I get stuff done.

819
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:32,904
- Yeah.

820
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,940
- [Gary] Caught up and like,
I like when I put out fires.

821
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,609
Makes me breathe easier.

822
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,444
Sid.

823
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,454
Hey.
- Hello.

824
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,927
- [Gary] Where's the, what?

825
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:58,730
Hey, how are you?

826
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,266
That's cool.
That's super cool.

827
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,936
I didn't see them fix it up.

828
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,544
Hey, 'sup Anna?

829
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,052
So like, you're married.

830
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,954
Yeah, Maggie emailed me

831
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,223
I'm like that's so weird 
with the last name.

832
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,891
- Switched her
name, I was confused.

833
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,927
- [Gary] I was, I had heard
that you were gonna

834
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,196
switch your name.
- Oh, I really wanted.

835
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,431
- [Gary] Hey everyone.
How you guys doin'?

836
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,132
- Good.
- Good.

837
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,567
- [Gary] All well?
- Yes.

838
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,769
- [Gary] Cool.
Have a great day.

839
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,405
(group laughter)

840
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,007
- Oh, what's up?
- 'Sup, bro?

841
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:42,707
- [Man 5] How you doin'?

842
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,775
- [Gary] Talking to Maggie?
- [Man 5] Yeah, yeah.

843
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:44,709
- [Gary] What's going on?

844
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,678
- [Man 8] Just helping me out.
- 'Sup bro, how you doing?

845
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,079
- Good.

846
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,347
- [Gary] Good to see you guys.
What's going on?

847
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,116
- [Man 6] What's going on?
- [Gary] Good.

848
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,151
You guys cold?
- [Man 5] A little bit.

849
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,654
- A little bit.
- [Gary] Yeah.

850
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,656
Yeah, this is rad.

851
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,890
- [Man 5] Let's get
this going actually.

852
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,292
- [Gary] That was Tyler's fault.
He fucked up.

853
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,394
(group laughter)

854
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,029
Seriously. He made 
a huge mistake.

855
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,830
He thought it was here.

856
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,932
- Yeah, I saw on the invite it
was somewhere on Hudson Street.

857
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,101
- [Gary] He got confused
because it said Hudson Street.

858
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:10,769
- Yeah.

859
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,237
- [Gary] And he just,
his eye overlooked it.

860
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:12,837
- Yeah.

861
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,571
- [Gary] You
should really razz him.

862
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,142
You should send him an email
and be like you destroyed his
day.

863
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:19,044
He destroyed your day.
All good?

864
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,346
- [Man 5] DRock, let's get
a closeup on the fountain.

865
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:30,588
- [Gary] Dude, how do you

866
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,925
feel like owing like 
$78,000 to the league?

867
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,262
- You know, I asked my parents
about it and they were like

868
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,931
it's A, way too late to 
ask for this kind of loan,

869
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,933
B, you're our 
least favorite child and

870
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:45,837
C, that's a lot 
to pony up right now.

871
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:49,407
So my only chance, I got to ask
the prize next year be $78,000.

872
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,975
- [Gary] $78,000.
Sounds right.

873
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,044
- [Man 6] That I can win.
- [Gary] Understood.

874
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,315
You guys alright?

875
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,890
How you doin', DRock?

876
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,626
Having a good day?
- [DRock] Yes, I am.

877
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,228
- [Gary] Good.

878
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,531
What are you talking about?

879
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,434
I'm always super, 
I actually think I'm super easy.

880
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,236
It's rare for me to
do what I just did.

881
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,537
I'll be right back.
Is he here?

882
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,172
- [Tyler] Yeah.

883
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,847
Ladies.
- [Both] Hello.

884
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:29,914
- [Gary] Thank you.

885
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,717
- [Tyler] Where you go going?
- [DRock] Yeah, where you going?

886
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,089
- [Gary] I thought he was going
to do an UberPool so he could

887
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,426
get a quick date.
(group laughter)

888
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,564
- [Tyler] GeeV, over here, bud.
- [Gary] Okay.

889
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,766
That was a good one.

890
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,335
Andy!

891
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,772
- You need anything?
- [Gary] I'll take a coffee.

892
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,608
We didn't get, we
didn't really get to it.

893
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,810
I gave him a huge compliment
on his sneaker poster.

894
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,911
- I went for the
wrong bottle of wine.

895
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,246
- Yeah. Loved it?

896
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,313
- I was like shit.

897
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,781
(group laughter)
This is amazing.

898
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,283
- I knew that was
going to blow people away.

899
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,520
("Working Together" by Jura Kez)

900
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:25,904
- [Gary] I feel like it's the

901
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,405
kind of thing you should
sink your teeth into.

902
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,676
You don't need to become the
(censored) expert but you need

903
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,212
to help me build it.

904
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,246
Does that make sense?
- [Man 8] Sure.

905
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,281
- This is something that can

906
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,883
really be an impact 
on you personally.

907
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,118
Dig into this.
- [Man 8] Yep.

908
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,386
- Really, you know what I mean?
- [Man 8] Sure.

909
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,487
- Dig into this.
- [Man 8] Cool.

910
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,721
- [Gary] Do you see it, 
do you see it too?

911
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,456
- I do. It's internet 
1.0 all over again

912
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,457
but in a different way because

913
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,593
now it's much more enabled
'cause there's so much more

914
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:49,727
technology at stake.

915
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,629
- [Gary] You gotta understand,
I'm really excited about it

916
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,866
because I think this could
be really carved out for you.

917
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,568
Like, I don't know if it
interests you and that's why I'm

918
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:59,837
not pushing too hard but if
you're asking me agnostically

919
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,040
something that's ownable that
can be quite substantial--

920
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,874
- [Man 8] Yeah.

921
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,310
- that can be beneficial to
you and you're built for,--

922
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,244
- [Man 8] Yeah.

923
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,812
- I think this is it.
- [Man 8] Cool.

924
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:11,282
- [Gary] In my way, 
just the way I view you,

925
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,618
you're here for this moment.

926
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:16,120
I know that you're the right
player and it's always like

927
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,655
players in a 
position to succeed,

928
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,023
we've done many things
already together--

929
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,358
- [Man 8] Yeah.
- I think this has a shot.

930
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,360
You're sitting with
Sally and Rick--

931
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,630
- [Man 8] Yeah.
- and learning and knowing.

932
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,667
This is, again, I'm agnostic,
you don't have to but you need

933
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,070
to seriously think about 
this being something that

934
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,504
could be really big.
- [Man 8] Good.

935
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,439
Thanks, man.

936
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,741
- [Gary] Yeah, I think it's a
good, I'm really excited about

937
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:40,478
it but don't use my
excitement to push you to do it.

938
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,379
You know what I mean?

939
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,146
I'm empathetic to that.

940
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,514
- [Man 8] Yeah, I hear you.
- You know?

941
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,382
Give it some thought.

942
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,718
But you don't have to love it.

943
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,987
I think it's there, man.

944
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,189
I want you to really help me,
I want you to put some real

945
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:52,123
fucking work on this.

946
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:56,160
I want five or six names from
you with links of like we need

947
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,929
to hire this person.
- [Man 8] Cool.

948
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,731
- Figure it out. Yeah.

949
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,273
I have unbelievable seats for
you two unbelievable seats in

950
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,508
LA for Tuesday and Wednesday and

951
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,811
I think you and 
Sitomer should go.

952
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,751
Well, let's talk about it.

953
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,619
Let's talk about it.

954
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,622
Well, let's talk about, aren't
you going already you said?

955
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,559
And so what is that?

956
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,994
That's when and when?

957
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,198
Tuesday, Wednesday,
Monday, Wednesday.

958
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,904
Okay, so you're definitely going
to LA Tuesday because you can

959
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,807
fly into San Francisco Wednesday
morning on the 6 AM flight.

960
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,644
- [Brandon] But I have
to change the flight.

961
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,378
- Brandon, you don't understand.

962
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,479
Let me remind you.

963
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,215
Do you remember when you
lived upstairs from me?

964
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,350
- [Brandon] Yes.

965
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,053
- And do you remember when 
I would always say to you like

966
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,488
you should come and hang because
we're gonna regret this because

967
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,325
one day we're gonna married
and we can't just hang out like.

968
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,526
- [Brandon] Yeah.
- Good.

969
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,795
That's what's
happening again right now.

970
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,096
- [Brandon] It's
just a lot of money.

971
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,864
It's a lot of money to
change, I'm not arguing.

972
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,333
(inaudible)

973
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:12,470
- No, you're doing
this and that's that.

974
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,206
You're going
Tuesday and Wednesday.

975
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,042
Start looking at flights.

976
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:22,180
I'm gonna have Tyler, Garrett,
Garrett, Garrett email Brandon

977
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,982
right now I'm forcing him to
go to the Tuesday and Wednesday

978
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,551
games of the Cubs in LA.

979
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,419
I want you to help with him with
flights 'cause I trust you more

980
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,255
than I trust him so email him
right now your cell number.

981
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,258
Call Garrett he's
gonna help you.

982
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,760
Alright?
- [Brandon] Yes.

983
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,496
- [Gary] Okay, good.
I love you more, bye.

984
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:40,064
What?

985
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,601
- The $50K that you
donated when you were on stage.

986
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,936
- [Gary] What?

987
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,170
- The $50K that you donated
when you were on stage,--

988
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,705
- Yes, I'm gonna do that
by the end of the year.

989
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:48,506
Let him know.

990
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,340
Let him know there's some tax

991
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,310
stuff but it will 
100% happen by the year.

992
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,545
- [Tyler] I think he's
gotten a shitload of influence.

993
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,748
- I know, I know.
- Okay, cool.

994
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:57,648
I'll let him know that.

995
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,150
Will it be
personal or will it be?

996
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,985
- It'll be personal.
- Okay, cool.

997
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,357
Hi.
- Hi.

998
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,258
- How are you?
- Good.

999
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,126
Jocelyn.
- Good.

1000
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,227
Jocelyn, you hurt your finger?
- [Jocelyn] Yeah.

1001
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,194
- What happened?

1002
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,998
- [Jocelyn] I originally hurt it
playing basketball and then--

1003
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,333
- [Gary] First of all, 
that's awesome.

1004
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,734
I love you for that.
(Jocelyn laughs)

1005
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:20,304
- And then I re-hurt it just
like pure stupidity honestly.

1006
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,074
I tripped and slammed
my finger in a mailbox.

1007
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,042
- [Gary] (laughs) I love it.

1008
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,377
That was perfect.

1009
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,645
How are you?
- [Jocelyn] Good.

1010
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,348
- Good. Anything
I can answer for you?

1011
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,419
- I was just curious
what's going on in your life?

1012
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:35,753
- Not much.

1013
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,155
(Gary and Jocelyn laughing)

1014
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:40,291
- Not really.
- Vayner.

1015
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,227
Vayner.

1016
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,365
My day's just filled
with headaches and I'm just

1017
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:49,967
trying to like I really
meant what I just said to you.

1018
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,836
I work for you.
- [Jocelyn] Mhmmm.

1019
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,138
- I don't know what
else to tell you.

1020
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,274
When you take on the
responsibility to be the last

1021
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,577
line of defense,
it's all your fault.

1022
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,978
All of it.
- [Jocelyn] Mhmmm.

1023
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,282
- And so, I feel a huge

1024
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:06,551
gratitude in everybody's trust

1025
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,487
and a huge sense responsibly
to deliver for everybody like

1026
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,423
I think we're really building
something for real like

1027
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,758
not just lip service.

1028
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,461
It's just very black-and-white
to me, I know we are and I want

1029
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:19,163
to see through and I want to
really deliver so I feel like

1030
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:23,901
public, great pressure.
- [Jocelyn] That's a lot.

1031
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:24,602
- You know?

1032
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,872
It's just five offices, 
800 people almost now.

1033
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:30,374
Not to mention all, you know
just like all the other stuff

1034
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,977
that goes along with like my
life, like the content and the

1035
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,414
books and the speaking and being
pulled in a million directions,

1036
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:39,750
it is a lot but
like I made my bed.

1037
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,020
I can't complain about
sleeping in it, you know?

1038
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,155
- [Jocelyn] Yeah.

1039
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:47,258
- And then let's really get to
the punchline, in the world of

1040
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:51,529
8 billion people 
I'm going to be okay.

1041
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:52,697
Do you know I mean?

1042
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:55,399
I can't even to begin to, 
I think coming from immigrant

1043
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,835
background and things of that
nature like my perspective

1044
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,370
is on fucking point.

1045
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,773
I'm very aware of how awesome

1046
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,775
it is so, yeah,
it's a lot of pressure.

1047
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,878
Great, so then don't do it.

1048
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,413
Sell the company, downsize it.

1049
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,349
I've made it's like I like want

1050
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,818
to instill that on 
the rest of the org.

1051
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,353
You're a big girl.

1052
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:18,156
Whatever problems the biggest
reason I'm giving you this

1053
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,057
little rant is I want you to
know that if you ever have

1054
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,159
anything, I'm here.
- [Jocelyn] Mhmmm.

1055
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,997
- Like email me.
- [Jocelyn] Okay.

1056
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,131
- You know?

1057
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,300
Have you met Claude yet?
- [Jocelyn] I haven't.

1058
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,868
- You have to
email her, right now.

1059
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,104
- [Jocelyn] Okay.
- I'm forcing you.

1060
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:33,771
- [Jocelyn] Okay.

1061
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,773
- You have to go to
your desk and email her.

1062
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,576
And be like I want her
to know who you are.

1063
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:43,848
This horse shit, it's way
more real than you think.

1064
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,016
- [Jocelyn] Mhmmm.

1065
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,517
- Take advantage of it.

1066
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,987
You stumbled into it,
fucking take advantage of it.

1067
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:50,555
- [Jocelyn] Okay.

1068
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:52,723
- Do you understand?
- [Jocelyn] Yeah. I'll do that.

1069
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,425
Email Claude, email Steve.

1070
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,128
- You know?
- [Jocelyn] Mhmmm.

1071
00:44:57,128 --> 00:45:01,399
- It's good and you should
get the most benefit from it.

1072
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:02,967
- [Jocelyn] I will.
- Cool.

1073
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:03,701
- [Jocelyn] Yeah.

1074
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,669
Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1075
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:05,636
Have a great day.
- [Jocelyn] Thanks.

1076
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:06,637
- Yeah. I hope
your finger gets better.

1077
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,273
- [Jocelyn] Thanks.

1078
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,708
- [Jocelyn] Thanks.

1079
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,844
- Zak! 
- [DRock] Zak.

1080
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,816
- [Gary] Come here, Zak.
(DRock laughing)

1081
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,685
- Are you taking a picture?

1082
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,587
- [Gary] Zak, please 
come here because

1083
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:24,255
I need to understand.

1084
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,290
Is that your 
Pokémon ball balloon?

1085
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:26,891
- Yeah.

1086
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:27,725
- Who got it for you?

1087
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,360
Hurry, one second.
- The team.

1088
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,227
- The team.

1089
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:31,829
- Kara.

1090
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:32,630
- How are you, Kara?
- Good.

1091
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,864
- What's been going on?

1092
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,399
- Not much.

1093
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,068
- How long have 
you been here now?

1094
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,269
- Since February.

1095
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,037
So like, eight months 
I think it is.

1096
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:40,738
- How's it going?

1097
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,906
- It's good, I like it a lot.

1098
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,507
- Good, tell me about yourself.

1099
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:45,977
- I'm from Long Island.

1100
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:49,046
I went to Stevens in Hoboken.

1101
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,314
Did lacrosse there.

1102
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,282
- Did you?
- Yeah.

1103
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:52,383
- That's awesome.

1104
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,085
- Right out of school I started
working for an architect.

1105
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,854
I went to school for
marketing information systems.

1106
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,155
- It's very basic.

1107
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,392
I'm not a hero or 
the greatest guy ever.

1108
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,361
I'm just building 
something forever.

1109
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,495
- You're just 
saying it differently.

1110
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,896
- 100%.

1111
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,465
- I buy that.

1112
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:08,399
It's just--

1113
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:09,500
What's broke?

1114
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,369
And it's a simple 
fix half the time.

1115
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:12,603
It's just think 
about it differently.

1116
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,740
I don't know, 
I talk to people who--

1117
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,074
And I'll be honest with you,

1118
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,609
when a recruiter hit 
me up for the job.

1119
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,543
I'd never heard of 
VaynerMedia before.

1120
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:20,378
- I get it.

1121
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,612
- I don't mean 
that in a douchey way--

1122
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,314
- No, no, no.

1123
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,548
You have to understand.

1124
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,917
I'm the most egotistical
and the most humble.

1125
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:27,485
- Yeah.

1126
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,954
- Like, I don't think 
any real creative

1127
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,822
thinks this is a real--

1128
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,090
doesn't know this.

1129
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:33,758
- No.

1130
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:34,592
- 'Cause we don't 
play that game.

1131
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,426
- [Adam] No, you don't.

1132
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,194
- We're inventing the
next version of the game.

1133
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,696
- [Adam] Yeah. Yeah.

1134
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,799
- Every 13-year-old you,--
- [Adam] Yeah.

1135
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,733
- is gonna dream to work here.

1136
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,802
- [Adam] 100%, because,

1137
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,405
when I grew up it was the
Chiat Days or the whatever

1138
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:48,439
that were doing 
the stuff, and now--

1139
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:51,475
- Did you know very early on
this was what you wanted to do?

1140
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,243
- [Adam] Advertising?
- [Gary] Yeah.

1141
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,011
- Yeah, I mean, 
I was in grade ten.

1142
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:54,845
Sydney.

1143
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,180
I'm from Sydney, Australia.

1144
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,815
I was grade ten and I went
and did work for Disney.

1145
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,083
I wanted to be an animator.

1146
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,052
And I kind of realized within--

1147
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:03,120
It's fantastic, in grade ten
they send you to do two weeks

1148
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,921
work experience.

1149
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,156
- And in five 
seconds you're like--

1150
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,590
- You realize that your dream
is not what you wanted to do.

1151
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,325
And no one's gonna go like,
my dream would've been to play

1152
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,226
for Phoenix Suns.

1153
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:10,895
But, I was never gonna do that.

1154
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:11,796
So I couldn't go and do that.

1155
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,431
So I went and did the--

1156
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:14,332
- I had a similar dream.

1157
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,333
My dream was to actually
play for New York Jets.

1158
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,035
It's just, when I realized
I couldn't do that I said

1159
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,470
you know what?
Fuck it, I'll just buy it.

1160
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,171
(laughs)

1161
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,773
- And I love that. I love that.
I love that.

1162
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,942
And I mean I hope you get there,

1163
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,444
it'd be freaking amazing.

1164
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,979
- You might design the new logo.

1165
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:29,947
- That would be great.

1166
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,716
I'm a Giants fan, but 
I don't hold that against you

1167
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:33,417
because I honestly,

1168
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,120
I arrived here and I was
like, I gotta pick a team.

1169
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,223
And I was kind of Cardinals.
- [Gary] Yeah.

1170
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,625
- 'cause I just grew up
loving Charles Barkley

1171
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:42,593
and I hated Jordan. 
I hated Jordan.

1172
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,028
- Yeah, I hate Jordan 
with all my life.

1173
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,396
- And I was like, Barkley's
the guy who gives the finger

1174
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,565
to the organization
and I love that.

1175
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,400
So I love Dan Marley.

1176
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,568
- Thunder Dan.

1177
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,171
The Knick's new 
coach is Hornacek.

1178
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,806
- Oh, and he was 
with Suns coach.

1179
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:56,440
- Yeah.

1180
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,008
- So, I'm a huge, I go
every year to see the Suns--

1181
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:58,943
- Is Nate here?

1182
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,044
Oh no, Nate.

1183
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,712
Yo, get Nate.

1184
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:07,952
So Nate, who used to be my
assistant for years, and is--

1185
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:09,787
You have to meet him,
he's a real Suns fan.

1186
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:11,856
- Oh, man, I'm legit, 
we should--

1187
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:15,192
- You guys are gonna have
to go to a game together.

1188
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,194
- Yeah, no, amazing.

1189
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,196
Howdy, man.

1190
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:19,897
- Nate.

1191
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,998
- Do you know Adam Lock?

1192
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,266
- No.
- I don't think so.

1193
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,201
- [Gary] Great news.

1194
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,003
He's a real Suns fan.

1195
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:26,771
- [Nate] Yeah.

1196
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:29,774
- I flew twice from Sydney
just to Phoenix to watch games

1197
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:30,841
and flew home again.

1198
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:31,776
- Why'd you become a Suns fan?

1199
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:33,477
- [Gary] Charles Barkley, 
he hated Jordan.

1200
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,012
- I loved Charles Barkley, 
I hated Jordan and I was like.

1201
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,448
- '96 when I got into
basketball.

1202
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:39,350
- Nate, when--

1203
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,051
Well, 'cause you're both
bandwagon fans,

1204
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,820
that's when they were good.

1205
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:46,190
Okay, well you're also young.

1206
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,959
When are Knicks 
playing the Suns?

1207
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:49,994
- [Nate] 21st.
- Of?

1208
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:50,995
- [Nate] Here?

1209
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:52,229
- Yeah.
- [Nate] January 21st.

1210
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,063
- Do we have tickets 
for that game?

1211
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:53,731
- [Nate] Yeah.

1212
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:55,266
- Okay, cool, awesome.

1213
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,433
- [Nate] Nice to meet you.

1214
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,335
- We'll see if Adam 
makes it to January.

1215
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,937
- [Adam] We gotta set up a 
slack channel for us.

1216
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,938
Just the Suns channel, 
you and me.

1217
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,407
- [Nate] For sure, 
there's none of us here.

1218
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,075
- [Gary] Are there no Suns fans?

1219
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:05,910
- I guess Chanel.

1220
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,945
Chanel's from Arizona, 
but very few.

1221
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,214
- Chanel Perez?

1222
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,049
Is she a Suns fan though?

1223
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,151
- There's like two dance
teams for the Suns,

1224
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,085
she was on one 
of the dance teams.

1225
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,253
- Oh, that's cool.
- [Adam] That's fair enough.

1226
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,688
- She was an employee.

1227
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,023
- [Nate] Does that mean 
she's a fan though?

1228
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:21,091
- We'll have to
figure it out later.

1229
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:25,062
(light music)

1230
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,398
- [Gary] What else has
been going on with you?

1231
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,967
- Just been working a lot, yeah.

1232
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:03,901
- [Gary] Oh, do you 
work with him?

1233
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:04,735
- Yeah.

1234
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:05,569
[Gary] Awesome.

1235
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:06,570
- It's funny, I met him

1236
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,404
- [Gary] Where's he from?

1237
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:08,239
about seven years ago.

1238
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,340
Tel Aviv, Israel.

1239
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,574
And he travels all 
around the world.

1240
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,477
He's like you on planes, but
he's never really in one place.

1241
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,378
- [Gary] Yeah.

1242
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:17,848
So, he has an agent that he
works with in New York City,

1243
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,416
he said, hey, you know,
we're gonna just do a show,

1244
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,752
because eventually they
wanna do some Broadway thing,

1245
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,787
so they threw him in
Caroline's in a full house

1246
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,755
and it's kinda cool.

1247
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:25,589
- [Lior] Yes!

1248
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,423
- [Gary] Awesome.

1249
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,258
- [Lior] It was fun.

1250
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:28,092
- I figured we'd 
come in here, and,

1251
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:28,926
- How are you? I'm Gary.

1252
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:30,594
- Thank you for having
us here, it's great.

1253
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,795
- Yeah, no worries.

1254
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,899
- I actually, on the way
here, I was on the elevator,

1255
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:35,933
I want to ask you a question,

1256
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,067
I'm gonna write something here.

1257
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:37,902
- [Gary] You got it.

1258
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,837
- Because we're shooting this,

1259
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:41,238
(laughing)

1260
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,407
- [Gary] By the way,
thank god I can't do this

1261
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,309
because I'd be the worst.

1262
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:47,478
- Go straight to Gary,
Gary look at the camera,

1263
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:48,312
- Yes.

1264
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,446
- And tell us a 
two digit number.

1265
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,181
Whatever you want, 
just say something.

1266
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,016
- One Five.

1267
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:52,917
- [Lior] So it's 15?

1268
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:53,751
- Yes.

1269
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,153
- I wrote here, 
"Gary will say 15."

1270
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:56,987
(people laughing)

1271
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:57,821
- I don't know what 
else to tell you.

1272
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,656
- Do you see?

1273
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:00,391
- I see it.

1274
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,293
- Yes, so why did you say
15? This is the question.

1275
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:03,527
- Because you put it in my head.

1276
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,497
- It's close to this,
it's close to this, yes.

1277
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,299
Hi, you guys, nice to meet you.

1278
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:11,201
Very awkward 
moment here, but it's fun.

1279
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,503
- [Gary] It's fucking the best.

1280
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,104
I believe in this shit
completely, by the way.

1281
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,172
- It's not about 
believing or not.

1282
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,440
First of all, it's about
experiencing.

1283
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,274
- [Gary] Yes.

1284
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,108
- I always say to people,

1285
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,945
it's not supernatural powers,

1286
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,480
it's based on psychology.

1287
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,482
I'll ask you a quick question,

1288
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,318
and try to go really fast.
- [Gary] Yeah.

1289
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,320
- Tell me the name 
of your first kiss.

1290
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,154
- Kim.

1291
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:32,323
- [Lior] Kim, okay, so
by saying this to you,

1292
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:35,426
this causes the entire room
to start thinking of the name,

1293
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,260
- Yep.

1294
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,061
- [Lior] And you 
think of the name,

1295
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:37,895
and you think of the name,

1296
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,063
and you think of the name.
- Yep.

1297
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,331
- [Lior] Uh, Lindsay.

1298
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:41,165
- [Lindsay] Mhmmm?

1299
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:42,232
- [Lior] I'm just
looking at you right now.

1300
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,067
- [Lindsay] Yeah?

1301
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,468
- Let me tell you the process,

1302
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,870
just for clarification, you
did not tell me the name.

1303
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,705
- [Lindsay] Sure.

1304
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,673
- Look at me, 
look at me, look at me.

1305
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,742
Do you know the 
name of her first kiss?

1306
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:52,576
- [Gary] No.

1307
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:53,410
- Okay, so just,

1308
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,345
- [Linday] (laughing) That
would be weird if you did.

1309
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:59,016
- Just think of a letter
in the middle of the name,

1310
00:51:59,016 --> 00:51:59,850
but don't say it.

1311
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,684
- [Lindsay] Okay.

1312
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,720
- Okay, you just had "D."

1313
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,588
(Lindsay laughing)

1314
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,422
Had a "D",

1315
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,790
can you videotape 
her for a second?

1316
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,992
- Did you catch that?

1317
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:09,093
(people laughing)

1318
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:09,927
- [Lior] Did you felt something?

1319
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:10,761
You felt something,

1320
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,731
and I'm gonna write
something for you here.

1321
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,299
- [Gary] It's so impressive,
right?

1322
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,301
- [Lior] Now, I swear we
don't know each other.

1323
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,702
- Nothing, I'm aware.

1324
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,037
We're not on stage here.

1325
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:22,373
- [Lior] It seems to be very
(mumbles) about this moment,

1326
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:23,207
that we don't know each other.

1327
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:24,041
- [Gary] By the way,

1328
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,476
this is the best moment that
ever happened in my life.

1329
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,177
- [Lior] Oh, I love it!

1330
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,179
- No, no, I'm being 
dead serious.

1331
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,649
This is the best 
moment of my life.

1332
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,483
You have to understand,

1333
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,318
I love this so much.

1334
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,686
You have to understand,

1335
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:40,157
there is so logical science
explanation for that.

1336
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,225
- Exactly.

1337
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:42,126
- You have to understand,

1338
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:45,596
I don't have this,
unfortunately,

1339
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,430
(laughing)

1340
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,400
but I have something,--

1341
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,234
- [Lior] I know.

1342
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:51,335
- in the way that 
I live my life,--

1343
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,503
- [Lior] Mhmmm.

1344
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,072
- that is a cousin to this,

1345
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:57,608
that makes me 
understand it's possibility.

1346
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:58,575
- [Lior] Exactly.

1347
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:02,746
- Like, everything I say is
gonna happen to me, happens.

1348
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,516
- [Lior] I will say you 
that people think

1349
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,051
the universe listens, basically.

1350
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:08,519
- I genuinely believe that, man.

1351
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,353
- [Lior] Hold this, 
don't show her that.

1352
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,187
- Okay.

1353
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,922
- [Lior] Don't show her.
I wrote something over there.

1354
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,258
What was your age when
you had your first kiss?

1355
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:17,327
- [Lindsay] Oh, god, uh, 13?

1356
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,830
- [Lior] 13? So that's like a,--

1357
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,298
- I'm impressed, very nice girl.

1358
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,132
- [Lindsay] Thank you.

1359
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,801
- [Lior] So, I need you to
look at the camera dramatically

1360
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:24,635
- Oh, man.

1361
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:27,538
- [Lior] Yes, and 
tell us the name.

1362
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,539
- Well, aren't you 
gonna tell me the name?

1363
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,406
- [Gary] No, you 
tell the camera.

1364
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:32,276
- [Lior] I already wrote
something, just say the name.

1365
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:33,277
- His name is Eddie.

1366
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:34,111
- [Lior] Eddie?

1367
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:35,312
Can you show her what I?

1368
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,146
(yelling)

1369
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:36,980
- He's so good!

1370
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,749
It's so good!

1371
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:40,117
- It wasn't a real kiss.

1372
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:41,718
(laughing)

1373
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,454
- [Lior] Wait, go back to me, 
go back to me.

1374
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,855
So, Eddie, if you're
watching this right now.

1375
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:45,856
- [Lindsay] Oh my god.

1376
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,024
- You thought of "B," 
by the way,

1377
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:47,858
the letter "B"

1378
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:48,692
when she was thinking of,

1379
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:49,893
Yeah? You had "B" in your mind.

1380
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,962
(laughing)

1381
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,030
- You'll like this.

1382
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,065
When I was saying my number,

1383
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,633
five came to me,

1384
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,302
'cause it always does,
it's my favorite number,

1385
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:59,303
but I was about 
to say something,

1386
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:00,871
and instead I said to 15.

1387
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,339
- You changed your mind,
that was me influencing you.

1388
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,173
- I know that.

1389
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,675
I genuinely believe you.

1390
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,577
I actually could feel it happen.

1391
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,911
- Mhmmm, mhmmm.

1392
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:09,980
(Lindsay laughing)

1393
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,515
- I know you guys 
know me a little bit.

1394
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,250
I get it, I literally get it.

1395
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,587
I was trying to 
say something else,

1396
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,789
it's amazing, I'm actually
just going backwards right now,

1397
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:20,657
I was trying to 
say something else

1398
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,459
and I was forced to say 15.

1399
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,128
I'm telling you guys, 
that's the truth.

1400
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:25,062
- So I have to tell 
you something,

1401
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:27,464
something that you'll love.

1402
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,999
- Can I harness this?

1403
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:29,833
(Lindsay laughing)

1404
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:30,767
I feel like, I feel like.

1405
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,536
- When first we came here, 
I saw all the people working,

1406
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:33,537
I said, listen, we need to

1407
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:34,872
arrange a show 
here for everyone.

1408
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:35,839
- Done!

1409
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:36,974
- Blow their minds with,--
- Done.

1410
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:38,408
When are you back in New York?

1411
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,376
- I don't know yet, 
but we'll figure it out.

1412
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,444
- Okay, Tyler, make it happen.

1413
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,045
We'll do a company-wide event.

1414
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:42,980
- Yes, cool.

1415
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,816
- [Gary] How much do you
care about your legacy?

1416
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:48,819
- Oh, that's something new
that I started to think of.

1417
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,821
That's very, 
very important for me.

1418
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,089
- [Gary] Yeah, it should be.

1419
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:53,790
- Yeah, I just, you know,

1420
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,460
did I tell you about my dream?

1421
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,661
I was talking to,

1422
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,363
I have a lot of dreams
and thoughts about this,

1423
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:01,165
and I thought, okay,

1424
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,433
I know my dad, my grandfather,

1425
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,170
I remember 
his father, but that's it.

1426
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,872
So you don't remember
who was his dad, right?

1427
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,741
And that's like 
100 years, that's it.

1428
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:11,808
It's nothing.

1429
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,976
- That's what this is, 
my friend.

1430
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,813
Right now, my great, 
great, great, great,

1431
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,216
great granddaughter is
watching this right now.

1432
00:55:19,216 --> 00:55:19,983
[Lior] Will.

1433
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,320
- [Lior] Or is, if we're
talking about (mumbles)

1434
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,454
- So, do you know 
what I mean, though?

1435
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,289
- [Lior] Of course, yeah.

1436
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,690
- It's fucking cool.

1437
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,824
- But you're also (mumbles)

1438
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:28,859
He's got two children, and all,

1439
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:29,893
Tel Aviv-based.

1440
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:30,727
- [Lior] Yeah.

1441
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,463
- [Man 9] He's on a plane
probably 180 days a year.

1442
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:34,631
- [Lior] 176, he's more.

1443
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,699
- [Man 9] Yeah.

1444
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,700
- 177 for me.

1445
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,534
- [Lior] Ah!

1446
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:38,835
- I wrote it down right here.

1447
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,938
(group laughing)

1448
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:41,772
- Oh, my God!

1449
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:42,839
(yells)

1450
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,274
(laughing)

1451
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,842
- [Lior] God, oh my god.

1452
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,544
- [Man 9] So, those are
things where I just thought.

1453
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:48,679
- By the way,

1454
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,113
the most interesting 
part of this was,

1455
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,982
I was literally able to feel

1456
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:52,983
me being forced to say it.

1457
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:54,051
- [Lior] Yep, yeah, yeah.

1458
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:55,719
- Do a lot of people get that?

1459
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,553
- [Lior] Not a lot.

1460
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,487
- That's why I feel
like I've got something.

1461
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,388
- [Lior] Because you 
are very sensitive.

1462
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,823
- I mean it.
- [Lior] Very sensitive.

1463
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,191
- I'm the most sensitive.

1464
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,025
- [Lindsay] We know!

1465
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,060
(group laughing)

1466
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,761
- No, really, it's real!

1467
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:05,596
And, know what? Xander,--

1468
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:06,496
- I'm stealing your 
phone here, Gary.

1469
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,431
- Okay, no problem.

1470
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:08,465
Xander's showing it.
- You have your password?

1471
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,700
- [Lindsay] Really?
- Yes.

1472
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,567
- I know your password, 
that's fine.

1473
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,035
- [Lindsay] That's amazing.
- Yes.

1474
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:12,970
(group laughing)

1475
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,804
- [Lindsay] Do you 
think he's going to be

1476
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:14,805
more sensitive than you?

1477
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:15,973
- [Gary] I don't know,

1478
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,374
and actually, 
that would be one place

1479
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,076
where I wouldn't be competitive.

1480
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:20,978
That would make me happy,
'cause I think it's special.

1481
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:22,179
- [Lindsay] Yeah.
- Where is the code?

1482
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,046
Yep, okay.

1483
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:23,981
So, you need to 
change your password.

1484
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,682
- [Gary] No problem.

1485
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:26,783
- It's a fun game.

1486
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,719
- [Gary] Okay.
- Fun game.

1487
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,721
You press a two digit number.

1488
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,555
- [Gary] Two git?

1489
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:32,389
- Two digit, whatever you want.

1490
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,223
- Okay.

1491
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,591
- Nope, just two.

1492
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:35,692
And you press "plus",

1493
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,526
- Okay.

1494
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,128
- [Lior] And what you do,

1495
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,329
don't think about it.
- Okay.

1496
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,597
- [Lior] Just use your
intuition, you'll be fine.

1497
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:41,665
- Yep, yep.

1498
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,767
- If this works, 
I will be in shock.

1499
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,535
You keep going, is it 91?

1500
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:46,370
- Yes.

1501
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,204
- You already did "plus", right?

1502
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:48,038
- I hit "plus", yes.

1503
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:50,340
- Okay, so one more
number, two digits again,

1504
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,174
- Two digits again?

1505
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,709
- Yes, and "plus" again,

1506
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,578
and you keep doing it, 
different numbers.

1507
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:55,412
- Keep going?

1508
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,713
- Yes, two digits,

1509
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,615
boom, "plus", two digits

1510
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,117
plus, and just,

1511
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:01,585
can you go faster?
- Yes.

1512
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:05,422
- Just "plus", da, da, "plus",
da, da, "plus", very good.

1513
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,224
And now go to three digits.

1514
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:10,961
Da da, "plus", da, da, da,
"plus", da, da, da, "plus".

1515
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:11,728
Stop!

1516
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:12,496
Divide.

1517
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:13,830
- Divide?

1518
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,599
- A two digit number.

1519
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:18,335
Equal?

1520
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,736
Score?

1521
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:21,571
- 52109?

1522
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:24,107
- (slam) Crazy.

1523
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,277
That's your number.

1524
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,313
Yeah, that's your number.
- That's my number?

1525
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:31,682
- Yep, that's 52901, 09? 52109?

1526
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,017
(laughter)

1527
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,319
- So great!

1528
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,854
- No, but you know what
is special about 52101?

1529
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:38,955
I say it's your number, yes?

1530
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,725
It's your number, actually,
Gary, it's G-A and R and Y.

1531
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,394
(laughing)

1532
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,063
- Your face was,

1533
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:49,032
(laughing, group cheering)

1534
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,033
I fucking love it.

1535
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,735
- Do you have glasses?

1536
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,437
It's the grand finale.

1537
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:54,705
Sunglasses?

1538
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:55,672
- [Gary] No.

1539
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,506
- Up there.

1540
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,408
- [Lindsay] Oh, on your chest.

1541
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,577
- Yeah, but again, 
I'm not using mine.

1542
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,645
And I need you to come over here

1543
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,914
and do a over-the-shoulder shot.

1544
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:05,182
And you, come here,

1545
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:06,783
and I want you to,

1546
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,318
we'll put it over here.

1547
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,621
Come, come, come, and,

1548
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,357
your first kiss 
got a weird name.

1549
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:14,891
- [Tyler] Yeah, 
super weird name.

1550
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:15,892
- [Lior] Where is she from?

1551
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:16,727
- She,

1552
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:18,095
- [Lior] She's not from America?

1553
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:19,730
- The last name would 
not be American, no.

1554
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,131
- [Lior] Like a,
- It was a last name.

1555
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:21,998
- [Lior] Oh, a last name.
- Yeah.

1556
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:22,899
- [Lior] Oh, really, wow.
- Yeah.

1557
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:25,769
- [Lior] Like "Ebil?" "Ibil?"

1558
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,037
- Is that where it's from,
you're asking?

1559
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,605
- [Lior] No, the name's close?
Am I close?

1560
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,606
- Yeah, a little bit.
- [Lior] What's the name?

1561
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,440
- Taybi.

1562
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,775
- [Lior] Taybi? Okay, I
was close, I was close.

1563
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:32,743
- [Tyler] You had the "B."

1564
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:33,944
- Exactly.

1565
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,846
Gary, do it, just wave
your hand above the glasses

1566
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,181
and tell me what you feel.
- Nothing.

1567
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,850
- [Lior] That's the point.
- Okay.

1568
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,251
- [Lior] You see the
middle of the glasses?

1569
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,286
- I do.
- Watch with me, you ready?

1570
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,321
You watching?

1571
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,423
So, look in this area.

1572
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,559
Come from this side.

1573
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,394
Yeah, just look here.

1574
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:51,228
Watch.

1575
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,297
(slam)

1576
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,298
- [Gary] Yeah, I just, you know.

1577
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:56,566
(everyone laughs)

1578
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,702
It's the best, man.

1579
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,237
The short term 
and the long term,

1580
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,071
- [Lior] Sure.

1581
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:02,639
- [Gary] And then I can
really do some stuff.

1582
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:03,974
- Okay.
- We'll figure it out.

1583
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,376
- And arrange something because
I want to freak all of you.

1584
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,812
- I will, you know what?
That's what we'll do.

1585
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,213
Why don't we arrange 
something right away

1586
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,481
for a company event,

1587
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,984
and then we'll spend the
hour and a half after,

1588
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,786
we'll talk.

1589
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:16,887
I mean, here's the punchline:

1590
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:20,090
Why Lindsay's here is
we're building something

1591
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,892
that is the future of all this,

1592
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,593
which is what DRock's doing.

1593
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:24,961
It's a human production company,

1594
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:25,762
- Right.

1595
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:29,900
- And, I don't need to sell it,

1596
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,501
I need to show it to you guys.

1597
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:32,335
- Yeah, it's special.

1598
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:33,703
- And then we'll figure
out what that means.

1599
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:34,704
- I just have fun with it.

1600
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:35,772
- Yeah, okay.
- I have a blast.

1601
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,207
Thanks for taking the time.
- Alright, of course.

1602
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:38,275
Great to see you.

1603
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:40,177
Have a great day.

1604
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,611
- If you want him to screw
with some people for fun,

1605
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,446
(laughing)

1606
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:43,280
- It's amazing, just amazing.

1607
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,082
- It will kill all 
your productivity.

1608
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,417
- Dude, it's the most amazing,
I totally get it, though.

1609
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,251
- [Man 9] Alright, thank you.

1610
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,253
- Take care.
- Alright, see you later.

1611
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,323
(light music)

1612
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:01,198
- Yeah, no worries.

1613
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:04,267
- Cool alright so I'll jump
right into it and make it quick.

1614
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,336
So I'm going through a
part of my life right now

1615
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,872
where I'm having 
some internal dissonance

1616
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:11,608
and in short it's really
balancing being

1617
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,244
a 21-year-old man 
and a 21-year-old kid.

1618
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,712
And strictly with values.

1619
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,648
Meaning, should I take risks,
should I do something that's

1620
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,917
responsible towards
people that, you know,

1621
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,219
have given me things, 
like my family.

1622
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,787
Should I reciprocate?

1623
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,121
So my name's Isaac Kassin.

1624
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,357
I'm 21 years old.
I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

1625
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,193
I'm here to discuss 
some personal things

1626
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,362
with Gary regarding my future.

1627
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,297
I started a financial 
technology company,

1628
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,832
raised a bunch of money,

1629
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:37,968
but I have a little
dissonance because I'm also

1630
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,637
attending NYU Stern and
I have to figure out

1631
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,639
how to balance the both.

1632
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,140
- Well then that's the game.

1633
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,575
- [Isaac] That's just the game.

1634
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:46,776
- That's the game.

1635
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,912
That you can't, yeah,
I'm glad we're talking

1636
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:52,516
because that is the game.

1637
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,685
That's what you're 
signing up for.

1638
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,754
Nobody can protect 
you from that.

1639
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:01,091
That's not what you want
to be protected about.

1640
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,125
Got it?

1641
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,059
- [Isaac] I see 
what you're saying.

1642
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:03,894
- You understand?
- [Isaac] Mhmmm.

1643
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:07,631
- Like, you can't have it
just the way you want it.

1644
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,232
- [Isaac] It's a trade 
off, isn't it?

1645
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,634
- This morning I had a meeting

1646
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:12,602
and I was telling my
executive, and I'm like look,

1647
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,638
if we're playing 
a different game,

1648
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:16,172
it's great when you're
playing a different game

1649
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,841
and it's good.

1650
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,009
But when you're playing 
a different game

1651
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,378
you gotta also eat the shit
that comes along with it.

1652
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,313
Super fun to fucking 
be an entrepreneur

1653
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,715
at 21 and play the game.

1654
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,651
If you fucking lose, you lose.

1655
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:29,219
It really doesn't suck.

1656
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:30,353
What you need to do,

1657
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,755
and I think you 
wouldn't be sitting here

1658
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:32,522
if you don't know my spiel.

1659
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,391
What you need to do is
figure out if you have

1660
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:37,160
the stomach for it or not and
if you don't that's cool too.

1661
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,095
But you need to 
figure out that out.

1662
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,630
How bout you default 
in two minutes.

1663
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,033
How bout you 
default until you don't.

1664
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,301
- What do you mean? 
Say that again.

1665
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:47,470
- How bout you take your
brain into a place where

1666
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,599
you say you won't succeed.

1667
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,977
And give up the equity.

1668
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,112
- [Isaac] Interesting.

1669
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,681
So just accept the downside 
'cause then the upside

1670
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:59,282
is that it's like oh I won.

1671
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,218
- And more importantly once
you fully accept the downside

1672
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,588
then you'll know if you
really want to do it.

1673
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:05,455
- [Isaac] I dig that.

1674
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:06,423
- You see where I'm going?
- [Isaac] Yeah.

1675
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:07,223
- That's how I live my life.

1676
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,926
I live my life everyday
as if my family died.

1677
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,195
And then that's why I'm so
fucking happy every day.

1678
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:15,098
- [Isaac] Listen, it's a very, 
very deep philosophical issue

1679
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,499
as well 'cause it 
involves my family.

1680
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,435
There's a lot of moving
elements so I think that

1681
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:21,204
it's an ongoing thought
process and discussion.

1682
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,273
But Gary was nice enough
to tell me that I could

1683
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:24,841
reach back out and 
follow up with him

1684
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,445
so hopefully definitely I'll
be lead in the right direction

1685
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:29,479
in the coming months.

1686
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,114
- [Gary] And here's 
what I will say,

1687
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:33,183
the only decision 
that needs to be made

1688
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:37,354
is the one that you will regret
the least when you're 90.

1689
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,824
- [Isaac] Wow.

1690
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,092
- You know?
- [Isaac] I like that.

1691
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,829
- That's the only one.
Which one? One sec...

1692
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:48,932
I'm glad you stopped by man.

1693
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:50,166
I hope I brought you some value.

1694
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,601
You know, 
it's a challenging one.

1695
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,435
- Yeah.

1696
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,603
- [Gary] Here's what 
you have to do.

1697
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,771
- [Isaac] Wish you 
had more time together.

1698
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,272
- Don't be a hypocrite.

1699
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,240
- [Isaac] Yeah.

1700
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:01,578
- But also, but listen,
don't be stubborn.

1701
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,680
Losing in the short term
because you do think Stern's

1702
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,482
the right way is fine.

1703
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:06,316
- [Isaac] It's fine.

1704
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:08,685
- It's super fine. But--

1705
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,053
- [Isaac] But if I
decide to go to school--

1706
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:13,123
- Super fine. 
You got a lot of time.

1707
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,525
But if this is what
you feel you need to do

1708
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,060
then you need to do it
and you can't expect

1709
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,928
them to be making 
you all the money.

1710
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:21,264
What are you gonna take
risk with a parachute?

1711
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:25,235
Take risks. It's not
fair on your brothers.

1712
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:29,172
- [Isaac] Okay.

1713
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,607
- Alright, good luck man.
We'll talk soon again.

1714
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:31,741
- I appreciate it (mumbles).

1715
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,677
- Take care. No worries.
Yeah, I would love to know.

1716
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:36,546
I would love to know. Take care.

1717
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,684
That was interesting.

1718
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:43,019
- I'm doing pretty good.

1719
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,588
I'm doing great. I was
wondering, I'm like,

1720
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:48,925
you know, it's cool 
to finally meet you.

1721
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,460
(laughing)

1722
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,828
I don't know what to say.

1723
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,762
- Thanks.

1724
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:53,930
- [Man 9] I will 
say one thing.

1725
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,098
- Please.

1726
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:57,567
- [Man 9] I've done a little 
research 'cause I'll be honest

1727
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,169
with you I didn't know 
exactly who you were.

1728
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,303
- [Gary] Mhmmm.

1729
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,038
- 'Cause I've been working
in the building for a while.

1730
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:03,006
- [Gary] I'm aware.

1731
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,308
- And you know, coming
into this, I'm like,

1732
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,476
I wonder who this guy is.

1733
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:07,610
You know we actually had
to do a bit of research.

1734
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,646
- [Gary] When the company
was first moving in?

1735
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,715
- When the company was
first moving in and I'm like

1736
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:13,416
okay so let me do a
little research to see

1737
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,484
who, you know, who's coming in.

1738
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:16,519
And I watched a 
few of your videos.

1739
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,121
I saw a couple of your
books and I'm just like,

1740
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:19,756
this guy really knows
what he's talking about.

1741
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:20,590
(Gary laughs)

1742
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,092
No, he's really 
making things happen.

1743
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:22,926
- [Gary] Yeah.

1744
01:04:22,926 --> 01:04:25,395
- So, yeah, it's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

1745
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:26,262
- [Gary] Thank you so much.

1746
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,631
How'd the Vayner 
people bringing vibe?

1747
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,900
- Amazing. No, let me
just be honest with you

1748
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,502
and I tell people 
this all the time,

1749
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:34,971
VaynerMedia is 
the coolest company

1750
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,139
that we have in the building.

1751
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:36,906
- [Gary] I love it.

1752
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,441
- Everyone is really 
chill and laid back.

1753
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,443
And really easy 
to get along with.

1754
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,444
- [Gary] Yep.
- I will say that, for sure.

1755
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:43,646
- [Gary] That matter to me.
How they interact matters.

1756
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,881
- Yeah. They're awesome.

1757
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,648
- [Gary] Good.

1758
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,283
You guys, you can tell who
works at Vayner, right?

1759
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,251
- Well, for the most part.

1760
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,919
- [Gary] You never know.

1761
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,955
- With the make up and things.

1762
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:52,889
- [Gary] Yeah, Yeah. (laughing)

1763
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:53,556
- It's really chill.

1764
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,024
- [Gary] Good man. So what's
going on in your world?

1765
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,359
- Nothing much, you know.

1766
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:59,329
I'm actually engaged.

1767
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,831
So I'm actually planning out
my wedding 'cause, you know,

1768
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:02,866
- [Gary] Good for you.

1769
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:04,167
- That's in a couple of months,

1770
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,870
but that's like taking up
most of my time right now.

1771
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,571
- [Gary] Good for you. 
That's awesome.

1772
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,939
And how long you been?

1773
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,508
What were you 
doing before this building?

1774
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,543
- Before this building, I was
actually still pretty much

1775
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:16,179
working for Related, 
the company.

1776
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:17,080
- [Gary] Yep.

1777
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:17,981
- But I was working at a mall.

1778
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:19,616
So I pretty much 
was like responsible

1779
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:20,750
for everything going on--

1780
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,584
- [Gary] Where?

1781
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,752
- In Flushing, Queens.

1782
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,854
- Oh is that right? 
Yep, I know it.

1783
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:25,755
That's very cool.

1784
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,190
- [Man 10] It was 
pretty interesting.

1785
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:29,893
- He's built an 
amazing company. Related.

1786
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:30,794
- [Man 10] Yeah, definitely.

1787
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:32,695
- Incredible. Incredible.

1788
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,364
Anything I can help you with?

1789
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:35,398
- [Man 10] Well you know what?

1790
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:36,399
- What?

1791
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:37,500
- [Man 10] Just being
able to sit down with you

1792
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,568
and talk to you today is great.

1793
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:39,702
- I appreciate that.

1794
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,238
- [Man 10] I really 
feel like there's a lot

1795
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,306
that I can learn from you.

1796
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,375
I'm actually not too
far behind you in age.

1797
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,309
- Okay.

1798
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,911
- [Man 10] I'm 38. 
I'll be 39 in March.

1799
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:48,545
- You look good.

1800
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,146
- [Man 10] So, well thank
you I appreciate it.

1801
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:55,318
I'd like to be able to
move upward in life and--

1802
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,419
- [Gary] Good for you.

1803
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:57,821
- But sometimes you 
get a little stuck.

1804
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:58,655
- [Gary] Yes.

1805
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:01,591
- And watching the videos
and seeing a lot of things

1806
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,827
that you've had to say
it's been really helpful.

1807
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:05,295
- [Gary] What's been
the, what's the one that

1808
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,096
sticks with you the most?

1809
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,567
- Get up off your ass. You know?

1810
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:15,171
- There's just nothing else.
It's so black and white.

1811
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,806
Like, you know, it's so crazy.

1812
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,108
I literally think that I only
believe in a couple of things.

1813
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,777
Like, it's interesting. 
Isn't it?

1814
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:21,377
- [Man 10] Yeah.

1815
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:24,781
- I think what's weird for
me, is for some reason,

1816
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:26,449
when I say it people...

1817
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,551
Maybe cause 
I believe it so much.

1818
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,053
I don't know.

1819
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:32,455
- [Man 10] I dare say, 
not only is it because

1820
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,224
you believe it so much
but it's also because

1821
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,860
you've actually, you've
actually gotten off your ass.

1822
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,029
- (Laughing) Right. Right.
I've done it. Right.

1823
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:40,864
Sure.

1824
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:41,764
- [Man 10] There is so many...

1825
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:42,999
- That's a good point.

1826
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,069
- [Man 10] That you've taken
your family wine business

1827
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,437
- Yep, yep.

1828
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:48,304
- [Man 10] and you've made it

1829
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:49,138
this multimillion 
dollar business.

1830
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,440
You've done so 
many different things

1831
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,841
and that's so commendable.

1832
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,878
And I'm lookin to 
do pretty much something

1833
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:56,546
- Well listen, let's you know,

1834
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:59,015
take value out of this meeting.

1835
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,450
You got my inbox.

1836
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,820
If anything pops in your
head between now and forever

1837
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,855
you ping me and I'll be
more than happy to listen.

1838
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,924
- [Man 10] I definitely
will. I definitely will.

1839
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:08,691
I appreciate it.

1840
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,792
- No worries. Alright.

1841
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:10,994
- [Man 10] Alright, 
I appreciate you.

1842
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:12,128
- Yeah, have a great weekend.

1843
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,162
- I definitely will. 
You do the same.

1844
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,430
- Yeah, I'm around.
- Alright, cool.

1845
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,531
- Let me know 
if you need anything.

1846
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,366
- I will.

1847
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,134
- Keep an eye..the thing is
if you watch a DailyVee

1848
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:20,470
and you see something and
you're like oh, you know?

1849
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:21,771
- [Man 10] Yeah, I definitely
will. I definitely will.

1850
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,039
- Good. Take care.

1851
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,308
(mumbling)

1852
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:33,983
- [Jake] Yo.

1855
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:36,719

1856
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,520

1857
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,354

- [Jake] This is the office?

1861
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:43,660
- This is it!

1862
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,361
- There's not even a computer.

1863
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:46,629
- What?

1864
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:47,463
- You leave here?

1865
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,232
- [Woman 5] Yeah.

1866
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,199
- Okay.

1867
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:51,401
We're doin it.

1868
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,502

1869
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:53,870

- [Tyler] We're doing

1872
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:01,744
- They're the hosts. 
I love it. Got it.

1873
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,679
- So this is Gary.

1874
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:03,546
Gary this is--
- I remember.

1875
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,014
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry.

1876
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,016
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you, too.

1877
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,318
- Gary.
- Good to see ya.

1878
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:09,152

01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:09,953

- All well?
Good come on in.

1881
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:12,922
Alex, you look good.

1882
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,991
Jake Paul. Special.

1883
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:16,059
Uh, what?

1884
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:16,893
- Fan's birthday.

1885
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:18,027
- Okay.

1886
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:18,895
Can you do it?

1887
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,997
- [DRock] We're 
gonna go with it.

1888
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:24,667
Conner, you
wanna be on this side?

1889
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:28,104
That way we have three
cameras on that side.

1890
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,671
That good?

1891
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,375
- Two, three, one?

1892
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,576
- Yes.

1893
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,377
- Good.

1894
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,511
Ready?
- Are you nervous?

1895
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:37,345
- Very.

1896
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:38,280
- You're nervous?
- Yeah.

1897
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,314
- Why are you nervous?

1898
01:08:39,314 --> 01:08:40,783
- I always get nervous.

1899
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,719
- I like that.

1900
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,388
- I'm super not nervous.
(group laughing)

1901
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:46,787
- [DRock] Alright ready? 
And, action.

1902
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:49,191
- Hey everybody this 
is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

1903
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:50,993
and this is episode 231 of

1904
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:55,798
The #AskGaryVee Show and 
it is a ridiculous show.

1905
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,700
This is a ridiculous show.

1906
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,502
- Okay so the first question is,

1907
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,770
how safe would you play it
when faced with the decision

1908
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,107
to quit your daytime job
to be an entrepreneur,

1909
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:06,309
the only dream that 
keeps you up at night?

1910
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,743
- So Jake, ya know,

1911
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,145
you're such a young guy.

1912
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,845
You didn't go down the route.

1913
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:12,781
Did you ever have a job
like maybe when you were 14?

1914
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:14,550
- I had my own 
landscaping company.

1915
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,785
- So you were an
entrepreneur from the get.

1916
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:16,618
- Yeah.

1917
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:18,321
- There was no I'm
gonna work at Fat Burger

1918
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,255
in Cleveland, Ohio.

1919
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:20,089
- No.
- Okay.

1920
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:20,923
- 'Cuz yeah.

1921
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:21,724
- I don't know if 
they have Fat Burgers

1922
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,326
in Cleveland, Ohio but it's 
just the first company.

1923
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,926
Anyway, nonetheless, so

1924
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:28,531
were your parents or
grandparents or anybody

1925
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:31,267
in your family entrepreneurs?

1926
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,702
- Not really, no.

1927
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:36,005
My uncle was probably the
biggest entrepreneur but

1928
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,774
didn't spend a ton of
time with him so I kinda

1929
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:42,412
just had the natural
hustle for it I guess.

1930
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:44,912
My dad was like yo you
shouldn't get a regular job

1931
01:09:44,912 --> 01:09:47,215
because you're not
going to learn anything.

1932
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,984
If you have a landscaping
company you're gonna learn

1933
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,185
how to negotiate.

1934
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:51,921
- So your dad was 
really pushing for it.

1935
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:52,755
- Yeah.

1936
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,857
He was like you're gonna
learn how to set the prices,

1937
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,627
get customers, 
get recurring business.

1938
01:09:57,627 --> 01:09:58,995
- Yep.
- So, ya know.

1939
01:09:58,995 --> 01:09:59,729
- Yeah, cool.

1940
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,030
What's the question again?

1941
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,899
- So how safe would you
play it when faced with

1942
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,767
the decision to quit
your daytime job to be

1943
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,135
an entrepreneur which 
is the only thing

1944
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,336
that keeps you up at night?

1945
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:08,171
- You know, I mean look.

1946
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:09,305
Anything that keeps you
up at night is something

1947
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,907
that should be addressed.

1948
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:12,975
And so if it's really
keeping you up at night,

1949
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,411
like you're not sleeping,
you're stressed,

1950
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,513
you're thinking that 
I'm gonna have regret

1951
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:18,714
my whole life.

1952
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,183
I would take it very serious.

1953
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,851
And I would play it 
not safe at all.

1954
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:22,952
If you're kinda full of shit,

1955
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:25,154
and once in a while 
you think about it.

1956
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,256
And once in a blue moon
you think about it,

1957
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,491
well then I would play it safe.

1958
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,726
The punch line is this.

1959
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:32,295
Way too many people are
playing it half pregnant.

1960
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,297
You either do it or ya don't.

1961
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:35,765
There is no in-betweens.

1962
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,267
And that's the bottom line
when it comes to this.

1963
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:39,502
This is binary.

1964
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:41,237
You know I talk about

1965
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:44,507
entrepreneurial tendencies
a ton. And that's fine.

1966
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:46,442
Who am I to judge just because
I love entrepreneurship.

1967
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:47,477
You do you.

1968
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:49,212
But this question is silly,

1969
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:51,380
because you don't need to
ask a question on a show

1970
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,083
like this because if you
really couldn't breathe,

1971
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,252
you would be doing it
and you wouldn't even

1972
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,489
be worried about 
my opinion on it.

1973
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:00,623
Cool, let's move on.

1974
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:04,260
- Working with Gary over
the past couple of months

1975
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,962
has been such an 
amazing experience

1976
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:10,767
as a young entrepreneur 
I don't have all the answers,

1977
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,568
I'm making mistakes 
all the time.

1978
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,772
And so just by watching
his videos every single day

1979
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:19,175
I'm able to learn and take
away little pieces of info

1980
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:23,246
that help me build my company
and grow as an individual.

1981
01:11:23,246 --> 01:11:25,214
And I know he's grinding.

1982
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:29,051
So I'm always trying to
keep up with his pace.

1983
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:31,787
So yeah, love you Gary.

1984
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,923
- Picture? Yeah.

1985
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,658
- Should we get one together?

1986
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,793
- Yeah let's get it.

1987
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,594
- Yeah get it on tape
one of you two first.

1988
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,428
- Okay.

1989
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:43,866
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

1990
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:45,868
Good to see you buddy.

1991
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,303
Good luck to you.

1992
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,207
Bye guys, have a wonderful day.

1993
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:52,909
Good luck on everything. Bye.

1994
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:53,743
Ty.

1995
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:54,944
- What's up?

1996
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:56,112
- Let's go.

1997
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:57,146
I saw Roman.

1998
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,381
Yeah? Let's go.

1999
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:01,617
- Roman, we're good to go.

2000
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:04,921
Jake, 30 under 30 you 
gonna vouch for him?

2001
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:05,755
- Yeah.
- [Tyler] Cool.

2002
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:07,190
- And push Mika.

2003
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,591
I'm gonna be a little late
I'm trying to squeeze--

2004
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:09,425
- [Tyler] Yeah. Exactly totally.

2005
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,096
- Great to see you.

2006
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:14,931
Great to see you.

2007
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:16,566
How are you?

2008
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:18,267
Matt, real pleasure.
- [Matt] Yeah.

2009
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:20,970
- How've you been?

2010
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,438
- I'm going great.

2011
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,574
Good, man, 
it's great to see you.

2012
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:26,409
You too, a lot of different
experiences.

2013
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:28,945
Good. Yeah. I'm sure.

2014
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:29,779
It's great to see you, man.

2015
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,047
Really good to see you.

2016
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:31,981
Awesome.

2017
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,683
- How's everything?
Things are good.

2018
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,818
Yeah, busy.
- Yeah, I'm following.

2019
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:37,587
- Good, a lot going on.

2020
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:38,621
A lot going on.
- I like the new office.

2021
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,556
- Have you seen some friends?

2022
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:44,527
- Yeah I've been waiting for
them but he didn't want to--

2023
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,462
- No worries.

2024
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:47,863
- I would want to stop by.
- Please, dude.

2025
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,066
You're family, 
anywhere you wanna go.

2026
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:51,234
So what's been going on?

2027
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,169
What can we jam on?

2028
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:55,938
- [Matt] Yeah, we've been 
working on a product

2029
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,506
called Shimmer.
- [Gary] Shimmer?

2030
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:01,277
- Yeah, I'm not sure if you've
heard of it or anything.

2031
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:02,545
Really what we're 
building is a social

2032
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:03,879
engagement platform.

2033
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,648
The whole idea being that
social media is all about

2034
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:07,250
content distribution obviously.
- [Gary] Yes.

2035
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,417
- Very one to many.

2036
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,385
- You're welcome.

2037
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,553
It's good to see you.

2038
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,787
Good luck, man.

2039
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:13,289
- Pleasure.
- Yeah I really enjoyed this.

2040
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:14,257
This was good, good luck.

2041
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:15,458
I'm excited to play.

2042
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:16,592
I'll give you some feedback.

2043
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:17,860
I will, I definitely will.

2044
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,196
And I'm genuinely,
I'm excited because I know

2045
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:21,864
that you'll value--

2046
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:22,698
Yeah, it's good.

2047
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:23,933
I'll jam. I'll let ya know.

2048
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,434
- [Matt] Appreciate it.

2049
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,269
- Thank you, Gary.

2050
01:13:26,269 --> 01:13:27,103
- Good to see you.

2051
01:13:27,103 --> 01:13:28,905
- Have a good day.
- You too.

2052
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,007
- Yeah. Yeah.

2053
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:32,675
I'll definitely take it
'cause I'll actually want

2054
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:34,944
to see how you're communicating.

2055
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,145
- Cool, thanks so much.

2056
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:36,979
- Take care of yourself, man.

2057
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:37,813
Good luck.

2058
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:38,814
- Thank you.

2059
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:41,484
- We're gonna play pool soon.

2060
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:42,318
- [DRock] Yes.

2061
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:45,187
- What's request?

2062
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,822
Is that like trying 
to get Nash Grier

2063
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,224
to sign up for your platform?

2064
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:49,058
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

2065
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,794
- Where does it go?

2066
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,663
- So you tap on it, you
got this nice little

2067
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,064
message right there.

2068
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:56,599
We've actually had to turn
of some because they're

2069
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,901
too big for where 
we're at right now.

2070
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:00,836
- [Gary] Uh-huh.

2071
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,272
There's some, 
you'll like the roadmap.

2072
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,507
We got a jam on that, November.

2073
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:05,875
- Okay. I'm excited, man.

2074
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:08,744
Good luck to you.
- Yeah, cheers.

2075
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,881
- [James] Gary!
- What's up my man?

2076
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:12,948
- [James] Pleasure, 
how are ya?

2077
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:13,783
- I'm well, how are you?

2078
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,451
- I'm James, nice to meet you.
- James, real pleasure.

2079
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,519
- [James] Hi, 
I'm James Cole,

2080
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:18,854
I've founded 
H Influencer Collective.

2081
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,324
We're a collective of
models, photographers,

2082
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:23,592
videographers in 
San Francisco, California

2083
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,461
and all up and down the
California coastline.

2084
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,229
This is what my company does.

2085
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,700
So I wanna explain to you.
- Yeah.

2086
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,435
So, James has been following
Gary territory here.

2087
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:34,437
So, your dad, right?

2088
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:36,038
He had a small wine shop,
- Yes.

2089
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:37,506
- Knows his 
customers super well,--

2090
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:38,174
- Yes.

2091
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:38,974
- It's bespoke, 
he cares, yeah?

2092
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:39,809
- Yes.

2093
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,177
- This is in 1950.
- Yes.

2094
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:42,378
- A local butcher or whatever.
- Yep.

2095
01:14:42,378 --> 01:14:44,914
- Now we're talking 
2008 to 2012.

2096
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:47,283
My dad worked for 
Goldman Sachs for 30 years.

2097
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:49,752
He got big, big, big, big, big
institutional, institutional,

2098
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:52,388
global, global, global,
the bigger the better.

2099
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:53,656
And all these brands,

2100
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:54,790
I've heard you talk

2101
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,092
about the big box store.
- Yes.

2102
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:57,126
- This, that, and the other
thing, yeah?

2103
01:14:57,126 --> 01:15:00,096
Now the future, this is
what we're doing now.

2104
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:03,666
You're either really little,
and you can reach big,

2105
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,635
this is Gary delivering the zin

2106
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,238
to the woman on December 23rd.
- Yep.

2107
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,841
- This Wine Library, TV,
- Yep.

2108
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,977
- So you're little, you're
caring about your customers,

2109
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,746
you're reaching a big audience,
- Yes.

2110
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:17,546
- You're content marketing,
- Yes.

2111
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:18,414
- Email marketing, whatever.

2112
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:21,050
Or you're a big, big,
big company Warby Parker,

2113
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,718
and you feel small.

2114
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,888
You care about your customers
through tech, right?

2115
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:28,924
The problem is, all these
influencer marketing platforms

2116
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,660
like Niche that sold
to Twitter or whatever,

2117
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,462
they're playing this 
game to your point.

2118
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:35,231
They're cool with a sellout.

2119
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:37,032
It's mass, mass, mass, mass,
- Agreed.

2120
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,167
- With a shit ton
of influencers,

2121
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,201
- Agreed.
- Yeah?

2122
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,703
But the problem is 
this is where it's at.

2123
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:41,537
- 100%.

2124
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,371
So now what?

2125
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,640
- So you're building 
a viable narrative.

2126
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,574
- [Gary] Next.
- What?

2127
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:46,742
- [Gary] Agreed.

2128
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:47,576
Now what?

2129
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,411
- What do you mean?

2130
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:49,245
- [Gary] I completely 
buy into that.

2131
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:50,079
- Cool.

2132
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:50,913
- [Gary] That will work.

2133
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:51,747
- Yeah.

2134
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:52,581
It has been working.

2135
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:53,416
- [Gary] It's gonna work.

2136
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:54,650
That's 100% gonna work.

2137
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:55,651
- So, I wanna--

2138
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,353
- [Gary] Then what?

2139
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:58,988
- No, you can, you can--

2140
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:00,122
- Okay I believe you.

2141
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,824
I believe you.
- Okay, so what I've done,

2142
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:04,093
So I came here today to talk
to Gary to get some advice

2143
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:06,862
about scaling something that
shouldn't scale very well.

2144
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,932
Which is leading 
with your heart,

2145
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:12,134
building a community 
around authenticity

2146
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,803
and really caring about the
content you're creating.

2147
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,571
- The reason you're
probably attracted to me

2148
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,773
is because I'm the 
same thing as you.

2149
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,809
- [James] Right.

2150
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:21,977
- Guys like you and I,

2151
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:24,680
the outcome is 
predicated on the insanity.

2152
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:26,816
This in un--

2153
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:28,317
- [James] It doesn't scale,
Gary, it doesn't scale.

2154
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,653
- This is un-build-able 
by anybody else.

2155
01:16:30,653 --> 01:16:34,390
- [James] Yes.
- That's why nobody can beat us.

2156
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,292
Because nobody's gonna
do what I'm gonna do.

2157
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,561
Nobody is going to spend

2158
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:41,997
20 hours a day working--
- [James] Yep.

2159
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,033
- and giving a fuck so much

2160
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:47,903
and using sensitivity
and caring as the weapon.

2161
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:50,039
You've already won.

2162
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:52,208
The 10 or 100 is predicated on

2163
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,876
how much you're 
gonna be willing to work.

2164
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:55,478
Nothing else.

2165
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:57,279
Because you can actually
manage more than 100.

2166
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,448
Why wasn't it 50?

2167
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,416
- [James] Totally.

2168
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:01,317
- Right?
- [James] Yeah.

2169
01:17:01,317 --> 01:17:05,788
- So hearing that 
the question becomes

2170
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,590
how do we make the payoff?

2171
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,124
If the payoff, and I get it man,

2172
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:10,659
I love you for your honesty,

2173
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:14,797
if the payoff is some 
good enough number,

2174
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:18,100
arbitrary to you, because that's
all that actually matters.

2175
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,704
If you needed to do, like it'd
almost take you in a weird--

2176
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,305
I'm actually very 
intrigued by this.

2177
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,139
This I like.

2178
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,341
- [James] Cool.

2179
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:27,943
- I almost think you have to
invent an arbitrary number

2180
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:31,514
that gets your nut 
off to the mission.

2181
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:33,182
- [James] You mean to sell for.

2182
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:34,950
- Do you wanna sell it?

2183
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:35,951
- [James] Is that what 
you're talking about?

2184
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,620
Like my exit strategy--
- I thought--

2185
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,488
No, or hit a revenue number.

2186
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,556
- [James] Oh, yeah.

2187
01:17:40,556 --> 01:17:41,957
Profit is not really 
what I'm focused on.

2188
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:45,628
- Or whatever, in the
game that you're playing,

2189
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:49,265
there's something that
makes your dad say, "huh".

2190
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:52,034
And I don't know if you've
got a read on that number,

2191
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,435
if you've made 
up your own number,

2192
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:54,870
if it's your number
first and then,

2193
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,639
whether your dad says 
"huh" or not,

2194
01:17:56,639 --> 01:17:58,240
you know that 
was the right number,

2195
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,376
but that needs to be the game.

2196
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:01,710
You can win your game.

2197
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:02,778
You can win.

2198
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,713
But you need to 
invent it right now,

2199
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,682
and then you need to get there.

2200
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:07,950
Do you understand?
- [James] Totally.

2201
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:08,784
I don't know 
what that number is,

2202
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:09,752
I could work back 
from the number,

2203
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:12,388
I can also work with these
other people that I have,

2204
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,957
they trust me.

2205
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:16,659
- But again, when you 
look at that model,

2206
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:18,594
we can say the maximum 
capacity of income

2207
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:19,895
in that would be 29--

2208
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,063
- Yeah 100k a month, 
200k a month,--

2209
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:21,897
- Right.

2210
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,732
And then if we knew the
number needed to be,

2211
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:27,336
if you do 40 million a year,
you could say, "I did it!"

2212
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:28,103
- Yeah.

2213
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:29,238
- Well then we just 
work backwards

2214
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:32,341
and realize the number of people
you need to manage is 747,

2215
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:33,209
and then we're set.

2216
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,911
What I know is this is set.

2217
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,080
What I don't know is
you've got what I've got,

2218
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,882
which is, you know 
how to handle this.

2219
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:40,716
- Yeah.

2220
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,084
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

2221
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:44,119
- And it'll be cool for you
to be challenging yourself

2222
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,554
to think if you can.

2223
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,122
Because it's different.

2224
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:50,092
This is super 
different than this.

2225
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:50,926
- Yeah.

2226
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:51,860
- And you might have it
in you, and you might not.

2227
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:52,861
I don't know.

2228
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:53,796
- Okay.
- But--

2229
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:55,364
- Well I'm gonna take--
- By the way--

2230
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:56,665
- The saturation and 
then we'll find out.

2231
01:18:56,665 --> 01:19:00,002
- Or, you may wanna 
try one right away--

2232
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:01,303
- Dip my toe in the water.

2233
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:02,705
- Yeah and see if 
it's right for you.

2234
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:03,572
- Okay.
- You see what I mean?

2235
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,307
- [James] Yeah, totally.

2236
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:06,175
Cool thank you.

2237
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:07,009
- You're welcome.

2238
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:07,843
- [James] Very helpful.

2239
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:09,545
- Yeah, I understand.

2240
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:12,014
- [James] It's cool, honestly, 
I thought you would understand,

2241
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:14,950
and then I prepped for this
watched hours and hours

2242
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:18,654
and hours of your 
shit and it was cool.

2243
01:19:18,654 --> 01:19:21,857
'Cause it was like,
same playbook, you know?

2244
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:22,791
- It works.

2245
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,729
Scaling up the un-scalable,
is the only good game.

2246
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:27,563
- Yeah.

2247
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:28,664
It's the only good game left.

2248
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:30,399
It's the game of the future.

2249
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:31,467
- For now.
- [James] Yeah.

2250
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:33,168
- Until everybody figures out--

2251
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,303
- You ended one 
of my favorite talks

2252
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:36,605
by saying "and it feels good", 
and it does.

2253
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:37,640
- And it feels good.

2254
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,141
- Because these people--

2255
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,309
- How, bro.

2256
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:43,178
How you make your 
money is more important

2257
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:44,747
than how much you make.

2258
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:47,583
- All of these people,
pizza boy, valet parking,

2259
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:50,753
they're all chasing a dream
and until further notice

2260
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:52,955
I hope I'm not Ponzi scheme-ing
the shit out of them,

2261
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,523
but I'm giving them that dream.

2262
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:55,758
I'm like, this guy--

2263
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:57,826
- You know you're 
not Ponzi scheme-ing,

2264
01:19:57,826 --> 01:19:59,294
the only reason you're hedging--

2265
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,562
- I just don't know if
it's gonna work or not.

2266
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:01,730
- You know it's gonna work.

2267
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,065
What you're hedging against,

2268
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:05,801
is you can never get
off the hamster wheel.

2269
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,002
- [James] Okay, so can 
I ask you this?

2270
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,071
- Do you understand?
- [James] Yeah, I understand.

2271
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:13,409
- Like that's, and by the
way, that's the punchline.

2272
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:15,010
- [James] That's what I was
wondering about with you,

2273
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:15,978
because there's no brakes.

2274
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:16,812
- Ever.

2275
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,614
- [James] Ever.
- 'Til the end.

2276
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:20,182
And I knew that I can do it.

2277
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:21,917
And I don't recommend 
it for anybody.

2278
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,652
- [James] Yeah.

2279
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,520
Cool.

2280
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,988
I had a really good
conversation with Gary,

2281
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,657
we were really vibing,

2282
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:31,627
he gave some really good advice,

2283
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:33,829
sort of encouraged me to up
the intensity, go all in,

2284
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,634
and never break 
the authenticity promise.

2285
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:40,936
Never sell out.

2286
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:42,037
And stick it out.

2287
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,238
Thanks Gary.

2288
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:44,306
Appreciate it.

2289
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:45,574
- You need to do me a favor.

2290
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,110
You need to realize it's binary.

2291
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:49,278
- [James] All in or all out.

2292
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:51,146
- You'll lose otherwise.

2293
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:51,980
- [James] Yeah.

2294
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,683
- And then if you really,
really, wanna put yourself

2295
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,418
up to the man that you wanna be,

2296
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:59,655
you'll get depressed 
that you sold out.

2297
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:01,957
- I'll get the press 
that I sold out?

2298
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:02,791
- Depressed.

2299
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,294
- Oh, depressed.
Yeah.

2300
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:06,328
- You know what I mean?
- Totally.

2301
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:07,896
- So before you put--

2302
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:10,799
The moment that 
was the most intense,

2303
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,968
was the moment when I decided

2304
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:14,470
and closed the door 
on the hamster wheel

2305
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:17,406
and realized it was 
the rest of my life.

2306
01:21:17,406 --> 01:21:19,108
It's what nobody understands.

2307
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:20,609
They're not gonna win.

2308
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:24,079
The cynical game, 
which is everybody,

2309
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,581
they're gonna lose to me.

2310
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:28,484
I'm gonna outlast them.

2311
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:29,251
Got it?

2312
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:30,352
- [James] Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

2313
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:30,986
- [James] I do.

2314
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:34,289
- And that is not 
only for everybody,--

2315
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,558
- [James] It's for no one.
- it's for no one.

2316
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,761
And I never, 
I never talk about it.

2317
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:39,294
- [James] Yeah.

2318
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:40,929
- Like I'm so glad that I get

2319
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:42,631
to talk about it 
with you right now.

2320
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:45,100
Like that is a game I could
never ask anybody else,

2321
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,103
I never fully ask anybody 
to play my game,

2322
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,972
because it is scary.

2323
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:51,440
It's like shooting to Mars

2324
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,941
and knowing you're 
never coming back.

2325
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:53,776
- [James] Mhmmm.

2326
01:21:54,977 --> 01:21:56,745
- So that is a big one, man.

2327
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,614
And you need to make sure
before you close that door

2328
01:21:58,614 --> 01:21:59,782
that you're willing to go there.

2329
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:00,949
And if not, that's okay,

2330
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:02,418
and let's come up with
an alternative version.

2331
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,887
But, when you 
shut that fucking door,

2332
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:06,388
there's only two outcomes.

2333
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:07,890
You're right, or you're wrong.

2334
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:10,759
And being wrong kind of
destroys your reputation

2335
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,296
name to yourself for
the rest of your life.

2336
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:15,931
- [James] I get it.

2337
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,299
- I know you do.
- I felt it.

2338
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,568
- [Gary] I know you do, 
that's why I'm telling you.

2339
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:20,436
- Cool.

2340
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,704
- And he's been around a whole
lot with me for last year,

2341
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:25,641
this is the first conversation
I've had like this.

2342
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:28,010
- [DRock] Mhmmm.
- Cool.

2343
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:29,778
- [Gary] So I'm warning you.

2344
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:33,382
- If you wanna do something
that doesn't scale,

2345
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:35,951
you have to work harder
than everyone else.

2346
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,288
And heart and soul throw
yourself into what you're doing.

2347
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,756
And I think what Gary was saying

2348
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:42,825
is I'm sort of at 
a crossroads right now

2349
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:44,726
and if I wanna commit 
to doing something

2350
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:47,162
that people say can't be done

2351
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:49,331
which is to focus on
something that doesn't scale

2352
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,366
in a world that is
so dominated by tech,

2353
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:54,136
you gotta shut the door,
get on the hamster wheel

2354
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,938
and never get off.

2355
01:22:56,872 --> 01:22:58,707
And he just wanted to make
sure I was ready for that.

2356
01:22:58,707 --> 01:22:59,708
Which I am.

2357
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,009
- But on a very serious note,

2358
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,911
it's all about 
collecting the people,

2359
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,413
that I win with,

2360
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,381
and that I help win more than...

2361
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,083
I genuinely believe,

2362
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:08,951
and then, by the way,

2363
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:12,187
this is all ego talking,

2364
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:14,256
but I just know you 
can win more with me

2365
01:23:14,256 --> 01:23:15,557
than without me.
(Roger giggles)

2366
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:16,625
You know what I mean?
- [Roger] I hear ya.

2367
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,627
- And that excites me

2368
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:20,329
because it's a double win.
- [Roger] Right, right, right.

2369
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,164
- I don't have 
this talk very often

2370
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,533
because it has to 
feel like a double win,--

2371
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:27,369
- [Roger] Right.
- because I feel like everybody,

2372
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:29,671
everybody wins 
when they're with me,--

2373
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:30,405
- [Roger] For sure.

2374
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:32,608
but I like when 
I feel that I also win

2375
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:33,542
because of that,

2376
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:34,776
and that's rare.

2377
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,144
And that's why 
we're sitting here.

2378
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:37,446
- [Roger] For sure, for sure.

2379
01:23:37,446 --> 01:23:39,514
I'll tell you this, listen,--
- Please.

2380
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,583
- I'm committed to being here.

2381
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:42,751
- I believe you.

2382
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:43,585
- One thing is--

2383
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,854
- That's actually like,
really like, important,--

2384
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,289
- Right.
- but this talk is even

2385
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:48,457
a different version of that.

2386
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:49,191
- Well, that's what I mean,

2387
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:50,325
and quite honestly, 
when I say being here,

2388
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:52,761
I mean being around you...

2389
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,763
- Me. That's it, 
that's it, that's it.

2390
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,131
- [Roger] Yeah, exactly.

2391
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,699
- And I think when you
take that mind shift,

2392
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,202
then like, you look at it,

2393
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,503
you're looking at it,

2394
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:02,537
you know that whole picture,

2395
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,039
where it's like, 
it's two people kissing,

2396
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:04,873
or it's like,--

2397
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:05,674
- [DRock] The lamp.

2398
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:08,043
- the lamp, or whatever, 
yeah, the glass.

2399
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,378
That's what I want.
- [Roger] Right, right.

2400
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,046
I feel like I want to make
sure you're looking at the

2401
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,281
silhouette or the people,

2402
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:13,515
whatever (mumbles), you know.
- [Roger] Yeah.

2403
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,584
- And that's when 
it gets interesting.

2404
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:17,386
That's what, and by the way,

2405
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,855
you're not as bought in
as you think you are.

2406
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:21,089
Let me explain why.

2407
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:23,058
When I had this 
conversation with (censored),

2408
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,460
it was just like this.

2409
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,995
But then, like, 
as you get in deeper,

2410
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,463
it gets better.

2411
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:31,033
- [Roger] Right, cool, 
with that...

2412
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:31,867
- You know, like your first
couple months,

2413
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:32,668
we had a good talk,

2414
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:34,303
you know, but it,
it just gets better.

2415
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:35,137
- [Roger] Totally.
Do you know what I mean?

2416
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:35,971
- [Roger] Totally, absolutely,
absolutely.

2417
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:36,805
- And so like,

2418
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:37,439
when you start 
making that commitment,

2419
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,141
then you start having
conversations

2420
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:41,610
with your family and your world,

2421
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,845
about like, things like,

2422
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:45,547
would I live anywhere?
- [Roger] Mhmmm.

2423
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,049
What would I do?

2424
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,550
What's important?

2425
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,419
What do I love?
- [Roger] Right.

2426
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:51,386
What do I care about?

2427
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:52,554
Because I need Gary to know,

2428
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:53,855
so he can reverse engineer

2429
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,758
to create the things, 
and vice-versa.

2430
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:57,593
- [Roger] That's cool.

2431
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,528
- I need to be willing to go
to Singapore for my whole life,

2432
01:24:59,528 --> 01:25:01,196
and I need to tell Gary
that I wanna live in a boat.

2433
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:02,965
And one of those two 
things could happen.

2434
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:03,832
- [Roger] Right, 
right, right, right.

2435
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:04,666
- Do you understand?

2436
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:05,500
- [Roger] Yeah like, I get it.

2437
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,435
For sure, for sure.

2438
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,736
So it's part of, yeah.

2439
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,938
I mean, to your part
to get to the bigger picture.

2440
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:10,872
- Just pot committed.

2441
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:13,041
- [Roger] For sure.
- At all levels.

2442
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,509
Not, I'm committed 
to this place,

2443
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,278
I'm gonna work there.
- [Roger] Right, right.

2444
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,279
- So, it's just very different.

2445
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,513
- [Roger] And it's 
less that for me.

2446
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,949
And I want you to 
know that as well.

2447
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:21,650
- Okay.

2448
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:24,987
- [Roger] For me, having 
been in multiple places--

2449
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:25,721
- But you know what else,

2450
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:27,222
I have empathy, it is still
early

2451
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:28,624
and we've had
limited interaction.

2452
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,224
- [Roger] Totally.

2453
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:30,292
- So that's why 
I called this meeting,

2454
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,693
'cause I keep, 
I'm adding blocks.

2455
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:32,628
- [Roger] Yeah, let's
keep doing more of that.

2456
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:33,462
- We will.

2457
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:34,596
- [Roger] Quite honestly,
I'll do more of that.

2458
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:36,231
- It's just about humility

2459
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,567
when you have to take the L.

2460
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:43,805
- [Roger] It's interesting, 
you know what's funny is,

2461
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,274
taking an L is an art.

2462
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:47,943
Not an art, but,

2463
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:50,078
you gotta like, it's a thing.

2464
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,014
- It's an art, or whatever
you wanna define--

2465
01:25:52,014 --> 01:25:53,515
You have to know 
how to take an L.

2466
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:55,150
- Yeah. You got to 
be able to do it,

2467
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,318
and keep it moving.

2468
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,787
Like, getting crippled
by Ls is a problem,

2469
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,355
it happens to a lot of people.

2470
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:01,857
- I love Ls.
- I do too.

2471
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:03,392
I know, I've seen you,

2472
01:26:03,392 --> 01:26:05,060
you've done some good.

2473
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,962
Listen, when they light
the fire on your ass,

2474
01:26:06,962 --> 01:26:07,763
it's no way, it's--

2475
01:26:07,763 --> 01:26:09,564
- I love Ls.
- Yeah.

2476
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:12,167
- 'Cause I love the 
I told you so, so much.

2477
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,168
'Cause I know what I am.

2478
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,002
(Roger laughs)

2479
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:14,836
You know what I mean?

2480
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:17,105
Cool, man, 
I'm glad we got to talk.

2481
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:17,939
- All right, man.

2482
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:18,807
- All right, 
have a good weekend.

2483
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:20,108
- All right, good luck to
your Jets this weekend.

2484
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:20,942
- Ah, that's a--

2485
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:22,411
- Giants though, man.

2486
01:26:22,411 --> 01:26:23,345
Giants are like, agh!

2487
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:24,613
- It's over, yeah Giants suck.

2488
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:25,147
- Although, I think, 
you know what?

2489
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:27,549
I think we're 
appropriately two and two.

2490
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:28,550
I would say that.

2491
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,686
- Nah, it should be oh-and-four.
(Roger laughs)

2492
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,187
The Saints game's ludicrous.

2493
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,922
- [Tyler] You want to do 
Shamika from here or from the
car?

2494
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:34,823
- [Gary] What's that?

2495
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:36,258
- [Tyler] You want to do 
Shamika from here or the car?

2496
01:26:36,258 --> 01:26:38,460
- [Gary] From the car, I think.

2497
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,695
(laughing)

2498
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:44,666
All right, I'm heading out,

2499
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:47,069
and cutting into...

2500
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:47,903
Here's a good one for you guys,

2501
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:49,638
I've been cutting 
my Fridays a lot earlier

2502
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:50,972
to spend more family time.

2503
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:53,208
It's actually a 
little bit later for me.

2504
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,277
You can flash the time.

2505
01:26:55,277 --> 01:26:57,713
It's just a new 
switch I've made.

2506
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:58,880
But fuck, man,

2507
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,184
did we cram a 
ton of all-time shit

2508
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:04,152
into this day.

2509
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:05,620
I was on a fuckin'--

2510
01:27:05,620 --> 00:00:00,000
- [DRock] There was a lot today.
