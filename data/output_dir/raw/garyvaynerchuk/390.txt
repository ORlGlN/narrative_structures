1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:02,750
- On this episode, we go
live on YouTube it crashes,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,208
we go on Instagram and
we have an epic ending.

3
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:07,875
(hip hop music)

4
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,625
- [Gary] You ask questions

5
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,625
and I answer them

6
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:27,500
This is The #AskGaryVee Show.

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,959
- Before we get
into this episode,

8
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:33,708
we should take advantage,
yeah do that too,

9
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,834
maybe a little bit there,

10
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,458
we should take advantage of

11
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,959
of everybody being here, how
do we gamify subscriptions

12
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,959
for YouTube
with all these peeps?

13
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,792
- [Andy] The bell.

14
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,291
- The bell?
(bell dings)

15
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,041
What bell?

16
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,291
They see a bell?

17
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,959
- [Andy] There's a
level of you subscribe

18
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:50,792
where you need to hit
the bell notification.

19
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:52,000

- [Andy] Yeah.

21
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:53,959
- So if they're watching

22
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,208

23
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,041

- [Andy] Levion Bell.

28
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,834
- Not the Levion Bell.
I hate the fucking Steelers.

29
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,583

00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:28,083

way will it switch?

43
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,083
There we go.

00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,333

00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,333
What the fuck's up with that?

49
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,041
That's just how it rolls huh?

00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,875
Like I can't go, like.

51
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,041

their phone numbers are rolling.

70
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,417
- [Andy] Okay.

71
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:26,250
- I don't know how
you're going to stop them,

72
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,125
they're rolling fast.

73
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,708
I'm going to switch the script
in getting to this show.

74
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,083
There you go, Sean.

75
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,500
You can flip it around.

76
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
You're good.

77
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,667
Alright episode what?

00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,875

79
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,708
244?

80
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,875
Ready?

81
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,708
- [Andy] Yep.

82
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,625
- Cool.

83
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,125
Hey everybody
this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

84
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,792
and this is episode 244

85
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:52,291
of The #AskGaryVee Show.

86
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,333
And we are live on YouTube

87
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,166
flipping the
script a little bit,

88
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,750
excited about that.

89
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,625
And ready to roll.

90
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,542
Going to go to the call-in show

91
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,291
which is always a lot of fun.

92
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,834
I especially like when I hold
it and get a little excited

93
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:07,792
about that.

94
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,166
We should put on the lights.

95
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,750
Let's see here, yep.
Hope everybody's super well.

96
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,375
Great weekend, I'm
heading out to the west coast

97
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,708
before this monster storm.

98
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,500
We got a blizzard
coming boys and girls.

99
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,250
And it looks like
Andy K is on his game.

100
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,917
Big upgrade from Chris A
with his calling it.

101
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,083
Listen, Chris was
struggling with calling.

102
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,041
- [Operator] The
number you have dialed.

103
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,208
Oh!

104
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,083
- I spoke too soon And.

105
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,333
Alright, I'll talk a little bit

106
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,959
while you get
your shit together.

107
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,375
First of all, just want
to thank everybody for all

108
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,291
of the love I've been getting
across all of social YouTube,

109
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,083
hit the bell, hit the bell.
(bell dings)

110
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,500
Instragram all this stuff trying

111
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
to put out a lot of content.

112
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,291
DailyVee's been rolling.

113
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,583
Tyler doing a really good job.

114
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,083
Where's DRock?
Is he working today?

115
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,458
- [Other Tyler] He's in Chicago.
(phone ringing)

116
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,542
Why traveling?

117
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:57,166
Sleeping in Chicago?

118
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,458
- [Tyler] Sleeping in.

119
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,667
- What?

120
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:01,708
Alright let's get into the show.
(phone ringing)

121
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,500
- [Nick] Hello?

122
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,834
- Hello this is Gar Vaynerchuk

123
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,583
and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show.

124
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,875
- [Nick] Get the
fuck outta here.

125
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,291
- Uh-huh, what's your
name because I'm presuming

126
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,041
it's not Nicole?

127
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,375
- [Nick] Nah, nah,
nah, it's Nick Rizzo.

128
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,208
- Nick, how are you?

129
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,250
- [Nick] Good man how you doing?

130
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,834
- Great man,
what's your question?

131
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,542
- [Nick] Ah shit,
so I guess I was,--

132
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,542
- So Nick real quick,
since everybody does this,

133
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,625
will use this
opportunity to like,

134
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,333
what everybody's just
putting their phone number

135
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,417
and they just never think it's
actually gonna get called,

136
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:38,875
right?

137
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,750
- [Nick] Well so Nicole
is my wife's little sister

138
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,333
and I got her
on to watching you,

139
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,917
she's been watching
all of your stuff

140
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,500
and I guess she
just put my number

141
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,250
and she just texted me saying,
hey I just put your number.

142
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,875
(group laughter)

143
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,166
- Oh so this is even better.

144
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,375
Andy redemption for you.

145
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,000
- [Nick] Holy shit.

146
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,750
- Well good man, well
thanks for being on the show.

147
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,417
Great job by her, do you
have a business question,

148
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,583
or any kind of question?

149
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,333
- [Nick] So I am starting
to build my own business

150
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,875
I've had one I'm transferring
over the brand name

151
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,166
into something I'm
more passionate about

152
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,875
more easier for me
to truly make content

153
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,375
I really care about and
make a business I care about.

154
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,000
I guess one
question I would have is--

155
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,458
- Real quick I'm going to
stop you there before you go

156
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,834
to your question as
you gather your thoughts

157
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,458
for everybody who's watching,

158
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:23,959
my man here drilled it, because
he said it would be easier

159
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,291
for me if I was
passionate about it.

160
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,542
And I think the
big key on Crush It!,

161
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:29,834
you should show that,

162
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,166
is the reason I talked about
cashing in on your passion

163
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,667
is when you love it,
like if I had to talk

164
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,125
about the Jets 24 hours
a day, piece of cake.

165
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,917
I love attention and marketing.
Piece of cake, business.

166
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:44,125
If Tyler right over
here, had to talk about

167
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,542
the Penn State Lions he
could do it all day, right?

168
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:51,208
He's struggling with his
transition to a Jets fandom.

169
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,583
He did a
terrible job transitioning

170
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,750
into fantasy baseball
fandom so it's harder for him

171
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,083
even though he wanted to and
all his boys were doing it

172
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,291
it wasn't his passion,
it is a lot easier to create,

173
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,125
document, hustle, DM,

174
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,583
biz dev, win,
when it's subject matter

175
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,834
that you're interested in.

176
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:11,375
If you're getting into real
estate but you're not interested

177
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,333
in real estate
or flipping homes,

178
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,083
but that's where
you heard the money was,

179
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,792
or if you're starting
a social media agency

180
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:18,792
but you're doing it
because that's where

181
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,291
you think the money is and
it's not something you love,

182
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,291
you're gonna lose 'cause
you're not going to put in

183
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:27,542
enough hours to win because
you don't love it, right?

184
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,667
- [Nick] Preach, brother.

185
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,625
I've been trying to
build something that got into

186
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,625
for like six months and
I just was going nowhere.

187
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,667
When you sit down
and do work everyday

188
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,375
and it's like a bore and you
don't want to get into it.

189
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,208
It's,--

190
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,792
- Did you get into it,
did you get into it

191
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:42,625
because you thought
that's where the money was?

192
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,417
- [Nick] It was a supplement
company I started doing

193
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,542
the research and
development for products for

194
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,417
back when I was in college
and then I kinda became

195
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,458
the owner and the
guy handed it down to me.

196
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,291
- Got it.

197
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,458
- [Nick] And it just
wasn't moving forward

198
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,208
the way I wanted to so
now I'm changing over things.

199
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,000
- Good what's the question?

200
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,792
- [Nick] I guess specifically,

201
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:02,250
what is, per value wise
do you see a lot of value

202
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,458
in utilizing Facebook
community groups to kind

203
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,208
of offer free courses
and things like that

204
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,500
to target specific niches,

205
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,333
do you think a Facebook group
would be a beneficial way

206
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,333
to host that or?

207
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,166
- Yeah I'm actually a,
good job by you

208
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,375
because I haven't talked
a lot about Facebook groups

209
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,375
in a long time and I'm
actually pretty big fan of it.

210
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,542
I think building community
on Facebook is very smart,

211
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,375
closed groups can
be very attractive.

212
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,500
Yeah, I'm a big fan of groups,
I think it builds community,

213
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,792
I think if you're
going to build a group bro,

214
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,000
you just got to make a
commitment to be in the group.

215
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Ot's like 2003 forums, right?

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,208
If you're going to build a
forum on the internet in 2002

217
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,375
it was a good idea.
It was a good idea in 2006.

218
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,000
Problem is you gotta be in it.

219
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,041
You gotta be in there right?

220
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,166
- [Nick] Post a lot--

221
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:49,083
Exactly, just like 4chan
all the way back did well

222
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,375
'cause Moot was in it.

223
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,750
Like you gotta be in it, right?

224
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,166
Jets Insider did well
because Brian was in it,

225
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,166
like if you're gonna host,

226
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,208
if you're gonna build a
community don't think

227
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,375
somebody else is going
to run it for you,

228
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,333
or like it's gonna
take care of itself,

229
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,458
you've got to manage it.
You gotta live in it

230
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,333
and provide value.

231
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,959
- [Nick] Yeah, I'm just
trying to use that as a place

232
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,834
where I can build a community
for people to feel safe

233
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,959
and to feel a part of
to kind of grow together

234
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,500
as a group itself too so.

235
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,708
- I think it's a good place,
man.

236
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,166
Thanks for your call.

237
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,000
- [Nick] Thank you very much.
Have a great day.

238
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,750
- Take care, bye bye.
Pretty good.

239
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,625
Yeah, I think
communities really matter,

240
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,125
I think there's a
lot of ways to do them,

241
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,583
I think GroupMes and WhatsApps,

242
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,082
and closed Facebook
groups, email newsletters,

243
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:36,041
internet forums,
yeah, I mean I think,

244
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,500
walled gardens,
closed environments,

245
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,500
for a group to build together
is a really rad thing to do.

246
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,332
What's up?

247
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,792
- [Andy] A.J. from
the Arctic Circle.

248
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:47,708
- A.J. It's Gary Vaynerchuk
from The #AskGaryVee Show.

249
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,834
- [A.J.] Oh my God,

250
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,333
I knew you were gonna call,

251
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,708
I don't know why,
I just knew it.

252
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,542
- You knew it today, man.

253
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,959
- [Andy] He said Arctic Circle.

254
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,458
- I love it man.

255
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,291
Well listen, you
should play the lotto tonight.

256
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,166
- [A.J.] Dude,
we gotta be quick.

257
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,834
I'm literally in
the Arctic Circle,

258
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,625
I only get service outside.

259
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,625
It's -42. So.

260
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,917
- Jesus. Let's do
this before you die.

261
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,291
(group laughter)

262
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,250
- [A.J.] Hey man,
my question is,

263
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,834
my family,
they don't operate like I do.

264
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,250
They don't work as hard as I do.

265
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,834
I want to help them,
but my friends think

266
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:20,875
that they're, they're drowning
me, you know what I mean?

267
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,917
- I see, you're
carrying your family's weight

268
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,708
on your shoulders,
the family business?

269
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,375
- [A.J.] Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,667
- This is tough
bro, because, listen,

271
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:34,333
I've been a driving
force in two family businesses,

272
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,375
where, you just gotta, honestly,

273
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,542
this is a very personal answer,

274
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,250
everybody's gotta
make their own decision.

275
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,417
It depends on what you
value, and what feels good,

276
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,917
and that will go up and down,

277
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,375
it feels good for me what I
brought to the partnerships

278
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,333
to my brother and
dad, and at times,

279
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,291
it didn't feel good.

280
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,834
I mean, it's,
you know, it's hard,

281
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,750
when you're hustling harder.

282
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,583
But you can't also,
like I can't expect

283
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,500
AJ to do
exactly what I'm doing,

284
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
because I'm being selfish.

285
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,875
I'm doing it for myself.

286
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,208
And so I think
- [A.J.] Yeah.

287
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,333
- You need to be, you know,

288
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,750
it's easy for
everybody from the outside,

289
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,166
saying yo bro, stop
carrying your sister

290
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,708
and your uncle and
everybody's getting money

291
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,583
off your back, if
it makes you feel good,

292
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,333
and you're okay
with 15 cents on a dollar

293
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,000
or 50 cents on a dollar,

294
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,875
well that's your life.

295
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,000
So, I would say this,

296
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,333
if you've got a problem with it,

297
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,208
and your friends
are saying that because

298
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,250
they're supporting what you're
saying after four beers,

299
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,291
that's one thing.

300
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,792
But if they're just
observing from the outside,

301
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,792
and they're starting
to change your mind,

302
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,333
I wouldn't let outside sources

303
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:34,125
tell you what to do
with inside a family dynamic.

304
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,583
- [A.J.] Okay.

305
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,375
I mean, I've been
struggling for years,

306
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,667
so this is great,
I do appreciate it.

307
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:40,375
- I appreciate it.

308
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,625
Is there anything I
can help build on this?

309
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,750
'Cause I think
family business is a place

310
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,834
where I have a lot of expertise

311
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,542
and a lot of experience,

312
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:46,959
and I pay attention to it.

313
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,625
Can I build on this for you
before you freeze to death?

314
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,041
- [A.J.] You know what,
you've talked about this

315
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,583
kind of a lot, not
necessarily this specific case,

316
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,250
but this really, like, solves
a lot of questions for me,

317
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,959
so, I'll just keep
watching your content,

318
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,125
and I'm sure you'll
talk about it again later.

319
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:01,750
- Good man.

320
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,041
If I can ever help
you again, let me know.

321
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,125
- [A.J.] Hey
man, I appreciate it.

322
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:05,875
Thanks for calling dude.

323
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,875
- You got it. Bye-bye.

324
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,917
Let's level
that up for everybody

325
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,875
while Andy gets the next number.

326
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,291
Listen.

327
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,333
You have to be very
careful and very smart

328
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,792
if you're getting
feedback from your inner circle

329
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,375
of people that
love you, 'friends',

330
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,250
about things,
based on you talking,

331
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,000
and then reacting
and supporting you,

332
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
versus them
observing from the outside

333
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,750
and imposing their own
family dynamics onto you.

334
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,750
It's super important.

335
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,208
You take a step back and realize

336
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,375
what's happening, what's
the chicken and egg here.

337
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,875
Is this people responding to me,

338
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,000
or is this me getting
advice from people

339
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,834
that just don't
know how exactly I feel,

340
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,542
or every little part
about it inside my world.

341
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:44,834
Sean, you playing
with, what's goin on,

342
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,041
you answering people? You okay?

343
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,917
- [Sean] No, I'm just
trying to get the video back.

344
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:48,959
- What happened?

345
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,000
- [Sean] You got a call,

346
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,250
and when
I declined it, it came back.

347
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,333
- Let me see.

348
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,875
That sucks. Let's see.

349
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,542
That's, why did I,

350
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,500
reconnect.

351
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:08,625
(phone ringing)

352
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,625
I think we're good.

353
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,375
- [Audrick] Hello?
- [Andy] Audrick.

354
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,417
- Hey man, it's Gary Vaynerchuk

355
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:15,083
and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show.

356
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,208
- [Audrick] That
is freakin' awesome.

357
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,458
What's going on Gary?

358
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,500
- Life is really good, my man.

359
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,041
What's your name?

360
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,250
- [Audrick] Hey, my
name is Audrick McGarow.

361
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,166
- I'm not sure
if it's recording, but.

362
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,083
Audrey, I want to
make sure I heard that.

363
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,583
What's that?

364
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,959
- [Audrick] Audrick.
Audrick McGarow.

365
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,166
- Audrick. Real,
real pleasure man.

366
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,583
How are you?

367
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,000
- [Audrick] I'm
doing excellent, man.

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,208
Hey Gary, definitely, you've
been an inspiration to me,

369
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,125
and a couple
things that you have told

370
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,250
in some of your
things about not actually

371
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,208
creating the stuff,
but actually documenting,

372
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,542
has been a turning
point in what I've been doing.

373
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:49,375
- Makes me happy.

374
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,000
- [Audrick] So I started,
yeah, I started

375
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
a Facebook ad agency,
to try to help people

376
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,625
with their Facebook ads.

377
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,792
But my true passion has been
in motivational speaking.

378
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,959
You know, so I
started documenting videos

379
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,250
on my Instagram, and in a short
time I've been able to reach

380
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,625
people with my words, and
the reason I find my passion

381
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,375
is in the fact that I
want to be able to reach people

382
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,041
that I didn't have in my life,

383
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,000
because I was growing up
through my obstacles. Correct?

384
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,166
- I get it.

385
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,291
- [Audrick] My question
to you is,

386
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,708
how do I expand,

387
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,917
so that I can
actually reach more people,

388
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,875
so that I can
actually be more impactful,

389
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,917
other than documenting my life

390
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,083
and actually
speaking from the heart?

391
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,917
You know, 'cause right
now, I'm growing organically

392
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,291
on my Instagram.

393
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,166
- How long have
you been doing it?

394
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,583
- [Audrick] So I actually
started about two weeks ago.

395
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,000
And I know that it's gonna
take some time to grow more.

396
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,708
- Dude.

397
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,375
- [Audrick] But just
wanted to know what other tips

398
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,959
I can do, to be
able to reach that point

399
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,750
where I'm reaching more people.

400
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,458
- Put out content where
people are paying attention.

401
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,375
Facebook, YouTube,
Instagram, Snapchat,

402
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:03,000
blogs, podcasts,
and put out content.

403
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,959
- [Audrick] Okay.

404
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,000
- And dude, when I tell you
that when I start something,

405
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,875
I don't even
begin to think about

406
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,542
how many more people I can reach

407
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,125
than I've been reaching,

408
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:16,458
maybe I start
caring at year three,

409
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,792
maybe the first time
I even think about it,

410
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,333
is three years into a decision.

411
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,500
You just told me that
you found your passion,

412
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,041
that you're a
motivational speaker,

413
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,625
and you're antsy.

414
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,959
Say whatever you
want, but you are.

415
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,458
You're antsy two
weeks in to get bigger.

416
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,708
That's gonna be a
disaster formula, my man.

417
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,875
You need to put your head down,

418
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,708
and you have to understand.

419
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,458
How many followers
you got on Instagram?

420
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,083
- [Audrick] I've grown up
to 302 in the two weeks.

421
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,166
- I love it.

422
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,583
You need to be in a place
where if nine months from now

423
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,041
you're at 413,
you're feeling just as good.

424
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:50,917
- [Audrick] Uh-huh.

425
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,417
- You're feeling just
as good. You know why?

426
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,333
- [Audrick] Ah, definitely.

427
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,792
- You know why,
though, I'm telling you that?

428
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:55,458
- [Audrick] Why's that?

429
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,917
- Because by the way,
I have a funny feeling,

430
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:59,166
my man, that if you
were at 413 followers

431
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,375
nine months from today,
you would not be happy.

432
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,500
You went from zero
to 320 in two weeks,

433
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,458
why the fuck would you
only gain 100 followers

434
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,917
in eight months
and two weeks, right?

435
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,375
The reason that
you should be thrilled

436
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,125
if you're at 419 in nine months,

437
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,041
is you just told me
you found your passion.

438
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,333
- [Audrick] Yeah.

439
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,208
And that's the
biggest thing that I,

440
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,875
'cause I know that
it's gonna take time.

441
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,166
And that's one thing that I,

442
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,125
you know,
I'm 35 years old, and freakin'--

443
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,000
- You're a kid.

444
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,250
- [Audrick] Yeah, exactly.

445
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,708
I'm still young, like you.

446
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,542
- You're real young, man. 35?

447
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,917
You got your
whole life ahead of you.

448
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,083
- [Audrick] And
that's the biggest thing,

449
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,458
I want to make sure that

450
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,375
one, you know,
watching your content

451
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,458
has definitely humbled me a lot,

452
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,625
to wanting to be the rich guy.

453
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,583
I don't want to be the rich guy.

454
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,917
I wanna be the guy
that people reach out to me,

455
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,125
and tell me hey, because of you,

456
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,792
I see things differently.

457
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:52,708
I'm more positive.

458
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,875
You know, and that's really what

459
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,250
my ultimate goal is going to be.

460
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,041
- My man, if you believe that,

461
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,041
and I actually
weirdly believe you,

462
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,208
then I'm gonna tell
you the number one thing

463
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,708
that you have to figure out.

464
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,166
Patience and humility.

465
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:06,792
- [Audrick] Okay.

466
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,542
- Do not wrap
your self-esteem up

467
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:11,291
into the number
of followers you got.

468
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,250
- [Audrick] Gotcha.

469
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,500
- You got 310 people
on earth that fucking

470
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,000
give a fuck about
what you have to say,

471
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,959
and you can change
every one of those lives,

472
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,583
you'd leave a
bigger impact on this earth

473
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,625
than 99% of people.

474
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,959
- [Audrick] That's deep.
- It is deep.

475
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,875
So be happy you got 310,

476
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,458
instead of worrying
about getting 3,000.

477
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,208
- [Audrick] Okay. Will do.

478
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,875
Yo, thank you
for calling me, man,

479
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,166
- You got it, man.
Good luck to you.

480
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,625
- [Audrick] Alright. Thank you.

481
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,542
- Cool. Take care.

482
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:40,250
We're on Instagram Live now
'cause YouTube crashed.

483
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,417
- [Sean] YouTube crashed, okay.

484
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,250
I was trying to figure it out.

485
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,083
- Yeah, YouTube crashed.

486
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:43,917
Let's get one or two more calls

487
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,458
before I got my next meeting.

488
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,667
Guys, you know,
everybody wants to grow.

489
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,959
Everybody wants to
continue to succeed, I get it.

490
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,875
But boy do I wish
I could, like, look at my world,

491
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,792
I was on Instagram
for fuckin' five years

492
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,417
and was at like
40,000 followers.

493
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,625
Like it's not about
the following count.

494
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,333
Your time will come
if you're good enough.

495
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,790
If you're a good
enough motivational speaker,

496
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,082
or good enough executive
or good enough designer,

497
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,708
good enough entrepreneur,
you're time will come.

498
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,165
Everybody's in a rush.

499
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,290
- [Andy] Taylor.

500
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,415
- Right?
(phone ringing)

501
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:15,374
Everybody's in
a rush to grow up.

502
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,500
I wish I was 12
and throwing a ball.

503
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
- [Taylor] Hello?
- Hey Taylor, it's GaryVee.

504
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,665
You're on The #AskGaryVee Show.

505
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,082
- [Taylor] No way!

506
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,250
- Yes way.
- [Taylor] Holy crap.

507
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,583
Okay.

508
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,540
- Where you from?
- [Taylor] Yeah, sweet.

509
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,874
I'm from Buffalo, New York.

510
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,375
- I love it,
are you a Bills fan?

511
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,208
(Taylor sighs)

512
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,708
- [Taylor] Unfortunately yes.

513
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,041
- I know you said unfortunately
'cause you're trying--

514
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,000
- [Taylor] We're not doing good.

515
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,583
- Well listen, neither
are the Jets, don't worry.

516
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,083
So what's going on?

517
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,417
(Taylor laughs)

518
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:40,333
- [Taylor] Nothing much.

519
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,917
I basically was just
dying to ask you a question.

520
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,875
Currently graduated
college last May

521
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,250
and I'm trying to
build my own business,

522
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,125
brand, hustle,
all that kinda stuff.

523
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,708
My question for you
is, and I'm probably sure

524
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,208
that a lot of people ask this--

525
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,583
- It's okay.
- [Taylor] The same things.

526
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,417
- It's okay.

527
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,500
- [Taylor] How do you get over

528
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,333
the stump of you're
graduating, and you feel

529
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,917
all this pressure
'cause you're trying

530
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,291
to build something
but you're still so young.

531
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,583
But you wanna do the
stuff and grow it big.

532
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,458
I'm just in a rut and
I can't get out of it.

533
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,792
But I have a hustle and a drive

534
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,041
that I know I'll be
able to build something.

535
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,041
But I'm just in this
space that's not--

536
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:23,708
- I know where you're at.

537
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,000
- [Taylor] That's not
allowing me to.

538
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,959
- Let me help you.

539
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,667
The space you're in is

540
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:32,458
probably the macro, micro issue.

541
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,208
So it's macro patience,
micro speed, right?

542
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,083
- [Taylor] Yeah.
- What do I mean by that?

543
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,834
You need to be
patient as fuck, Taylor.

544
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,000
You're 22, 23-years-old.

545
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,250
Like what do you
think's gonna happen overnight?

546
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,417
- [Taylor] Yeah, I know.

547
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,792
- You need to be fast.

548
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,834
7 A.M. to two in
the morning every day.

549
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,166
But in the big picture, you
need to realize nothing good

550
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,834
is gonna happen
for the next six years.

551
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,041
- [Taylor] Okay.

552
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,375
Do you think that I should just

553
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,625
try every good idea that I think

554
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,041
I have and just
go for it all out?

555
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:10,083
Or do you think I should stick
with one thing at a time?

556
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,333
- I think the fact that you even

557
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,625
asked that question,
that you should

558
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,000
taste flirting with a
lot of different things

559
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,166
because you'll be crippled
by the what if if you don't.

560
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,500
Even though
that's not the perfect

561
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,917
formula to build the
biggest short term wealth

562
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,166
because you should
triple down on one thing

563
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,625
instead of being
half pregnant on nine.

564
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,792
- [Taylor] Okay, I like that.

565
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:33,417
- Taylor, let me
tell you something.

566
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:36,125
Let me ask you, the
pressure, who do you?

567
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,041
Like are you trying
to prove to yourself,

568
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,625
to your siblings, to
your parents, to the world?

569
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,041
Who are you trying to prove that

570
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,708
you're successful to,
or that this

571
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,041
was the right call,
or you're gonna make it?

572
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,000
That's what you
have to figure out.

573
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,750
- [Taylor] Hmm,
that's a good question.

574
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,458
- What are you impatient for?

575
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,875
What's the problem?

576
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,750
You wanna buy a fuckin' Rolex?

577
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,667
What's the rush?

578
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,000
- [Taylor] I feel
like I've known

579
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,166
that I'm mean to
do something big.

580
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,125
- Me too.
- [Taylor] And I grew up in

581
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,250
an entrepreneurial household.
- Me too.

582
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,542
- [Taylor] So it's in my blood,

583
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,291
it's in my bones.
- Good.

584
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,542
- [Taylor] I feel like I watch

585
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,750
all these other
Millennials hitting

586
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,208
these huge I guess
milestones in their life--

587
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:16,875
- What milestones?

588
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,750
- [Taylor] Then
I'm sitting here.

589
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,959
- Let's break it down.
How old are you?

590
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:23,583
- [Taylor] I'm 22,
about to be 23.

591
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,041
- Okay, what
milestone, please give

592
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,000
me a Millennial
and the milestone

593
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,583
they achieved
that makes you feel

594
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,000
like you're just
sitting in fucking Buffalo?

595
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,667
- [Taylor] Well,
I'm sitting in Buffalo,

596
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,583
which is one thing
I'm not happy about.

597
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,333
But--
- That's right 'cause

598
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,625
it's home of the Buffalo Bills,
piece of shit team.

599
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,083
- [Taylor] Yeah. (laughs)

600
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,959
- But before you go there,
forget about sitting in Buffalo,

601
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,000
who's the Millennial
and what's the milestone

602
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,917
that's making you feel
like you're sitting there?

603
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:48,750
Go.

604
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,458
The truth, go.

605
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,542
- [Taylor] Well
honestly there's people

606
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,875
on social media which definitely

607
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,250
is not always true--
- Who?

608
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,625
- [Taylor] But I watch,
oh god, the only thing

609
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,500
on the spot I can
think of is a Kardashian

610
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,250
or a Jenner which is
lame, but. (laughing)

611
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,375
- Can we talk about this please?

612
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,959
- [Taylor] Yeah,
I feel like, sure.

613
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:13,667
- Like you're telling me
that Kylie Jenner's fucking

614
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,792
trillion followers on Instagram

615
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,917
makes you feel like
you're just sitting there?

616
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,458
- [Taylor] No, I feel
like the fact

617
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,166
that she's
already got a business

618
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,125
started that's super successful,

619
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,583
obviously that
comes with her fame.

620
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,250
- Did you
factor in the fact that

621
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,500
her sisters and mom architected

622
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,166
something for 10 years while
she was a teenager that she

623
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,750
was able to walk directly into,
that gave her a springboard?

624
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,834
That she had the
financial capabilities

625
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:43,500
of deploying ungodly
amounts of plastic surgery,

626
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,583
and all the other variable
things that she's been able

627
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:50,166
to do to create that culture,
and that financial benefit?

628
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,000
- [Taylor] Yeah.

629
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,875
- Did you factor in that her mom

630
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:56,083
is a ninja architect of business
and created that framework?

631
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,750
- [Taylor] Yeah and I feel like

632
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,834
not many people give
them the credit for that.

633
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:01,875
- I agree.
- [Taylor] I totally think that

634
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,083
they built this empire.
- I agree.

635
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,625
But what the fuck does
that have to do with you?

636
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,917
- [Taylor] It has
nothing to do with me.

637
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,083
I know.
- No shit.

638
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,125
Remember how I?

639
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,208
I don't know if you
saw this where I said

640
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,792
stop looking at
your friends' shit

641
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:17,333
or whatever the
fuck I put on Instagram?

642
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,041
- [Taylor] Yeah.

643
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:18,917
- I don't know if you saw it

644
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:19,875
or not but it doesn't matter.

645
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,375
Like you looking
at the Kardashians

646
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,500
is the most ludicrous horseshit
I've ever heard in my life.

647
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
(Taylor laughs)

648
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,959
- [Taylor] Well that's just
first one that can pop into my

649
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:29,959
when you asked me.
- Great.

650
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:30,792
Listen, we're here, we're here.

651
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,458
Give me another one.

652
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,458
- [Taylor] There's a
guy in London.

653
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,500
I can't think of his name

654
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,583
at the top of my head.
- I'm gonna stop,

655
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,250
I'm gonna stop you right now.

656
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,083
- [Taylor] Okay.

657
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,583
- Let me give you some,
I was gonna say fatherly.

658
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,875
I guess my father was 40,
now I'll give you some

659
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,917
massively older
brother, uncle advice.

660
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:50,000
You ready?
- [Taylor] (laughs) Okay, yes.

661
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,667
- Every second
you spend thinking

662
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,917
about what
somebody else has is taking

663
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:57,375
away from time that you could
create something for yourself.

664
00:22:58,792 --> 00:22:59,750
- [Taylor] Yeah.

665
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,875
- You're losing.

666
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,000
You're losing
'cause you're laying

667
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,792
in your bed looking
at somebody's fucking

668
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:07,708
glamorous photoshopped picture
of them doing something cool.

669
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,333
You're envious,
and you're jealous,

670
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:13,291
and you're impatient, and
it's crippling your upside.

671
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,208
- [Taylor] Yeah
'cause that's where

672
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,166
I wanna be and I know
I'm not there yet.

673
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,667
- You haven't done shit.

674
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:19,500
- [Taylor] I know.

675
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,417
- So go do shit that
actually gets you there

676
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,166
so that you earn
it instead of like

677
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,041
you dwelling
that you're not there

678
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,250
and hoping that's
something's gonna happen.

679
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,375
I don't know what's
going through your mind.

680
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,625
- [Taylor] Yeah. Well I guess
I'm hustling on the side

681
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,667
but I don't think
I'm doing enough I guess.

682
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:35,542
- You definitely
aren't doing enough

683
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,000
if you have
enough time to fucking

684
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,917
consume the
content of a Kardashian

685
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,333
and some boy in London.

686
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,750
- [Taylor] That's true. (laughs)

687
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,667
- Taylor, listen to me.

688
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,792
Taylor, listen.

689
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,917
You've gotta deploy patience
and you gotta love the process.

690
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:50,708
I'm addicted to the
process of the battle scars,

691
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,625
the setbacks, the
lack of, you know.

692
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,458
Taylor, I gave up my
entire 20s, all of 'em.

693
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,417
Imagine not doing
anything fun or going anywhere

694
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:02,250
for the next eight years,
including Saturday and Sunday.

695
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,041
That's what I did from 22 to 30.

696
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,000
Every day I spent 15 hours a day

697
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,708
in a liquor store,
thought about a liquor store,

698
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:12,000
built a liquor store, sold wine.

699
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,417
Like spent every day.

700
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,417
Like this last weekend,
don't lie to me Taylor,

701
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,875
what did you do
this last weekend?

702
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,792
What did you do
fuckin' Saturday and Sunday?

703
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,625
Tell me the truth,
don't bullshit me.

704
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,917
- [Taylor] Yeah, no
bullshit, I'm helping my

705
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:27,333
mom right now on digital media
and branding for her company.

706
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,166
- Lovely.

707
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,333
- [Taylor] So I had a
marketing meeting--

708
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,208
- Lovely.
- With one of

709
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,750
the people doing that.
- Love you.

710
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,500
- [Taylor] Then I also
have coming up--

711
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,375
- How much time did
you have for yourself

712
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,917
on Saturday and Sunday that
was not working every minute?

713
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:41,250
Tell me the truth.

714
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,250
- [Taylor] A lot, a lot.
- I know.

715
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,834
So that's the punchline, right?

716
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:46,834
Now imagine this.
- Yeah.

717
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:47,959
- When I tell you this.

718
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:51,834
You spent more
downtime on not your career

719
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:56,000
this weekend than I did
in my entire 20s combined.

720
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,625
- [Taylor] Oh shit, okay.

721
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,375
(Andy chuckling)

722
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,125
That put things
into perspective.

723
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,208
- I think so.

724
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,166
- [Taylor] Awesome.

725
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,000
- I think so too.

726
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
- [Taylor] Yeah, I need
to just get to it.

727
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,917
- Taylor, you need
to do me a huge favor.

728
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,917
If you really wanna
win and you wanna come

729
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,125
to New York in eight years,

730
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,083
and shake my hand,
here's what you need to do.

731
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,667
You need to stop giving a shit

732
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,917
about what anybody
else has and realize

733
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,208
that if you put your head down

734
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,708
and just work for
the next 10 years,

735
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:30,834
no glamor, no new
fucking car, suitcase,

736
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:34,333
jewelry, trip,
event, no Coachella,

737
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,708
no fucking new fucking sneakers.

738
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,208
Like fuckin' work,
you will have it.

739
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,375
Every time you care about one

740
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,625
of the things I just mentioned,

741
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:45,125
it will slow down
your process of having it.

742
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,250
- [Taylor] Okay so
in less than eight years

743
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,875
when I'm a millionaire by 25,
I'll come shake your hand.

744
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,083
- I promise you that statement

745
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:55,250
itself made me 100%
guarantee that you won't.

746
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,458
- [Taylor] No!
- Yes.

747
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,333
Yes, that's how this works.

748
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,291
Being a millionaire
at 25 when you're 22,

749
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:04,542
and you're dick shit,
and haven't even started

750
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:08,875
is inconceivable unless
you fuckin' hit the lotto.

751
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,000
What's the romance?
- [Taylor] Hmm, okay.

752
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,583
- What's the romance?

753
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,208
I wanna make, you
know how everybody says,

754
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,583
"GaryVee, when are
you gonna buy the Jets?

755
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,667
"In two years?" and
then I reply 20 years

756
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,250
I'm a romantic about the journey

757
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,000
and the process which is why
I'm actually gonna pull it off.

758
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,750
You're trying to be
a millionaire by 25.

759
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,959
How, Taylor?

760
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,959
- [Taylor] It's just
a goal I've always had.

761
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,375
- Why?
- [Taylor] Right now with what

762
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,208
I'm doing I guess it's not.

763
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,667
- That's right,
it's an arbitrary

764
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,500
bullshit thing
that means nothing.

765
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,750
- [Taylor] Yeah.

766
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,208
- Wouldn't you rather guarantee

767
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,917
millionairship by 36 than

768
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,333
by doing long
term marathon running

769
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,291
versus doing a
bunch of bullshit sprints

770
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:50,291
that guarantees never having it?

771
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:51,000
And I promise you,

772
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,667
a funny thing
happens to your self-esteem

773
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,542
when you're 31
and not a millionaire

774
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:57,041
because you've been
chasing fast fucking cash,

775
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:00,417
and you're now six years removed
from not hitting your goal.

776
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:04,000
Your self-esteem
starts fuckin' with your head.

777
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,166
- [Taylor] Mhmmm, yeah.

778
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,458
- Listen carefully.
- [Taylor] I agree.

779
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,041
- I wanna buy the New York Jets

780
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,417
but when I
clarify it to everybody,

781
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,291
I want the
process of trying to buy

782
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:14,166
the New York Jets more
than buying the New York Jets.

783
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,291
Understand?

784
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,291
- [Taylor] Yeah.

785
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,250
'Cause ultimately
that's the end goal

786
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,291
but there's a
process behind that.

787
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,458
- You have to
understand, I don't give

788
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,750
a fuck about the end goal.

789
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,375
I care about the process,
the enjoyment of doing it.

790
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,583
You're not
enjoying yourself trying

791
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:33,291
to get to a million bucks
over the next three years.

792
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:36,834
- [Taylor] No. (laughs)

793
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:37,667
You're right.

794
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,166
- Oh I know I'm right.

795
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,583
I'm just sticking
on this right now

796
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,583
because I feel like we've
gone into this deep enough

797
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,667
that I might as well hold
on for a couple more minutes

798
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,667
to see if I can
actually pull you through

799
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,500
instead of you
just being on this high

800
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,792
of practicality for 36 hours,
and then going back

801
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,625
to Instagram
bullshit in 48 hours.

802
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,875
- [Taylor] I'm gonna
deactivate that shit. (laughs)

803
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,166
- No, you need to
learn to discipline,

804
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:04,000
to be able to put it
in the proper bucket.

805
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,208
- [Taylor] Yeah.

806
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,250
I just feel like I hold myself

807
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,834
at this pedestal
only it's crippling myself

808
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:10,834
'cause I'm not actually doing
the things to get there.

809
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:13,083
- Of course so you're
playing a fake narrative

810
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,542
instead of
putting in the actual work

811
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:17,041
that's needed to
actually pull it off.

812
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,834
Then what's
happen is you're living

813
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:21,041
a fake world to yourself,
but you know it,

814
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,625
which then changes your behavior

815
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,458
in the way you
interact with others.

816
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,208
- [Taylor] That's true.

817
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,417
- I know.

818
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,375
Like for all my bravado now,
I was real quiet in my 20s.

819
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,417
People made of
me, like, "You work

820
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,834
"in your dad's liquor store?

821
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,458
"I'm on Wall Street
making a 100,000.

822
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:37,291
"I got a BMW."

823
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,083
I'm like, "That's nice, Pat."

824
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,000
- [Taylor] Yeah.

825
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,125
- Do you understand the level

826
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,792
of disrespect I have for Pat?

827
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,125
Do you understand the level

828
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,417
of disrespect
I have for all those

829
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,708
20, 30, 40, 
50-year-olds flashing shit

830
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,417
on fuckin' Instagram
with short term moves?

831
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,708
I can't wait for the
fucking world to melt.

832
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,500
I can't wait for all
these bullshit people

833
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,917
to get fuckin' hosed out
when the economy gets shit.

834
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,375
- [Taylor] Yeah it's
'cause they're short term

835
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,333
affording these
things that are flashy

836
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:04,041
but in the long term,
it's not sustainable

837
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,166
for what
they're doing right now.

838
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:08,417
- Yeah but meanwhile, you're
admiring the fuck out of them.

839
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,917
- [Taylor] I know,
it's a problem.

840
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,917
- No shit, Taylor.
- [Taylor] It's really bad.

841
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,458
- Taylor, you need to
start lovin' the process,

842
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:15,917
and the work, and the grind.

843
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,166
You need to
start respecting people

844
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:20,333
that are like sleeping
with like four roommates

845
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,917
and buying their
t-shirts at Walmart.

846
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,708
- [Taylor] Yeah, you know what?

847
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,291
I feel like I need that wake up.

848
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,375
But I feel like I need to hit

849
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,208
rock bottom and
have that wake up.

850
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,834
I'm too comfortable right now.

851
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,375
It's annoying
the shit out of me.

852
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,667
- I don't think so.

853
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,208
I think you're saying you need

854
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,834
to hit rock
bottom because it buys

855
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:43,917
you more time to
bullshit like you are right now.

856
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,834
- [Taylor] Hmm,
I never thought of that.

857
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:47,875
- You know what I mean?

858
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,250
Like you know it's not working.

859
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,291
You're just saying, by the way,

860
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,375
let me go complete
left field on you.

861
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,125
You're a
22-year-old girl, woman.

862
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,583
Like it's okay to
enjoy a little bit now too.

863
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,917
You've heard me say
regrets, I don't know

864
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,041
how deep you know
my content, but once

865
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:02,959
in a blue moon
when people ask me

866
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,667
the advice for 25-year-old Gary,

867
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,875
the answer is go
have fun, asshole.

868
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,917
It would've been
okay to go to Vegas,

869
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:12,125
or Acapulco, or
like do some dumb shit.

870
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,625
Do you know what I mean?

871
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,625
- [Taylor] Yeah.

872
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,750
I think I've had my
fun in college though

873
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,208
and now I feel
like it's time to work.

874
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:19,875
- No, no.

875
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:22,250
That's the bullshit
PR version Taylor.

876
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:26,917
The reality Taylor is
still fuckin' in that zone.

877
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,792
- [Taylor] Hmm.

878
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,375
Yeah.

879
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,667
- Don't beat yourself up.

880
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,083
Don't hold yourself accountable

881
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,959
to arbitrary bullshit fantasies.

882
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,041
Just put in work and enjoy that.

883
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:40,083
Enjoy eating shit,
and dirt, and bleeding,

884
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,458
and the grind,
and don't give a fuck

885
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,000
about what anybody else thinks,

886
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,083
why you haven't done it,
why are you doing that.

887
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,208
Have four jobs.

888
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:50,125
Fuckin' Wendys,
Walmart, your side hustle.

889
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,834
Work, train, learn.

890
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:53,917
Don't think
you're a digital expert

891
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:56,125
just because you're 22 and
you have an Instagram account.

892
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,417
Show me how much
fuckin' shit you've sold

893
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:02,166
with your digital
social media skills.

894
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,041
- [Taylor] Okay.

895
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,834
- Do you understand?

896
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:05,708
- [Taylor] No, I do.

897
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:06,542
Yeah.

898
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,583
- You're just completely
in the wrong game

899
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,542
and I'm holding you
onto this because you and 99%

900
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:14,875
of the people that are watching
are playing the same game.

901
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:15,959
- [Taylor] I know which is why

902
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,333
I wanted to ask the question.

903
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,166
- But you're look--
- [Taylor] I can't--

904
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,000
- But you're--
- [Taylor] I'm obviously

905
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,166
not the only one.

906
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,291
- No, you're the majority
and the massive majority.

907
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:27,166
The question is, you just need
to understand the following.

908
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:31,708
You can trick losers,
you're not tricking me.

909
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:34,667
- [Taylor] Good 'cause
I want honest answers.

910
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,166
- You don't need
my honest answer.

911
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,625
You know you're not
tricking yourself either.

912
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,875
None of us are
tricking ourselves.

913
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,041
- [Taylor] No.
- I just wanna remind you

914
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,333
that you might be able to trick

915
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,375
your Uncle Hal, and
you might be able to trick

916
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,583
your girlfriend that was in
your fucking college with you.

917
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:49,125
But you're not tricking the
winner when you're bullshitting.

918
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,083
Got it?
- [Taylor] Got it.

919
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:54,708
- So even if you're
posturing, and pandering,

920
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:58,875
and PR-ing yourself, no
winner thinks you're winning.

921
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,083
- [Taylor] Yeah, 'cause I'm not.
- I know.

922
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,083
Work.

923
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:11,291
That's the answer
to all these questions.

924
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:12,125
- [Taylor] Got it.
- Work, learn things,

925
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,583
do stuff, try to sell shit,
learn how to make money.

926
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,834
Work.

927
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,667
- [Taylor] Alright, I will.

928
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,417
- Was this good?

929
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,250
- [Taylor] Awesome.
Thank you so much.

930
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,000
- Can you do me a huge favor?
- [Taylor] Yeah.

931
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,041
- Can you email me in 30 days,
and don't bullshit me,

932
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,542
what's your Twitter
handle or Instagram?

933
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:29,583
- [Taylor] I don't--
- What's your

934
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,959
Instagram handle?
- That's fine.

935
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,917
- [Taylor] Instagram,
it's @TheFabulousJourney.

936
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:36,333
- @TheFabulousJourney.

937
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,083
- [Taylor] Yeah.

938
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,667
- Me, and my whole
team, and the entire

939
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,083
VaynerNation is watching.

940
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,000
- [Taylor] Oh shit, okay.

941
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,708
Got it.

942
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:46,083
- I'm gonna smoke
you out of your bullshit.

943
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,708
- [Taylor] (laughs) Okay.

944
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:51,083
- Everybody's watching.

945
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,875
- [Taylor] Okay, I got it.

946
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,917
- Do you understand?

947
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:57,083
- [Taylor] Yeah.

948
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,000
- I like your blue dress.

949
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,834
- [Taylor] (laughs) Thank you,
I got it on sale.

950
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:03,959
- I like that answer.

951
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,125
That's the best thing
you said all fuckin' day.

952
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,959
That's the best thing
you said this whole time.

953
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:11,834
Listen, slow and
steady wins the race.

954
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:14,750
You're only
competing with yourself.

955
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,041
- [Taylor] Okay.

956
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,458
- Got it?

957
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:18,291
- [Taylor] Got it.

958
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,250
- Nobody else defines you.

959
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,583
Not me, not everybody watching,

960
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:24,000
not your mom, not the
fucking Kardashians, you.

961
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,458
- [Taylor] Got it.

962
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,000
- You can grind and
be patient for 10 years

963
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,166
every day and still be
nine years younger than me

964
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,500
and I would trade
places with you.

965
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,667
That's how amazing
having time on your side is.

966
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,417
- [Taylor] Yeah,
time's everything.

967
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,041
- So use it.

968
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,375
- [Taylor] I will.

969
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,291
- Good, see ya.

970
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,542
- [Taylor] Thank you
- You're welcome.

971
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,375
(sighs)

972
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,667
You keep asking questions,

973
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,125
I'll keep answering
them.

974
00:33:54,125 --> 00:00:00,000
