1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,431
- If I was 6'4" and ran like a gazelle

2
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:04,556
I'd play for the Jets
instead of owning them.

3
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:07,384
(laughing)

4
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:10,268
I really need everybody
to have that one sink in.

5
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:11,741
'Cause it's the most important one.

6
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:13,757
(soft, calm music)

7
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:15,810
You know like, when you're
driving and the cop-lights go on

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,410
and your fuckin' heart goes,

9
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,490
but then when the cop
drives by you're like, oof,

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,978
you feel real good and then you
start driving with two hands

11
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:24,851
and the speed limit for about four minutes

12
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:25,722
(laughing)

13
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:28,141
and then you go back to
being, like, ridiculous?

14
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,019
That's how people are living their lives.

15
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:30,852
Right?

16
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:32,723
Like, Grandma gets sick
or Mom has a cancer scare

17
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:33,850
or they get sick or something.

18
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,827
And then they get to start
caring about real shit.

19
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:39,320
Nobody's giving a fuck
about a supreme backpack

20
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,884
when your health isn't going anywhere.

21
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:43,404
(bells chiming)

22
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:44,734
And so, I just don't
understand why people are

23
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:47,023
living their lives like that.

24
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:49,471
And so, fucking gratitude.

25
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:53,237
We've got the whole game
misframed, everybody's confused.

26
00:00:53,237 --> 00:00:55,696
People talk about millions as like,

27
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:58,896
I've gotta make a million
as like an entry-point,

28
00:00:58,896 --> 00:00:59,997
and they don't even understand

29
00:00:59,997 --> 00:01:04,650
that 99% of people in America
don't make $400,000 a year.

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,056
Nobody

31
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:08,025
is putting on marathon-sneakers,

32
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,353
everybody wants to be a sprinter,

33
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:10,903
everybody wants it tomorrow.

34
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,950
A lot of people taking money
and instead of investing it

35
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,719
back into their business,

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,288
buying dumb shit.

37
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,382
And that's why I fuckin'
put scrutiny on everybody

38
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:20,200
who's trying to do courses

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,641
and pre-rolls trying to get you

40
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:24,175
to pay $4,000 for this
and $10,000 for that.

41
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:25,624
This shit is simple.

42
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:27,403
All the information is free.

43
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:31,692
There's a lot of people who'd
much rather pay somebody

44
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,034
to make them feel good
about why they're not doing.

45
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:37,010
Let me give you the secret
once and for all right here:

46
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:37,843
Work

47
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:39,817
A lot.

48
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:42,154
Everybody looks at the people that made it

49
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:44,586
and none of you looked
at how they got there.

50
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:45,634
Talk your truth.

51
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:47,931
Create a framework that
you can fuckin' follow.

52
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:49,382
Talk your reality.

53
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:50,635
Think about your fucking grandparents

54
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:51,916
they didn't have no internet.

55
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,602
They had to work the job and go to sleep.

56
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:55,954
The fact that you can
work your nine to five

57
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:57,635
to pay off your debt or pay your rent

58
00:01:57,635 --> 00:01:58,902
or take care of what you have to

59
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,636
and then you can take on your phone

60
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:02,603
and fuckin' work from 7:00
pm till two in the morning

61
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,491
that's a fuckin' blessing.

62
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,788
That's a fuckin' opportunity

63
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:08,726
and nobody can stop you
and nobody decides but us

64
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:09,840
it's fucking crazy.

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,091
Do you have the humility

66
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,242
to put in the fuckin' work?

67
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:14,075
Period.

68
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,441
Because the only people
listening to your excuses

69
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:19,509
or your bullshit are your
loser fuckin' friends.

70
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,733
My friends, let's just
get to the punchline,

71
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,261
nobody gives a fuck about your problems.

72
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,141
People sit in little
circles of four people,

73
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,461
everybody gassing each
other up to not do shit.

74
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:31,781
People complaining downstairs
wearing $213 shoes,

75
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:32,861
shut the fuck up.

76
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,158
(fast paced, rhythmic music)

77
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,523
Get perspective.

78
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,597
What the fuck do you think
is going on in the world?

79
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:40,093
Everybody's pointing at everybody
else without understanding

80
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,925
nobody's deploying empathy.

81
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:45,117
Here's what you don't get:
you fucking lack patience.

82
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:48,207
Too many of you talk about being
it but you're not living it

83
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:49,756
You know why you guys aren't patient?

84
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:52,934
'Cause you wanna win
already to fuckin' stick it

85
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:54,566
to your fuckin' parents.

86
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:58,570
I'm trying to become
your excuse, your shield,

87
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,236
your thing that you can point to

88
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:03,335
because if you trip and fall

89
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:05,607
you guys are worried about failing

90
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:07,703
and I'm trying to get you to point at me

91
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:09,527
and blame me that it didn't work

92
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,439
versus blaming yourself so
that it gives you the courage

93
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,719
to actually start doing shit.

94
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,303
But, you've gotta understand,

95
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:18,991
instead of sitting here and
dwelling and blaming them

96
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,327
you're in control of your own shit.

97
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,889
You got one fuck in that bat

98
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:25,424
do something with it.

99
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:27,618
Listen, some of you been
consuming this for a year or two

100
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:29,584
you watch those videos
on Instagram or YouTube

101
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,201
you watch my Blog or this
and that, listen to podcasts,

102
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,451
you get hyped,

103
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:37,495
and you're like, right, and
then you stop listening,

104
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:39,061
and you walk out into your real life,

105
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:40,375
and you go back to dumb shit.

106
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,967
You know how many people
sitting here still dwelling

107
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:44,047
about some dumb shit
that happened in 2011?

108
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:45,159
It's binary.

109
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,030
This whole thing.

110
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,637
Your fuckin' life is binary.

111
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:49,421
Let me tell you what you should focus on:

112
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,518
You need to do some shit you like.

113
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:55,155
If I could ever convince all
of you that your short-comings

114
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:58,390
and your detriments are your
strengths, you would win.

115
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,817
You guys wanna be selfless
and be good and give back?

116
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,416
Be selfish first and get your shit

117
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,056
to the place where you need to be.

118
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,199
The current state of political correctness

119
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,098
and how you should parent,
and how you should live,

120
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:11,674
and what age you should
get married at, like,

121
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:13,020
that's all bullshit.

122
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,968
(uplifting orchestral music)

123
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,611
There's only one story like yours.

124
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:19,482
I'm not scared of losing
'cause I don't allow

125
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,668
any of you to judge me.

126
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,210
Guys, you're only scared to
lose because you're worried

127
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,255
about what other people are gonna say.

128
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:28,347
My losses are my losses.

129
00:04:28,347 --> 00:00:00,000
(peaceful, slow music)
