00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,289
- All right, I'm bouncing,
I'm gonna give you guys

2
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:05,456
10 seconds to take a screen
shot to enter the contest.

3
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:12,766
That was sorta weird.

hate the Patriots.

9
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:37,751
Heading to two client
meetings here in Boston

10
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:40,369
and then heading to the airport, Logan,

11
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:44,194
and on our way to Sweden for two days,

12
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:46,533
with Babin here, which is exciting.

13
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:49,123
A little takeaway, something
interesting has emerged

14
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:51,165
over the last couple days.

15
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:55,655
Three or four people have
called me out for public debates

16
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,939
on subject matters, and I can't figure out

17
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:00,738
what the debate's about,
other than they're trying to

18
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:04,075
bait me and goad me into
giving them exposure

19
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:06,504
for whatever thing they're up to.

20
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:11,353
Which I weirdly respect in
that 3% gangster kind of thing,

21
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:15,285
but the truth always wins and
everything's on the record,

22
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,234
and all of this stuff happens publicly.

23
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,575
And your grandkids are
gonna make fun of you

24
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:22,075
for not doing the right thing.

25
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:25,961
I don't get it.

26
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,136
I understand if a Patriots
fan here in Boston

27
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:31,007
wanted to debate me about football,

28
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,243
but people are trying to
debate me about things

29
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:35,405
that I can't even create
any understanding about

30
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,605
what we're debating other
than they want more followers

31
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:39,767
from me to jump in.

32
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,600
- [Man] That's it.

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,411
- Which is amazing, I
appreciate it, I'm humbled.

34
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:47,225

don't even know who you are.

- Would I expect you to see us together?

00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:11,417
- What's your?

44
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,842

- Come on, Trout, I don't do logistics.

52
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:25,651
Vlog, this has been well-established,
I don't do logistics.

53
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:27,253
Babin, that's on you, by the way.

54
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:30,359
When DRock and Iris are here,
they help me with logistics.

55
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,169
I feel like you just
tag along for the ride.

56
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,585
What do you have to say
for yourself, Babin?

57
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:35,320
- Just add it to my list of fuck ups.

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,410
- Yeah, I don't do logistics.

59
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,218
I don't have to do everything around here.

60
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:40,958
I try to do everything,
it's not that I'm fancy,

61
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,608
I just don't fuckin' do logistics.

00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:43,872
I'm not gonna look at my fuckin' number,

63
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,833

00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,729

to go get some business.

00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:49,646
- I was doing some.
You were just,

67
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:52,189
you and Babin were sitting
in like a nicely lit lobby

68
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,393
just hanging out.

69
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,825

00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:55,658

00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:11,531
quiet a bit, obviously has
different dynamics than,

81
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,614
but I mean, shit, you guys know this.

82
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,109
If you guys care about the five
year macro of the business,

83
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,457
which you may or may not
care about being a human,

84
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:23,869
as an employee within the organization.

85
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,425
But for legacy purposes
and like, I'm sure you guys

86
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,262
have pride and are good human beings,

87
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:32,293
your company has to do
real shit in 2018 and 19,

88
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:34,649
or it gets real vulnerable, real fast.

89
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:38,435
You guys have to at all
cost, win on long form video

90
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,792
on Facebook, it can fundamentally change

91
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:42,220
your brand positioning.

92
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,497
You have to become religious about

93
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:44,608
understanding what that means

94
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,961
with or without us, you have to.

95
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,528
It's the under-priced
attention that can give you

96
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,647
a chance to reframe your brand,

97
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,104
to three to five
different significant sets

98
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:57,140
at the lowest possible
cost, in lieu of people

99
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,392
wanting to go check out fancy new places.

100
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:01,609
You're not gonna renovate
your entire place,

101
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,442
you know what I mean?

102
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,764
You're not gonna deploy the capital,

103
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:05,499
so they're gonna get real consideration,

104
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,235
just 'cause it's new.

105
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:10,393
You guys have to
disproportionately story tell,

106
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:14,297
you have to be 150 index,
not to take a big punch

107
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:17,547
in the mouth, so you better start fast.

108
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,607
- [Man] You can get some screen talk.

109
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,986
- [Man] Yeah, I really need
you to keep a copy of that.

110
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:28,819
I've haven't been traveling with him

111
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,379
that much recently so--

112
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:33,641
- What happened, am I losing a viewer?

113
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,474
- What?

114
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,564
- [Gary] Am I losing a viewer in your mom

115
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:36,785
'cause you're not on as much?

116
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:39,010
- Yeah, that's exactly right.

117
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,864
- Mama Schroeder, I promise you,

118
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,449
I will use Nate in more content,

119
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,530
'cause I'll do anything for ratings.

120
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,780
- (laughing) Let's go.

121
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,601
- Babin, no joke, that let's go--

122
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:53,604
- Let's go.

123
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:56,901
- I want you to re, I want,
send it to your clip it,

124
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:59,516
that will be in it, that little let's go,

125
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,298
I literally want that Nate let's go clip

126
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:03,508
to pop up randomly--

127
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:04,361
- Let's go.

128
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,951
- For like 11 straight vlogs in a row.

129
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,072
(Babin laughing)

130
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,310
Where it makes no sense, got it?

131
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,181
You'll pass that on to the team?

132
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:10,574
Good for you.

133
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:12,869
Well listen, you should go tend to that.

134
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:17,175
I have two really amazing,
two incredible women

135
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:20,258
that I work with, one from, one from,

136
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,981
who both reached out to
me as a mentor of like,

137
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:27,523
should I go do this, should I go do that.

138
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:29,112
And when I emailed you the other day,

139
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:31,938
I was in the second of those
two meetings in two days,

140
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:33,845
and I said, wait a minute, I remembered,

141
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:35,556
I kinda recalled from our call.

142
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:36,982
So I'd like to introduce you to them.

143
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:41,684
One is named, she was at,
now she's been in five years,

144
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:45,087
amazing, senior, kind
of like a real player.

145
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,260
And the other one is,
name is, she's younger.

146
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,741
Good, okay, well listen, it's a home run.

147
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,826
These two women are
gonna be winners in life,

148
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:55,268
they'd be blessed to
spend an hour with you,

149
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:56,771
half an hour with you, so do you want me

150
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,670
to do that on email or text?

151
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,259
You're not gonna be able to
use a lot of that content,

152
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,562
beep the shit out of it, but
I'm just introducing people

153
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,790
and it's gonna be wins for them and,

154
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,067
I'm not lookin' for anything in return.

155
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,995
Karma points to the fuckin' max.

156
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:10,984
Sure, in 19 years, could one
of them give me business?

157
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:14,772
Sure, more likely, in
16 years can one of them

158
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,571
take an hour meeting with Misha

159
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:19,893
'cause she wants to learn
something from them, probably.

160
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:22,343
But more importantly, the
fuckin' world doesn't lie.

161
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:23,872
You know there's a great
thing in basketball,

162
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:26,134
it says, ball don't lie.

163
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:27,517
You know, when there's a bullshit foul

164
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,728
and then the guy misses both free throws

165
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:30,404
and you're like, ball don't lie.

166
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:32,891
Rasheed Wallace used to always say,

167
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,785
I feel like world don't lie.

168
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:37,683
You do the right thing,
shit works out at the end.

169
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:40,502
I play under the fuckin'
thesis of world don't lie.

170
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:41,784
Just a, how long was that?

171
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:42,707
I'm gonna actually give you an exam,

172
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:44,243
I love it, this is gonna be a great clip.

173
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:45,491
How long was that goddamn call?

174
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,117
That call was two minutes.

175
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:49,016
In two minutes, one of the biggest CEOs

176
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,683
in the world, top 500 companies,

177
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,477
I'm introducing two young talents to them,

178
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:56,792
it's just gonna be a win.

179
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,009
I'm now out of the equation, two minutes

180
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:00,718
doing good love for three people.

181
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,162
Two people meeting one person separately,

182
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:05,743
who knows what happens
but world don't lie.

183
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:09,011
Do the right thing, expect
nothing in return and just,

184
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,579
in 19 years, six years,
four months from now.

185
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,772
I'm in some place, they're
like oh wanna do that.

186
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,448
By the way, let me tell
you why I wanna do that.

187
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:18,016
You did, da-da-da, fuckin'
do the right thing,

188
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,713
everybody's worried about themselves.

189
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:21,118
Best way to worry about yourselves

190
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:22,533
is to do for other people.

191
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,453
I know this sounds something like,

192
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:25,111
religious joint, fine.

193
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,928
And not reading the Bible
and knowing that stuff,

194
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:29,232
I don't know, but I promise you this.

195
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:32,436
It's practical as fuck, world don't lie.

196
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:34,724
Instagram, Instagram,
Instagram, Instagram, what up?

197
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:37,895
Big ups to all 1,700s of
you, damn that's crazy.

198
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:38,900
- That's so fast, Jesus.
- 2000 people in like

199
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,327
four seconds.

200
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,077
Bitcoin, you know, bought
my bitcoin in 2014,

201
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,050
have played with it a little bit.

202
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,891
Think there's so many
more experts than me,

203
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,414
hence why I haven't talked about it.

204
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,190
It's good to put this
in the vlog, actually.

205
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,012
The reason I haven't gotten
deep on cryptocurrency,

206
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:57,354
blockchain, ethereum, bitcoin, litecoin,

207
00:07:57,354 --> 00:08:00,628
is I don't feel like I
know as much as most people

208
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:02,321
and I don't like to talk about shit

209
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:04,878
when I don't know as much as other people.

210
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:05,875
I think there's better sources.

211
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,387
I have intuitions, I'm
marinading, I'm back at the lab,

212
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:11,842
a.k.a. my head, right now
trying to get educated.

213
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:15,439
Whether it's voice, whether
it's cryptocurrency,

214
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,482
whether it's a couple other things,

215
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:20,133
small business, marketing,
by the way, is a weird one.

216
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,147
I'm gonna take late
December, early January

217
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,285
to walk the beach a little bit and think.

218
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:26,810
And I'm gonna come out
guns a fuckin' blazing

219
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,342
like I always do in January,
and I promise you vlog,

220
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:33,212
promise you Instagram live, I will bring

221
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,974
straight fuckin' thunder
and pound it down your mouth

222
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:38,506
for free, when I get to it.

223
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,052
If you go straight and then right,

224
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,193
like kinda back on the highway,

225
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:42,721
or if I kept goin' straight, right?

226
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,621
- [Driver] Yeah I think if we

227
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:44,454
kept goin' straight--
- Yeah if we kept straight yep

228
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,539
take a right, right, yeah.

229
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:48,857
- [Driver] We can then come
up here on parallel street.

230
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:52,026
Beacon is comin' up, so I'm
assuming Com Ave is right.

231
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:52,859
Parallel to it.

232
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,734
- That's so funny, oh good job, Babin.

233
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,386
In my old stomping grounds, '94 to '98,

234
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,639
Gary V is a very different character.

235
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,472
Yeah, I know this area super well.

236
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,519
This is the train station, right.

237
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,352
- [Driver] Yeah it is, yeah.

238
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:07,486
- Oh, that's exactly right.

239
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:09,498
- [Driver] Beacon right there, Com Avenue.

240
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:12,208
- God I haven't been here in awhile.

241
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:16,903
Boy do I love Mass, and
do I hate the Patriots.

242
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:19,692
What an interesting like--

243
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,875
- [Man In Backseat] You
have a lot of excuses.

244
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,532
- I really do weirdly enough,
people don't even know.

245
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:25,081
But I love Boston,

246
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:28,452
and I really hate the
New England Patriots.

247
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,114
- [Man In Backseat]
How'd you find Mount Ida?

248
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,345
- They sent me a postcard in
the mail, I filled it out.

249
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:34,547
- [Man In Back Seat] Is that real?

250
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:35,540
Direct mail, it worked--

251
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,230
- Direct mail, it works. (laughing)

252
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,068
That's amazing actually,
the fact that I literally

253
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:42,598
picked my college on direct mail.

254
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:46,765
The target musta been like
bottom 1% rank in the class.

255
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:49,668
They literally--

256
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,645
- They had no insights to go off of.

257
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:54,842
- I feel like they were like,
the segmentation was like,

258
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:57,757
ridiculously punted school
for the last decade.

259
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:01,007
(upbeat, bouncy music)

260
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:04,139
What's that?

261
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:04,972
(cameraman muffled)

262
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:08,405
- Yeah, that's nice, let's do it.

263
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:09,690
- [Man] Never before.

264
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,523
- [Man With Camera] Cool.

265
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,481
- It was an honor, man.

266
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,482
Take care of yourself.

267
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:16,149
Built his own garages, you know.

268
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,504
Learned a lot, right?

269
00:10:19,504 --> 00:10:20,508
It's so crazy.

270
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:21,719
Nate, I tell you so much, right.

271
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,069
- Probably.

272
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:23,902
- But what do you really think?

273
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:25,095
It is kinda weird, right?

274
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,946
I like it, it's super cool.

275
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:28,874
It's super interesting.

276
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,504
Hey everybody, it is your favorite time.

277
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,435
Every vlog, that was a quick transition,

278
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:35,492
every time, the greatest superhero ever

279
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:36,752
has made his way to Boston.

280
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:38,842
Look at that shot.

281
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:40,236
Hold on, let me see this.

282
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,562
Hold on, I feel like I'm now good at this.

283
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:43,831
That shot's nice, right?

284
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:44,738
- [Babin] Very nice.

285
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:46,230
- [Gary] But how do you zoom in?

286
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,385
Oh I got it, I got it, don't,

287
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:48,288
don't touch.
- There you go.

288
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:49,121
Fair enough.

289
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:49,954
- This is nice.

290
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:52,396
Boston, good job, all right, here you go.

291
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:57,200
Favorite superhero ever,
by the way, I can't wait.

292
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,960
You think I sold a lot of sneakers, Nate?

293
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,009
You think there was a lot of K-Swiss sold?

294
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,713
When the action figure comes out--

295
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:05,529
- [Nate] We got an action figure?

296
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,624
- I think the Airport Gary action figure

297
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:11,624
Hasbro, Mattel, call me.

298
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,552
I think the action figure is real.

299
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:22,452
I'm telling you, the comments
are gonna roll in right now.

300
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:24,535
I think the action figure,

301
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:28,011
it is your favorite time
folks, I am headed to Sweden.

302
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:31,207
The greatest superhero
that you've ever seen

303
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,957
is now coming to be Airport Gary.

304
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:41,353
- Yeah I mean, that's
such a good question.

305
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:42,839
Good job, Babin, that's
something I don't see

306
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,904
Iris or DRock asking, a
little deeper explanation

307
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:49,718
for the origins of one of the
great superheros of all time.

308
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:52,166
Spiderman was bit by a spider,
Superman the metro thing,

309
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,749
I need to get cozy.

310
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:56,467
You know the key in airports for me

311
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:59,545
is it's like my home, I
get cozy, I get work done.

312
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:04,404
I get in that kind of like,
I'm like one with the airport.

313
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:05,819
And so I have to get real cozy.

314
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,766
Oh wait a minute, look at this, Babin.

315
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:09,652
We have like the same hat.

316
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:13,030
- I'm like Airport Tyler
all the time though.

317
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,216
- Oh you mean you're Airport Tyler

318
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,525
in real life at all times.

319
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,358
- Basically.

320
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:17,191
- But I have to wear other clothes

321
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:18,441
'cause I do something for a living.

322
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:20,191
- Exactly, that's it.

323
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:22,943
- I gotta get one with the airport.

324
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,421
So in this gear, I get real
cozy, I feel real calm,

325
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:27,593
I can just get my work done.

326
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:30,146
So, heading to Sweden,
looking forward to it.

327
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:31,827
Stockholm, stand up.

328
00:12:31,827 --> 00:00:00,000
(smooth, upbeat music)
