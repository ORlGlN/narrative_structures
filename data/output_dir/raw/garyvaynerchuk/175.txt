1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,542
- So basically, first
of all, I know I'm shit,

2
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:06,933
but I also know I'm special.

3
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:07,766
- Understood.

4
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:08,801
- So I just wanted to get
that out of the hopper.

5
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:09,968
- That's cool.

6
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,456
- You know how I got this meeting?

7
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,289
- I don't remember.

8
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:14,122
- Okay.

9
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:16,134
So basically, I own a
barter system in Canada.

10
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:17,115
- Yes.

11
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:18,285
- Canada's barter guy.

12
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,443
We met at Haste and Hustle, briefly.

13
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:20,365
- Yes, I remember.

14
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:21,198
- In St. Catherine's.

15
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:22,042
- Yes, I remember.

16
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:22,875
- And, basically

17
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:23,708
- I remember.

18
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,541
- You remember.

19
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:25,828
- Now I remember.

20
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:28,707
- Perfect, I just wanted
to get in front of you.

21
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:30,166
Obviously, there was
ton of noise after that.

22
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,369
You had told me in a video,
I have a video recorded

23
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,011
where you said, "yeah,
tweet me, I'll see it,

24
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,720
I believe in what you're
doing, you know I do."

25
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,748
I attempted to get in touch
with you, which is no big deal,

26
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,450
there's tons of stuff coming at you.

27
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,223
So I, basically, found another way,

28
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:44,961
cause I wasn't getting heard.

29
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,686
I happened to know a guy

30
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:50,031
who had the @Drock Instagram user name.

31
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:51,031
- Amazing.

32
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:52,049
- I don't know if you heard about this.

33
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:52,998
- I remember this part too.

34
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:54,559
I didn't know they were connected,

35
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,585
but I know that story too.

36
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:58,168
- I said I have to use a barter

37
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,929
- Yeah, you executed under thesis.

38
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:02,762
I love it.

39
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,510
- Exactly, so I got in touch with D Rock.

40
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,284
He had been attempting to username right

41
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,846
from some guy before and never got it,

42
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:11,019
but I happened to know this guy,

43
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:14,167
so I traded him a custom horse saddle

44
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,098
for his daughter who's in show jumping,

45
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:17,560
traded him a custom horse saddle,

46
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,056
through a TradeBank client of mine,

47
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:20,307
my barter system.

48
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:21,810
He was able to take the saddle,

49
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,267
I got the D Rock instagram user name.

50
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,289
I made the deal with D Rock.

51
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,115
He gave me the ask and here I am.

52
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:28,311
- Fucking love it.

53
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:29,144
- It's awesome, right.

54
00:01:29,144 --> 00:01:29,977
- Amazing.

55
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,777
- I used barter to get a
meeting to talk about barter.

56
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:33,072
- I love it.

57
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:35,501
Super meta and it worked out

58
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,868
way better for you this way

59
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:38,562
than if I would've just
replied to the tweet.

60
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:39,547
- It did.

61
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:40,380
- 100%.

62
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,929
- I'm happy, this like plays

63
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:43,035
right into my narrative.

64
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:44,530
- This is my biggest thesis, right?

65
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,697
Which is everybody like just gives up.

66
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:52,949
It's why I like barter so much.

67
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:55,432
It's a move that people don't have

68
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:56,781
in their repertoire.

69
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:57,781
- Exactly.

70
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,433
- It's lost.

71
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,831
It's how we all used to roll.

72
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,047
- Yeah.

73
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:06,241
- Chicken for hay, hay
for fucking a massage.

74
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:08,158
Rocks for fucking wire.

75
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:10,121
This is our currency.

76
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:10,954
- Exactly.

77
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:14,945
- I mean, I've always dreamed of building,

78
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:18,187
this is why I responded
so emphatically to you.

79
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:20,739
For a long time in the 90's,

80
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,416
my belief was the start up

81
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,140
that would make me buy the Jets,

82
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,212
was to build the barter Ebay.

83
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,285
- Right.

84
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:28,354
- You know?

85
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:29,187
- Yep.

86
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:30,164
- I still can't believe it, actually.

87
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:32,298
It's being scratched by
a lot of little things.

88
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:33,747
- Yeah, oh yeah.

89
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:35,436
- Um. I'm a fan.

90
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:36,870
So, anyway, what can I help you with

91
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,087
before we run out of time?

92
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:38,920
- Awesome.

93
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,026
Basically, I've been
doing this for 20 years.

94
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,073
- Bartering?

95
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:42,223
- Bartering.

96
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:43,056
- Why?

97
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:44,945
How did it start?

98
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,146
- It started with me
coming out of high school.

99
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:47,986
I was going to go into engineering.

100
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:50,456
I got started in sales
with an alarm company,

101
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:52,027
realized I could close and

102
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:54,214
just went straight to sales.

103
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:55,493
Met a guy who was

104
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,825
in the barter business in Toronto.

105
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,062
- The classic media barter business,

106
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,222
the one that's kind of sometimes dirty,

107
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,275
sometimes clean.

108
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:03,077
- No, totally retail bartering.

109
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:04,322
- Retail bartering.

110
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:05,262
What would that mean?

111
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:06,095
- That would mean like

112
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,571
small to medium sized business,

113
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,621
where it's all on a platform.

114
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:12,514
It's organized, called
barter business exchange

115
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:13,454
at the time, but it's called

116
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:14,549
TradeBank now.

117
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:15,382
- Right.

118
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:17,852
I would say I have 1,000 cases of wine

119
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:19,279
that I can't move at my store,

120
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,155
and somebody would say,

121
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:21,888
"I want that, I've got ..."

122
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:22,721
- Correct.

123
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:23,554
So I just did a deal with a winery,

124
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:24,387
in the Niagara region,

125
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:26,314
you know Niagara is quite ...

126
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:27,350
By the way, before I forget,

127
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,512
I brought you a ...

128
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:29,349
- Thank you.

129
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,182
Humphrey.

130
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:31,015
Yeah, I love it.

131
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,397
- So basically, I just helped this winery

132
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:33,656
trade off about a 100 grand worth of

133
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:35,194
long inventory, that was taking up space

134
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:36,299
in their warehouse.

135
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,209
They were gonna have to discount it like

136
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,808
50% to get rid of it.

137
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:39,867
- They got full value.

138
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,057
- They got full value
in their barter account,

139
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:43,711
we helped them construct a new building

140
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:46,241
and get advertising and
media in exchange, yes.

141
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,298
Made a whole bunch of clients

142
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:48,424
really, really happy in the meantime,

143
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:49,391
because they got it at Christmas time,

144
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:50,638
so we were able to get that out to our ...

145
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:52,489
- What percentage of the barter on the

146
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,012
TradeBank and all that
is that world a barter

147
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:57,110
that I understand much more,

148
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,564
which is you get full
value of your product,

149
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:00,568
you get media in return,

150
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:02,506
the people in the middle

151
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:03,752
are playing on both sides and are

152
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:07,419
making their margin
versus wine for markers?

153
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:10,067
- Or construction.

154
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,329
So, basically, the way we make money

155
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:13,422
is based on a transaction ...

156
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:14,587
- I totally get that.

157
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,839
I got it, I understand that.

158
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,272
That I understand.

159
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:21,940
How much of the ecosystem
is the established

160
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,227
media barter world that I know very well,

161
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:27,944
you know where people trading media

162
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:30,309
versus stuff for stuff

163
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:31,896
or services for services,

164
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,528
that don't include advertising?

165
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:35,681
- Well we do a lot of advertising too,

166
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:36,912
but not at the level you're talking about.

167
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,084
- Yes, I understand.

168
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:39,274
Just on your world, I'm just curious.

169
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:40,647
- We're a very small part of ...

170
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,919
- I understand.

171
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,701
- You can't find your business on barter.

172
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,859
- And do people still do a
lot of cash in your world.

173
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:48,823
- When I say cash, I mean U.S. dollars

174
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:49,968
or Canadian dollars, I don't mean

175
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:50,963
cash under the table.

176
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:51,852
- I understand.

177
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:52,685
- There is a lot of that too.

178
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,220
At TradeBank what we
do, is a small portion,

179
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,747
we basically promote that any business

180
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,352
should never barter more than three to ten

181
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,760
percent of their annual sales and that's

182
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,819
additional new business, incremental sales

183
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,025
on top of their regular
cash paying customer

184
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:06,408
business right now.

185
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:07,637
So, what we do, is we generate ...

186
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:09,380
- What's like a funny trade
that you've seen there?

187
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,223
- A funny trade?

188
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:11,056
- Yeah, give me like a historically

189
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,369
funny trade.

190
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,492
- Historically funny trade.

191
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:15,710
- Or just one that I would deem unusual

192
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,593
as somebody who doesn't
know the world as well.

193
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:21,874
- Well, it's very unusual
for people to say,

194
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:22,889
"I was able to..."

195
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:23,723
I'll give you one right now.

196
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,858
A Tupperware lady.

197
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,691
You heard of Tupperware?

198
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,524
- Yeah, of course.

199
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:27,635
- National brand. International brand.

200
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:28,902
So, we had a Tupperware lady

201
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:30,421
who was in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,

202
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:31,693
way out in Western Canada.

203
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:32,526
- Yeah, I know it.

204
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:34,042
- She wanted to renovate her home, right?

205
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,998
Well, she's gonna have to go cut a check

206
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:37,232
and pay money out of her pocket

207
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:39,273
or she can actually do the smart way

208
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,635
and trade Tupperware for construction.

209
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,776
So, we helped her sell about $60,000

210
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:46,160
worth of Tupperware, through Tupperware

211
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,947
e-gifts in exchange for the construction

212
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,852
of her new home and incentivizing

213
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:53,634
her down lines, like her
down line marketing team

214
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:55,927
to actually do more sales.

215
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:58,044
That's something that
people are blown away by.

216
00:05:58,044 --> 00:05:59,925
We do anything from
marketing to advertising,

217
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:01,374
to construction to retail,

218
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,507
to restaurants to wineries.

219
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:04,824
- I'm getting married this year

220
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,869
in December and we've
got the photographer,

221
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:09,218
the limo, suit rental,

222
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:10,572
all of that through TradeBank.

223
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:13,308
- Right. And what did
you give them in return?

224
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,449
- Working for John.

225
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,757
- Yeah, trade dollars.

226
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,041
- TradeBank currency.

227
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,874
- I see.

228
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,315
- TradeBank currency monetizes the system,

229
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,963
so what happens is like ...

230
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:24,181
- I totally understand.

231
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:25,377
- My passion is that there's so much

232
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:26,923
business waste out there.

233
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:28,828
- It's a highly profitable business

234
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,087
when you're the platform.

235
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:30,969
- Yes.

236
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:31,802
Oh, yes.

237
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:32,636
- It really is.

238
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:33,638
- It's not mainstream enough.

239
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:34,883
This is where I would come to you.

240
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:36,875
- 'Cause a lot of people
got dirty people in it.

241
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,951
- Exactly.

242
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:38,941
- Especially on the media side.

243
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:39,843
- Exactly.

244
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:40,943
It's got to be legitimized

245
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,391
and my passion is that there's

246
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:43,445
so many businesses out there that are

247
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,778
wasting away ...

248
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:48,172
- Considering we have so little time

249
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,235
and now that I'm grounded,

250
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:52,279
what do you think I can do for you?

251
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,476
You get to write the script.

252
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:54,309
What is it?

253
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:55,142
- This is my meeting I paid for,

254
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:57,598
what I want to do, is I'd love to be

255
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,578
on the Ask Gary V Show.

256
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:00,411
- Yes.

257
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:02,340
- As an expert in retail business barter

258
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,557
to train your people, the marketers,

259
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,357
how to train their clients how to

260
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:09,453
capitalize on their down time,

261
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:12,409
idle inventory, that sort of thing.

262
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:13,959
- Understood.

263
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,702
So, to answer that question,

264
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,042
much like the same reason

265
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,286
I don't give quotes on books.

266
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,836
The only people that are on Ask Gary V,

267
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:24,452
are people that I've really got some

268
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:27,965
deep knowledge of, because
I'm scared shitless.

269
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:28,826
- Totally get it.

270
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:30,283
- Scared shitless.

271
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,818
Compounded with the
fact that you are in an

272
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:33,956
industry that is far more scary to me

273
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:37,039
than a person on TV, or a songwriter,

274
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:39,521
or things of that nature.

275
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:40,909
The answer is it's not inconceivable.

276
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,004
I'm not against it.

277
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,020
- No, it's gonna take some time.

278
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,626
- I'm concerned that
I have to do real work

279
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:49,643
to get to the yes that I'm not so sold

280
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,892
I'm excited about doing.

281
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:51,828
- Right.

282
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:53,805
- So, help me crack that.

283
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,101
- Which I will do over time.

284
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,092
- Okay.

285
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,132
- No problem, I can make that happen.

286
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:00,132
- Let's work backwards for a minute.

287
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:04,151
Let me play it a different way.

288
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:09,402
Why not accomplish the same thing

289
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:10,883
without me being the gate keeper

290
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,972
that puts you on?

291
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:14,327
The speed in which it happens, right?

292
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,221
- Yeah.

293
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,054
Oh, yeah.

294
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:17,435
- That's the thing I always think about.

295
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:18,418
- Yeah.

296
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:22,368
- I became Inc and Fortune
and Wall Street Journal,

297
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,556
so that I didn't have to rely

298
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:26,026
on them putting me on.

299
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:27,028
The thing that I'm trying to do

300
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,338
for a lot of people ironically

301
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,863
is show them how to do it,

302
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:33,557
so that they're not then at the mercy

303
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,120
of me putting them on.

304
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,995
- Which is cool.

305
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,001
So the other question I had for you ...

306
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:37,946
- So I wonder, I'm trying to think

307
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,469
if like there's on that note,

308
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:40,590
I'm trying to think about how

309
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,423
I can help.

310
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:42,256
But keep going.

311
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,089
- The other question is,

312
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,657
you're one of the best, obviously,

313
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,160
at helping businesses reach a

314
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,009
business to consumer market,

315
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,070
in terms of digital media,

316
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,119
Have you worked with or do you ...

317
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:52,980
- B2B?

318
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,813
- Some B2B?

319
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:54,646
- A ton.

320
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:55,479
That's where I make a lot of my money.

321
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,312
I'm coming.

322
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:57,979
One minute, promise.

323
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,935
Yes, let me tell you
exactly how you do it.

324
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:05,596
You should start a weekly podcast

325
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:06,782
or are you doing a video podcast now

326
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:07,661
or like what are you doing?

327
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:08,494
- Not yet.

328
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:10,803
- You need a weekly minimum,

329
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:12,553
weekly minimum thing.

330
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,582
I think podcast is really good

331
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:17,487
for this space.

332
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:18,673
- You're pushing that for
yourself right now, yeah?

333
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:19,506
- I love it.

334
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:20,339
I just think it's good.

335
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,854
- So, LinkedIn is where I get most of my

336
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:22,865
business, B2B.

337
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:23,698
- Understood.

338
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:24,575
You're gonna love what I'm about to say.

339
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:25,469
- Okay.

340
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:27,101
- Whether it's video or audio,

341
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,752
the number one way for you to get people,

342
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:32,419
is to spend 100 to $1,000 a week

343
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:37,150
on Facebook ads, against the segmentation

344
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,964
that is called employees of.

345
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:43,291
So you can go to the 20 biggest

346
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,208
businesses in Ottawa, in Vancouver,

347
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,363
in Winnipeg, in Calgary

348
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:51,530
and Saskatchewan and run your content,

349
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:54,532
I would do it like this,

350
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:57,865
"Does your CEO know, does your CFO know"

351
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:00,855
like literally the video starts with,

352
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:02,266
"Does your CFO know ..."

353
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:06,245
and you target it and
you just do your thing,

354
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:09,674
word, video, audio on explaining why

355
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:12,841
and I would attack it right away with,

356
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:16,354
"I'm aware why some people

357
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:19,348
are unaware or cynical to barter.

358
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:20,703
Let me give you the history of it."

359
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,428
You'll need to get
maybe even more educated

360
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:23,321
than you are.

361
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:24,154
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:24,987
You know what I mean?

363
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:28,944
- Like, what really happened
in the 70's and 60's, right?

364
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,735
But Facebook ads against employees of

365
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:33,459
who then see it in their feed

366
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,854
and then forward it to their CFO.

367
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:36,987
It kills.

368
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:37,820
- It kills, yeah.

369
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,653
It kills.

370
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:41,222
- It's the secret sauce.

371
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,605
- Using the c market to
get to the B2B market.

372
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:46,351
Leverage them as your sales reps.

373
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:47,700
- By making the creative say,

374
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,014
"Does your CFO know?"

375
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:52,304
They're like, "Does my CFO got it?"

376
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,205
And then three of those 800 people,

377
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,669
have the courage to
forward it to their CFO.

378
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,256
CFO gets three emails on the same thing,

379
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,653
she watches.

380
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:00,718
- Oh, for sure.

381
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:01,648
100%.

382
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:02,481
- Got it?

383
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:03,314
- Yeah.

384
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:04,689
Okay, that's cool.

385
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,535
I had something else on my list.

386
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:07,397
Oh, one more thing I have on my list.

387
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:08,230
We might have to cut this,

388
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,063
this is kind of a private thing,

389
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:10,914
out of the show later,

390
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:12,044
if it ends up being on.

391
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,524
But, I have a friend of mine,

392
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:15,022
who is a pretty big business guy

393
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,533
in Niagara, he's launching

394
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,745
a brand new retail winery store,

395
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:19,752
right on the busiest highway,

396
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:21,473
right there in Niagara.

397
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,061
- But does it have to be state controlled?

398
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:24,129
- No.

399
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:24,962
- 'Cause that's how ...

400
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:26,240
In Canada?

401
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,193
- No, I don't believe it does.

402
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:29,624
They're actually opening
up a brand new winery,

403
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:32,506
then selling retail wine ...

404
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,089
- Where am I going?

405
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,005
- We have a meeting with ...

406
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:36,838
Cool.

407
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,255
One minute.

408
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:41,750
- We're looking, we're actually looking

409
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,639
for, if you'd be interested in exploring,

410
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,859
obviously not making a decision,

411
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:46,828
exploring the idea of owning

412
00:11:46,828 --> 00:11:49,634
or partly owning, what's going to be

413
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,274
a very large retail wine store,

414
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:52,946
right in the heart of Niagara.

415
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,166
- Send me all the information.

416
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,385
Let me put my lawyer, 'cause the legal

417
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:59,504
liquor laws in America are so convoluted,

418
00:11:59,504 --> 00:12:01,705
I want to make sure it doesn't fuck me up.

419
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:03,211
But thrilled to look at it.

420
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:04,044
- You would look at that?

421
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:04,877
- I would look at that.

422
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:05,710
- So, when you come to Toronto

423
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,626
in February, for GenerationNow, maybe

424
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,764
we can arrange something with that crew?

425
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:08,845
- I'm thrilled to explore that.

426
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,178
- Okay, the other thing was,

427
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,568
how do I stay in touch to ...

428
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,401
- Email.

429
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,234
- Email?

430
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,067
- Email.

431
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:17,900
- Alright.

432
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,733
- Thanks, boss.

433
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:19,566
- Pleasure.

434
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,684
Take care.

435
00:12:20,684 --> 00:00:00,000
(rock music)
