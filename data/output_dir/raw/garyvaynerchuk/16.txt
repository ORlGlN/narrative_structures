1
00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:03,094
(hip hop music)

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,005
- [Sportscaster] Stauskas will take!

3
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,102
It's hit!

4
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,620
Off the dribble!

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,320
He hits another!

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,640
Nik Stauskas with the heat check!

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,653
- How's it goin'?

8
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:23,486
- It's goin' good!

9
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:24,416
- Good, man.

10
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,249
- I appreciate you being with me, man.

11
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:26,210
- No worries man
- I'm a huge fan

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,043
- Thank you, man.

13
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:27,876
Thank you so much.

14
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:29,570
I'm excited about the
podcast we're about to do.

15
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,970
- Yeah, no I'm excited!
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.

16
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,070
So tell me about yourself.

17
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,410
I mean I know the Michigan part,

18
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,230
I know that your game, I know that.

19
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,063
- Yeah.

20
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:38,610
Born and raised in Toronto,

21
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,440
when I was 15 years old,

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,920
I kind of got to a point where

23
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,883
I was killing high school
basketball in Canada

24
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:45,716
- [Gary] Yeah.

25
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,210
- But at that point, Canada wasn't really

26
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,418
known for its basketball, so

27
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:51,660
I kinda took matters in my own hands

28
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,994
and decided I want to move
to the U.S. by myself.

29
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:56,034
Just started to go to prep school there

30
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:59,300
to get noticed by college
coaches or whatever.

31
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,690
So, when I was 15 I left home,

32
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,390
I left my parents and just kind of

33
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,330
- [Gary] They were okay with that?

34
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,960
- My mom definitely

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,793
- [Gary] Struggled

36
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:09,230
- She was like, didn't want me to go

37
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,000
'cause I wasn't ready
to go but I just knew

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,480
I was like, I wanted to play in the NBA,

39
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,360
I know this is what I needed to do.

40
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,590
It ended up working out.

41
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,640
I got a lot of scholarships,

42
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,473
ended up going to Michigan,

43
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:19,730
and then I did two years there,

44
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,890
got drafted and now,

45
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,381
it's my fourth year in the league.

46
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:24,910
I'm playing for the Nets now,

47
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,520
so

48
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,500
man it's been a crazy journey so far

49
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,320
and it's all gone so fast,

50
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,010
it feels like just yesterday I left home

51
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,490
and I started going to
prep school in the U.S.

52
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,130
And now, I'm 24 and in my fourth year

53
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,400
- [Gary] Like a vet!

54
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,233
- Crazy, right?

55
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,430
I just, that's the thing,

56
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,790
I feel like I just got drafted

57
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,410
and now I'm like about
the get my second contract

58
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,310
and all this different kind of stuff,

59
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,230
it's crazy how fast time flies, so

60
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,460
- [Gary] It's cool, man.

61
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,870
How'd you first get into my

62
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,320
how long have you known about my content?

63
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,430
- Maybe

64
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,340
about like a year and a half or so.

65
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,330
I had when I was in Philly,

66
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,450
my roommate at the time was like,

67
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,820
really into all your stuff and

68
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,370
often times, like whenever
he was into something

69
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,760
he would just send it my way.

70
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,010
He would always forward
me your Instagram stuff

71
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,970
or whatever.

72
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,818
And so, he sent me a couple
of pretty dope quotes

73
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:11,280
that you had and I was like,

74
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,170
I gotta check this guy out.

75
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,070
And then ever since then,
I've just been like,

76
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,120
all your YouTube videos

77
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,953
and stuff like that
(Gary laughs)

78
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:18,000
I've just kind of been on those ones.

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,833
- Thank you, man.

80
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,666
- Ever since I've was a kid,

81
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,440
I've always been huge on

82
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,810
- [Gary] Mindset?

83
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,830
- Just on,

84
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,350
motivational quotes and
inspirational stuff,

85
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,183
all that kind of stuff, like,

86
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:28,430
ever since I was 10,

87
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,782
I always read those Michael Jordan quotes,

88
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,450
'I missed nine thousand shots'.

89
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,283
- Yeah, exactly.

90
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,210
- You know those ones?
- Yeah.

91
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,490
- So,

92
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,390
yeah, it's cool for me
to be able to actually

93
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,884
sit down and talk with you because

94
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:39,717
- Thank you man.
- This is something that

95
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:40,590
really interests me.

96
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,054
In just like the mind,

97
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:45,093
on my Instagram, my thing under my

98
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,470
I don't know, whatever you
call it under your name

99
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,730
it says, when you master your mind,

100
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,847
you master your life.

101
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:50,680
- 100 percent.

102
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,736
- I've always believed that.

103
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:52,660
- I believe that too.
- So it interests me,

104
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,037
but it's so much easier said than done.

105
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:55,898
- 100 percent.

106
00:02:55,898 --> 00:02:57,110
'Cause you have so many variables that

107
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,410
you weren't in control of,

108
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,610
DNA, who your parents were,

109
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,150
where you grew up.

110
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,440
But then you get to a point where you have

111
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,500
more control than you think.

112
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,990
Too many people think that it's over,

113
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,349
but it's actually about who
you surround yourself with

114
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,004
and what you consume.

115
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:11,006
- Yeah.

116
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,233
That's true.

117
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,066
- Like,

118
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:13,899
the end.

119
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:15,178
We take it,

120
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,550
it's funny, people realize that

121
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,060
if you listen to a bunch
of hip hop music and

122
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,550
this that and the other
thing, live the culture,

123
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,710
you can have swag.

124
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,750
But people don't realize that
you can do the same thing

125
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,110
around being a winner.

126
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,130
- Yeah.

127
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,531
- Just surround yourself with winners,

128
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:31,010
and just get optimistic
instead of pessimistic.

129
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,155
It seems so simple,

130
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,770
you know it is, it's actually no different

131
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,850
than what you did.

132
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,600
You took a lot of fuckin' shots, man,

133
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,910
when you were 12 years old,

134
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,266
you shot a lot of basketballs.

135
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,099
- Yeah.

136
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:41,932
- And that mattered.

137
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:42,765
- Yeah.

138
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,860
- Like, yeah you were
gifted with the ability,

139
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,200
but the amount of people that
were gifted with the ability

140
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,921
is actually scary high!

141
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:51,210
It's the next part that matters.

142
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,580
So, to me, it's reps.

143
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,760
- Yeah.

144
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,260
- To me, being an entrepreneur,

145
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,860
my mindset was reps.

146
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,880
It just always where I was, and by 42,

147
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,364
I'm just in it now, you know?

148
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:02,460
And then the world
changes, you never know.

149
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,639
I was 34 years old before I ever made a

150
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,640
piece of content for the internet.

151
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,830
I never, you know what I mean?

152
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,060
It just never was

153
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,067
how I saw it playing out.

154
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:14,330
And now, it got even crazier because

155
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,065
entrepreneurs got popular.

156
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:16,898
- Yeah.

157
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:17,731
- You know?

158
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:20,010
Like, having athletes
and rappers hit me up

159
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,230
is just the funniest shit!

160
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,130
- It's funny to you?

161
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,046
- Amazingly funny.

162
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,688
I love it, I love it, right?

163
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:27,825
Growing up, I grew up in Jersey.

164
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,824
The Nets were in Jersey
when I was growing up.

165
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,060
Growing up and going to a Nets game and

166
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,130
having Chris Morris wave at me

167
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,732
would have been like, you know?

168
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:36,565
- Yeah.

169
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:37,944
- And so, it's the same old game and

170
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,690
that's the cool part.

171
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,790
We live in such an open world.

172
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,090
- For sure.

173
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,040
- That we can have,

174
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,550
one follow, one DM,

175
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,383
it's cool!

176
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:48,111
It's an amazing time to be alive.

177
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:48,944
- Yeah.

178
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:49,777
You know what's crazy, actually,

179
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:50,651
how

180
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:51,760
when I DM'ed you,

181
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,100
it was actually a bet,

182
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,210
from one of my friends.

183
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,290
- [Gary] What?!

184
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,130
- My friend, he's like a big fan of yours,

185
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,070
and your name just came up
in conversation one day.

186
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,529
And we were sitting on
the couch watching TV

187
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:04,983
and he was like, dude just go DM him and

188
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,323
I bet you $100 bucks he's gonna respond.

189
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,038
And I'm like, dude, Gary V's not

190
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:11,510
he probably gets a
thousand of these every day

191
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,610
but there's no way he's gonna read this.

192
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,110
And so we made the bet and we're like,

193
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,149
let's set a deadline

194
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,830
(laughs)
on when he's gonna reply by.

195
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,010
So he's like, three days.

196
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,180
He's gonna reply in three days.

197
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,260
So three days goes by, and

198
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,609
I looked, it didn't even say
open or seen or anything.

199
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:29,530
So I'm like, bro, there's no way.

200
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,900
He has way too many of these
messages coming at him,

201
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,733
he's not gonna see it.

202
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,430
And he's like, bro just
give it a little faith.

203
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,880
He's gonna reply at some point.

204
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,790
I gave up on him two weeks later,

205
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,116
you hit me up and you were like,

206
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:40,156
yo, thanks for the message.

207
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,690
Really appreciate the support.

208
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,520
Then he hooked me up
with Tyler right away,

209
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,910
I was like dude, that's crazy,

210
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,348
one DM, I just took a
shot out of nowhere and

211
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,850
- It's what I want everybody to do.

212
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,440
You can get to people.

213
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,365
- Yeah.

214
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,198
- You can get to people.

215
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:55,031
Not everybody,

216
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,360
I like people and want to meet people and

217
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,750
that's my personality.

218
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,583
And guess what?

219
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,990
There's other athletes and actresses

220
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,277
and models and skateboarders and

221
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,162
rappers that are like that too.

222
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:03,995
The end.

223
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:04,970
- Yeah.

224
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,291
- It's not about a status.

225
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,340
You know?

226
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,860
It's about a mindset.

227
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,693
- For sure.

228
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:11,526
- Back to that point, you know?

229
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:14,752
So how do you think about
your career and life and

230
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:18,600
what's crazy about athletes
as I've gotten to know them is

231
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,070
you guys are so young when you're done.

232
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,903
- Yeah.

233
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:21,736
- It's crazy.

234
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,130
- So, that's kind of one of the things

235
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,610
when I came in here, a
couple questions I had,

236
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,860
maybe that I want to get your take on.

237
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,690
So, I've listened to videos

238
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,490
where you just like, I love eating dirt.

239
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,323
- Yes.

240
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:35,156
- I love

241
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:37,369
being on the grind and whatever.

242
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,750
And that's cool, I love the grind too.

243
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,040
Like, for me, honestly, one
of the best parts of my job

244
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,930
is not even necessarily playing the games

245
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,030
during the season, but when the off season

246
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,970
comes around and I have like,
a five, six month period

247
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,660
where I can just evaluate
what do I need to work on.

248
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,670
And I just, I'm in the gym all day

249
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,530
every day, just working
on what I need to work on.

250
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,020
- How narrow or deep,

251
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,280
how wide or deep to you
go on what you work on

252
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,340
in an off season?

253
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,510
Do you pick a singular thing and go crazy?

254
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,310
'Cause you're playing
at the highest level.

255
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,143
- Yeah.

256
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:07,976
- So it's kind of like,

257
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:10,640
you may just want to work on
this one left handed thing.

258
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,558
- Well that's the thing,

259
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:14,170
I guess there's a lot of
different areas I work on,

260
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,270
like this in the summer,

261
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,240
I kind of break it up into
three different areas.

262
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,480
So I start my day on the court,

263
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,220
where I'll do an hour
and a half to two hours

264
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,053
on the court.

265
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:24,060
And in two hours, you can
hit a lot of different

266
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:26,090
- Moooves.

267
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,950
- Skills, like moves, finishes,

268
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,470
shots, whatever, dribbling, whatnot.

269
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,290
And then I really started
to get into Pilates

270
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,360
this summer.

271
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,193
- Flexibility.

272
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,110
- Flexibility, core strength,
all that kinda stuff.

273
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,424
And then there's weight training, like

274
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,680
whether that's upper body,
whether that's gaining

275
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,420
explosiveness, so there's
a lot of different areas

276
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,030
that I kind of divided up into but

277
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,933
those are three areas that
I'm hitting every day.

278
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,785
But, when you kind of said this,

279
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:52,030
when we're so young when we finish,

280
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,120
one of the questions
I had for you is like,

281
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,240
I love the grind in whatever,

282
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,619
but

283
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,870
how do you learn to be patient when

284
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,890
our careers are so short?

285
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,723
You know what I mean?

286
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:06,360
'Cause it's like

287
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,240
- So let's talk about that.

288
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
- So yeah, that's the thing

289
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,560
- I think about the
grind for entrepreneurs

290
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,160
where the career is not short.

291
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,993
- Yeah.

292
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,130
- So are you asking about being patient

293
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,940
within a basketball framework?

294
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,773
- Yeah, so like

295
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,090
- Or are you asking it in a life

296
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,011
and totalitarian standpoint, right?

297
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,810
- I guess more just the fact that like

298
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,643
so

299
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:28,476
- Or do you think it was like,

300
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:30,050
I have leverage while I'm a player,

301
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,860
what do I do with it?

302
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,409
- I think my question is more like,

303
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,079
how do I get the mindset of

304
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,240
so over my four year in the NBA,

305
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,220
I've grinded and grinded.

306
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,044
I've been eating dirt.

307
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:42,589
And though it hasn't been all bad,

308
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,640
there's been some success here and there,

309
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,092
it hasn't been the type of
success that I want it to be.

310
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,750
So, at the same time for me, like

311
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,120
over four years I look at it

312
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,953
and I'm like,

313
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:54,050
the average career in the league

314
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,020
is only four years!

315
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,015
People don't understand that most guys

316
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:58,120
only last four years and that's it.

317
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,150
- Most guys,

318
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,750
yeah, that's the average.

319
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,270
- That's the average.
- A lot of guys

320
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,640
- A lot of guys are only one or two years

321
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,473
and they're done,

322
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:07,250
so like, for me, I've made
it to the average so far.

323
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,900
But I have dreams of
playing 10 to 15 years,

324
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,370
as long as I can play.

325
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,370
But even with that, I'm like,

326
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,370
if I last 15 years I'm
already 25 percent done,

327
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,494
I don't have that much time.

328
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:21,500
- I don't think my patience game

329
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,640
works out in something like sports.

330
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,476
- Yeah.
- I think it's different.

331
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:26,573
- Yeah.

332
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:27,810
- I would be,

333
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,930
first of all, my whole
thing is macro patience

334
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,450
and micro speed.

335
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,920
So, macro patience I still,
even in an athlete's standpoint,

336
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,930
probably can buy into my patience,

337
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,200
but I would make it life, not basketball.

338
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,980
But if I wanted to be a
great basketball player,

339
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,840
and I was four years into my career,

340
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,480
and it hadn't happened yet,

341
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,140
I would probably spend every
single minute on my game.

342
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,973
- Yeah.

343
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:50,810
- Like I mean every one.

344
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,188
You might want to leave right now.

345
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:53,021
(laughs)

346
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:55,024
Brother, I'm being really frank with you.

347
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:56,837
If you're actually asking me,

348
00:09:56,837 --> 00:10:00,429
I would probably study film and work out

349
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,492
every single moment of the
next 24 months or your life.

350
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:06,931
No sitting on the couch with your buddy,

351
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,020
DM'ing me.

352
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,072
- Yeah.
- Zero.

353
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:09,905
- That's like

354
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:10,940
- Zero, by the way.

355
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,773
- Zero.

356
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:12,606
- I did it!

357
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:15,082
From 21 to 30, my life was zero.

358
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,284
Like straight up zero,
you have to understand.

359
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,700
I lived in Jersey, and
never came to New York City

360
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,860
to go out on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

361
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,693
And when I say ever

362
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:25,799
- Never, zero times.

363
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,980
That's crazy.

364
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,810
- So that's what's real though.

365
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,770
People don't understand,

366
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,890
greatness is about obsession.

367
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,120
Like, otherwise, wouldn't
everybody be fucking great?

368
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,953
- Yeah.

369
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:37,039
- So if you're year four,

370
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,380
and you're like, fuck, man,

371
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,880
I really don't want to regret this,

372
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,147
and I'd like to have

373
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:42,890
the course of my career to change,

374
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,649
I follow the sport enough to know,

375
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,120
then dude, you actually
have to go 100 percent.

376
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,566
Like, no friends, no girls,

377
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,980
basketball.

378
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,874
- Damn.

379
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:52,707
- That's the truth.

380
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:53,540
- Yeah, it's the truth, it's the truth.

381
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,572
- That's the truth,

382
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,610
that's actually eating dirt.

383
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,010
When I talk about eating dirt,

384
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,350
people are like, oh yeah I eat dirt,

385
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,183
I work hard!

386
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:02,490
That's working hard.

387
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,750
Eat dirt.

388
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,583
- Yeah.

389
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,493
Damn.

390
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,390
- That's what it is, man.

391
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,223
- So,

392
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:11,645
- And you know what's kinda cool is like,

393
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:14,130
in my opinion you're in
a sweet spot to try it.

394
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,410
My big thing for you right now is

395
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,120
kinda like, fuck it, try it!

396
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,953
Do it!

397
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,097
Do it for 18 months,
just see what happens.

398
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:19,930
- So

399
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,990
- What's really crazy
about your game though,

400
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,450
what fucks me up, is you can

401
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,450
you can do it,

402
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,650
everything can be perfect
and you could get hurt.

403
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,570
- Yeah.

404
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,070
- That just fucks with me so much.

405
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,370
- And you see it in the NBA this year,

406
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,240
even Chris the other day just

407
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,073
torn his

408
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:35,750
12 months he's gonna be out.

409
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,980
And it's like, it's just like
the harsh reality of the game.

410
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,813
- It's a harsh game.

411
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:41,330
But look, like anything in life,

412
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,771
being a professional athlete in America

413
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,337
that's pretty up there, bro.

414
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,090
- Oh I love

415
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,990
- I mean of course!

416
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,110
- It was my dream since I was a kid,

417
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,140
so I can't complain.

418
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,973
But like,

419
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:53,210
I guess another question I have is like,

420
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,413
how do you think I should

421
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:59,460
how should I go about evaluating
what I need to change?

422
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,160
In terms of my routine, 'cause like

423
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,993
to be honest,

424
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:05,520
it's to the point like, I've ate dirt.

425
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,299
I've ate dirt to the point where

426
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,779
they ban me from coming
back to the gym at night.

427
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,540
I just came here from practice,

428
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,160
and often times I go back home,

429
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,410
I go take a nap or whatever it is,

430
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,740
and I go back at night.

431
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,140
And it's gotten to
point where they're like

432
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,390
dude, you can't keep coming back.

433
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,850
It's not good for your body,

434
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,683
you need

435
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:22,870
at a certain point for
athletes you do need rest.

436
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,920
- So here's what I would do.

437
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,850
I would go look at as
many people as possible

438
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,110
that have mapped a similar career to you

439
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,620
and actually accelerated their career

440
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,980
in year five or six.

441
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,040
Like literally.

442
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,920
Have somebody, one of
your college buddies,

443
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,990
somebody that

444
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,160
a fan,

445
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,290
figure the fuck out

446
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,730
who the 29 guys who've had
the most similar path to you

447
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,010
in the last 10 years

448
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,960
and actually talk to every one of them.

449
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,100
DM them.
- Yeah.

450
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,370
- They're in the fraternity.

451
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,000
Definitely, definitely do that

452
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,650
and I definitely think you need a

453
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,980
I think you should really
consider hiring somebody.

454
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,510
- Okay.
- You know?

455
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,690
- Yeah.

456
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,550
- I don't know

457
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,670
sport well enough to know who
those basketball coaches are

458
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,760
and how they roll,

459
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,490
and what that is,

460
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,692
but that's potentially what it is.

461
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:11,789
You know?

462
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,040
- Yeah.

463
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,900
I guess that's

464
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,230
one of the most frustrating parts for me

465
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,430
is 'cause like, when I've
been on this journey,

466
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,520
especially over the four years,

467
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,265
I haven't seen the success
that I've wanted to see.

468
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:23,190
But everyone keeps

469
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,470
every coach that I've been

470
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,540
I've played for three different teams.

471
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,870
- I know.
- Every coach

472
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,410
and every team that I have,

473
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,680
everyone's like, you're gonna be okay,

474
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,970
you're on the right path.

475
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,570
Trust me, your hard work's gonna pay off.

476
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,089
But after four years of it,

477
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,747
certain parts of your
mind where you're like

478
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,980
are these people just telling
me what I want to hear?

479
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,810
- Here's what's up.

480
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,910
It doesn't matter.

481
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,743
- Yeah.

482
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:44,770
- Like what's the alternative?

483
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,380
- Yeah it's true, there is no alternative.

484
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,230
- Right, that's

485
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,767
see how simple that is, actually?

486
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:52,200
Doesn't matter if you're
getting gassed up.

487
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,033
- [Man] You have the 10 minutes to fill

488
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,000
just before we do the

489
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,860
- Toronto?

490
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,890
Okay.

491
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,370
Doesn't matter if dudes
are gassin' you up.

492
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,203
- Yeah.

493
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:01,843
- What's the alternative?

494
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,078
- I'm not quitting, so

495
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:03,911
- That's it.

496
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,069
It's binary.

497
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:07,190
I mean there's one middle ground,

498
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,680
which is you mail it in, right?

499
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,513
- Yeah.

500
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:11,120
- And then the league will tell
you that it's time to quit.

501
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,953
- Yeah.

502
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:12,877
- So you're quitting anyway, right?

503
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:13,710
- Exactly.

504
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,543
- So,

505
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,640
I just think things are
about the alternative, man.

506
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,720
People ask me shit all the time, I'm like,

507
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,490
I get real basic real fast, like,

508
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,750
and?

509
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:24,473
Right?

510
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:25,306
- Yeah.

511
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:26,480
- My answer to everything is "and?".

512
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,617
Are you gonna be mad at
people that were kind to you?

513
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:33,950
You know, it's not like they tricked you.

514
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,320
Like you know the score.

515
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,260
The big thing for athletes is sometimes

516
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,548
you need that moment, that break,

517
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:41,190
that moment, right?

518
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:45,090
Those two guys get hurt in the same game

519
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,780
and drop 17 in seven minutes and

520
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,810
I mean, that's just real
life, that's sports.

521
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,365
- Yeah, that's the reality.

522
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,421
There's obviously a lot of superstars

523
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:53,940
in every sport,

524
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,260
but it's crazy, especially in basketball.

525
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,450
A lot of guys get their
first opportunities

526
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,960
off of players getting hurt.

527
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,450
Players in front of them get hurt,

528
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,060
and they just step into a role.

529
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,590
People don't realize Draymond
Green on the Warriors,

530
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,976
that's kind of what happened to him.

531
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:06,809
- I'm aware.

532
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:07,642
- David Lee got hurt

533
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:08,710
- That's exactly what happened.

534
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,880
- He steps in,

535
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,532
Draymond Green becomes Draymond Green.

536
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:13,440
- Just needed the at-bat.

537
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,660
- Yeah, that's crazy.
- That's right.

538
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,760
Happens all the time, man.

539
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,593
- Yeah.

540
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,320
- That's exactly right.

541
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,080
That's exactly right, and that's it.

542
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,230
All you can do is

543
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,617
people always ask me, when
are you gonna buy the Jets?

544
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:26,890
I'm like, what if Woody
Johnson doesn't want to

545
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,723
sell it to you?

546
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:29,101
I'm like, I can't control that part.

547
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:29,934
- Yeah.

548
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,820
- It just becomes laser focus on

549
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,441
focusing on what you can control.

550
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:36,274
- Yeah.

551
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,240
- You can't control
the guy in front of you

552
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,730
getting traded or hurt or

553
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,320
falling in love and falling off,

554
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,460
there's a million things in life.

555
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,220
All you can do is do the exact same shit

556
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,209
that got you here.

557
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,260
- Yeah.

558
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,830
- You know.

559
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,663
- Sure.

560
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,220
- I would really really really

561
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,820
consider

562
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,980
reaching out to a couple
dudes that lived your life.

563
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,110
- Yeah.

564
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,943
- And they're out there.

565
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,812
- Yeah, I've had the pleasure actually of

566
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:04,527
so this year when I started in Philly,

567
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,667
I started the year in Philly,

568
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,498
we signed JJ Redick

569
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:10,590
do you know who JJ?

570
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,520
- Very well.

571
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,840
- So, and JJ was the guy that was like

572
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,673
similar,

573
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,506
very similar to me,

574
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,617
his first five years maybe in a week

575
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:19,280
I mean,

576
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,413
he was okay, he was decent but

577
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,933
- Not what he became.

578
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:25,030
- Not what he is now, and not how he was

579
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,940
performing at Duke.

580
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,870
In college, it was just like a drop off.

581
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,850
And it took him five years

582
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,683
- What was he saying?

583
00:16:30,683 --> 00:16:31,860
- And for me, he was like,

584
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,070
dude, trust me,

585
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,810
I've been in this league now for 10 years,

586
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,139
I can tell that you're gonna be fine.

587
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,768
- Honestly

588
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:39,190
- You're on the right path.

589
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,400
- Honestly, that's a big one,

590
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,666
'cause

591
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,365
I also know enough to know

592
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,610
from what I know about him,

593
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,690
and I know a lot of people
know him pretty well,

594
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,350
he's not in the business
of saying that to you.

595
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,210
- Yeah.

596
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,232
- He's a nice dude.

597
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:52,830
And I don't think he would say

598
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,497
He doesn't know.

599
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,082
So it goes both ways.

600
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:56,915
- Yeah.

601
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,960
- That's my whole thing
with love and hate.

602
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,050
Both are guessing.

603
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,380
- Yeah.

604
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,870
True.

605
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,201
- You can't even

606
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:07,329
some of the best players of all time

607
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,019
just sat the bench for
the last eight years,

608
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,010
it never happened.

609
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,843
- Yeah.

610
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:12,000
- That could be real.

611
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,833
- Yeah.

612
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,380
- But what you need to do is make sure

613
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,450
that if you get the right things,

614
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,650
the right coach, the right
team, the right moment

615
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,550
or the right opportunity

616
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,886
that you're in that spot.

617
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:24,071
'Cause that's the part
that will bother you.

618
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:26,499
If you got caught up in
the vortex of the machine

619
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,099
and just the wrong
teams at the wrong times

620
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,900
with the right people ahead of you,

621
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,590
you'll always be like, okay.

622
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:34,017
As you get older, you'll
be like, fuck man.

623
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,520
I did get to play in the
league which is bonkers.

624
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,740
But yeah, fuck, right?

625
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,573
- Yeah.

626
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:39,960
- But if you get the shot

627
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,900
and you get to play the
last 19 games of the year,

628
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,201
and you play like shit
'cause you didn't go there,

629
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:45,740
that will hurt.

630
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,573
- Yeah.

631
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:47,900
That's the thing,

632
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,733
especially when I got

633
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,720
I've gotten traded here to Brooklyn

634
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,553
and it's been tough,

635
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:52,560
we have a lot of guards on our team.

636
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,390
But the opportunities that I have gotten

637
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,546
I've played well

638
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:56,554
a lot of those games.

639
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:58,600
- Here's the good news,

640
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,750
the league's watching.

641
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,730
- I know the league's watching,

642
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,290
but then it's tough because
guys come back from injury

643
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,477
and then I kind of step back to that.

644
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:07,249
So it's more of a patience thing.

645
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:08,898
- Yeah but the way I look at that,

646
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:12,270
straight up, is look, there's
two things that happen there.

647
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,800
Things I can't control, guys came back,

648
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,880
coach decided,

649
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,230
and things I could control.

650
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:20,900
And I don't know enough detail
but I know you played well.

651
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,750
You know what's funny?

652
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,920
I just take blame for everything

653
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,760
in a good way.

654
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,593
- Yeah.

655
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:26,426
- Like I hear that,

656
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:28,890
and if I had the luxury of playing,

657
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,719
I'd be like, well I could
have dropped 35 in a quarter.

658
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,400
- That's the same attitude I take

659
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,233
- That's good.

660
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,156
- All my friends are
like, you played so well.

661
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,546
Well clearly I didn't do enough,

662
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:39,379
because

663
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:40,325
- I wouldn't dwell though.

664
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,760
- I know, I mean I try not to dwell on it

665
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,373
- You control what you control,

666
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,389
you know?

667
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,372
- Yeah.

668
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:47,970
- And by the way, sports is tricky.

669
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,890
In a microcosm, anybody
can play well or not well.

670
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,830
- Yeah.

671
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,663
For sure.

672
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:53,677
- You just gotta keep

673
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:56,180
the hardest part is keeping
your mental game up.

674
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,003
That's it.

675
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:58,836
- Yeah.

676
00:18:58,836 --> 00:18:59,669
- And it's the same thing for you

677
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,646
or all the kids that are
fuckin' in debt right now,

678
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:02,760
right?

679
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,593
What's the tough part?

680
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:04,426
Being in debt.

681
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:06,060
Still working, not getting a raise.

682
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,705
Getting past.

683
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,240
We could walk the floor right now.

684
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,450
Same thing they're thinking about,

685
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,390
why didn't I get that raise?

686
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,030
Why didn't I get promoted at Vayner?

687
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,868
I got this debt.

688
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:15,404
Fuck it, I'll go to this other.

689
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,492
It's the game for everybody.

690
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:18,325
- Yeah.

691
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,650
- Just different circumstances.

692
00:19:21,525 --> 00:00:00,000
(hip hop music)
