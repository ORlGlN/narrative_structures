I've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn is most of them don't</font>

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,750
because they pay Boehner McKinsey or

Cambridge group or Boston Consulting a

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,310
shitload of money for a small sample

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,949
size of data and they decided we're

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,690
targeting this female meanwhile you see

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,090
the chatter and conversation public free

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,579
data showing you that your brand is not

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,290
necessarily just to these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,020
all these people I'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget saks</font>

them back in 09 and they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,510
want it was that Cristal thing they

didn't want the customers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talking I'm like but third customers</font>

25
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,879
like it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> insane thing to decide</font>

26
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,640
which customers you want right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,680
owning the brand but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that becomes you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know you can be put in a very tough spot</font>

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,550
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize it you know to me</font>

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,099
it's it's getting the best day that you

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,840
have from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your retail partners if you're</font>

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,130
a brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out who's actually</font>

33
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,960
buying your product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then mapping it</font>

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,180
to where those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are and</font>

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,890
that date is tough to come by<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

36
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,360
think some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anecdotal from a</font>

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,640
strategy standpoint I don't think 50 to

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,040
70 year old men are on snapchat if they

39
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">are they're probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some</font>

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,080
gangster-ass right

41
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,470
but it so so I i think it's i also think

42
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,180
i want to say this I also think there

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,680
needs to be a purpose while you jump on

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,200
something we put brands on early

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,030
platforms we put General Electric on

46
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,830
buying the first day because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,380
strategy has earned media by GE getting

48
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,020
earned media of being a first mover in

49
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,790
that platform within the trade they're

50
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,160
attracting better talent so it depends

51
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,620
on what your KPIs you know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>
