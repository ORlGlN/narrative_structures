1
00:00:00,563 --> 00:00:02,301
- What up, vlog?

2
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:04,529
Just did a workout.

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,775
Anyway, one of the more
interesting jam sessions

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,200
I've had in a while is with
the uber-talented Big K.R.I.T.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,571
If you haven't listened
to his new double album,

6
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:16,326
go check it.

7
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,720
Hope you guys are doing super
well on this holiday weekend

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,609
and getting geared up
for that December crunch.

9
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,983
Check it, watch it, thank you
so much for being subscribed.

10
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:27,602
Actually, a lot of you aren't.

11
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:28,988
Subscribe now if you're not.

12
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,655
(hip hop music)

13
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:37,978
- [Big] Yo yo.

14
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:38,891
- [Gary] How are you?

15
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:39,832
- [Big] How are you doing, my brother?

16
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:40,665
- Real pleasure.
- Same to you.

17
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,498
- [Gary] How are you, my man?

18
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:42,331
- [Big] Doing good, doing good.

19
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,164
- Yeah, real pleasure.

20
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,408
Hey, how are you?

21
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:45,501
- Great, nice to meet you.

22
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,468
- Such a pleasure, how you doing?

23
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:47,481
- Doing great, man, doing great.

24
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,515
- Come on, sit sit sit, get comfortable.

25
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:50,857
What's up, man?

26
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:51,938
How you doing?

27
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:53,014
- Man, how are you?

28
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:53,847
Kari.
- Kari.

29
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:54,680
- Nice to meet you.
- Real pleasure, how are you?

30
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,513
- I'm good.
- Good.

31
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,704
How you doing, my man?

32
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:57,537
- [Man] What's up, what's going on?

33
00:00:57,537 --> 00:01:00,170
(mumbling)

34
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,239
- [Woman] Thank you.

35
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:03,085
(giggling)

36
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:04,030
- What's up, my man?

37
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,046
(mumbling)

38
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:06,370
We got WWF belts up here.

39
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,398
- How you doing?

40
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:08,441
Shawn Marshall pleasure to meet you.

41
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,361
- Gary Vaynerchuk, how are you?

42
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,376
- Pleasure to meet you, Gary.

43
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:11,411
- How are things?

44
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:12,409
(mumbling)

45
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:13,909
Thank you, my man.

46
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:17,171
This is the room.

47
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,157
- [Big] Yeah!

48
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:19,621
(laughing)

49
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,978
I was like, bro.

50
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:23,109
Ah, man, I respect it, bro.

51
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:25,026
- How you doing?
- I'm good, brother.

52
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:25,886
Excited.
- Good man.

53
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:26,719
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

54
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,671
I've been looking forward to it.

55
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,060
- [Big] Thank you, same for you.

56
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,308
- Yeah man, how's life?

57
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:31,141
- Great.

58
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:36,561
Obviously, uploading the
album, but just being back out

59
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,288
and moving around and seeing
people I ain't seen in years.

60
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:41,713
More like a family reunion kind of thing,

61
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:45,348
and everybody's grown
and changed and worked

62
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:47,456
through stuff, and it's
just like catching back up.

63
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:50,612
And it's like that man, glad
you're back, kind of thing.

64
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:52,979
- [Gary] It's a good feeling, right?

65
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,373
- Ah man, it's refreshing.

66
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:56,265
It's refreshing to be outta the studio

67
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:57,548
and just be living it.

68
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:58,902
(laughing)

69
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,502
- How long were you in the studio?

70
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:03,066
- [Big] I worked on it for
two hours, I mean two years.

71
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,674
Two years.
- Yeah, Jesus.

72
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:07,342
- I lived, I just lived that album.

73
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,911
And so, once it came, when I turned it in

74
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:13,664
and gave it to my man
(mumbling), it was hard

75
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:15,624
for me to let go of the fact
that I didn't have anything

76
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:16,716
to do at the moment.

77
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:17,680
'Cause I was so used to just--

78
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,646
- [Gary] It felt awkward, right?

79
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:19,694
- Definitely.

80
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:20,868
Calling him, like Brett,
what you need me to do.

81
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:22,252
Like Brett, you don't have any shit.

82
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:23,712
It's okay, bro.

83
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:24,973
It's good.

84
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:25,965
- [Gary] Where do you live?

85
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:27,095
- In Atlanta.

86
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:28,060
Yeah, I'm in Atlanta.

87
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,342
And yeah man, this is different.

88
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:32,832
This is fun.

89
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,882
- [Gary] Good for you.

90
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,071
- Yeah, brother, yeah.

91
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,038
- [Gary] How long are you in New York?

92
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:37,342
- We'll be around?

93
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:38,744
- [Man] Until Thursday.

94
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:39,731
- 'Til Thursday.

95
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,893
- [Gary] Got a lot of promotion
and all that kind of stuff.

96
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,054
- Making it happen.

97
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:43,762
(mumbling)

98
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,214
Yeah, but see, trying to eat better.

99
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:46,270
Not doing too much.

100
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,877
Lost some weight, I can make the runs

101
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:48,949
when I'm tripping.

102
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,028
- [Gary] I get it.

103
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:51,468
- I ain't, yeah, we can make the runs.

104
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:53,220
(laughing drowning out speakers)

105
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,405
Now, mind you, right, I
know you always on the move,

106
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:59,081
on the go, and so, brother, sleep.

107
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:00,562
Like how often (mumbling)?

108
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:02,453
- My man, sleep is important.

109
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:04,178
I'm not worried about how
many hours people sleep.

110
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:06,453
I'm worried about what they're
doing when they're awake.

111
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,620
I'm trying to get six, seven, eight hours.

112
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,978
The body is not joking around.

113
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:13,412
I got a little bit of a,
I was just complaining,

114
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:16,666
I'm going to Australia
next week for two days,

115
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,217
and I'm only sleeping two hours.

116
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:20,228
I don't know what my
assistant was thinking, but,

117
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:24,132
in general, but in general, in general,

118
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:28,685
I get scared when people
think the whole hustle mantra

119
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:31,304
that I like to push is about not sleep.

120
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:33,897
Because I'm trying to talk more about it,

121
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,998
that's why I have this good
line, like I'm not worried

122
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,402
about what you do when you're asleep,

123
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:40,136
I'm worried about what
you do when you're awake,

124
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,537
just so people get it.

125
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:45,165
But yeah, to me it's when you're awake.

126
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:49,082
It's those 18 hours that
really, really matter.

127
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,417
People are just wasting their at bat.

128
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,610
- [Big] Man!

129
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,661
Hey, I like that.

130
00:03:57,661 --> 00:04:00,240
You're on deck, you wait, you
try to get your opportunity

131
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,342
and you're too tired to
hit the goddamn ball.

132
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,532
- 100%, and then you prefer
to sit and dwell and complain.

133
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:09,328
People just come up with a
million reasons why not to do.

134
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:11,299
(laughing)

135
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:12,691
Right?

136
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:16,315
Do you know Prince worked as
a janitor for studio time?

137
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:17,803
Do you know that?

138
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:19,006
- [Big] Did not know that.

139
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:19,947
- [Man] Did not know that.

140
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:21,464
- That to me gets me fired the
fuck up because I don't know,

141
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:25,114
I assume you get plenty of
this, too, in DM and all this,

142
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:28,774
but obviously since, I
just get so many kids

143
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:32,023
who wanna be you, and they're like, a lot

144
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:35,070
of them don't have much, and I'm like,

145
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,690
work at Chick-fil-A, save
your money, go to the studio.

146
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,259
- [Big] Exactly.

147
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,793
- I don't know.

148
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,983
What do you want me to tell you?

149
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,423
- [Big] Or become a hybrid
and don't just do one thing

150
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:46,506
in your field.

151
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:48,368
- Well, that's that next, that's...

152
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:52,588
And then what's even crazier,
actually, is the shit

153
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:56,522
you can now do that doesn't
even need studio time.

154
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,630
It's just like.

155
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,351
It's not what you and
I grew up with, right?

156
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:02,534
I mean the technology's crazy,
do you know what this is?

157
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,867
- [Big] I know what you, a studio.

158
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,049
- This is a studio.

159
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,330
That's exactly what it is.

160
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,601
(laughing)

161
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,434
It's just suffocating out excuses.

162
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:12,606
- [Big] Oh my god!

163
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,527
- Right, right?

164
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:16,465
- [Big] Yo, you right.

165
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,045
- So, what's going on
with your guy's team?

166
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:20,429
Obviously, I know you guys
have enough context for us.

167
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,255
I've seen different outreaches.

168
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,154
We've talked, I've watched,
we've talked, listened.

169
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:27,902
Is there anything that over,
since we got time together,

170
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:30,829
is there anything that
stands out that I can answer,

171
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:31,932
I can help with?

172
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,082
Is there anything we can do?

173
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,375
And please, go ahead.

174
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,346
And as the person that
probably has the most context

175
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:37,984
on both sides, feel free.

176
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,474
- So, real quick, right--

177
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,760
- [Gary] You got some
new, cool shoes, huh?

178
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,995
- [Big] Oh, he's like oh, hey.

179
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:44,187
(laughing)

180
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:46,510
- No, real fast, though, when
I first started working here--

181
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,070
- I know exactly what you're about to say.

182
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,180
- He was just telling
me that that interview

183
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,518
we did messed up his
whole album, 'cause we had

184
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,458
to turn the volume down
to do the interview,

185
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,037
and they bounced the
album and it was too soft,

186
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,359
and everyone's like why is so soft?

187
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,406
I need to turn my headphones up.

188
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,980
- [Big] Everybody's
wondering why I dropped it.

189
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,951
K.R.I.T. Wuz Here and
it's so low in the car.

190
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:05,945
But when he walked in, we
pushed the master fader down

191
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:08,131
and so we could the album--

192
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:09,168
- [Gary] That's amazing.

193
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,456
- Bounce that shit, and I told
him, yo, you're the reason.

194
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:12,877
- [Gary] That's amazing.

195
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:13,939
That's amazing.
- I want everybody

196
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,099
in the world!

197
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,735
I believe in my music being
loud as shit, knocking.

198
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:19,216
Like uh!

199
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:21,816
You might be the reason why I
made the sub loud as shit now.

200
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,150
(laughing)

201
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,942
- [Gary] It's gotten a
inch louder 'cause of you.

202
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,300
- It's like yeah.

203
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,112
- The crazy thing is
that's like 2010, right?

204
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:30,405
And then he's like on
Def Jam, doing his thing,

205
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,415
and now he's off Def Jam, independent,

206
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:35,050
doing his thing independently,
and he's at this

207
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,437
cool position, I feel,
because in the year 2017,

208
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,539
he has all the fans, he
has all the attention.

209
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:41,924
He knows the value of attention.

210
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:44,281
He knows the value of shaking
hands and being face to face.

211
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,692
But he doesn't have a
label controlling him.

212
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,482
- Some people are just
naturally charismatic

213
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,000
and like people.

214
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,760
And that's the biggest fucking
advantage if you have that.

215
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,419
- [Big] Being human, yeah.

216
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,905
- And he's one of the smarter
musicians we've met with.

217
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:57,213
- [Big] Thank you.

218
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:58,422
- Musically.

219
00:06:58,422 --> 00:06:59,401
It's just the truth.

220
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:00,690
- He says that to everybody, don't worry.

221
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,291
(laughing drowning out speakers)

222
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,331
Just trying to help you here.

223
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:06,126
- [Big] You gonna get some calls.

224
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,538
- I'm gonna make a highlight
reel of every meeting we have.

225
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:08,814
It's just the same thing.

226
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,085
But, go ahead.
- For real.

227
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:13,156
I know you well enough to know.

228
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:14,489
From what angle?

229
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,064
'Cause your next follow up is gonna--

230
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:18,345
- Musically.

231
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:19,178
- Yes.

232
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,423
Musically.
- Famous jazz musician here

233
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:24,120
and listen to his album,
he's gonna be like wow!

234
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,339
You know what I mean?
- I understand.

235
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,172
- And also, lyrically--

236
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,362
- 'Cause I'm funny, as a
person that listens to music.

237
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:30,621
And this is the reason I love hip hop,

238
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:34,078
it's less about production
and music and beats.

239
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,196
It is.

240
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:37,423
It's so much more about the words.

241
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,655
- [Big] Yeah.

242
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:42,113
- I just resonate with it,
'cause I'm competitive,

243
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,106
I came up with not much.

244
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:48,273
To me, my media empire looks
a lot more like slinging disks

245
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:54,562
from the back of a truck and that's why I,

246
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:57,419
that's why I resonate with it.

247
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,100
So, every time, the music
parts always funny to me,

248
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,367
'cause I never wanna front,
and be like oh yeah yeah.

249
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,585
I don't really know.

250
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,085
I love Metro Boomin, like him.

251
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,474
But to understand his craft
versus somebody who writes,

252
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,683
there's a big disconnect for me.

253
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,382
I don't understand music...

254
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:18,386
I like what you--

255
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:19,732
- [Big] I respect that!

256
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,818
- That's just not what I do.

257
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:23,729
Like telling you how to make
sure every single eSports kid

258
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,070
on earth fucks with
you, that I understand.

259
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,950
Making sure that every
Latino 14-year-old guy fucks

260
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,347
with you so that in 10 years,
when they're the majority

261
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,857
of the US market, that I can tell you.

262
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:38,718
How to hack Singapore, to
when you go over there,

263
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,129
and you're the number
one, that I understand.

264
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,501
But understanding...

265
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:46,845
When people are like that bass,
I'm like, yeah, that bass.

266
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,256
I don't understand that.

267
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:52,083
I understand it, but
I don't understand it.

268
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,627
It doesn't go through me like that.

269
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:54,754
- Yeah.

270
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:56,521
I dig it, but I think, to some degree--

271
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,003
- [Gary] How 'bout why do you think that?

272
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,200
Did you grow up in a musical family?

273
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,143
- Ah man, as far as
being around my parents

274
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:04,319
and my grandmother and them
playing different music--

275
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:06,783
- [Gary] Always, it's always the answer.

276
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:10,466
- Obviously gospel and blues,
and my dad playing Scarface.

277
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,963
And I'm getting that from him.

278
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,705
And my mom is playing Whitney Houston.

279
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:16,607
So, I got all those things.

280
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:18,402
And then I sought out music on my own.

281
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:20,639
And then you talking
about old school records,

282
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,360
and people that I like, and
discovering Curtis Mayfield

283
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,152
and Bobby Womack, or Willie Hutch.

284
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:28,324
Then that's how I got the brand of--

285
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:30,055
- And what about, so that's classic.

286
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:32,980
And so what about new, when
you were, how old are you?

287
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,076
- [Big] I'm 31.

288
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,035
- You look good.

289
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:36,033
- [Big] Thank you, hey, I'm trying.

290
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,985
I grew the hair out.

291
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:37,970
- That's what helped you.

292
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,723
- [Big] I look younger now
then I did when I was 21.

293
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:42,077
- D Wade the other day, I
was watching Knicks games,

294
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:44,516
like oh, D Wade with a haircut looks good.

295
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,439
I like that, growing out the hair.

296
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,332
Right?

297
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:48,217
He looks younger.

298
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:49,217
I was like that's good for you.

299
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:50,316
- [Big] You're still good.

300
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:51,451
- Yeah, you're still good.

301
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:54,640
So, 31, so how about
when you were growing up,

302
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,243
who were the new guys?

303
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:58,118
Scarface is obviously more like--

304
00:09:58,118 --> 00:09:59,415
- [Big] Scarface, but no--

305
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:00,839
- But he was already
even a generation older.

306
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,812
- [Big] Talking 'bout
Pac, Biggie, UGK, Outkast,

307
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,630
Three 6 Mafia, probably (mumbling)--

308
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,954
- [Gary] Yeah, the whole LA
Reed Atlanta thing was just

309
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,023
so game changing.

310
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:08,895
- Yeah.

311
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:10,051
- [Gary] It was like
Motown all over again.

312
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:11,480
- It was crazy, man.

313
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,421
And obviously, talking about
Snoop and people like that.

314
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:15,555
- [Gary] Yeah, of course.

315
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:18,199
- But the beauty of
growing up in a small town,

316
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,050
'cause I'm from
Mississippi, in Mississippi,

317
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,116
is that radio played the top
10 records from everywhere.

318
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:25,199
But where I was from.

319
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,481
So, I got a good understand
of East Coast and West Coast

320
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:30,299
and what that feels like in tempos

321
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,719
and how that music sounded.

322
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:35,137
So when it came time to do
features and work with people,

323
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,707
I understood the science of
where they were coming from

324
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:38,998
and what made sense for people.

325
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:41,979
So, that was the benefit
of people not playing music

326
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,253
from where I was from.

327
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:45,208
- [Gary] So being
independent, the release here,

328
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,371
direct to consumer?

329
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:47,568
And then what?

330
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:48,961
- Man.

331
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:50,212
We keep pushing it.

332
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:51,373
- [Gary] Digital?

333
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:52,483
- Yeah, of course.

334
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:54,095
(speakers drowning each other out)

335
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:56,563
- [Man] And major artists are
showing a lot of support--

336
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:57,633
- [Gary] I saw.

337
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,795
- [Man] Really doing well.

338
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:01,152
- Go ahead, dude.
- Branding right?

339
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,179
- [Gary] Yeah.

340
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,547
- I spent so long, 'cause
I was always raised

341
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,133
as let someone else toot your horn.

342
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,362
You don't do it yourself.

343
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:09,390
- [Gary] Humility.

344
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,344
- Yeah, right.

345
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:11,298
And so--

346
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,289
- [Gary] And so, this new world.

347
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:15,410
- Yeah, and I run into a thing
where, and he gonna tell you

348
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,179
he's like brother, you
need to Tweet something.

349
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,157
You need to IG--

350
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,417
- [Gary] And it's not your natural state.

351
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,812
Let me tell you, as somebody
who goes the complete

352
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,812
other way, and peacocks.

353
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,650
(laughing)

354
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,004
It's probably the way you
feel about your music, man.

355
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,824
I feel so good about what
I'm saying, that I'm willing

356
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,956
to take the heat.

357
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:33,982
- Okay.

358
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:35,459
- [Gary] You know how many
people don't put out music

359
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:36,565
'cause they don't wanna take the heat?

360
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,706
Most of them.

361
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:38,744
- [Man] Most of 'em.

362
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:41,504
- [Gary] So, you need to
not talk when he wants

363
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,306
you to, 'cause it's smart strategy.

364
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,120
You need to find a way to when
you feel something to talk.

365
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,467
- Okay.

366
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,178
- Because if you, right?

367
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:51,487
If you can convert it in the
way you think about music,

368
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,502
the reason I'm putting
out so much shit is I got

369
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:54,766
something to say.

370
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:56,298
- [Big] I'm talking with you, man.

371
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,744
I'm talking with everybody in this room.

372
00:11:57,744 --> 00:11:59,421
That's easy.
- So, listen--

373
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:01,837
- [Big] Talking into that, it's like fuck.

374
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,932
- So maybe you take the
strategy that I took.

375
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,821
Listen, if you did a fucking
Instagram story right now

376
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,413
and said I'm taking an
intern to be my videographer,

377
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:11,786
I'm not gonna pay you shit,
and you get to follow me around

378
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:15,513
and make video, follow me and
make videos and put it out,

379
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:17,682
yeah, fucking 10,000
people raising their hand.

380
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:19,840
You know how many people
would rip their arm off

381
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,864
that love you more than life to do that?

382
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:24,258
And you'll be like, you're
learn and this and that,

383
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:25,649
you should do that.

384
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,138
I can see that you're
comfortable in this kind of,

385
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,153
I thought this was gonna be
the hardest thing I ever did

386
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:31,018
'cause I was like, two
years ago, when I decided

387
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,472
to film everything I did, I'm
like, that's some douchey-ass

388
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:36,964
shit, right, like I was like,
how am I gonna explain that?

389
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,270
You know?

390
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,687
But I just knew it was right.

391
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:44,896
And that's, listen, it's
all about putting players

392
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,510
in a position to succeed.

393
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,247
In music, in sports, in business.

394
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,841
When somebody wants to become a producer

395
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:53,950
'cause they just wanna be a
producer, but they're really

396
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,762
a writer, it gets fucked up.

397
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,234
You gotta do your thing.

398
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,754
If it's not your thing
to self start and Tweet

399
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:02,579
and put up on Instagram,
then build around you.

400
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,865
I'm too busy.

401
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:05,094
I'm running a big-ass company.

402
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,229
So, I need them following
me around and filming.

403
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:10,748
So, I surround myself with
people, just like you've got

404
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,123
people around you that can
do other things, you need

405
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:14,886
somebody collecting content.

406
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,328
You're doing a lot of interesting shit.

407
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,247
Do you know how fucking
amazing it would be right now

408
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,168
to put out a 47-minute
documentary on Facebook

409
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,451
of those two years.

410
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:25,331
Short haired K.R.I.T.

411
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:27,581
(laughing)

412
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:30,889
But you know?

413
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:31,882
- [Big] Yeah, yeah.

414
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:33,195
- All this magic lost in time.

415
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:35,955
Like in the world that I live in, my dome,

416
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:38,294
imagine all those videos
we could be watching

417
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:40,172
of when Pac and Biggie were friends.

418
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:41,615
- [Big] Oh, my god.

419
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:43,033
- You know how just fun this is.

420
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:46,084
My man, you and I are gonna
sit down and eat some food

421
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:48,805
in 13 years, and pull up
our phone, or whatever,

422
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,176
and watch this.

423
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,395
- [Big] Yeah.

424
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,455
When I still had the hair.

425
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:53,616
(laughing)

426
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,043
- That's amazing.

427
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,441
So, I call it documenting versus creating.

428
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:01,560
You're an artist, so I
imagine through your head,

429
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,016
when you're putting out a
Tweet, you're probably putting

430
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,174
that extra layer--

431
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:06,196
- [Big] Oh, my god.

432
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:07,615
(speakers drowning each other out)

433
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,742
Bro!

434
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:10,409
I done sent it to him
or sent it to my girl,

435
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:11,970
and been like, yo, can I say something?

436
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,995
Or is this okay?

437
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,037
I go through--

438
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:16,348
- Overthinking it from an artistic level.

439
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:17,656
- [Big] I can't help it.

440
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,743
- I respect that, and I
don't want you to help it,

441
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:23,357
but I wanna create a
framework that allows you

442
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:27,026
to put out, and by the
way, let me go on a real,

443
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:28,223
crazy left turn on you.

444
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:30,878
You're just gonna like having
this when you're an old man

445
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,956
because your kids are
gonna be able to watch it.

446
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,035
- [Man] It's real.

447
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:36,093
- Super real.

448
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:37,784
And I don't even wanna get
into the way I think about shit

449
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:39,517
which AI and virtual reality.

450
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:43,104
In the world that I live
in, my kids, my great,

451
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:45,104
great grandkids, long after
I'm gone are gonna sell

452
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:48,604
this meeting, sell it, as virtual reality,

453
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,383
and they're gonna be
actually sitting right there,

454
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,751
'cause they think you're
cool, 'cause they think

455
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:56,232
I'm cool 'cause I'm
their great grandpappy,

456
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:57,703
and they're gonna sell it.

457
00:14:57,703 --> 00:14:59,717
Yeah, it's crazy.

458
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:03,558
But I promise you, the guy
that drew Batman never thought

459
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:07,725
in 70 years there's gonna be
billion dollar movies made.

460
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:11,562
You can't project that far out.

461
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,562
But I can, a little bit.

462
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,084
A little bit, a little bit.

463
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,371
- [Big] You gotta go the distance.

464
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:20,691
- Documenting versus creating, K.R.I.T.

465
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:24,275
Anything that creates friction
for you, he already knows,

466
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:25,785
you're not gonna do it.

467
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:26,895
So, you're just gonna be.

468
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:27,728
So hack.

469
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,324
I think it's this.

470
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:32,609
I think you guys do some
sort of out, like one post,

471
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:36,120
and then people look at it, and be like,

472
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,219
interview three kids,
feel good about them,

473
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,815
make sure it's not just star
fucking and they're like.

474
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,748
That's what we do.

475
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:44,766
We get thousands of entries every time.

476
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:47,099
We gotta new person, we vet.

477
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:50,445
It will work for you, man.

478
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:52,442
Think about how much fun
it's gonna be for them.

479
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:54,701
Imagine you're a K.R.I.T.
fan, and now you're on tour.

480
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:58,816
Now, you're just film, like
you're living the dream.

481
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,436
- [Man] And we create those
experiences all the time.

482
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:02,137
- [Big] And we just don't--

483
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:04,103
- Every day, and there's interesting ones.

484
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:05,595
This is an unusual one.

485
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:09,195
Then there's on stage, then
there's another unusual one.

486
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:10,969
then there's the moment
where you're just walking

487
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,327
down the street and somebody
tells you this song did

488
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,448
this for them.

489
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:15,488
Captured.

490
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,080
And you decide to put that on Instagram

491
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,308
because you thought something.

492
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,914
And then you start getting used to it.

493
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:21,128
And then different shit.

494
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:22,238
And then you start creating.

495
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:25,208
Off the interaction, you
start looking at the camera,

496
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,322
making a point.

497
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,209
You start getting feedback.

498
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,269
Your social media grows 'cause of this.

499
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,400
And then people are leaving
comments, and you're getting

500
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,663
that feedback and it just...

501
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:34,795
Right?

502
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:35,988
It's counter punching.

503
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:37,376
You start reacting.

504
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:40,906
- It's been a difficult
thing and a challenge.

505
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,595
Even earlier on.

506
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:45,846
- [Gary] Did people think
you waited too long?

507
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:47,898
- No, on the low.

508
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:50,175
Oddly enough, I was scared.
- What do you think, Boyd?

509
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,445
- [Boyd] What do you mean?

510
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,278
For the album?
- For the album, yeah.

511
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,664
- [Gary] Two years is
like, in a world where

512
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:56,637
people are putting out mixed tapes.

513
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:58,099
- [Man] I can tell you that his fans were

514
00:16:58,099 --> 00:16:59,543
consistently asking--

515
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,165
- Yeah, it got to a point where pictures.

516
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:02,920
Don't post no pictures, even.

517
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,179
- We knew that our project
was coming so we knew

518
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,073
the music was coming, we
didn't post on purpose.

519
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:10,402
But it was a consistent ask.

520
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:12,046
Where you at, where you at, where you at.

521
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:13,727
So, yeah, definitely.

522
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,069
- And music changes so much.

523
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,048
- So fast.
- Two years.

524
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,496
- But the beauty of--

525
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,347
- That's always, to be
very frank, that's the shit

526
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:20,722
that always scares me.

527
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:23,710
'Cause you get crippled by that.

528
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,867
I'm older.

529
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,436
That Dre project.

530
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:28,496
That was like, took
for, it never happened.

531
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:31,452
(laughing)

532
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:32,650
It never happened.

533
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,685
- [Big] Yeah, it never happened.

534
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:36,318
- I was like, and this is
pre-Internet, back in the

535
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:38,126
early Internet, and I was
like when is it coming?

536
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:39,735
(laughing)

537
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:42,710
Went through all of, went through life.

538
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,032
Like one thing you know.

539
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,572
- [Big] Oh, my god.

540
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:47,642
- And to that point, man.

541
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:50,731
Some of the stuff that was
in your head two years ago,

542
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:52,336
shit does change quick.

543
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,471
- [Big] But it game me the
opportunity to do as much

544
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,042
as I wanted to to a song right now.

545
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,597
- Good for you.

546
00:17:58,597 --> 00:17:59,647
- [Big] No song's on that
album like oh, I wish

547
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:00,524
I woulda done that.

548
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:01,391
- Good.

549
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:02,391
You needed to do that.

550
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:03,908
- [Big] I needed it,
and both of the albums--

551
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:05,342
- And do you think that's
always how you're gonna need it

552
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:07,072
or do you think now that
you did it this way,

553
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,829
it gives you like, (sighing)
okay, did it that way once.

554
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,712
- No, I think now I can
create like this now.

555
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:16,300
Because the two years was figuring out how

556
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,754
to work with musicians, how
to get out of my comfort zone.

557
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:22,081
How to not record in my
house the whole time.

558
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,395
I get to go to other studios
to get creative criticism

559
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,841
and not take it so personally
that I don't wanna do

560
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,246
the song anymore.

561
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:29,317
(laughing)

562
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,504
So, I needed that.

563
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:32,642
And so now, going into the
next one is gonna be like

564
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:33,950
we weren't wrong.

565
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,620
And that's the first
thing that I realized.

566
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,179
Like man, we're at a time
when people are telling me

567
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,687
people don't wanna hear
that kinda shit, bro,

568
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,077
they just want a song for the radio.

569
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,539
And I'm like, brother, I got this record

570
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,892
that's about life and I wasn't wrong.

571
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:46,353
Like no, people are hurting.

572
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:47,919
It's a human thing.

573
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,048
Superheroes when we go
to work, but when we

574
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:51,999
by ourselves, we trying to figure it out,

575
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,188
and to put all that in my
album and to make music

576
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:55,994
like that is very necessary,
and there's a space for me.

577
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:57,375
- [Gary] Good for you, man.

578
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,368
- Yeah.

579
00:18:58,368 --> 00:18:59,743
- [Gary] As long as you
understand your process, man.

580
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:01,089
- I get it, now.

581
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:04,222
I'm happy making music,
and it's no restrictions.

582
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:06,103
And I'm independent,
which makes it easier.

583
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,387
- [Gary] Crazy cool, yeah.

584
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,913
- [Boyd] I was just
telling K.R.I.T. earlier,

585
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:11,599
I was listening to this song or that song

586
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,865
and it really touched me, and that's why,

587
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:15,263
to answer your question, too, an artist

588
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:18,166
like him doesn't get hurt
too hard waiting a long time

589
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,531
'cause the music is so real.

590
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:21,825
It's not like catchy or
vibey or of the moment.

591
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,346
His music is touching your heart.

592
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:26,591
- Instead of me rapping just
to be rapping so you learn

593
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,883
these words on...

594
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,294
(laughing)

595
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,294
- I'm on it.

596
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:33,238
Hell yeah, thank you, my man.

597
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,001
- It's basically me telling you

598
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,348
about my life in transparency.

599
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:41,367
Which is easier for me to do
that sometimes, and again,

600
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:44,183
like with the cameras,
music is my therapy.

601
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,219
And so, when I'm dropping these songs,

602
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,593
it's literally forgetting
that at the moment

603
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:50,681
that I wrote it I was
going through something

604
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,073
and putting that out there for the world,

605
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:54,259
hoping somebody relates.

606
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,495
- Are you thinking about
the thing that I'm?

607
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,865
A big thing in me in
advertising while we popped was

608
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,711
I think the market's always right.

609
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:05,162
And I mean 100%.

610
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,551
I've never sat in the moment of my career

611
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,104
in anything I've done, from
my dad's liquor business

612
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:11,834
to me being a public persona.

613
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:16,199
If it didn't work, they
were right, I was wrong.

614
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,421
And as I've spent a lot
more time with artists,

615
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,642
and I don't mean just hip hop artists,

616
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,901
I mean the 300 people in
my creative department,

617
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:26,901
my artists, the ego stops
them from the humility

618
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,285
that becomes their strength.

619
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:33,629
So, one thing I've been
really interested in is

620
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:36,512
the notion of sitting
and listening to albums.

621
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:38,345
And then understanding

622
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,970
they want one of the
songs to be the single.

623
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,320
Because it's the one that
wrote that meant the most.

624
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,752
I do it, too.

625
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:52,487
There's some shit I talk about.

626
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,320
Patience.

627
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:57,631
I want more than life for all
these 30 year old and unders

628
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,550
to have patience, 'cause they can win.

629
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,265
They can win if they're not short cutting.

630
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:04,598
True confidence.

631
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,249
Like why do you need things?

632
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:10,753
Oh, 'cause you're insecure
and you wanna get girls

633
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:13,060
with it or you wanna show
somebody that you made it.

634
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,739
That insecurity stops you
from really getting there.

635
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:17,121
Right?

636
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:18,734
So, there's things I'm passionate about.

637
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:20,996
So, when I make content
around that, I'm like

638
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:23,649
I hope this goes, and when
it doesn't, I'm fine with it.

639
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,902
I just collect it.

640
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:28,392
So, you're talking about
something with A Boogie

641
00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:30,319
that I thought was
interesting and something

642
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,190
I've been thinking a
lot about as we continue

643
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,807
to have these meetings, and
I'm trying to help bring value,

644
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,825
is the notion of the single.

645
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:38,272
So, this comes out.

646
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:42,054
I'm dying to know the
meetings of this crew

647
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:44,713
and definitely dying to know what's going

648
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:46,869
through your head for weeks
of like what's gonna be

649
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,646
the single, and I don't know if that's how

650
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:52,545
you think about it, but
damn, 90%, 95% or maybe 100%,

651
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,068
and definitely if you got a label.

652
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:55,004
- [Big] But we don't--

653
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:56,153
- I know you don't.

654
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:58,562
Definitely if you do, they're
picking what's the single.

655
00:21:58,562 --> 00:22:02,162
But even as an artist, I
still think everybody's got

656
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:03,277
a favorite child.

657
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:04,235
- [Big] Yeah.

658
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:05,316
(laughing)

659
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:06,149
- Go ahead.
- I don't know

660
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,548
if it's so much picking
the singles, more as,

661
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:11,164
yes, you have lead singles.

662
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:11,997
Absolutely.

663
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,372
- So, let's just start
with that for a minute.

664
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:16,490
I'm fascinated by that in the
environment we now live in.

665
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,747
That made a lot of sense
to me when radio play.

666
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:22,114
But that's, you know how some
shit just gets carried over

667
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:23,408
'cause that's the way it was?

668
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,343
- [Man] Right.

669
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,571
- This is not a final thought,
this is my brainstorm.

670
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:29,803
I think I know what the lead single is.

671
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:33,622
The ones that they told
us are the lead singles.

672
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:36,223
There's a way to harness
the reality of the market,

673
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:39,676
and you have to have pure
humility that does not come

674
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:42,926
natural to anybody in the field of art.

675
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:45,799
Go ahead, please.

676
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,600
- [Man] With his two singles, it was more,

677
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,683
from artistic standpoint.

678
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:52,527
- That was what he was
most passionate about.

679
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:53,967
- [Man] You following what I'm saying?

680
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:54,935
- Of course.

681
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,093
By the way, of course.

682
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:57,059
There's only one of two things.

683
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,927
There's the business
people saying this one,

684
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:01,038
'cause it's gonna sell shit,
and then there's the artist

685
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:03,370
or the artistic people
saying this is the one

686
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,431
that means the most.

687
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:05,316
I get that.

688
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:07,936
I'm about the third one
which is the fucking market.

689
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:09,127
- Right.

690
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:13,130
So now, we put those two
out as a launching pad,

691
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,983
but we put the project out on top of it,

692
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:19,930
so now, the market, like 1999 is a single

693
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,946
that's really coming back from the market.

694
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:23,002
- [Gary] I get it.

695
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,311
(speakers drowning each other out)

696
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:25,459
Of course I do.

697
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:28,111
- [Big] In itself, it
wasn't what we put out.

698
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:30,308
- And by the way, we all know that.

699
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,058
That's happened for years
for people's albums.

700
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:34,562
- [Big] But again, one
being independent, this is

701
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:37,184
the first time I was like bro
this need to be the first one.

702
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:38,332
- Mm-hmm.

703
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,431
(mumbling)

704
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,519
Yeah, you've been wanting
to scratch that itch.

705
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,536
Yeah, yeah.
- Board-room meeting

706
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,683
and they was like well, well we like--

707
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:47,014
- But that hook is gonna work on radio.

708
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:48,653
I get it.

709
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:49,918
I get it.

710
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:51,449
- [Big] And I know what
you talking about because--

711
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:52,627
- It's an interesting thing.

712
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:54,469
- The idea of being an independent artist

713
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:56,872
or when you underground and
you're trying to figure out,

714
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:58,944
your shit is jamming, and in your mind,

715
00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:00,928
and everybody's telling
you it's better than

716
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:02,704
what's on the radio but
you can't get on the radio.

717
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:05,905
Yeah, it's like damn,
but people be like man,

718
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:07,888
I hate that song, but they
find themselves listening

719
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:10,333
to it and knowing it
because it's on the radio.

720
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,762
I'm trying to figure out who
the hell is still wanting

721
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:13,850
this song played.

722
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,152
So, you got a point to something--

723
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:16,913
- There's something else
I've been thinking about.

724
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,614
I wanna throw at you since
the vibes I'm feeling.

725
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:20,592
This is something, you haven't
heard this one yet from me.

726
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,107
- [Big] Oh, let's go.

727
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,773
(laughing)

728
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:25,088
- I got one, I got one.

729
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,738
I got one that I've been
really, 'cause deep down,

730
00:24:26,738 --> 00:24:28,825
I wish I was a rapper,
and then shit would be

731
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:29,943
so much more fun.

732
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,495
I would be fucking.

733
00:24:31,495 --> 00:24:33,115
I just wish I knew how to flow.

734
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:35,281
I believe you.
- I got beats.

735
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:36,114
We'll get in the studio.
- I believe you.

736
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:37,949
I actually weirdly think I'm
gonna try to train myself

737
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:41,189
into figuring it out because I've got it

738
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,618
but I don't have it.

739
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:43,738
You know what I mean?

740
00:24:43,738 --> 00:24:45,493
Like I got it--

741
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:46,932
- [Big] It's here, but coming out--

742
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:48,873
- It's why I do what I do and it works,

743
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:51,433
and you see it, it's working in culture.

744
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:54,301
It's just not done through, anyway, this.

745
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:56,364
I'm dying to see your perspective on this.

746
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:58,219
I have a concept that I haven't seen.

747
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:01,174
Song comes out, album comes
out, project comes out.

748
00:25:01,174 --> 00:25:02,538
Something pops.

749
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:06,455
In movies, they come out
with number two quick.

750
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:13,162
You put out Guardians of
the Galaxy, you're like

751
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:14,221
what the fuck happened?

752
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,199
It blows up in the theater,
they're fucking in production

753
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,827
on number two from the bat.

754
00:25:17,827 --> 00:25:19,999
(speakers drowning each other out)

755
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:20,917
- [Man] Just like Fast and the Furious.

756
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:21,980
- [Big] Right after it.

757
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,348
- So, for me, again, back to lyrics.

758
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:27,846
You write a song, it's
about you're going through

759
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:30,283
with your girl, with your best friend,

760
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:33,114
with somebody sick in
your family, and it goes.

761
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:37,191
Well, it's been some time
in between you writing that

762
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:38,941
and now it happening.

763
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:44,225
To write the update and piggy
back off the momentum is

764
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:48,409
something I've never seen.

765
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:50,409
There's something there.

766
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:52,106
Song goes.

767
00:25:52,997 --> 00:25:54,470
It meant something.

768
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,966
You know a lot of stuff
goes that doesn't mean,

769
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:57,289
but it meant something.

770
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,384
The words.

771
00:25:58,384 --> 00:25:59,618
- [Man] So, quick question.

772
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:00,484
- Yes, sir.

773
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:01,649
- [Man] Would that not
be considered the remix?

774
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:03,545
- [Big] No, because remix
is other people's ideas

775
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:04,857
on top of your song.

776
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:06,217
- [Man] It could be your idea, too.

777
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:10,479
- The remix is some
form of a collaboration

778
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,657
that building of the
equity of the popularity.

779
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:14,965
What I'm referring to,
especially if you write--

780
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:16,806
- [Man] Oh, you're
saying a different song?

781
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:20,704
- A different, but literally
is like the name is

782
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,741
like The Follow Up or What Happened, or,

783
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:25,212
ready for this?

784
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:26,335
Ready for this?

785
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,819
Ready for this.
- Next week,

786
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:28,714
I'm gonna do that shit.
- I do believe that.

787
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:29,547
- [Big] That's right.

788
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,443
- I think, K.R.I.T., I
think right here, right now,

789
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:34,535
we're creating a genre
called What Happened, colon,

790
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:35,780
and the name of the song.

791
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,514
The Follow Up.

792
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,927
That's interesting artistically.

793
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:42,614
- [Big] It's also a little
dangerous, creatively, right?

794
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:43,814
- Go ahead.

795
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:44,910
(mumbling)

796
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,119
What's that?

797
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,475
- [Man] I think you did that,
three albums, like Reloaded,

798
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:50,945
Rewatched, she did that
like three albums--

799
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:54,368
- Yes, but I'm going, yeah, exactly.

800
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:55,922
I am, I am.

801
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:59,726
I'm saying, I'm saying, this is out 1999,

802
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:01,175
then you write 2000.

803
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:02,881
Or like something.

804
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:05,441
There's something, so what
people don't realize is

805
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:07,099
distribution's been commoditized.

806
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:10,099
The process that Michael Jackson had

807
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:12,979
to go through doesn't exist.

808
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,929
You put this project
out, and to your point,

809
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:18,033
something's popping, we're
getting feedback back.

810
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,878
Now, back to your point.

811
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:22,813
Artistically, if you can't
get the momentum to write

812
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:26,076
The Follow Up or The Update,
mazel tov, but if you can,

813
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:28,520
now you're breaking new ground.

814
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,770
I think for hip hop, it could become...

815
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:35,531
There used to not be
anything called the remix.

816
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,023
I'm old.

817
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:40,206
I grew up, there was no remix.

818
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:43,373
There isn't something called
The Follow Up or The Update,

819
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:45,209
but I think it could happen.

820
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:46,861
The speed in which you can do things,

821
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:50,503
that fucking excites,
because I'm in it for,

822
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,406
you have to understand
who I am as a listener,

823
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:53,810
I'm in it for the story.

824
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,903
- [Man] Right.

825
00:27:54,903 --> 00:27:56,182
So, yeah, that'd be dope.

826
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:57,311
- Right?

827
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:59,599
(speakers drowning each other out)

828
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,257
- [Big] But how do you
keep it genuine, though?

829
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:04,275
That's the key.

830
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:05,265
Because what's happens--

831
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:06,251
- You know what?

832
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,141
I'm not worried about you.

833
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:07,988
I'll tell you why.

834
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:11,396
Can I answer how you're
gonna keep it genuine?

835
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:12,390
You don't know any other options.

836
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,878
That's why you asked the question.

837
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:16,000
So honestly, if I was part
of this crew, I'd be like yo,

838
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,151
99's popping, or this song's
popping or that song's popping.

839
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:20,542
You got some?

840
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:23,478
First of all, when it's your crew or you,

841
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:24,832
you know your life.

842
00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:27,541
If nothing's happened since you wrote that

843
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:31,841
about the baby-mamma drama
or the grandpa or the city,

844
00:28:31,841 --> 00:28:33,289
well, there's nothing to talk about.

845
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:34,694
But if there is.

846
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,602
- [Big] Mm-kay.

847
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:38,125
- Right?

848
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,664
So, one thing you'll love,
it was the first thing

849
00:28:40,664 --> 00:28:42,645
I said to you, and this
is where I'm connecting

850
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:43,700
with you right now.

851
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,808
I've never said anything
I don't believe in

852
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,579
in my fucking life.

853
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:50,805
So, in a weird way, even
though I'm such a business man,

854
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:53,414
I have that one attachment with artists.

855
00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:56,177
I've never said a damn fucking
word I don't believe in.

856
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,949
There's been opportunities.

857
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:03,637
I could be making a lot of
money talking about some shit.

858
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:05,277
So, I get you.

859
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,944
But if there's something to say.

860
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:10,900
- [Man] Say it.

861
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,829
(laughing)

862
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:14,392
- And take advantage of
culture that we now live in

863
00:29:14,392 --> 00:29:16,399
because people have not
seen this white space

864
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,839
that I'm seeing.

865
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,839
- [Man] Hey!

866
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,049
- [Man] I got an idea.

867
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,097
- You do.

868
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:24,055
- [Man] I got the idea.

869
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,088
We'll talk about it.

870
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:26,021
- Okay, good.

871
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:26,891
(clapping)

872
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:27,724
Interesting, right?

873
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,130
You know why I love that
and why I pitched it to you?

874
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,200
Is 'cause I'm feeling your vibe.

875
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,117
That's art.

876
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:38,478
Because now you're inventing some shit.

877
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:40,702
Now you're going over
here and being like yo.

878
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:43,829
This is a whole new territory of thing,

879
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:47,603
and as for a writer,
that's incredible because

880
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:50,697
that flexibility to write,
back to what you said,

881
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:52,820
sat on this for two years
because I don't feel

882
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,556
like I have to go back and say I did it.

883
00:29:55,556 --> 00:29:58,892
But as you know, sometimes
when you're telling a story,

884
00:29:58,892 --> 00:30:00,219
there's an update.

885
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:01,530
- [Big] Always, yeah.

886
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,221
- And so to me, for a lot
of the stories I listen to,

887
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,915
every day, I'm like oh, what happened?

888
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:10,797
With that girl that broke your heart?

889
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:12,340
Or what happened?

890
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,192
Okay, it's been a year since
grandpa died and he was

891
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:16,558
your fucking North Star.

892
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:17,751
How you doing?

893
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:20,649
What about writing the fact
that you visited the cemetery?

894
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:21,855
What?

895
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:23,609
'Cause it's stories.

896
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:24,934
- [Man] Mm-hmm.

897
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:26,464
- There's something there.

898
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:29,214
To me, it's that, something pops,

899
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:32,974
and there's an actual story?

900
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:35,145
Get the fuck in the
studio and get that out.

901
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:37,359
I can see a tsunami.

902
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,660
- [Boyd] That's surprising to the fans.

903
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,884
- Yeah, that's--

904
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:41,076
- [Boyd] Giving them what they want.

905
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:41,940
- Yeah.

906
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,954
- [Gary] That is what they want.

907
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:47,308
- The connection of, as
far as people I've seen,

908
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:49,663
my life I talk about in my
music, and the understanding

909
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:50,734
of sorts, right.

910
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,834
- Well, that's why it would work for you.

911
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,846
You're not just talking
about going to club

912
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:56,356
and having fun, which is great.

913
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:59,123
When you're telling
stories, life didn't stop.

914
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,227
- [Big] It definitely didn't.

915
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,008
- And this story might've been finished.

916
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:05,196
But this story might be just starting.

917
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,992
And if that song went, and
you've got a couple more lines

918
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:13,221
to add to the equation,
you see where I'm going.

919
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:14,438
I see it.

920
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:15,495
I'm looking for you.

921
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:18,246
'Cause I'm looking deeply
through his glasses,

922
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:19,824
and I'm watching his eyes.

923
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:21,428
This is interesting shit.

924
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:22,564
I'm not fooling around here.

925
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,442
This is something different.

926
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:25,722
- [Boyd] That's fun.

927
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:27,777
I'm gonna tell you all
right, I like that a lot.

928
00:31:27,777 --> 00:31:29,010
- All right, go ahead.

929
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,951
Drink one.

930
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:30,965
Those things are like fucking $14.

931
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,050
(laughing)

932
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,036
Drink that Dirty Lemon.

933
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:34,333
What's up, my man?

934
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,740
- [Man] I was just saying,
he's a story teller.

935
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,715
- That's what it is, man.

936
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,577
- [Man] Exactly what you're
saying because if you came up

937
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:42,959
with a follow up, your
fans would be all in that.

938
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:44,103
You know what I'm saying?

939
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,218
(speakers drowning each other out)

940
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:46,672
- [Big] That's dope.

941
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,059
- [Man] That's crazy.

942
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,162
See, but now, we done put
it out there, and if people,

943
00:31:50,162 --> 00:31:51,382
somebody's gonna, that's already done.

944
00:31:51,382 --> 00:31:53,632
(mumbling)

945
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:59,095
- Honestly, that to me is the best part.

946
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:00,605
To your point.

947
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:02,531
I'm gonna put it out
because I don't want you

948
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:03,672
to have the pressure of that.

949
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,581
That's just what's fun.

950
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:05,739
That's the zeitgeist, but that's real.

951
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:08,176
And you have an advantage
in the way you communicate

952
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,502
to the point of some people write things

953
00:32:10,502 --> 00:32:13,310
and they're trying to go backwards
on saying some funny shit

954
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,453
to hope it pops.

955
00:32:15,453 --> 00:32:18,778
Put some great beat on it,
let me make up a fucking word

956
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:21,057
and see if it can go.

957
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:22,757
You're writing about your life.

958
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:23,909
- [Big] Yeah, man.

959
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,720
- And when you write about
your life, you've got

960
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,239
a big advantage for the model
that I've been sitting on

961
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,731
in my head.

962
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:31,296
- [Big] That's crazy, though.

963
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:33,070
- It's interesting, right?

964
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,673
- [Man] Ah, we gonna chop up after this.

965
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,231
(mumbling)

966
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:37,227
- [Big] For sure.

967
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:38,364
- [Man] Man.

968
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:40,111
I appreciate that.

969
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:42,255
(laughing drowning out speaker)

970
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:45,263
- [Big] As a creator, and
especially now, trying

971
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,204
to be inspired and figure out
a way to keep doing something.

972
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:50,125
- To me, I think the thing
that you're gonna get to is

973
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:53,011
you're gonna want to get to
probably where I am creatively

974
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:57,035
in marketing and communications,
which is after you get good

975
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,476
at your craft, after you scratched
a couple of those itches,

976
00:32:59,476 --> 00:33:01,396
you wanna start inventing shit.

977
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,896
And there's only so
many ways you can invent

978
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,916
within the box that you already know.

979
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:08,606
You're trying to scratch that itch.

980
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:11,990
I think that we haven't thought
about music dimensionally

981
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,350
enough to understand
what the new distribution

982
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,124
channels have awarded us.

983
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,767
That's why when I talk
about what I just said,

984
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,621
it's a big idea.

985
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:22,835
Because it's staying within the confines,

986
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,728
but it's creating new territory
that hasn't been there,

987
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:27,097
much like a remix.

988
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:29,415
Or like collaborations
with a country star.

989
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:31,238
Or an influencer.

990
00:33:31,238 --> 00:33:33,449
There's just new little things that could

991
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:34,568
never be done before.

992
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:36,772
Like the music video.

993
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:38,939
There wasn't that in 1972.

994
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:41,369
- [Big] And all of a sudden--

995
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,719
- Then there was.

996
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,035
Then it became the art.

997
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:45,128
Then there wasn't.

998
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:49,392
And to me, that's what's
so, but, when I know

999
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:53,559
somebody who's writing real
shit, that is super interesting.

1000
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:56,301
A project that took two years to come out.

1001
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,803
A song that resonates.

1002
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,756
A truth that there is a follow
up story, not fabricated,

1003
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:04,190
that you can get generated about.

1004
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,548
And then it comes out 11 days later

1005
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:08,370
and everybody's been feeling that song,

1006
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,907
and now you're telling what happened.

1007
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:11,610
You're feeding 'em.

1008
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,860
(laughing)

1009
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:18,074
- [Big] Wow, okay.

1010
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:19,688
- I betcha didn't think
that was coming today.

1011
00:34:19,688 --> 00:34:20,717
- [Big] Definitely no.

1012
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:22,273
(laughing)

1013
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:24,039
(speakers drowning each other out)

1014
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,157
- [Big] He was like go, like okay.

1015
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:26,661
I'm thinking to myself like studio time.

1016
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,563
(mumbling)

1017
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:29,549
- Bro.

1018
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,695
- My man.

1019
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,556
Oh yeah, let's get this pictures, too.

1020
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:33,389
Right.

1021
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:36,598
All right, going vertical on this one.

1022
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:38,007
Hope you guys enjoyed it.

1023
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:39,943
Hope you loved it.
