00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:32,943
- What up, what up, what up?

8
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:33,776
Good morning.

9
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:35,370
I'm lagging on a lives,

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,018
so trying to,

11
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:39,500
trying to up my game a
little bit on the lives.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,871
Oh, and this gets saved
now, and goes to stories,

13
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:44,332
so big shout out everybody if
you're watching my stories.

14
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:48,521
D-Rock's three year
anniversary at Vayner Media.

15
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:49,998
Happy birthday, D-Rock.

16
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:51,026
- [D-Rock] Thank you.

17
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:52,468
- Three.

18
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:54,326
How's yesterday's DailyVee?

19
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:55,239
Mainly about the USC football?

20
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,072
- [D-Rock] Yep.

21
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:56,905
- Dang right.

22
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:58,180
Straight up, for 90% of you,

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,287
this is the greatest year
of your life, right now.

24
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:01,374
Little bit of the call with Colin.

25
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:02,207
- [D-Rock] Yep.

26
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:03,213
- It's how you make it.

27
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:04,046
- [D-Rock] Are we in a rant?

28
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:05,510
- Are we in a rant?

29
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,879
Are you?

30
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,712
Fabricate it.
(muffled speaking)

31
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:10,015
If your shit's good right
now, quadruple down.

32
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,575
To me, I don't even think
about it as cold calling

33
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:15,599
I think of it as more of like
business development, right?

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,490
You know, it's like you're
introducing yourself.

35
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,112
And so, the word cold calling
speaks to just high volume

36
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:23,200
don't give a fuck.

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,033
To me it's strategic introduction.

38
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:30,318
Cold calling, strategic introductions.

39
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:31,548
Si.

40
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:33,180
I can brand this whole thing like si.

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,657
Like yes.

42
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:36,324
2017 flip challenge.

43
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:39,514
There's all money just
sitting in people's how,

44
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:40,636
people want money.

45
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:42,058
People are spending their lives

46
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,283
trying to figure out how to
raise $25,000 for a startup,

47
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:46,330
and they're sitting with $25,000

48
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,936
in fucking clothes, garbage.

49
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,931
Or, in hustle.

50
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,661
Like just driving around and midnight

51
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:54,001
and picking up people's free shit

52
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,915
that they put out on the curb.

53
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,401
I know it sounds dirty,

54
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:57,818
but I like dirty.

55
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:00,549
I'm into dirty.

56
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,896
Dirty's how you win.

57
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:05,899
Dirty's all you've got
when you got nothing.

58
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:07,605
Look, if you don't want dirty,

59
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:10,181
be lucky and be born into a trust fund.

60
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:11,235
You know?

61
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:12,113
Win the lotto.

62
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:13,762
But,

63
00:02:13,762 --> 00:02:16,305
when you're fucking dirty,
when you're coming from zero,

64
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:18,309
you gotta scrap.

65
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:22,476
Because complaining on your
social media or at the bar

66
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:25,504
ain't gonna get you shit.

67
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:26,337
Nothing.

68
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,606
Gusac.

69
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,066
Fucking zero.

70
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,506
(clicking)

71
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:33,540
Cool, what else could I do
here before I've got this call

72
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,090
in five minutes?

73
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,104
Dunc, the most boring DailyVee
ever because it's true.

74
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:38,937
(laughs) What?

75
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,628
I don't know which one that was.

76
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,437
You know what's crazy?

77
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:45,121
If I made $70,000 a year I'd be set.

78
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,085
I'd be real happy.

79
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:46,918
I don't need anything.

80
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:47,751
- [D-Rock] Yep.

81
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,786
- When you don't need anything,

82
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,329
when you don't expect
anything from others,

83
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:55,185
when you don't need anything,
when you love losing,

84
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:58,059
when you don't give a fuck
about what other people think,

85
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:01,083
you become fundamentally unbeatable.

86
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,252
And that's what I am.

87
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:04,462
I'm un-fucking-beatable

88
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:05,295
because

89
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:07,459
of humility,

90
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:09,974
empathy,

91
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:13,657
that's it man.

92
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:15,188
Fucking, it's cool.

93
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:16,421
Like, it's starting to be interesting

94
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,611
how I'm like starting to figure it out.

95
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:18,536
I'm like, oh, okay.

96
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:19,518
You can't beat me, what are you gonna do?

97
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:20,457
What are you gonna do?

98
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:21,816
What are you gonna say?

99
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:22,665
I like it.

100
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:24,255
I want more chips on my shoulder.

101
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:26,461
I like, why do you think
I love the Jets so much?

102
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:27,808
Like, it's true though.

103
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:28,641
- [D-Rock] Oh yeah?

104
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,186
- Two videos put out by (beep).

105
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,833
One shows the brand in
the first three seconds,

106
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,863
the other one is just much better

107
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,359
and people give a fuck.

108
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,716
That one will sell more (beep).

109
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:39,720
That's real life.

110
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,936
I understand.

111
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:41,769
I understand.

112
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,017
I understand.

113
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:43,978
That's fine.

114
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:48,145
And what we're pointing to is
common sense and real life,

115
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,953
and a world that trades on things

116
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:54,519
that aren't the metrics
that guide the spend.

117
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,246
And I'm not naive to think
that that's not a vulnerability

118
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:00,728
but we have to have a
point of view on this

119
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:05,061
that is gonna make us in
a 30 years macro correct.

120
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:08,266
Again, I think you guys
have heard this from me,

121
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:11,070
we will put the brand in
the first three seconds

122
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,207
in every video as long as (beep)

123
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,704
and (beep) know that we
think they're shitfaces

124
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,297
for making us do it.

125
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:19,130
The end.

126
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:24,717

Yo, yo, yo, email this

if you are a sneaker shop owner,

163

an owner of Instagram accounts,

164
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:50,037
or profiles that play in that arena.

165
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,050
Super grateful, driven by gratitude.

166
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,755
Actually, I need a driven
by gratitude t-shirt.

167
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,100
Right?

168
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,308
Tyler, can you fucking design that shit?

In the next hour?

00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:02,616
See ya.

172
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:04,294
Eddie, were you reading,
or were you watching?

173
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:05,732
- [Eddie] I was (drowned out
by talking over each other)

174
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,565
a little bit.

175
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,798
- [Gary] What was the vibes?

176
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:10,121
- Lot of shoes sizes cash in.

177
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:10,954
- [Gary] Yep.

178
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,466
- Lot of people pumped.

179
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:14,299
I mean,

180
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,132
- [Gary] Good vibes.

181
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:16,279
- A lot of people just
wanted to get on the phone.

182
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,112
(laughing)

183
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,090
Complaining about what's being
talked about on the phone.

184
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,359
- I think the best thing
that's happened to me

185
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,457
in running Vayner was
me coming to the company

186
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:24,071
and saying project
management should be out,

187
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:24,904
and then bringing it back.

188
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,980
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

189
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,897
- I think my genius is me accepting

190
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,147
that I'm a super naked emperor.

191
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:33,980
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

192
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,193
I think that's good.

193
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:36,384
- That's how you win.

194
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,217
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

195
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:38,050
- I don't think I'm a genius,

196
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,637
I think I just am always evolving.

197
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:40,470
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

198
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,275
- And I'm never bought into my own shit.

199
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:46,153
The signature creative
will be long form video

200
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:49,259
for the mobile device
on probably Facebook.

201
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,460
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

202
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,109
- That's the proper statement.

203
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:52,942
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

204
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,072
- Like in 48 months,

205
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:59,008
if it's Snapchat, if it's
Red Shoe, if it's MySpace

206
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:00,317
has come back, I don't know.

207
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:01,150
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

208
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,131
- I don't really care.

209
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:02,964
- [Interviewer] Right.

210
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,275
- It's the internet.

211
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,440
- [Interviewer] But it's
not gonna be a 30 second--

212
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,027
- But it's not gonna be a 30 second spot.

213
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:07,860
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

214
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,693
- [Gary] It's impossible.

215
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:09,526
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

216
00:07:09,526 --> 00:07:10,948
- [Gary] And that's a big sea change.

217
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:12,066
- Yeah, sure.

218
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,173
- [Gary] That's a trillion
dollar sea change.

219
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:15,177
- Yeah.

220
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:16,010
Yeah.

221
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,205
- Because when you compound
all the digital marketing

222
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,062
that ladders up to the 30 second spot,

223
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:23,443
it's not a,

224
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,507
it's not just the money
poured into a commercial.

225
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,340
- [Interviewer] Sure.

226
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,409
- It's the impact on everything.

227
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,479
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

228
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,170
- It's the glue that holds down
every brand's communication.

229
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,168
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

230
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:37,666
- It is the piece.

231
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,243
When that breaks, all hell breaks loose.

248

- How are you?

249
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,836
You might've even saw
it before you even came.

250
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,919
I believe in it the most.

251
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,817
There's nothing you're gonna learn here

252
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:14,684
that trumps becoming
friends with Madelana,

253
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:18,292
or Matt Sitimer, it's just inconceivable.

254
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,418
The end.

255
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:21,078
You should really,
(laughing)

256
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,681
literally, fundamentally you should.

257
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:26,056
You may introverted, or quiet,
like I don't know you, right?

258
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:28,424
But whatever you can do.

259
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,200
And I think the right thing to do

260
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,367
is try to bring value too.

261
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,391
Like, hey, I know I'm on
the inside strategy team,

262
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,618
but hey creative, you know, Sally,

263
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,234
like is there anything I can do for you?

264
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:43,451
And it's more not like you
should be working 28 hours,

265
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:46,411
it's like, if you're gonna,
like, here's the thing.

266
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,605
If you're gonna stay to
show that you're a hustler,

267
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:49,438
think you wanna work here.

268
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:50,553
After this.

269
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:51,950
And you're like, okay, good way to do it,

270
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,343
I know Gary's spiel, and like
I'm gonna stay here 'til nine.

271
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:57,770
That's gonna be like, they're gonna see.

272
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,816
Which would be a strategy.

273
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,958
It'd be really smart if you
did something of meaning

274
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,527
towards a relationship in that four hours.

275
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,661
Work for the sake of work,
you know what I mean?

276
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:09,323
It does speak to hard work and effortless,

277
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:11,386
and I think a lot of the
things I've done in my career

278
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:13,547
were not smart, but I just willed 'em

279
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,903
through sheer volume and effort.

280
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:19,804
But, what is so much
cooler is breaking shit

281
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:21,244
through relationships.

282
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:25,455
Like if you work on your
required account thing

283
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:28,825
from nine to six, it would
probably less scrutinized

284
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:31,933
if you were helping somebody in production

285
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,539
from eight to 10.

286
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,688
It may be scrutinized.

287
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:37,300
I mean, most of the
company still falls, like,

288
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,621
when you're an employee of
a company you're like, well,

289
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,838
this is our rule, like I would get that.

290
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,922
But it's that's interesting.

291
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:45,082
Or just like, hanging out with each other.

292
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:47,758
The relationships are,
they only are a why.

293
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:49,126
It just they are.

294
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:52,668
The skillsets are gonna change too much.

295
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:53,618
Right?

296
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:54,883
The skillsets are gonna change.

297
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:58,217
The principles are tried and true.

298
00:09:58,217 --> 00:10:00,233

Your work ethic is your work ethic.

300
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:04,186
