of vaynor yep in the u.s. we have I

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">think people understood it as a social</font>

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,250
shop when yes started out I do percent

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,479
but I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed with the team</font>

30

<font color="#E5E5E5">that I met there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">London team that you've got here because</font>

32
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,830
the scope is broadened yeah not and so

33
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,869
what it as a proposition to London and

34
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,930
as an agency what are you bringing here

35
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,939
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in our core</font>

36
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,110
were were reverse engineers who care

37
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,960
about attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,350
the proper story to create a result once

39
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,229
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that attention yeah so you know</font>

40
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,170
I you know I think currently and you can

41
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,759
see with the kind of body language that

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,590
I bring to this statement currently

43
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,899
we're positioned as a social first

44
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,670
digital shop I mean at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

45
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,509
day we want to execute strategies and

46
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,460
creative execution and paid

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,920
amplification in places that we think

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,469
actually help whomever we work with

49
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,630
whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non-profit trying to</font>

50
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,460
raise money or that's a sporting team

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,490
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell tickets whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

52
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,960
you know beverage trying to sell in

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,520
vending machines and see stores and

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tesco we want to help people spend their</font>

55
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,780
money in a place

56
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,610
we think is a valuable place to spend

57
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,290
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> money and there are so many places</font>

58
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,940
that we think clients are spending that

59
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,040
are not as valuable yeah whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,160
programmatic banner whether that be

61
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,150
television we think that there's some

62
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,980
places I just instinctively<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you</font>

63
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,680
you're analyzing its instinct its

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,110
instinctively at first yeah and then

65
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,330
it's normally proven through actual

66
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,510
sales you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I come from a retail</font>

67
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,420
background so as I've gotten into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

68
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,209
agency<font color="#CCCCCC"> and creative world I've found</font>

69
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:44,980
that I have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> big advantage because</font>

70
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,040
my instincts are to actually sell

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,370
something yeah and that helps versus

72
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,820
headlines and awards and reporting yeah

73
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,340
and just basic media metrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

74
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,959
not just buying really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't break</font>

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">me right saying is that so you're</font>

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenged people are obsessed with with</font>

77
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,860
yeah we don't debate the quality of an

78
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,250
impression hmm and so yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean as</font>

79
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,930
I've become educated over the last seven

80
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">years but more specifically last five on</font>

81
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,060
what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here hmm but you know</font>

82
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,920
who those characters are all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these these</font>

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,720
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of names I've become fascinated by</font>

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,190
the lack of practicality and

85
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,290
practitioner ship in the collective

86
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,470
agency and client side now by the way

87
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,209
there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things that people do</font>

88
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,459
that for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe in real life</font>

89
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,100
activations I believe if done right it's

90
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">incredible to activate at Bonnaroo or</font>

91
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,600
Coachella<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the world come I think</font>

92
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,560
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of places to get attention</font>

93
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,660
not just digital and I think the places

94
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,799
i'm obsessed with whether it's Facebook

95
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,480
or Instagram or snapchat in five years

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,549
will be disrupted<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well yeah but I</font>

97
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,739
like day trading attention I like doing

98
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,290
it for the moment when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seinfeld's the</font>

99
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,910
number one show on television you buy

100
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,890
commercials on it yeah so I don't care

101
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,780
where snapchat<font color="#CCCCCC"> arendse remember going I</font>

102
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,549
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're under priced right now</font>

103
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:03,489
yeah and you are you we referred in last

104
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,950
week's episode to you as being as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

105
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,440
saying earlier as being part of this

106
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,329
disruption is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you're very</font>

107
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:11,859
conscious of it are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talking about</font>

108
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:15,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs and the desire for vaynermedia</font>

109
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,220
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> disruptive because it is going to</font>

110
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,500
disrupt<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traditional agency model</font>

111
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,360
like you're growing here phenomenally

112
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,980
farm animal expanding it

113
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,260
I think when people you know I think

114
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">when people and look I'm thankful that</font>

115
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,680
you know I was smiling<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you said you</font>

116
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,450
had heard of us in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US I was thankful</font>

117
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,670
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know outside of a couple of</font>

118
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,430
adage references I've been very quiet i

119
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,450
don't think i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think people really</font>

120
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,210
realize the scope of you know what's 650

121
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,850
employees and 100 million dollar revenue

122
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,890
run rate business we're big company and

123
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,330
much bigger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> most people in</font>

124
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,070
advertising world think of us or know us

125
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,530
as you know I've said this a lot I don't

126
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I'm destructive I actually think</font>

127
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm practical I think the market is</font>

128
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,580
destructive I think I think when you're

129
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,680
for example we have a lot of clients and

130
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,720
you may as well and others do that try

131
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
to sell to people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are under 25</font>

132
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">years old I think running television</font>

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,950
commercials is disruptive for a 22 year

134
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,510
old to buy your<font color="#CCCCCC"> bubblegum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or your</font>

135
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,900
stickers so I I think I'm quite

136
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,510
practical I recognize why people think

137
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,850
we're disruptive I do think that we have

138
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,260
the potential to change the conversation

139
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are not passionate</font>

140
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,650
about media metrics or awards or

141
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,970
headlines the way a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

142
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,800
contemporaries are I have empathy for

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,330
why people have been because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how</font>

144
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,370
they get business that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we get</font>

145
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,860
business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's and we get business in</font>

146
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,390
a very funny way we get business because

147
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,420
I get us business from my history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

148
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,950
selling stuff and people knowing it

149
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,140
intimately not what they read in Fast

150
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,080
Company and then our results you know

151
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,090
when we grow sour patches business

152
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,040
through the roof when we grow a lot of

153
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,110
our ABI clients business when we

154
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,610
actually grow our bit most of my

155
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,170
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now is word of mouth of</font>

156
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,700
brand managers and CMOS going to other

157
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,380
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> and desperately wanting to bring</font>

158
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,950
us along because we did something<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I</font>

159
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions to Eric and Jeff in</font>

160
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:11,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team in New Yorker they are a big</font>

161
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,540
agencies reacting in a bad way to that

162
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,490
because you must be stealing files then

163
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,760
we're taking scope I still I still think

164
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the big agencies as you refer to</font>

165
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,660
them are putting us in two buckets<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

166
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh that's just little social it doesn't</font>

167
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,110
mean anything and oh that's just Gary

168
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,780
he's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these gurus and</font>

169
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,310
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a bunch of interns that</font>

170
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,150
he's paying no money

171
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">too they just don't look under the hood</font>

172
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,500
yeah in the same way that they read

173
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,230
headlines on PR week and make their

174
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,330
assumptions on snapchat and Facebook I

175
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,680
think they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the same thing with</font>

176
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">me and that's a nice way to operate I'd</font>

177
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,430
rather be right now yeah i mean look

178
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,620
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mark ender estimated oh then</font>

179
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,110
you can over deliver if you if you go

180
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,550
look and it's fun to have Rebecca here

181
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,710
you know who handles our comms if you go

182
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,660
look at how much has been communicated

183
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,180
about me as a human versus the agency in

184
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,690
the last 24 months it's ninety percent

185
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,660
me surprised because you're so sure and

186
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,700
you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> funny one could say it's</font>

187
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,860
narcissistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> its ego it's things of that</font>

188
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,900
nature to me it's been quite calculated

189
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,930
like I've enjoyed people being naive and

190
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,730
under estimating what we're doing to the

191
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,880
market I have no problem surprising

192
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,070
people look if they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been respecting</font>

193
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,960
it or if they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> naive to it it</font>

194
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,940
would have been regardless because we're

195
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,010
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute we know how to sell</font>

196
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day the</font>

197
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,610
Unilever<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zanda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proctors and the cokes</font>

198
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,310
and the Pepsi's<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the BMW's they care</font>

199
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,680
about selling at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of day</font>

200
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,260
somewhere maybe not your<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand manager</font>

201
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,120
maybe not the CMO that needs a headline

202
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,080
to get the next CMO job but somewhere

203
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,270
somewhere somebody cares and the ironic

204
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,100
thing is usually somebody that's

205
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,400
important yeah this is good yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

211
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,960

212
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like I don't like to speak for</font>

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,500
meritocracy I love capitalism

230
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,130
I like the market I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's coming</font>

231

<font color="#E5E5E5">across well because I'm speaking the</font>

232
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,050
truth meaning in the same way that I'll

233
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,420
be the first person as I am now who's

234
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,550
saying Twitter's broken Twitter's a

235
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,350
problem don't spend money on Twitter

236
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,690
after if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting here 36 months</font>

237
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,620
Twitter would be the only thing out of

238
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,170
my mouth I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

239
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,610
track record now that people are

240
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,320
starting to realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what I'm</font>

241
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,670
obsessed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being historically</font>

242
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,280
correct not where I'm making my money at

243
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,710
the moment yeah like you know I invested

244
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,230
a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> into meerkat you haven't</font>

245
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,760
heard a<font color="#CCCCCC"> word for me about meerkat for</font>

246
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,380
the last year you know why cuz it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

247
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,540
gonna win yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not pushing</font>

248
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,120
agenda I'm pushing conversation that

249
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,100
benefits us all if marketing was better

250
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,670
if media planning wasn't so broad if all

251
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,010
of us tried to sell more products a lot

252
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us would do better the industry would</font>

253
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,290
be in a better place and so I want

254
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,150
everybody to win I do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font>

255
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest building in town yes how do</font>

256
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,750
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that by building the</font>

257
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,220
biggest building not by tearing

258
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,900
everybody's building down so i think

259
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,280
what i did in that meeting was<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said</font>

260
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,350
look you're acting one way as a human

261
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,390
which means you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not looking at</font>

262
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,250
commercials you're not clicking banner

263
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,230
ads yeah but your marketing all your

264
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,730
money in a different way and you're

265
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,230
doing that because the whole machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

266
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">built on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and i thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it went well</font>

267
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,700
and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting because you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

268
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,920
when you give that talk the first 15

269
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,320
minutes is awkward yeah when you go into

270
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,970
a room and say look<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

271
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,440
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the kind of person normally</font>

272
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,850
they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it's relatively</font>

273
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,270
conservative isn't it as a as a as a

274
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment you know better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than I do</font>

275
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just starting to I mean I</font>

276
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,400
think everything's conservative so

277
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,310
probably um yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean look look</font>

278
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,930
there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people in Madison</font>

279
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,970
Avenue today that had the narrative that

280
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,490
I had which was I first built a 65

281
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,800
million dollar business on the backbone

282
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,190
of what was considered radical marketing

a different angle and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got such a</font>

293
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,839
different point of view that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it uh that</font>

294
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going well and it's got its pluses</font>

295
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,699
it's got its minuses but will try when a

human beings now when you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

329
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,800
three or four big holding companies that

330
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,120
drive everything it becomes even more

331
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,040
intense so you can see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it</font>

332
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,689
obvious as you say like across industry

333
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,060

there's none of I mean that it there's I

339
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,870
am a meritocracy even at my own expense

340
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,259
the end yeah okay the end if we're going

341
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lose a media pitch because oh the</font>

00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,269
business yeah i mean that's that when

346
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:13,939
you're better you don't have to play

347
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:15,350
that game<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's good and that's</font>

348
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,939
what we that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i liked about the</font>

349
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:17,329
narrator

350
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,679
that we were hearing from the agency

351
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,230
when we went to New York I hope you

352
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,029
continue that in Europe that's a

353
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,559
slightly different market is there any

354
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,689
new ones to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the European market I mean I</font>

355
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean there's the cliche stereotypes that</font>

356
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:34,309
you know the you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm to us even for</font>

357
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:37,699
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the personality may may rub some</font>

358
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,350
people the wrong way here's here's what

359
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,759
I know look I was born in Eastern Europe

360
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,230
I grew up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wine business I've</font>

361
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,790
spent an enormous amount of time in

362
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,019
Italy and France in other parts of the

363
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:48,499
world people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people meaning like I</font>

364
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think so yes do I think there's</font>

365
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,660
some cultural differences of course but

366
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,769
do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision maker at</font>

367
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,379
unilever UK market or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toyota UK market</font>

368
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,319
or Nestle UK market doesn't want to do

369
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,059
deep deep down doesn't want to do the

370
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">right thing for their business because</font>

371
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,079
maybe it was too aggressive that's fine

372
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,989
i mean like I'm they all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it they</font>

373
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:15,079
all I mean they all really know it if we

374
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,569
lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something that shouldn't be</font>

375
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:21,829
important then that's fine by us so look

376
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,879
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think every market marketing is a</font>

377
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,970
tactic to help a transaction happen we

378
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,579
do that extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> well yeah um and I</font>

379
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that um I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

380
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,869
go over extremely well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this market um</font>

381
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:37,429
I'll tell you what really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is most</font>

382
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:39,019
fascinating to me about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> London and</font>

383
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,980
general kind of Western Europe market

384
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,709
there's a stunning lack of respect for

385
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,799
how well modern digital is doing in this

386
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,989
market when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the metrics of</font>

387
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:54,259
Instagram and Facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> and snapchat in</font>

388
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:57,169
the UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> market it's like kind of weirdly</font>

389
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,149
more exciting than the US market<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah i</font>

390
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,389
mean the penetration is at full scale

391
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:05,779
the behavior is quite aged up I think

392
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,459
there's some real big opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

393
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US has so many the</font>

394
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,569
startups start there there's also that

395
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:13,309
six to twelve month pause you know

396
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:14,720
London's incredible market so maybe it's

397
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,329
a three to six-month pause but and look

398
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:20,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">I day trade so I'm fast in the u.s.</font>

399
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:23,089
having an extra six or<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve months for</font>

400
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,399
a UK market or a Dublin market or a

401
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,309
Berlin market is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> attractive for</font>

402
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:28,910
me

403
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,590
good so finally before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guess the</font>

404
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,150
other thing your legendary for is to be

405
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,320

411
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,530
time if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the episode of it if</font>
