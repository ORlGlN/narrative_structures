00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Jason asks what's the hardest thing

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've had to deal with in the past five</font>

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,309
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how did you get through it</font>

4
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,320
Jason over the last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years the</font>

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,110
hardest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've had to deal with</font>

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,389
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know hands down it has to be the</font>

7
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,060
fact of siphoning off of wine library TV

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,240
daily grape that<font color="#E5E5E5"> routine of six years</font>

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and really leaving the day in day out</font>

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,760
operations of the family business that

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the most emotional business you know</font>

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,859
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my dad kind of this</font>

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,540
transition of being day in and day out

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,730
with my dad to being day in and day with

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,059
my brother enormous emotion comes with

16
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,489
that yeah I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> never even realized</font>

17
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,590
that that would ever happen it was a

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">very big brain twist for me that I would</font>

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">be transitioning out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> family</font>

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,940
business into another chapter in my life

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,680
and I struggled<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that quite a bit a</font>

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,620
lot of heavy emotion the the

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,199
relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people at Wine Library</font>

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,140
my dad<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I dynamics just all these</font>

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,430
very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there was also</font>

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,559
happening right when Misha was born it

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">was an interesting time in my life I was</font>

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,180
was growing up and and transitioning and

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,060
changing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealt with it with what I</font>

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,430
deal with everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really probably</font>

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,590
the cornerstone of my happiness I dealt

32
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it by over communicating the the</font>

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,380
level of communication I had with the

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,360
people involved was very high and and

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,700
allowed for it to happen and so that's

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:00:00,000
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font>
