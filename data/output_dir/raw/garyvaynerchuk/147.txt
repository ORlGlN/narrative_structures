1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:02,041
- And uh, a buddy I went to college with.

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:03,520
- Let's give him a shout-out, though.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,247
Seth, I'm proud of you,
here, getting set up

4
00:00:05,247 --> 00:00:07,163
for the big event this
morning at Wine Library,

5
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:08,846
who hooked us up with this audio?

6
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:10,366
- My man Skylar.

7
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:11,850
Skylar Adler.

8
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,739
- Skylar, Skylar Adler,
we're proud of you.

9
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:14,810
We're thankful.

10
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,126
Awesome, alright, good.

11
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:18,543
(rock music)

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,912
- Would you like home space, or like?

13
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,046
- What is that?

14
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:31,920
Yo, okay, hey vlog.

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,013
So here we are at Wine Library,

16
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,103
I haven't been at Wine Library

17
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:38,783
at 8 AM on a Saturday in many, many years.

18
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,410
Doing the event, the Q&A
session, a lot of fun,

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,442
super fun to be back in
the stomping grounds,

20
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:47,321
and we'll see what's
up, see what we can do.

21
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:50,640
Man, what goes on here,
if anything at any time?

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,413
What goes here?

23
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:56,257
I feel like this needs to be smarter.

24
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,007
I think this needs to be smarter.

25
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:02,491
Back to my old school.

26
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,777
You can take a boy from the liquor store,

27
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:13,852
but you can't take the liquor
store away from the boy.

28
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:15,019
You need help?

29
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,786
Uh huh, uh huh!

30
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:24,698
(laughing)

31
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,272
Memories, feelings, the feelings.

32
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:28,855
I mean, this building's
especially interesting

33
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,940
because it's the building
that we built, right?

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,027
But it wasn't super easy,
it took way too long,

35
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:38,860
so I have a funny vibe towards it.

36
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:42,199
Amazing, but like, sometimes like this,

37
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:46,211
fuckin' wine room took a year too long.

38
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,364
Hey guys, it's Gary Vaynerchuk,

39
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:49,028
I'm here at the Wine Library,

40
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,745
and I'm super excited to be talking to you

41
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,095
because corporate gifts.

42
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:54,841
And the bottom line is,
there's not a single

43
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:56,100
wine club out there that even

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,884
remotely can hang with this one.

45
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:00,258
(laughing)

46
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:03,606
Cool, well thank you so much
for coming, this is super fun.

47
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:05,766
It's funny, me and D-Rock were joking

48
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:09,183
right before saying we do so many events,

49
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:13,125
and a lot of times people say,

50
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,422
"Well how many people were there?"

51
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:16,409
and we're like, oh, 100 or 200,

52
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,905
but if this is what 85 looks like

53
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,676
I think we've been underestimating
every event in our lives.

54
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:22,509
(crowd laughter)

55
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,917
Thanks for coming out this early.

56
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,356
You know, it's funny, when
I was putting this together

57
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:28,784
I'm like, you know what,
let's organize this at 8 AM

58
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,724
on a Saturday, let's see
who's really committed.

59
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:32,938
(crowd laughter)

60
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,337
So I'm enjoying that part.

61
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:39,657
Listen, to that point,
if you're gonna be here

62
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:43,387
at 8 AM on a Saturday, then
I think the far majority

63
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:44,977
of you have a whole lot of context of

64
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:47,699
who I am and a lot of my spiel, right?

65
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,653
So instead of repeating stuff that I think

66
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:52,946
you can hear online or
you're probably really

67
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:56,112
super close to, I think we can really go

68
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:58,862
pretty hardcore into Q&A, and so,

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,578
do you guys feel collectively like

70
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:03,797
that might be the way to go?

71
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:04,630
- [Crowd] Yeah.

72
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,739
- Alright, cool, we'll do that and then,

73
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,617
like if I want, I'll find
things along the way to say,

74
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:10,483
so, I mean, look, with two hours

75
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,893
I'm pretty sure we might be
able to get to everything here.

76
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,342
Actually, I wish Tyler was here.

77
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:17,938
The four D's, there's only
ten people and it takes

78
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:20,179
an hour and a half and he gets mad at me.

79
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,020
So, why don't we start raising hands?

80
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,909
Let's go, who's got a question?

81
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:24,927
You in the back with the hat.

82
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:25,760
What's your name?

83
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,593
- [David] David.

84
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:27,426
- David.

85
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,259
- [David] So I'm from Cleveland,

86
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:29,362
I own a dog grooming business,

87
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:33,016
we've been a business for
about a year and a half now,

88
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:35,095
it's growing incredibly fast,

89
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,704
we just opened our third location.

90
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,201
- Hey Seth, you don't
have a second mic do you?

91
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,215
I could pass this though,
lets do that, lets pass,

92
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:43,048
this way he can capture it though.

93
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:46,297
Dog business, Cleveland.

94
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:47,818
- [David] Dog business, Cleveland.

95
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:49,923
We just opened our third
location in a year and a half,

96
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:52,676
growing super fast, I'm only 23 years old

97
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:54,323
and I'm just kind of wondering,

98
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:58,058
at what point do I, I
feel like I'm just kind of

99
00:03:58,058 --> 00:04:00,299
throwing shit at the
walls, as far as like,

100
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:01,351
I don't know anything about business.

101
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:05,365
At what point do I, I have huge
ambitions for this business,

102
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:07,562
you know, at what point
do I try to find somebody

103
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:10,258
that might be able to
push it faster or further,

104
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,889
or do I keep figuring
it out along the way?

105
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,856
- Yeah, so I think that there's

106
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,206
a lot of ways to go about it,

107
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:19,760
I think that you've gotta recognize that

108
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,589
there's a lot of people
who, never in their lives

109
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,820
will build a business with three
locations that's profitable

110
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,879
or not sinking, so I don't
think that underestimating

111
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,314
yourself because of your
age is the right strategy,

112
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:33,080
I think the most
concerning thing for me was

113
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,843
the first words out of
your mouth are faster.

114
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,581
You know, and I think I talk
about patience in a lot of ways

115
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,263
but I don't talk a lot about it from,

116
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:45,064
I talk about it more from,
you've gotta be patient

117
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:47,762
to get to the success things, instead of,

118
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:51,189
you've gotta deploy patience
pretty much the entire way.

119
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,152
Right?

120
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:56,055
I mean, I'm always stunned
by people who reply to me

121
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:58,594
pushing patience, and
replying in the comments,

122
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:02,873
DM, or e-mail, "Easy for
you to say, rich guy."

123
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,445
Right?

124
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:06,058
Which is super funny for me because,

125
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:09,285
I think I'm probably
deploying the greatest

126
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:11,742
patience of my life right now.

127
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:13,404
Like if you really understand

128
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:15,463
the economics of my day to day,

129
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:17,030
you know, the fact that I'm even operating

130
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,964
Vayner Media, is me deploying

131
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:21,962
an enormous amount of patience.

132
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:25,105
I'm running a very non-profitable,
not interesting business,

133
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:27,065
I'm eating a lot of shit on a daily basis.

134
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,523
Client services at the
scale that we're at,

135
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:31,761
at $150 million level, and 800 employees,

136
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:35,220
it's just not a fun
business when I can just,

137
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,312
look at the economics around
something like this, right?

138
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:41,792
Or the things that you see,
like 4 D's is far more me

139
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:45,430
than Vayner Media, I can
live right now and make

140
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,699
15 to 20 million dollars a year,

141
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,109
which is more money than
I make enjoying myself

142
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,878
and just being Gary V.

143
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:55,783
So I think the thing you
need to think about is,

144
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:59,037
it's working, but the
thing that will hurt you

145
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:01,633
is if you have too much ambition locked up

146
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:04,122
in the amount of locations.

147
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,814
You know, locations remind me of likes.

148
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:09,890
For some reason people
care about how many likes

149
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,608
and followers they have even though it has

150
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:14,334
no proxy to the reality
of their situation.

151
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:18,043
And I think locations are very similar.

152
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,017
Look at this.

153
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:21,061
This is the only location
of Wine Library, right?

154
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:24,644
So one thing that I
spend a lot of time on,

155
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:26,459
and again, an audience that I think

156
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,727
understands me deeper so
I'm gonna try and go into

157
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:30,470
a little bit of a different angle,

158
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,845
almost everything I talk about

159
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:36,271
is me giving advice that
I'm actually living.

160
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,745
You know, I might just be
further along in the path,

161
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:41,774
but it's everything that
I've, I never try to guess.

162
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:44,905
And the way I learn is by doing.

163
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,612
And so, almost everything I talk about

164
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:49,578
is predicated on what I'm doing,

165
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,636
have done, and will continue to do.

166
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:55,697
So I would tell you to
slow it down, you know,

167
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:57,801
like let it slow down.

168
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,291
One way to really lose
is to get out of control,

169
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,505
right, like once you start
learning how to drive

170
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,475
when you were a kid, you're like,

171
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:05,904
"Alright, let's see if I can go 80",

172
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,908
that's when shit gets dangerous, right?

173
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:08,870
(crowd laughter)

174
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,342
So I would tell you, it's
not about somebody else.

175
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:15,732
The best way to get
bigger is to be calculated

176
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:19,676
and smart about it, and so my intuition is

177
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:21,784
if you've gotten it this far this early,

178
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:24,241
then you've saw something
and you've executed

179
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:26,148
better than others, and
you've taken advantage

180
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:29,161
of, whether it's your area or
region or digital marketing,

181
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:32,391
or hustle, passion, or
a million other things

182
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:36,006
that are to be, but I don't
think faster is a good model.

183
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,506
I think proper and calculated.

184
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:41,520
Make sense?

185
00:07:42,451 --> 00:07:43,581
- [David] Yeah, definitely.

186
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:44,414
- Cool.

187
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:45,258
Questions?

188
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,091
Go ahead.

189
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,078
- [Man] I struggle with time management.

190
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:49,635
So I work from nine to five, I'm 28,

191
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,481
I still live at home with mom,

192
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,215
student loan debt, the whole nine,

193
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:56,055
I really try not to make excuses

194
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,724
and I'm grateful that my mom's
letting me get on my feet,

195
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:02,044
how do I get past that
whole, okay, I'm tired of

196
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:05,168
coming home from that nine to five,

197
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,503
friends are calling
wanting to watch the game,

198
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:08,479
and I'm good with cutting them out,

199
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,931
how do I do the 7-2 AM and
still be productive at my 9-5?

200
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:14,493
- Yeah, there's a lot of
different things here.

201
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:17,826
First of all, you should audit your 9-5.

202
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:20,726
I would make it as easy possible.

203
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,669
Like, there's an arbitrage.

204
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,819
To be productive at your
9-5, a lot of people,

205
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,214
but I will crush it, I
mean this is now 2009,

206
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:31,548
this 7 PM to 2 AM thing,
it's been around for a while

207
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:34,517
which is crazy, I mean
I've answered this e-mail

208
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,722
so many times, it's been amazing,

209
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:39,806
this is one of my big pieces of advice,

210
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:40,741
I know I'm building it up,

211
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:42,085
but it's actually crazy.

212
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,063
The amount of people that
I've been able to tell,

213
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:48,230
who've gone from making 58,000,
73,000, 190,000 in their 9-5

214
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:55,119
to, from 57 to 51, from
73 to 60, from 190 to 90.

215
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:02,641
Because what they did was,
they figured out what they

216
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:06,065
needed to even just barely live,

217
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:10,380
but their 9-5 got way
easier, they just literally,

218
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,644
some of them literally would go and work

219
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:15,252
at like Sachs 5th Avenue
on the sales floor

220
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:18,002
and have eight hour shifts where,

221
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:21,338
retail's a good one right now.

222
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:22,291
Go work retail.

223
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,672
Nobody's coming in.

224
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:24,852
(crowd laughter)

225
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:28,019
And you can be on your phone and work!

226
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,599
- [Man] I love my 9-5 job.

227
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:36,258
- You don't love it more
than what you want to happen.

228
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:37,091
- [Man] Correct.

229
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:37,980
- The end.

230
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,190
Life's about choices brother,
there's nothing else to say.

231
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,021
You know, this is where it gets important.

232
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,807
You know how I love saying binary?

233
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:46,640
Cuz it is.

234
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:52,022
If you love it so much,
then you wouldn't be here.

235
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:54,763
So you don't love it enough, so fuck that.

236
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:55,596
Got it?

237
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,702
Like, make a little less or make more,

238
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,502
just make it something that
doesn't take up your brain,

239
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:04,837
and energy, so that you're fuckin',

240
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,141
the bigger issue now is that

241
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:08,700
you were so bored for eight hours

242
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,803
that it's tough to restart,
not that you're out of energy.

243
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:11,636
I mean it.

244
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:16,897
That's the answer, it's
not so easy to execute.

245
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:19,224
- [Man] Right, because most
of it has to do with finances.

246
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:20,884
- I get it, I get it.

247
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:23,095
Especially when debt is
compounding with that interest,

248
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:26,713
like, this is why I'm
just, I really, you know.

249
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,092
- [Man] And I hate making excuses.

250
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:30,420
- Dude, it's not, I can
tell, it's not an excuse,

251
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,554
it's a fundamental issue
that I'm trying to put

252
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:36,908
a lot of pressure on as one person,

253
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,970
and hope it builds momentum.

254
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,657
The thought of going to college

255
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:43,894
and collecting six figures of debt

256
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,265
in the way, what college
does for you in return,

257
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,515
in today's world, is wrong.

258
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:53,520
There's just nothing else to say.

259
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,794
It's fundamentally wrong,
especially if it's not a layup

260
00:10:57,794 --> 00:10:59,377
to six figure jobs.

261
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,628
Listen, you wanna go and be a consultant

262
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:06,156
at Bane and McKenzie or Goldmann Sachs,

263
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,027
because it's Harvard and Stanford,

264
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:09,712
you can sell me a little bit.

265
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,018
But that's a small percentage.

266
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:15,768
And if you're an
entrepreneur, what the fuck?

267
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:17,902
(crowd laughter)

268
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:21,446
I mean, Babson's a great
entrepreneurial school,

269
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:25,997
but it's the minor leagues to
real life entrepreneurship.

270
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:29,765
So, my answer is simple,
just to round this out.

271
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:32,098
Life's about choices, right?

272
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:35,727
And like, they're hard.

273
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:38,141
And it's about patience.

274
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:40,302
What I'm telling you is probably like

275
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:43,961
a good solid seven year mapping game plan.

276
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,964
And for you, you're like, "Fuck man,

277
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:49,918
it's not feeling good to
be 28 at my mom's house,

278
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,124
the fuck is Gary talking about 35?".

279
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:56,791
Here's what I'm talking
about, life is long.

280
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,852
Okay, let's move it back
and I'll set up there

281
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:05,277
for the last half an
hour, this way we just.

282
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:06,133
- [Man] How ya doin?

283
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,033
- Good.

284
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,962
Hey vlog, today on a Saturday,

285
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,156
got to see a bunch of
people, good to be back

286
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:14,537
in the stomping grounds,
super fun, super fun.

287
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:17,120
(upbeat music)

288
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,663
That was my favorite
part of the whole talk.

289
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,496
(crowd laughter)

290
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,498
As soon as you talked I looked over

291
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,053
a little bit in the eye
and I watched dad go.

292
00:12:30,053 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughter)
