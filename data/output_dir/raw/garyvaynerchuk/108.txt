1
00:00:00,426 --> 00:00:01,259
- What's up blog?

2
00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:02,092
Gary V. here.

3
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:04,212
Really excited about this episode.

4
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:07,562
Long day in Copenhagen,
did a bunch of content.

5
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:10,123
This first key note, which
was the first session there,

6
00:00:10,123 --> 00:00:11,530
I thought it was extremely strong.

7
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,445
I think there's some
pretty remarkable insights,

8
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,990
and I hope you enjoy it, and here it is.

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,657
(upbeat techno theme music)

10
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:25,134
- I know many of you have
waited a long time for this,

11
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:26,505
I know that I have.

12
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:29,030
So I think we should
all just get on our feet

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,579
and put our hands together
and welcome Gary Vaynerchuk.

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,662
(audience clapping and cheering)

15
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:52,362
- Thank you, thank you for coming.

16
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:55,674
That was nice.

17
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:56,507
- [Host] That was nice!

18
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:57,804
- Yes, thank you guys,

19
00:00:57,804 --> 00:00:59,015
thrilled to be here.

20
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,874
- [Host] You could get used to that, yeah?

21
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,940
To help the session get started,

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,940
some of you have prepared some questions.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,445
So, let's get started with that.

24
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:11,858
Do we have the mic runners ready?

25
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,447
Okay, are you ready, Gary?

26
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:14,594
- [Gary] I'm always ready.

27
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:15,985
- [Host] Perfect!

28
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:17,060
- So, yes.

29
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,787
And are you ready?

30
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,933
- Yes!
- [Host] Okay, perfect.

31
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,017
Well, would you like to
say a little about yourself

32
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,184
before we start up?

33
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:28,404
- Yeah, I mean, for the people
in here who are not familiar,

34
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:31,113
I guess the best way for me
to quantify what I'm about is:

35
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:32,751
I'm a serial entrepreneur.

36
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:35,118
I was born in the former Soviet Union,

37
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:37,451
came to the U.S. as a kid.

38
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:42,137
And, you know, really invested
in Facebook, and Twitter,

39
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:45,151
and Uber, and Tumblr, and
did very well in investing.

40
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,908
Built my dad's liquor store
business in the late '90s

41
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,314
on the back of modern day
marketing and execution,

42
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:52,107
which at the time, for
the kids in the room,

43
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:55,076
was even having a website in 1996,

44
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:57,369
not thinking the Internet
was gonna be a fad.

45
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,369
And then, built businesses
on the back of email,

46
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:05,192
and Google AdWords, and then YouTube,

47
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,214
and then this whole social media run.

48
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:12,094
And I think a lot of what I'm
thinking about in this journey

49
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:13,389
we're about to take over four hours

50
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,037
between this Q & A session,
the key note I wanna deliver,

51
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,391
and other things we're doing is,

52
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:19,579
the more I think about it,

53
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,635
the more I realize how much
of it was mental perspective,

54
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:27,713
self-awareness, emotional intelligence.

55
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,152
The tactics are very important,

56
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:31,860
but they're incredibly commoditized.

57
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,459
How to run a Facebook ad,

58
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,271
or what a good deal on an influencer is,

59
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,644
is very different than
really reverse engineering

60
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:42,156
who you are, and putting your company,

61
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:45,189
or yourself more importantly,
in a position to succeed.

62
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,689
So you know, I think I'm an overdeveloped,

63
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:54,865
emotional intelligence entrepreneur.

64
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:58,028
Which is confusing because
my persona, my shtick,

65
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:01,495
my showmanship, speaks more to sales,

66
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:04,279
and more aggressive alpha dynamics.

67
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:06,395
But I would argue that
I'm dramatically more

68
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,998
in the listening business than
I am in the talking business,

69
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:14,534
if one ever had the time to
actually see what's going on.

70
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:15,996
- [Host] Perfect!

71
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,413
Well, let's get started then.

72
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:22,166
Mariah, are you in the room?

73
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,108
Yup, could we have a mic on her?

74
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,775
Edmariah, over here.

75
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:28,502
Back, in the back.

76
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,404
So Mariah will ask you her own question.

77
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,237
- Yup.

78
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:36,487
- It will come for you now.

79
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,203
- Hello Gary.

80
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:44,036
- How are you?

81
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,287
- I have been so excited being here so --

82
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:47,120
- Thank you.

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,303
- I would really like to ask you

84
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:51,250
what is your number one marketing advice

85
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,268
and I'm thinking about online marketing.

86
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,107
- So whether it's online
or offline, Marta,

87
00:03:57,107 --> 00:03:59,729
I would tell you that the thing

88
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:00,563
that has been most interesting to me

89
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:02,198
coming from entrepreneurship

90
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,281
or liquor store retail or

91
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:10,671
the really entrepreneurial
Silicon Valley start up world

92
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:13,400
to now being in the last seven years

93
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,970
spending a lot of times

94
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,482
with the biggest brands in the world,

95
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:17,649
global brands.

96
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:22,869
I'm stunned that people
are not consumer centric.

97
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:25,188
I would tell you my number
one marketing advice

98
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:27,345
is to be empathetic.

99
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:30,873
Everybody's so selfish when they market.

100
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:34,639
They want the customer to
do what they want them to do

101
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,043
instead of the way I think about it,

102
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,893
which is more counter punching,

103
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:41,542
which is listen to what
your customer's doing

104
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,013
that you're trying to sell and market to

105
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:47,235
and formulate a marketing
strategy around that.

106
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:49,350
And so for me the reason I today,

107
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,555
push Facebook so much,

108
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:54,830
is 'cause that scale,
whether it B to B of B to C,

109
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,312
Facebook is under-priced attention

110
00:04:57,312 --> 00:05:00,210
that the masses are paying attention to.

111
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,323
And if you become an amazing practitioner

112
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:05,147
in the pictures, written
words, audio and video

113
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:06,424
of that medium,

114
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:07,416
you win.

115
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,663
So when people watch television

116
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:11,865
or listen to radio or read magazines,

117
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:13,868
they need to be good at that craft.

118
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:17,347
My number one marketing advice is empathy

119
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:19,613
and then skill set around

120
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:22,713
once you realize where they are,

121
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:24,963
and to me in November 2017,

122
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,521
that is to become the disproportionate

123
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:31,938
best Facebook marketer that you could be.

124
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:34,567
- Thank you.

125
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,817
(applause)

126
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:43,043
- [Host] Now Helen Bertrop, where are you?

127
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:46,675
Do we have Helen?

128
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:47,508
- Yeah, I'm here.

129
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:48,341
- How are you?

130
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:49,174
- Hi Gary.

131
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,007
- How are you?

132
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:50,840
- Good to see you today.

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,673
- Great to see you.

134
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:53,449
- So I am actually in the
Facebook marketing business

135
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:54,913
and sometimes my clients,

136
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:56,197
they say something around,

137
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:58,602
they don't want to market
themselves too much --

138
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:00,317
- Personally?

139
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:02,597
- Yeah personally, maybe
they're like therapists

140
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,350
or they run some causes or whatever and --

141
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,467
- Or ugly.

142
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:06,300
- Uh. (nervous chuckle)

143
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,598
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

144
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:08,684
Go ahead, go ahead.
- I hope not.

145
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,053
- But sometimes people have this feeling

146
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:12,372
that they don't want to --

147
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,205
- Yes.

148
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:14,088
- Be too much in other people's face.

149
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:14,921
- Yes.

150
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,174
- Do you have advice for that situation?

151
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:18,204
- I would tell you

152
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,652
that you should not convince them of that.

153
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:22,364
Because I'm so out there,

154
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,612
people are always like,

155
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:26,004
okay, should I build a
personal brand for my business?

156
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:28,405
You know, should I be in their feed

157
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,628
five times a day, every day?

158
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:33,760
I think the answer is,
not necessarily, right?

159
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,073
I think to me,

160
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:37,752
I think it's reverse
engineering the individual.

161
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:41,039
You know now, if your
business is selling yourself,

162
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,106
as a fitness instructor or a lawyer

163
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:46,270
or a financial investor
or a real estate agent,

164
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,639
you're gonna wanna be out there, right?

165
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,463
And if the question is more

166
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:54,432
about the difference
between alpha American DNA

167
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:56,851
where you're out in front
and other parts of the world

168
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,563
where people are more reserved,

169
00:06:58,563 --> 00:07:00,842
you know, at some level
it's very difficult

170
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,861
to make somebody do something
they're not comfortable with.

171
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:04,549
They'll never be good at it.

172
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,362
I wanna remind everybody,

173
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:07,935
some of the biggest
companies in the world,

174
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:10,393
you don't even know the name of the CEO,

175
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:12,899
let alone what she or he looks like.

176
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,695
So, just because there are
certain people taking advantage,

177
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:18,279
and others of the opportunity,

178
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,277
building personal brand
as a branding mechanism

179
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:22,300
to build their business,

180
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,046
it doesn't mean it's
the only way to do it.

181
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:27,488
And so I never try to convince people

182
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,556
to build their personal
brand or be out there more.

183
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:34,592
I remind them that if they're
good at it and enjoy it,

184
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:38,092
is it a credibly owned and controllable IP

185
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,069
that is unbelievably scalable,

186
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,121
but I would tell you that I don't think

187
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:48,971
that this is a one size fits
all situation and environment.

188
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:51,938
And so I'm not overly passionate

189
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,718
that everybody needs to
build their personal brand,

190
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:58,301
but there is significant
upside if you can.

191
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:01,087
Cool.

192
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,337
(applause)

193
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:08,480
- [Host] Vitvas, upstairs?

194
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:10,632
- Very nice.

195
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:12,257
- [Host] Run, run for us, run.

196
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:13,090
- That was quick.

197
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,361
- Thank you.

198
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,600
- Hey.

199
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,089
Oh, okay, don't worry, I'm calm, I'm sure.

200
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:18,922
There we go.

201
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:19,755
- Okay.

202
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:22,870
Thank you so much for the
enormous amount of content

203
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,827
that you provide the regular people with.

204
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:28,307
That's quite surprising.

205
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,140
- Thank you.

206
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,967
- And I have a question for you.

207
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:33,562
How do you start to market the service

208
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:35,982
that people who currently don't see

209
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:40,297
as something that they would benefit from?

210
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,472
- First you really have to wrap your head

211
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:44,077
around humility, right?

212
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,912
My entire career has been
around this question.

213
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:47,220
When I first got into the wine business,

214
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,557
I tried to make Americans
drink Spanish wines,

215
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:52,039
New Zealand wines.

216
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,074
You know, wines from
obscure places in France

217
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:57,717
like the Mataron and Languedoc.

218
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,874
And because I saw that
being my opportunity,

219
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,298
I felt that I was a
disproportionately good marketer

220
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:03,203
and storyteller,

221
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:07,102
that was more arbitrage and
me bringing these brands

222
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:09,230
and these regions to the surface.

223
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,063
As you can imagine,

224
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,472
when I started talking about social media

225
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:15,429
in 2007 and eight and nine, you know,

226
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,650
as a lot of you know,

227
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,745
most companies still don't
believe that social media

228
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,426
is ROI positive.

229
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,356
That is nine years later

230
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:25,153
and so the first thing I would tell you is

231
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:27,047
too many people get frustrated

232
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:28,850
when they're going in
to this kind of world.

233
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,092
If the market doesn't
perceive the value of it,

234
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,645
that means that you're
making a bet that it's true

235
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:38,365
and that over the next 24
to 48 months, they will.

236
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:39,621
Because if it's longer than that,

237
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,783
you'll be out of business

238
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:43,065
by the time you're proven to be right.

239
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,343
You know, it's not fun to be right

240
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,279
and not get the benefits of being right

241
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,013
because you were so dramatically early.

242
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,025
Like cool, I understand that you know

243
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,157
that VR is gonna happen and
virtual reality's gonna happen.

244
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:56,291
The problem is it's gonna take 20 years

245
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,145
before it's at the scale that may benefit

246
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:00,554
for the way that people are
building their businesses today.

247
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:03,134
So, I would first say humility

248
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:06,411
and then you need to go on a
hardcore education pounding.

249
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:07,967
How many people are here have
been following my content

250
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,168
for more than five years?

251
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:10,500
Raise your hands.

252
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,133
So these 12, 15 people,

253
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:16,955
I've been sayin' the same
fuckin' shit for a decade.

254
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:20,073
Every day, for free, at scale,

255
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:24,312
more than any goddamn human
being on the mobile device.

256
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:26,484
And I still have to do it every day,

257
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:28,968
all day, to everybody.

258
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:31,667
And so it's enormous patience and empathy

259
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,558
and make sure that your
timing isn't too far ahead.

260
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:39,146
And then finally just continuously looking

261
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:41,428
for under-priced attention.

262
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:42,637
Because you won't be able to afford

263
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:45,829
to tell your story in overpriced
attention for too long

264
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:48,064
if you're selling something
people aren't ready for.

265
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,534
And then you've gotta really
pound the value prop, right?

266
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:55,272
I'm not into social media
'cause I like technology

267
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,965
and gadgets and I'm a technologist

268
00:10:57,965 --> 00:10:59,689
and I think it's fun or cool.

269
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:02,517
I'm in it because I think
attention is the number one asset

270
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:03,801
if you wanna build a business

271
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:06,203
and I'd look for where it's
under-priced and overpriced.

272
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:07,283
And when I'd speak to it,

273
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,484
I speak in business terms

274
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:09,621
which eventually get people

275
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:11,143
to understand it in business terms,

276
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:13,368
not because of the altruistic,

277
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:16,949
it's nice to reply to somebody on Twitter.

278
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:20,148
And so, I would make sure that
you're speaking the language

279
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,824
of the individuals that
you're trying to convert

280
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:25,285
and that's the framework
you have to live in.

281
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,373
And this model has the most upside,

282
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,123
but also has the most graveyards.

283
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,012
- Okay.

284
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:35,845
- Thank you.

285
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:38,095
(applause)

286
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,214
- [Host] Then it's Kai.

287
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:45,986
Over here, can we have a mic on him?

288
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:46,819
Thank you.

289
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:50,135
He's fast.

290
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:54,741
- Hi Gary, welcome to Denmark.

291
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:55,941
- Thank you for having me.

292
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:59,277
- Um, like I guess a lot
of other people in here,

293
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:02,676
I am a entrepreneur with
very small business.

294
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,821
I have three employees.

295
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,118
I'm in the creative business,

296
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:09,089
I'm a jeweler and that
means that obviously,

297
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,488
I'm wearing a lot of hats.

298
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:11,321
- Yes.

299
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,154
- We call them.

300
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:16,685
So my question is given all
the things that I need to do,

301
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:21,476
what percentage of time should
I allocate for marketing?

302
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:22,816
- Versus what else?

303
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:24,961
- Versus everything.

304
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,012
In my case, talking to customers,

305
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,091
designing, creating jewelry,

306
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:31,884
handling my employees, everything admin,

307
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,884
decoration, you name it.

308
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:35,717
- I mean I think for,

309
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:38,334
how many people here are entrepreneurs?

310
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,167
Amazing.

311
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,167
So you have the audacity

312
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:45,015
to wanna live life on your terms.

313
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:46,908
And so I need,

314
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:47,741
hold the mic.

315
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:48,574
Let her hold that for a second, my friend.

316
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:49,407
Thank you.

317
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:51,575
One more time,

318
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:53,329
hands in the air.

319
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,246
We have the audacity to
live life on our terms.

320
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:04,047
The percentage of
successful entrepreneurs,

321
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:06,491
ones that can make a living

322
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:08,387
and live their lives on their own back,

323
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,797
not in the company structure,

324
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:11,310
is quite low.

325
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,466
The percentage of those that
amass the kind of wealth

326
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:17,625
that everybody thinks
they're going to amass

327
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,179
when they get into entrepreneurship

328
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,346
is even smaller than that.

329
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,847
The answer to your question my friend,

330
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,514
is all of it, all the
time, always, forever.

331
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,557
(cheers, applause)

332
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:37,817
And so to that point

333
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,693
and that's collecting
the energy in this room,

334
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,019
I think we all understand.

335
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,179
You're in a boat,

336
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,001
there's marketing, there's your employees,

337
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,008
there's sales, there's the product.

338
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,068
If the jewelry isn't good,

339
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:48,723
who gives a shit if the marketing's good,

340
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:49,562
it's not right.

341
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,667
There's all these things

342
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:54,191
and we're all in a boat
and here pops a hole

343
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,017
and you've got to go put your finger in it

344
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:56,850
and then there's one over here

345
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,543
and your toe and then
finally it fixes and good.

346
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,805
Now two more over here,

347
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,077
we're in the firefighter business.

348
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,981
I am in constant anxiety.

349
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,502
I have to be here for the next four hours.

350
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:08,380
When I get off,

351
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,135
America has started today.

352
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:12,657
My office is in motion.

353
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,874
We're five, six hours ahead.

354
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:17,423
There's a lot that's about
to happen in my business

355
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,716
in the next five hours and this is fun

356
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:21,236
and I'm obsessed with the admiration

357
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,315
and I can't wait to take
selfies and high-fives

358
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,488
and answer questions and
give a great keynote.

359
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:29,108
And I'm so excited to
be in this amazing town

360
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:32,023
and meet you guys and
it's fucking incredible.

361
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:34,345
Yet, the second it's over,

362
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:36,114
from the high of the high

363
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:39,283
of people traveling hours
or I change their lives,

364
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:42,616
I take my phone and I have 17 headaches.

365
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:46,247
This person quit and this client's mad

366
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,097
and this didn't go well
and this is a problem,

367
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,354
and (clicking sound),

368
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:55,521
everything, always, forever
because we have the audacity

369
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:00,152
to want it in this way

370
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:02,390
which is the best way to have it

371
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,890
for a human if you're capable.

372
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,269
(applause)

373
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,122
- [Host] And let's find the capabilities

374
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,081
to find the next question.

375
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,164
Casper, here.

376
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,386
- Hello Gary.

377
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,414
- Hello my man.

378
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:26,947
- I do watch what you do
and love what you say.

379
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:27,780
- I like it.

380
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,606
- But still I have a question.

381
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:33,105
I have a lifestyle brand
and a DJ collection.

382
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:34,155
So I'm a DJ.

383
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:36,841
I'm playing after hours today.

384
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:38,258
So my question is

385
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,628
my own like DJ promotion or

386
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,026
for me to, yeah.

387
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:50,404
- I see it.

388
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:51,514
I would probably do it.

389
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:54,593
If there's nothing that stands out

390
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:56,738
to why not doing it under your name,

391
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,286
I would do it under your name.

392
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:03,795
Because personal will always
over index versus a logo.

393
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,930
And I think that we are
now in the day and age

394
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,184
where people are okay with understanding

395
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,638
people are complete people

396
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,502
and have multiple things going on.

397
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:14,165
I remember the early days of this

398
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:17,279
people would have like a very
different life on Facebook

399
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,331
than they had on LinkedIn.

400
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:20,164
You know?

401
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:21,033
And I would always laugh

402
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:24,135
because they thought they
were tricking somebody.

403
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:25,664
Like, we all know.

404
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,781
You know it's funny now that I'm a parent,

405
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:30,467
my daughter is doing a
lot of things that I did

406
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,990
and at eight, I thought it worked.

407
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,271
Now I just realized my
mom was letting me do it

408
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,499
and laughing at me.

409
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:37,767
(laughter)

410
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,741
And that's how I think about why it's okay

411
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:42,589
to mix personal and professional.

412
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:44,494
You're not tricking anybody,

413
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:45,987
that you're so professional

414
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:49,323
with a nice picture with a tie on LinkedIn

415
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:52,293
while you're throwing up on Instagram.

416
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:54,004
(laughter)

417
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,163
So I think we should just embrace it

418
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:57,595
and so I think the personal part

419
00:16:57,595 --> 00:17:01,187
will always over-index over a logo.

420
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,321
(talking off mic)

421
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,804
(applause)

422
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,170
Good.

423
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,420
(applause)

424
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:10,700
- [Host] All right.

425
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,021
Now it's time for Yasper.

426
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:14,271
Yes? Over here.

427
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:19,181
- Hey Gary.

428
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:20,013
- How are you?

429
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,199
- I'm good.

430
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,808
So I have a micro question.

431
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,454
- You don't wanna stand up?

432
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:25,721
- I can stand up if you want.

433
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:26,554
- Respect.

434
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:27,665
Let's clap it up for him.

435
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,916
(clapping)

436
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:33,030
- So I have a micro question.

437
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,357
What kind of content should
the world's leading VR

438
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:38,719
physical therapy company be
putting out on social media?

439
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:41,714
(chuckling)

440
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:43,702
- First of all Yasper,

441
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:44,907
you need to be putting out content

442
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:46,486
that makes people understand
what the fuck that means.

443
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:47,578
(host chortles)

444
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:48,411
Right?

445
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:49,244
- Makes sense.

446
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:50,097
- And I'm making a joke,

447
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:51,600
but you know that's exact,

448
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,335
like that's similar to two questions ago.

449
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:55,608
Your job right now is to get
people to even understand

450
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,441
what that is.

451
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:57,348
I mean, you know,

452
00:17:57,348 --> 00:17:59,128
this is a room that has a chance

453
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:01,395
of understanding what that means.

454
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:05,741
The 99% of normals have no
idea what you're talking about.

455
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:08,225
I think a lot of us that are
fortunate enough to understand

456
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:11,628
the cutting edge of
marketing or technology

457
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:13,814
have one certain language,

458
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,309
but then there's the rest of the world.

459
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:17,883
The ones we're trying to sell to,

460
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:20,534
the ones that don't overthink their copy

461
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,359
on a Instagram photo.

462
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,989
Like, the normals.

463
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:27,068
And so for the normals
and even for this group,

464
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:30,013
we've gotta really wrap
our head around what VR,

465
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,086
you know, physical therapy is.

466
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,194
I think we can theoretically understand.

467
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:36,017
But I think the first thing
is you have to put out content

468
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,608
to make us even comfortable

469
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:40,039
that it's not a jankee experience.

470
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,807
Because I think the
ones that understand it,

471
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:44,927
understand that it's got a
ways to go, technology wise.

472
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,138
There's a lot of things that are there

473
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:48,557
and so I would just overeducate.

474
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:49,527
I think, you know,

475
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:50,648
I don't know if you follow me,

476
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:53,090
but when I talk about
documenting versus creating --

477
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,108
- Yeah, we're doing that.

478
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:55,056
Been blogging for like the last year.

479
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:55,889
- Huge.

480
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:56,722
- Everything we've done.

481
00:18:56,722 --> 00:18:58,368
- Huge and so then
you've gotta figure out,

482
00:18:58,368 --> 00:18:59,353
if you're doing that,

483
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:01,391
you're three fourths of the way there.

484
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,268
Now you've gotta figure
out two core things.

485
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,145
Is it interesting?

486
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,196
And do you know how to distribute it?

487
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,029
- Yeah.

488
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:08,862
- You know?

489
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:09,763
- Number two was down,

490
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:12,350
but one is like you're talking about.

491
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,390
It's the education thing that's maybe.

492
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,605
We're doing the storytelling,

493
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:19,643
but like more explainer
videos or where are we at?

494
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:21,153
- You know I think, again,

495
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:23,382
it's a lot of these similar answers like

496
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:24,850
you need to make entertainment content

497
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,567
and informational content.

498
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,849
You're gonna need them both
in a business like this.

499
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:31,357
And so I would just keep,
you know, creating at scale.

500
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:33,342
It's just imperative.

501
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:36,215
And then I would also think a lot

502
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:37,742
about influencers, you know?

503
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:40,171
I mean if you've got good, you know,

504
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,452
tracking on what's going on on
Instagram or other platforms

505
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:46,729
and you would get the luxury
of having somebody maybe,

506
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:49,730
tear an ACL or something in that nature

507
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,847
and you can get an influencer

508
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,324
to go through rehab with you,

509
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,357
I think there could be an
incredible narrative there

510
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:58,986
that could bring disproportionate
awareness to your product.

511
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:00,888
- Uh yeah, makes sense. Thanks.

512
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:02,077
- Cool. You got it.

513
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,327
(applause)

514
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,454
- [Host] Now it's time for Stian.

515
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:12,938
Oh, over here.

516
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:13,771
- Yup, yeah, he's up there.

517
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,604
Hey.

518
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:15,706
- Hi Gary.

519
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:16,539
- How are you?

520
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:17,372
- Very good.

521
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:18,205
- Good.

522
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:19,038
- First of all,

523
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:19,871
thank you so much for,

524
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:21,147
I follow you from 2014.

525
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:21,980
- Thank you.

526
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,144
- Got a video with you in '99,

527
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,109
talking about different
context and channels.

528
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:29,247
So my question is actually,
had a couple of questions.

529
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:33,094
I'm a speaker and I'm
a consultant in product

530
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,588
and file management
and I do it for a year.

531
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,156
My background is for movie producing

532
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:39,287
and since the new think,

533
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:41,391
I'm sort of a one man army,

534
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:42,866
as many people I guess.

535
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,400
And it's really hard with sometimes

536
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,425
with allocating the time
because I'm focused primarily

537
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,489
on content, on delivering to customers

538
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:54,130
and to sell directly, like
reaching out to customers.

539
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,829
But I'm also super
curious about influencers

540
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,628
and I never done it before,

541
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:02,141
but I was just wondering
if it will make any sense

542
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,810
to allocate time where
I am right now with the

543
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,616
spending some of my time
on the influencers market

544
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,268
and trying to reach out
to people on Instagram

545
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:12,924
or maybe LinkedIn even better.

546
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:15,219
So I just wanted to hear what's
your thoughts about that.

547
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:19,009
- Well I think, look again
at the youth that you're at

548
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,534
at the ambition that you have.

549
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:25,477
You know, one thing that always
scares me about my narrative

550
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:26,653
is people always ask me,

551
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:30,170
how much do I sleep or am I
an advocate of not sleeping,

552
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,214
'cause I'm not.

553
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:33,949
I think people should sleep
six, seven, eight hours,

554
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:35,220
depending on your body.

555
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,367
I'm a huge advocate in

556
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:39,713
"what the fuck are you doing
the other 18 hours?", right?

557
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:41,136
And so when I hear your question,

558
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,700
the answer's "of course you should."

559
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,291
You know you should.

560
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,949
You know you should test.

561
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:49,137
Everybody here should spend
meaningful amounts of time

562
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:51,619
testing everything, everything.

563
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:55,276
You know, that's what
you're supposed to be doing,

564
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:58,247
'Cause you don't know the
answer for your specific nuance

565
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:02,581
if LinkedIn or a podcast or
influence or marketing or,

566
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:04,562
you know, you don't know

567
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:06,387
if that's gonna be the turning point.

568
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:09,231
And what you're doing is
you're doing too many things.

569
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,055
People are keeping their time precious

570
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:13,660
when it's their biggest asset.

571
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,929
People are not reinvesting
money back into their business

572
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:18,142
'cause they wanna buy dumb shit.

573
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:20,721
People are not trying
things because if they fail,

574
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:24,069
they worry about what other
people think about that failure.

575
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:25,578
And so they're, we're all, you know,

576
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,347
the answer is yes,

577
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,885
to everything.

578
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:30,511
Literally, fuck it.

579
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:31,778
I'm like yes and I can leave

580
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:34,528
and go fluckin' fly to L.A. right now.

581
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:36,866
Because the next three hours is "yes".

582
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:38,239
(audience laughs)

583
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,060
- (snickers) It is. It's yes.

584
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,882
So, of course you should.

585
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:44,919
Like, what are you doing
for 18 hours a day?

586
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:47,969
Find an hour and do it
for an hour every day

587
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:49,349
to get to the answer.

588
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:51,655
And then also understand that
the first 10 times you do it,

589
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:53,139
it might not be right.

590
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,141
Because it's like,

591
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,744
you know I always talk about the ROI.

592
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,904
People are like, "what's
the ROI of influencers or VR

593
00:22:57,904 --> 00:23:01,537
the ROI of those 10 hours
reaching out to influencers?".

594
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:05,770
The ROI of a basketball is
very different to people.

595
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,043
To me it's nothing,

596
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:09,242
to LeBron James, it's a billion dollars.

597
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:12,036
So all this stuff works.

598
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:14,221
It's "are you good at it?",

599
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:16,033
is a whole 'nother question.

600
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:18,878
So it's not just the ROI of trying it

601
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:20,662
then you got to get good at it.

602
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:22,159
Nothing you're good at right now,

603
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,332
you were so great out the
first time you tried it.

604
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:27,529
So, of course, man.

605
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,301
Like everything that's happening,

606
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:31,727
you need to figure out how
it works for your business,

607
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:33,809
B to B, B to C, personal brand.

608
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,065
The question is,

609
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:38,318
what are you doing with
your time, you know?

610
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,800
And so that's why I get mad at people

611
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,554
who wanna be an entrepreneur

612
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,998
and watch four hours of
Netflix a weekend or,

613
00:23:45,998 --> 00:23:47,101
and by the way,

614
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:48,090
people need escapism,

615
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:48,965
you need to check out,

616
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:49,830
you need to rest,

617
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,287
you have to be in a mental place.

618
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,605
But the scrutiny that we
have to put on our time

619
00:23:53,605 --> 00:23:55,795
as young entrepreneurs, you know,

620
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:58,075
it's just time or money.

621
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:59,739
Talent is the variable that sits in here,

622
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,244
but the assets that you're sitting with

623
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:04,070
in the beginning are time

624
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,540
and then you amass money and
then you can use the money

625
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,198
to save time and you're
just going back and forth.

626
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,546
And everybody wants these big dreams

627
00:24:11,546 --> 00:24:14,043
and they're not willing to
work at the level they need to

628
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:16,178
and that's the advantage they have.

629
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:18,261
So, fuck yes, you should.

630
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:20,037
- I just want to wrap it up

631
00:24:20,037 --> 00:24:21,197
and that's the biggest inspiration

632
00:24:21,197 --> 00:24:23,655
I got from you since 2014.

633
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:26,555
Just to cut off the crap
and just fucking work.

634
00:24:26,555 --> 00:24:27,516
So thank you so much.

635
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:29,435
- You're welcome and I
just wanna say one thing.

636
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,063
If that's your ambition,

637
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:33,166
you can work 10 hours a week.

638
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,584
If you're happy, I'm happy.

639
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,477
But don't go running around saying

640
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,068
you're gonna build a 17
million dollar business

641
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:43,427
and think you're gonna do
that on 25 hours a week.

642
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:45,601
That person doesn't exist.

643
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,560
Anybody you know who's
built something meaningful,

644
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,311
has worked for it.

645
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:51,339
I know people have inherited money,

646
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,103
but they're not the one that built it.

647
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:55,076
Anybody you know that built something,

648
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,372
put in the work.

649
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:57,205
There's just no shortcut.

650
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,587
It's like working out.

651
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:01,232
You can't think about pushups.

652
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:04,280
(light laughter)

653
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,157
Good.

654
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:06,129
(applause)

655
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,129
- Thank you.

656
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,851
- [Host] And before we
take the next question,

657
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:19,042
you can begin to wonder if
you want to ask Gary something

658
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:22,792
because we got a few
more questions prepared.

659
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,819
But then it's up to you, the audience.

660
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:27,652
- Awesome.

661
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,434
- [Host] So, yeah?

662
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:31,932
In a while we'll set you free.

663
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:32,765
Jonas.

664
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:34,506
- Yeah I'm here.

665
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:35,506
- Over here?

666
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:38,309
- How are you Jonas?

667
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,347
- Oh shit, I can't believe
I'm talking to you, man.

668
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:41,180
(laughs)

669
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,261
(audience laughs)

670
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,094
- Don't worry brother,

671
00:25:43,094 --> 00:25:44,099
it's gonna be okay.

672
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:46,349
(applause)

673
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,105
- All right, so my question is

674
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:53,620
in the very, very early
stage of the startup,

675
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,453
my first startup,

676
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:55,397
- Yep.

677
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:57,328
- And on the very, very slight budget.

678
00:25:57,328 --> 00:25:58,161
- Yep.

679
00:25:58,161 --> 00:25:59,931
- The first thing to focus on,

680
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:03,588
the most important thing and how to.

681
00:26:03,588 --> 00:26:05,223
- (sighs) There's so much brother, so --

682
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:06,276
- I'm so overwhelming,

683
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:07,166
that's why I'm asking you.

684
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,488
- Of course, I mean I think a lot

685
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:10,353
of what I just talked about is true.

686
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:14,832
The biggest advantage you
have right now is your time.

687
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:16,551
It's your number one asset.

688
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,546
You're young,

689
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:18,747
you should have plenty of energy,

690
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:19,580
you're hungry,

691
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,988
you're ambitious, great.

692
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:23,362
You need to work every
goddamn minute you can.

693
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:25,713
It's the single biggest thing you've got.

694
00:26:25,713 --> 00:26:26,546
The other thing is

695
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:28,708
you need to figure out how
to get leverage, right?

696
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:31,501
So, you need to figure
out what does that mean?

697
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:33,501
So, what's the business?

698
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,745
- Right now it's a
website selling posters.

699
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:38,740
- It's a what, brother?

700
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,871
- A web shop selling posters.

701
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:42,475
- A web shop selling posters?

702
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,624
- Yeah, yeah.

703
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:44,687
- So, you're a web shop,

704
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,149
when you say posters,

705
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,457
you, physical?

706
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:49,290
- Yeah.

707
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,898
- Okay, so you're trying
to sell them to people?

708
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,210
- Yeah.

709
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,269
- And how much does it
cost you to make them?

710
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:59,367
- 10 bucks, right now.

711
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,481
It's in very small pieces again, package.

712
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:05,652
- So, one thing that I'm a
huge fan of in the beginning

713
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:07,878
is doing a lot of work for free.

714
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:09,999
And people get very mad
at me for this advice.

715
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,375
I don't know why.

716
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,345
'Cause they debate me in theory

717
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:16,042
instead of actually
ever living a business.

718
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,749
You know, one of the things

719
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,323
that you're looking for is awareness.

720
00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:21,766
You need to let people know you exist.

721
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,285
One of the great ways to do that

722
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:26,651
is to do free work for
people that have awareness.

723
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:27,989
You're giving them work,

724
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:29,880
they're giving you awareness.

725
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,955
So I would have a hardcore
strategy in the market

726
00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:33,574
that you're trying to fulfill,

727
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:35,792
to do free work and reach
out to the companies

728
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,016
or individuals and say,

729
00:27:37,016 --> 00:27:40,392
I wanna do this for you for
free because I like your work.

730
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,025
This is the kind of work we do,

731
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:42,969
would you like it?

732
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,119
And by the way,

733
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:47,546
I have a thousand people
a day offer me "free"

734
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:48,841
and I don't take them up on it

735
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,662
because the value exchange
of the time is not worth it.

736
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:53,366
So just 'cause you even offer it for free

737
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,714
doesn't mean they'll take you up on it.

738
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,368
But the number one thing I would do first,

739
00:27:56,368 --> 00:27:57,201
if I was your partner,

740
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:58,034
I was like,

741
00:27:58,034 --> 00:27:59,196
cool, let's get side jobs,

742
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:00,383
let's sell shit.

743
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,474
Let's do something else to amass dollars,

744
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,595
let's borrow money,

745
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:04,428
let's rent money,

746
00:28:04,428 --> 00:28:06,401
let's raise capital or
let's take our money

747
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:08,159
that we have together
to do as much free work

748
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,801
for the biggest celebrity,

749
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:10,750
the biggest athlete,

750
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,345
the biggest business, the coolest thing,

751
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:16,862
the coolest festival,
the coolest brand, free,

752
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,034
as long as we're getting
awareness out of it,

753
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:23,356
to build our brand to
then create deal flow.

754
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:24,785
- All right, do you
think that's possible to

755
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:27,095
with a very tight budget.

756
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:29,661
So, you're meaning that I
have to work free for them

757
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:31,823
or then I have to provide
some of my products

758
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:32,656
for them, for free?

759
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:33,489
- Both.

760
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:34,322
- Both?

761
00:28:34,322 --> 00:28:35,155
- Free and free.

762
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:35,988
- Yeah.

763
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,443
- Which could mean that you
may have to get a side job

764
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:40,940
at night or borrow money

765
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,300
or have a separate business all together,

766
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,609
but, or do services for
other people at low costs.

767
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:51,934
Like, what I get surprised
that people don't understand,

768
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,977
is what are the alternatives?

769
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,219
Like, why are you asking me this question?

770
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:59,497
You're asking 'cause you don't
have the answer right now,

771
00:28:59,497 --> 00:29:01,079
because there's not that many alternatives

772
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,319
when you don't have a lot of money

773
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,293
and nobody knows what
the fuck your product is.

774
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,411
(snickers)

775
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,244
- Yeah, exactly.

776
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:11,133
- Right, so, entrepreneurship is super fun

777
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,483
and cool on Instagram,

778
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:14,837
but in real life, it sucks shit.

779
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:15,830
(laughter)

780
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,691
So, you know, doing shit
for free is not fun.

781
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,524
Go ahead.

782
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:22,446
- I'm just saying that I have
a part-time job right now.

783
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:23,279
- That's good.

784
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,618
- Yeah, and I'm working
on this after hours and --

785
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:28,077
- Great, so you know the money --

786
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:30,562
- You just want me to use all the money

787
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,438
for the business, right?

788
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:34,083
- Yes, so don't buy another thing.

789
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,583
No more nice jacket.

790
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,607
- That's from my mom, so.

791
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:38,440
- Respect.

792
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,404
(laughter)

793
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,237
(applause)

794
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,709
That's good. That's good.

795
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:46,709
Yeah, I think a small
company that makes posters

796
00:29:47,574 --> 00:29:49,519
number one arbitrage,

797
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,589
is to make posters for free

798
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,521
for things that will give them awareness.

799
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:54,510
When people are like,

800
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,343
"who made that poster?",

801
00:29:55,343 --> 00:29:56,281
if your brand's there,

802
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:57,114
things of that nature,

803
00:29:57,114 --> 00:30:00,330
that is your number one move
you can do when you're tiny.

804
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,315
And so you just need to
be able to afford that,

805
00:30:02,315 --> 00:30:06,635
including selling the nice
jacket that your mom gave you.

806
00:30:06,635 --> 00:30:09,968
(laughter and applause)

807
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:14,690
- Thank you man.

808
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,811
- You're welcome.

809
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:19,384
- [Host] Okay, Miguel, where are you?

810
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,217
- But you know what?

811
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:21,958
Real quick because it's a funny moment,

812
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,603
it's just very true.

813
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:27,900
Like, there's a reason
immigrants over-index in success.

814
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,001
That's the kind of shit they do.

815
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:31,314
They don't buy anything.

816
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:35,133
They live in a place that has
a shitty house for seven years

817
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,033
and save every dollar

818
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,627
even though they could've
moved out two years earlier

819
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:39,778
or four years earlier.

820
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:42,556
Non-entrepreneurs, as soon
as they get a little money,

821
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:43,664
buy dumb shit,

822
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:47,226
instead of putting it
back into their business.

823
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:49,281
And so like, it seems like a funny joke,

824
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,549
but like, when you have no options,

825
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,464
you have no options.

826
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:55,522
Like it's not miraculously gonna happen

827
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:59,461
and everybody got tricked because
of venture capital funding

828
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:01,015
and everybody thinks they're
gonna writer a business plan

829
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:04,287
on paper and go out and
find some miraculous VC

830
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:05,596
and then they complain,

831
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,606
well in Denmark and Norway
they don't have good VCs,

832
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:09,671
but Silicon Valley,

833
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,357
Silicon Valley's a fuckin' bitch too.

834
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:13,332
They'll take the meeting,

835
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:15,517
but not gonna give you money either.

836
00:31:15,517 --> 00:31:18,498
And so, we need to be
smart and more practical.

837
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:19,915
That's real life.

838
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:23,319
- [Host] Thank you.

839
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,839
- You're welcome.

840
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,089
(applause)

841
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:31,043
- [Host] Okay, Miguel where are you?

842
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:32,807
Down here, can we get a mic now?

843
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,683
- Smack in the middle.

844
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,641
- [Host] Yeah.

845
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:35,883
- Hey Miguel.

846
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:36,716
- Oh my god.

847
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:39,109
Gary V. is in the house and
I'm about to ask a question.

848
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:39,942
- Yes you are.

849
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,466
- Okay, hi Gary, is it possible --

850
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,299
- How are you?

851
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:43,904
- Very good.

852
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,303
If you're about to open a
trampoline park in Copenhagen

853
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:47,346
in around four month,

854
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:48,895
how would you approach the marketing

855
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:51,310
until the opening and after?

856
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,539
- Okay, let's start with the four months.

857
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,400
Is that an arbitrary thing
or is that a 100% locked in?

858
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,265
Like, why four months?

859
00:31:58,265 --> 00:31:59,813
- Had a meeting with the owner, the boss,

860
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:02,152
yesterday and he wants me to run it,

861
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:04,851
but he want to do the
marketing and I ask him,

862
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:06,252
what would you do?

863
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:09,344
Facebook ads and Google ads and that's it.

864
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,423
- That's what you asked him?

865
00:32:10,423 --> 00:32:12,459
- Yes, he would do the marketing

866
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:15,740
with Facebook ads and Google ads.

867
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,674
- And that's what he wants to do?

868
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:17,603
- That's it.

869
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:18,436
- Okay.

870
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,839
- And what would you do?

871
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,923
- I'm very high on that.

872
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:24,531
You know, I kind of did a
little bit of homework on

873
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:26,255
like the attention arbitrage in Copenhagen

874
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:27,091
before I got here.

875
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:28,429
I think that's cool.

876
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,330
I would just add influencer
marketing on top of that.

877
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,303
I think there's a lot
of Instagram, Snapchat,

878
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:35,154
Facebook personalities that could bring

879
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:39,024
disproportionate attention
to this and are under-priced.

880
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,723
It's incredible to me that
there's a lot of individuals

881
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:45,397
in the Copenhagen metro area and suburbs

882
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:48,064
that you could invite for free,

883
00:32:48,064 --> 00:32:50,607
that even have 719 fans or 3,000 fans

884
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:52,644
on some of these platforms,

885
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:56,146
that the ROI of you giving it
to them for free for the photo

886
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:59,479
is worth it for you from
a business standpoint.

887
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,082
So I would say those three and then look,

888
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,366
it's very abstract

889
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,417
to say you're gonna do
Facebook and Google.

890
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,332
Really understanding the
content that you need to make

891
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:12,800
in a Facebook environment
is incredibly important.

892
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,925
So you can waste $10,000 on
Facebook in a month very quickly

893
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:18,094
if you don't know what you're doing.

894
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:19,859
And so, just make sure

895
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:21,587
that you guys have a deep understanding

896
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:23,031
on the kind of content that will convert.

897
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:24,095
Are you trying to,

898
00:33:24,095 --> 00:33:25,844
and then also the four months before

899
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:26,677
and the four months after.

900
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:28,064
In the four months before,

901
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,043
I would drive them to a landing
page that has a Google form

902
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,450
that fills out so that
you can use that data

903
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,810
to re-market when you open,

904
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,755
than after the fact,

905
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:40,124
you're driving them to a place
where frictionless, you know,

906
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:41,508
conversion to the tickets

907
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:45,312
or the packages that you're selling.

908
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:47,065
- What about something like,

909
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:51,507
make people, you know, the
journey of now we're here,

910
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:54,356
now they're manufacturing the
trampoline parts in Hanover --

911
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:55,872
- You know this is the thing

912
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:57,597
similar to the VR physical service.

913
00:33:57,597 --> 00:33:58,472
This is the thing

914
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:00,484
that I wanna make sure
everybody understands,

915
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:02,304
'cause a lot of you are paying
attention to what I'm doing

916
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:03,439
and I'm a believer.

917
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:06,518
I'm a believer in the
"documenting the journey".

918
00:34:06,518 --> 00:34:07,746
Instead of creating.

919
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,192
I just wanna remind everybody

920
00:34:09,192 --> 00:34:12,672
that there are millions of
documentaries made every year,

921
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:17,179
but only 13 of them are things
that people wanna watch.

922
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,748
So, yes, I believe it,

923
00:34:19,748 --> 00:34:21,822
but can you and can he and can others

924
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:23,282
make a great --

925
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:24,116
- Yes.

926
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:25,292
- Documentary on the journey

927
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,129
that makes people really wanna watch

928
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,786
and fall in love with
the characters, you and,

929
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:32,608
That is a real challenge,

930
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:33,936
but if you can do it,

931
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:36,320
yes, I'm super interested in
it and I wanna remind everybody

932
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,846
that's now thinking about this

933
00:34:37,846 --> 00:34:38,873
first time they're hearing it,

934
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:41,703
there's so much young talent out there

935
00:34:41,703 --> 00:34:43,771
that just wanna get their, you know,

936
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:47,739
their first work out
there as a videographer

937
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,024
or as a post editor.

938
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:50,302
I believe that everybody here

939
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:52,719
can hire two to three
incredible, creative interns,

940
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,664
pay them very little,

941
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:58,293
but their ROI is the work
and they get a body of work.

942
00:34:58,293 --> 00:35:01,183
And that's an incredible
opportunity for both parties.

943
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,735
We've never had people that
have been editing on Youtube

944
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:04,892
since they were six years old

945
00:35:04,892 --> 00:35:06,975
and are now 17 and producing

946
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:09,619
this kind of quality, post production.

947
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,601
That is not the world we grew up in.

948
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,777
And so, I think yes,

949
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:15,057
and keep in mind that you might be able

950
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:16,258
to grab the extra hands.

951
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:17,945
Even for poster, you know like,

952
00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:20,604
the fact that you can get
somebody "to work for free"

953
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:24,557
because for her the
documentation output is a project

954
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:28,042
she can point to if she
chooses to take that risk

955
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,525
'cause she has the same mindset
as you to "work for free".

956
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:32,322
I think there's a lot
of creators out there

957
00:35:32,322 --> 00:35:33,468
that are looking for opportunities,

958
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:36,181
minimum wage, free and
obviously there's laws

959
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:38,285
and you'll have to navigate
the reality of what you can do,

960
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:41,189
but very low cost, high quality creators

961
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:43,284
are in the system right now.

962
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:44,672
Another thing for you to think about.

963
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:48,180
Look, for sure, if you could make a Vlog

964
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,166
of the road leading up to this,

965
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,731
but I'm telling you right now brother,

966
00:35:51,731 --> 00:35:55,093
it's hard to get people to
get really excited and watch.

967
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:57,278
So I don't want you to disproportionately

968
00:35:57,278 --> 00:35:58,479
put too much energy into it

969
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:00,303
or be thoughtful and go all in

970
00:36:00,303 --> 00:36:01,760
for six to eight weeks and if you don't,

971
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,404
you know, you've got
to be smart about that.

972
00:36:03,404 --> 00:36:07,270
Can't be ideological about
documenting versus creating.

973
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,972
Can't be ideological about anything.

974
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:13,352
You know, theory is only
as good as the execution

975
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:15,352
that creates the result that you want.

976
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:17,714
Things that I believe
in change by the minute

977
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:20,535
if I don't like the way the
cadence of the attention

978
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:22,348
or the platforms are evolving.

979
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:25,946
So my religion is never
what's talked about last week

980
00:36:25,946 --> 00:36:27,065
or last year.

981
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:29,036
My religion is what's
happening right this minute

982
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:31,377
in the creative and
distribution opportunity

983
00:36:31,377 --> 00:36:33,549
of communications to create the donation,

984
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:34,937
the voting for my candidate,

985
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:37,851
the opening of my
trampoline park, you know.

986
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:41,306
I worry that people that follow
me think that these things

987
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:44,612
are set in stone 'cause they've
not been carefully watching

988
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:45,720
the last ten years

989
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,969
where I will change my point of view

990
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:49,635
on anything other than
if I think your attention

991
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:51,081
is in a place that's under-priced,

992
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:53,081
that's where I wanna be.

993
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:55,042
- Thanks a lot.

994
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:55,875
- You got it.

995
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,125
(applause)

996
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,193
- [Host] Now for Maria Elaine.

997
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:06,004
Where are you?

998
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,328
Here? Can we get a mic on her down here?

999
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:09,161
- Right here.

1000
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:10,494
- Here. Perfect.

1001
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:13,785
- Hi.

1002
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:14,672
- Hi.

1003
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:16,482
- I'd like to ask you what the one thing

1004
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:18,275
that you make sure to do every day

1005
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:22,353
to keep strengthening
your online performances?

1006
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:24,565
- To deploy gratitude
that the seven people

1007
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:26,729
I love the most are healthy.

1008
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:28,142
- Okay.

1009
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:30,099
- I mean that's the real
answer that I'm not sure

1010
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,760
if it brings anybody any value

1011
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,038
or maybe it brings a lot
of people a lot of value.

1012
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:35,335
That's the truth.

1013
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,612
Like, none of this works
unless I'm in the right,

1014
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:41,479
you know, grateful, passionate,
excited about it standpoint.

1015
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:43,784
'Cause all this shit is hard.

1016
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:46,052
And so for me, all of this is mindset.

1017
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:47,119
There's no tactic.

1018
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,817
There's no double checking
the copy on my Facebook post.

1019
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:54,371
There's no updating the
picture on Instagram.

1020
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:57,566
There's no looking at all
the replies on Twitter.

1021
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:02,195
All of that is so secondary
to "am I in a good place"

1022
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:04,897
to do the amount of work that is required

1023
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,842
to do more, more, more, more, more,

1024
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:08,972
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1025
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:11,143
It's why I'm so fearful right
now about entrepreneurship

1026
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:13,313
because I think a lot
of people are doing it

1027
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:15,827
'cause it's cool or it seems cool.

1028
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,674
And it's so hard and so
lonely and exposes you so much

1029
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,686
that I want people in the right mindset.

1030
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:24,320
So there's no tactic I do every day

1031
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,320
other than consume and listen.

1032
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,447
I read my email.

1033
00:38:28,447 --> 00:38:30,170
I look at the replies on Twitter.

1034
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,485
I read all the replies from
the night before on Instagram

1035
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:34,333
from my pictures.

1036
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,803
I'm very qualitative.

1037
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:38,533
I don't care how many likes or shares.

1038
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,192
I don't care about it
as much about the data.

1039
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,169
I understand it. I see it.

1040
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:46,929
But I'm spending a lot more
time on the gray, the vibes

1041
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:49,382
that I get from the
comments and engagement

1042
00:38:49,382 --> 00:38:52,365
of the community to give me
an indicator of what's working

1043
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:53,699
and what's not working.

1044
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,168
Like a performer that does,

1045
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:56,492
it's kind of why I'm
a good public speaker.

1046
00:38:56,492 --> 00:38:59,009
I'm, right now, creating context

1047
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,422
on what you guys are interested in

1048
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,497
and it's already formulating my keynote

1049
00:39:02,497 --> 00:39:03,990
that's gonna come in an hour

1050
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,346
based on this Q & A session.

1051
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,842
That's good.

1052
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:09,477
That's what makes me good at what I do.

1053
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:11,487
I do that with my creative,

1054
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:12,320
with my businesses.

1055
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,472
To be very frank,

1056
00:39:13,472 --> 00:39:15,722
with my whole fuckin' life.

1057
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:17,518
- Thank you.

1058
00:39:17,518 --> 00:39:18,810
- You're welcome.

1059
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,060
(applause)

1060
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:28,077
- [Host] Maria Lucia, where are you?

1061
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,730
- Hi Gary. I'm here.

1062
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,607
- Hi.

1063
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:33,407
- Thank you for visiting Copenhagen.

1064
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:35,186
- Thanks for having me.

1065
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:39,707
- So, when we talk about
success, like in general,

1066
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:43,874
what do you define as your
absolutely personal success?

1067
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,032
- That's interesting.

1068
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:50,240
Um, you know, for me I don't think

1069
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,637
about my absolute personal success

1070
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:55,120
in the micro or the short term.

1071
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,681
I think about my ultimate
personal success in the long term.

1072
00:39:58,681 --> 00:40:02,019
So, somewhere in about 15 to 20 years

1073
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:03,180
when I have a tremendous read

1074
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,427
on who my two children
are as human beings,

1075
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:10,301
that will be a very
big judgment day for me

1076
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:12,547
on my personal success.

1077
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:15,630
In 25 years when a intern named Cathy

1078
00:40:16,743 --> 00:40:19,906
that starts today is
running a huge business

1079
00:40:19,906 --> 00:40:23,437
and she learned at Vayner
Media the right things to do

1080
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:24,742
to build a huge business,

1081
00:40:24,742 --> 00:40:26,805
that will be my personal success.

1082
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:29,863
Right now I'm living out Sasha

1083
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:31,889
and Tamara's personal success.

1084
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:34,918
Right now I'm a by-product
of what my parenting

1085
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:38,433
and my upbringing and my nuances.

1086
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:41,990
My personal success has
a little bit more to go

1087
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,827
and I think that's how I think about it.

1088
00:40:43,827 --> 00:40:46,494
And as long as I am daily acting

1089
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,598
on that long term legacy North Star

1090
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:52,820
and that everything that
comes out of my mouth

1091
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,488
and everything that I do

1092
00:40:54,488 --> 00:40:56,723
spends disproportionate amount of time

1093
00:40:56,723 --> 00:41:00,019
on how Misha and Zander
and the rest of my family

1094
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:02,031
and my employees are affected by it

1095
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:04,344
and what it sets up for them,

1096
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:06,486
that's basically how I think about.

1097
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:08,486
I live my life only,

1098
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:12,653
only based on what people are
saying behind my back, right?

1099
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:16,328
You know, it's interesting right?

1100
00:41:16,328 --> 00:41:18,754
It's basically my framework, you know.

1101
00:41:18,754 --> 00:41:19,920
People are always like,

1102
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,799
man, he's so nice.

1103
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:24,615
I'm nice because when I
stop to take one more selfie

1104
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,755
and say hello and look you in the face

1105
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:27,906
and listen to your question,

1106
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:31,131
that's what you're gonna
say about me when I'm gone.

1107
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:31,964
And so I,

1108
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,996
success for me is not in the short term.

1109
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,323
It's just, you know, to me,

1110
00:41:37,323 --> 00:41:38,756
playing the game is success,

1111
00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:40,627
waking up in the morning is success,

1112
00:41:40,627 --> 00:41:42,911
being able to be who I am is success.

1113
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:44,362
That's what I love about entrepreneurship.

1114
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:46,138
You're in control.

1115
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:49,971
But the absolute personal,
you know, judgement

1116
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:53,601
is a long, long way away.

1117
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:54,683
You know it's very interesting for me,

1118
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:55,567
I apologize.

1119
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:56,944
It's very interesting for me right now

1120
00:41:56,944 --> 00:41:57,818
what's happening in the world

1121
00:41:57,818 --> 00:41:59,445
that people are getting exposed.

1122
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:01,379
A whole lot of people are being taken down

1123
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:02,940
and I love that.

1124
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,351
I love it because the
truth should be undefeated.

1125
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:08,105
I don't, you know, I like that.

1126
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:10,027
I like when merit wins,

1127
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,542
when the truth wins.

1128
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:15,449
And so for some us that are
living our lives that way,

1129
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,782
this is very exciting times.

1130
00:42:20,317 --> 00:42:21,191
(applause)

1131
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:22,234
- Thank you.

1132
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:23,651
- You're welcome.

1133
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:29,249
- [Host] Daniel, yeah?

1134
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,043
- Hey Gary.

1135
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:33,919
- How are you Daniel?

1136
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:37,781
- Good. I've been watching
your Q & A, "Ask Gary"

1137
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:41,052
and try to make my own
version of it and --

1138
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:41,937
- What's it called?

1139
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:44,420
- S & P integration Q & A.

1140
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,296
- Understood.

1141
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:49,081
- So it's a car technical
and that's my challenge here

1142
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:51,414
about how do I both make it,

1143
00:42:52,263 --> 00:42:54,449
well technical, how do
we present these things

1144
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:57,449
and as you talked about earlier here

1145
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,663
about make it a bit
more entertaining or --

1146
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:05,758
- Don't, you know, if you're
gonna make a documentary

1147
00:43:05,758 --> 00:43:07,331
which comes across as a film,

1148
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:09,175
there's got to be an entertainment value

1149
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:12,863
because the structure of a film
or documentary is escapism.

1150
00:43:12,863 --> 00:43:14,657
We're there to get caught up in the story

1151
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:16,673
so we don't have to think
about the real world,

1152
00:43:16,673 --> 00:43:19,725
that's why we like music, sports and film.

1153
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:21,000
When you're doing something technical,

1154
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,267
you're in the utility education business.

1155
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,646
It does not have to be entertaining.

1156
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:26,520
- Okay.

1157
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,751
- You don't come across as
the most entertaining dude

1158
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:29,626
I've ever seen.

1159
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:30,501
(laughter)

1160
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:32,452
Like I'm being frank.

1161
00:43:32,452 --> 00:43:33,521
Guess what though?

1162
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:34,455
Guess what?

1163
00:43:34,455 --> 00:43:36,506
And I'm not razzing or making a joke,

1164
00:43:36,506 --> 00:43:39,158
I need you to understand
why this is important.

1165
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,778
If you fuckin' know your craft,

1166
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:43,395
and you know what the
fuck you're talking about,

1167
00:43:43,395 --> 00:43:45,443
it's not gonna matter
how fuckin' charismatic

1168
00:43:45,443 --> 00:43:46,627
or funny you are,

1169
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,481
you will win on your merit.

1170
00:43:48,481 --> 00:43:50,650
You just might need to
be extremely patient

1171
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,133
because when there's small niches,

1172
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:54,666
it takes time to hit any critical mass

1173
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,983
'cause usually there is no critical mass.

1174
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:58,231
And the way you surround your team

1175
00:43:58,231 --> 00:43:59,568
with people that don't understand

1176
00:43:59,568 --> 00:44:01,612
is you find people that do understand.

1177
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:02,445
- Okay.

1178
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:03,278
- You know, there's no --

1179
00:44:03,278 --> 00:44:04,111
- So that will be the intern or whatever.

1180
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:04,944
- That's right.

1181
00:44:04,944 --> 00:44:06,138
When I built Wine Library for people

1182
00:44:06,138 --> 00:44:08,748
that worked on the floor
that knew about wine,

1183
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:11,296
they needed to know about wine.

1184
00:44:11,296 --> 00:44:14,522
Like, you know, there's plenty
people that I saw and like,

1185
00:44:14,522 --> 00:44:16,088
oh, she's an amazing salesperson,

1186
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,878
but then when I ask her
about Chateauneuf du Pape,

1187
00:44:17,878 --> 00:44:19,388
if she didn't know what it was,

1188
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:20,813
that wasn't gonna cut it.

1189
00:44:20,813 --> 00:44:21,950
Because the business I was in,

1190
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,352
you expected to walk in the store

1191
00:44:23,352 --> 00:44:25,729
and you had questions
and you needed answers

1192
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,458
and it was important.

1193
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,411
So I don't think you should run
away into the entertainment.

1194
00:44:29,411 --> 00:44:32,754
I think you should triple
down into technical,

1195
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,275
utility and knowledge.

1196
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:35,325
'Cause that wins too.

1197
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:36,210
- Okay.

1198
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,086
- You know?

1199
00:44:37,086 --> 00:44:40,718
It may not get you millions
of followers on Instagram,

1200
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:42,176
but that's not what
you're trying to achieve.

1201
00:44:42,176 --> 00:44:44,208
You're trying to achieve
what you're trying to achieve

1202
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:46,374
and so I think that that's great.

1203
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:49,121
And I would triple down on the depth,

1204
00:44:49,121 --> 00:44:50,744
not the width.

1205
00:44:50,744 --> 00:44:52,827
- Okay, so just more technical content.

1206
00:44:52,827 --> 00:44:56,410
- And then remember,
audio, written, video.

1207
00:44:57,957 --> 00:44:59,562
Have you had to take a step back

1208
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:01,755
and be self aware about which platform

1209
00:45:01,755 --> 00:45:04,836
you're best at communicating
is very important

1210
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:06,380
and then understanding going forward,

1211
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,760
just like yes, yes, yes, all of them,

1212
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,938
all of you are going to
have to produce content

1213
00:45:11,938 --> 00:45:16,675
in written, audio and video
form to be relevant in the noise

1214
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,151
that is coming in 2022.

1215
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:20,597
'Cause you have to let the consumer pick

1216
00:45:20,597 --> 00:45:23,994
which medium is best for them
and you have to be everywhere

1217
00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:25,317
to really win.

1218
00:45:25,317 --> 00:45:26,760
I mean, you can't be
everywhere right away,

1219
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,923
I get it.

1220
00:45:27,923 --> 00:45:30,293
But you have to wrap your head
around that and as for me,

1221
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:32,415
somebody who could not put
three sentences together

1222
00:45:32,415 --> 00:45:34,316
that make any cohesive sense,

1223
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:35,860
I get to hire a ghostwriter

1224
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,331
who is listening right now to this video

1225
00:45:38,331 --> 00:45:41,026
and transcribing it and
then is gonna call me

1226
00:45:41,026 --> 00:45:42,566
and ask me five more questions

1227
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:43,990
and I'm gonna answer them

1228
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,149
and that's how I make my
LinkedIn and medium posts.

1229
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:48,218
- Mmm. Okay.

1230
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:49,609
- And at first I couldn't afford that.

1231
00:45:49,609 --> 00:45:51,768
So I had to give up on
writing and had to wait.

1232
00:45:51,768 --> 00:45:54,127
And so like, we all go
through these journeys,

1233
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,517
but you know, you've
gotta really give thought

1234
00:45:56,517 --> 00:45:57,936
to the mediums too.

1235
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:01,476
You could have a very
successful, super niche podcast

1236
00:46:01,476 --> 00:46:03,920
where you're just talking this stuff out

1237
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,709
and the 1800 people
you're trying to reach,

1238
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,847
700 of them listen to the podcast,

1239
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:09,998
you will win.

1240
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:12,343
If that's how narrow your world is.

1241
00:46:12,343 --> 00:46:13,467
- True. Thanks.

1242
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:14,341
- You're welcome.

1243
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:16,591
(applause)

1244
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:23,193
- [Host] And now it's your turn.

1245
00:46:23,193 --> 00:46:25,069
So do we have the first up?

1246
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:25,986
Yeah? Yeah.

1247
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:29,398
- Pick me, pick me.
- He's quick.

1248
00:46:29,398 --> 00:46:30,279
- Hi, how are you doin'?

1249
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:31,680
Simon Steven.

1250
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,554
- How are you?

1251
00:46:32,554 --> 00:46:34,183
- So, actually I don't
have a question for you.

1252
00:46:34,183 --> 00:46:36,625
I've been following you a couple of years.

1253
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:39,807
You've given me so many
ideas and thought awakenings

1254
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:43,523
that I thought, man I owe you, big time.

1255
00:46:43,523 --> 00:46:46,183
But there's no way I can
pay you back at the moment

1256
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:47,981
so I thought I'll give you something

1257
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:50,641
that might bring you a little bit of joy.

1258
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,208
And I know your background
into wine quite a bit now,

1259
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,925
but I just realized that you
drink a lot of white wine.

1260
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:56,758
- I am.

1261
00:46:56,758 --> 00:46:57,758
- But still.

1262
00:46:59,288 --> 00:47:00,174
(light laughter from audience)

1263
00:47:00,174 --> 00:47:03,359
So, I'm bringing with me a
Pierre Long Chateauneuf Du Pape.

1264
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,233
- Very nice.

1265
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:05,586
- From 2011.

1266
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:06,703
I hope you like it.

1267
00:47:06,703 --> 00:47:07,790
It's what I can give you

1268
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,270
as just a way of saying, "Thank you, man".

1269
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,940
- It's very nice. Please.

1270
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,200
- [Host] Give him a hand.

1271
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,450
(applause)

1272
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:17,202
- Real pleasure.

1273
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,077
Thank you man.

1274
00:47:18,077 --> 00:47:19,538
Thank you so much.

1275
00:47:19,538 --> 00:47:21,788
(applause)

1276
00:47:24,027 --> 00:47:27,743
You know what's amazing about life?

1277
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,699
The fact that I was just giving an analogy

1278
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:31,665
of wine store knowledge.

1279
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:33,645
And of all the wines in the world,

1280
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:35,802
that I used Chateauneuf
du Pape as the example,

1281
00:47:35,802 --> 00:47:37,587
which is pretty esoteric.

1282
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:39,775
And for that to be the wine?

1283
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,302
Like that's when I'm like
the universe is looking at me

1284
00:47:42,302 --> 00:47:43,980
and saying, "keep going", you know?

1285
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,813
(applause)

1286
00:47:44,813 --> 00:47:46,230
It's interesting.

1287
00:47:51,894 --> 00:47:53,926
- [Host] And we have one more over here.

1288
00:47:53,926 --> 00:47:55,893
Casper, behind you.

1289
00:47:55,893 --> 00:47:57,226
Yeah, thank you.

1290
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,533
- Cool, hi Gary.
- How are you?

1291
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:01,791
- Guys, real quick, just so you know,

1292
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,524
between the other Q & A and the keynote

1293
00:48:04,524 --> 00:48:05,905
and the fact that we're covering so much,

1294
00:48:05,905 --> 00:48:07,291
I've made a new decision.

1295
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,587
I'm gonna answer every
single person's question

1296
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,257
in this conference.

1297
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:14,139
So you better get way more extrovert

1298
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:15,337
and start raising your hands

1299
00:48:15,337 --> 00:48:16,998
because I'm gonna
systematically pick on you

1300
00:48:16,998 --> 00:48:18,896
over the next three hours.

1301
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:19,771
Go ahead.

1302
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,647
- Hi Gary.

1303
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,814
- How are you?

1304
00:48:23,054 --> 00:48:23,987
- My name is Vasille.

1305
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:26,076
I've been watching your
content for more than a year,

1306
00:48:26,076 --> 00:48:28,612
actually saw you live in
the Bucharest in Branmines

1307
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:29,445
if you --

1308
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:30,278
- Yes.

1309
00:48:30,278 --> 00:48:31,111
- Remember that.

1310
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:31,944
- I sure do.

1311
00:48:31,944 --> 00:48:34,046
- Also possibility to
ask you a question there

1312
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:35,973
and just wanna say, you know,

1313
00:48:35,973 --> 00:48:38,974
thank you so much for
everything you've been done.

1314
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:40,756
And in Bucharest I asked,

1315
00:48:40,756 --> 00:48:43,439
I shared my success as
well as a entrepreneur

1316
00:48:43,439 --> 00:48:47,210
where I was successful
building E-commerce store

1317
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:48,168
with influence and marketing.

1318
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:49,001
- I remember.

1319
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:49,834
- For DMing, 100, 200 people.

1320
00:48:49,834 --> 00:48:50,667
- I remember.

1321
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:51,500
I remember.

1322
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,225
- And also my journey on
the Fiverr.com platform.

1323
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:55,739
And so you know, interesting fact

1324
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:58,807
that after that I saw
the keynote you posted

1325
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:02,394
and it brought so much
attention to my Fiverr profile.

1326
00:49:02,394 --> 00:49:04,497
It started getting a lot
of, you know, context.

1327
00:49:04,497 --> 00:49:05,592
So I just wanna say, you know,

1328
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:06,425
thank you so much for this.

1329
00:49:06,425 --> 00:49:07,258
- You're welcome.

1330
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:08,666
It was incredible amount of opportunity.

1331
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:09,499
- Good.

1332
00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:11,528
- And from this, you know, freelancing,

1333
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:13,915
I was able to build a as a
social media marketing agency,

1334
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:15,601
you know, on Fiverr.

1335
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:16,913
And my question to you is,

1336
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:20,349
I started to work on my personal branding

1337
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:22,474
and I just got invited to some conference,

1338
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:24,157
business conference to speak

1339
00:49:24,157 --> 00:49:25,462
and I wanna ask you,

1340
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:30,055
if I start continue to, you
know, expand personal branding,

1341
00:49:30,055 --> 00:49:33,225
would help me get bigger clients?

1342
00:49:33,225 --> 00:49:34,058
- Yes.

1343
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:34,891
- You know we've uh --

1344
00:49:34,891 --> 00:49:35,724
- Yes.

1345
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:36,557
- Like bigger companies.

1346
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,390
- Yes.

1347
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:40,265
- Or would it also just
bring like audience to you,

1348
00:49:40,265 --> 00:49:42,381
like you have a large
audience following you.

1349
00:49:42,381 --> 00:49:44,810
So do you, what do you have, you know,

1350
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:45,950
opinion on that.

1351
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,158
Working personal brand to --

1352
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:48,727
- Both are gonna happen.

1353
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:49,560
- Okay.

1354
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,621
Thank you.

1355
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:53,921
- That's my opinion Visalle.

1356
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:54,769
- Thank you.

1357
00:49:54,769 --> 00:49:55,703
- Like, both will happen, right?

1358
00:49:55,703 --> 00:49:57,387
And so what will happen is

1359
00:49:57,387 --> 00:49:58,902
you'll get bigger clients

1360
00:49:58,902 --> 00:50:02,024
because what you're
doing is building brand.

1361
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:04,699
I love it when people get
cynical about personal brand,

1362
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:07,120
'cause I know there's cynicism around it.

1363
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,466
All it, you know,

1364
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:09,765
if you don't like the word personal brand,

1365
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:11,928
let's call it something else.

1366
00:50:11,928 --> 00:50:12,845
Reputation.

1367
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:15,845
Yes, if you have a bigger reputation,

1368
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:17,753
things will happen, right?

1369
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:20,056
What will happen is on
the personal brand side,

1370
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:23,270
fans or audience, not clients,

1371
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,152
what will happen is opportunity.

1372
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:29,485
You know, every single investment I made

1373
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:32,604
that made me tens of millions of dollars

1374
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:34,763
were built on the back
of a personal brand.

1375
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:35,596
It built me opportunities.

1376
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:37,095
It created meetings for me.

1377
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:38,311
It's how I got to places.

1378
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:40,454
Of course reputation matters.

1379
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,722
It's always mattered.

1380
00:50:41,722 --> 00:50:45,495
People are now trying to
comprehend what's happening here

1381
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:48,950
because it's become bigger
then the mainstream media.

1382
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,602
Everybody here can be as
big as they want to be

1383
00:50:51,602 --> 00:50:54,073
on merit and skill and that's incredible

1384
00:50:54,073 --> 00:50:57,860
because we use to be gateway
and gatekeepers, right?

1385
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,560
So, yeah, both will happen

1386
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,635
and then you'll decide what you wanna do.

1387
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:05,131
I could easily make 30
million dollars a year

1388
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:06,733
being Gary V.

1389
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:09,337
I choose not to because I
still wanna be a business man

1390
00:51:09,337 --> 00:51:11,595
and that's why I have an 800 person agency

1391
00:51:11,595 --> 00:51:14,000
and that's why I'm gonna have 18 Fiverrs

1392
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,146
when I get off stage 'cause
I wanna build businesses.

1393
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:17,865
I don't wanna be just a personal brand.

1394
00:51:17,865 --> 00:51:20,501
But that doesn't mean that's wrong.

1395
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:22,115
And there's a lot of people who do that

1396
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:23,378
and if that's what you wanna do,

1397
00:51:23,378 --> 00:51:25,217
the more awareness you have,

1398
00:51:25,217 --> 00:51:28,305
you will be given
something called options.

1399
00:51:28,305 --> 00:51:29,731
And let me promise you something,

1400
00:51:29,731 --> 00:51:31,148
options are good.

1401
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,401
- Yeah, thank you Gary.

1402
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:38,115
And I wanted to ask you as
well for Fiverr platform,

1403
00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:39,405
do you, what are your thoughts on that,

1404
00:51:39,405 --> 00:51:41,218
like, if we're expanding our services.

1405
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:42,847
We're getting a lot of requests.

1406
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:44,744
We're like top rate seller, you know,

1407
00:51:44,744 --> 00:51:46,501
in the top category for
social media marketing.

1408
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:48,503
So, what are your thoughts
on expanding that,

1409
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:51,008
going into fields like
doing production video,

1410
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:52,561
maybe you know, building like a brand --

1411
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:55,231
- I think you should
use it as a gateway drug

1412
00:51:55,231 --> 00:51:56,648
to bigger scopes.

1413
00:51:57,558 --> 00:51:58,929
- Okay. Thanks Gary.

1414
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:01,274
And the last question, sorry for that.

1415
00:52:01,274 --> 00:52:04,389
But is there any chance
foreseeability to have, you know,

1416
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:06,803
10, 15 minute talk to you one on one,

1417
00:52:06,803 --> 00:52:09,493
at some point, maybe in
your future conferences

1418
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,993
like in Stockholm or maybe
could be just Face Time

1419
00:52:11,993 --> 00:52:14,122
or anything like that.

1420
00:52:14,122 --> 00:52:15,929
- Maybe in the back half of 18

1421
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:18,340
'cause I'm fighting for
every minute right now.

1422
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,894
But if you send me an email and say,

1423
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:22,598
"I'm the Fiverr guy who
asked 47 different questions.

1424
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,651
(laughter)

1425
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:26,220
I'll see that and we'll set something up.

1426
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,886
- Thank you so much Gary.
- You're welcome.

1427
00:52:27,886 --> 00:52:29,093
- Thank you, thank you so much.

1428
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:31,343
(applause)

1429
00:52:32,705 --> 00:52:34,116
- Now there's people everywhere.

1430
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,783
Great, we've broken the ceiling.

1431
00:52:38,337 --> 00:52:39,201
Who's next?

1432
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,396
- [Host] Yeah, in the back.

1433
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:41,229
- Hi.

1434
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:43,061
- Hi. Hi Gary.

1435
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:43,894
- Hi.

1436
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:44,727
- I'm Christina.

1437
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:45,560
- Christina, how are you?

1438
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,502
- Thank you for being here
and I didn't know you at all

1439
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:50,720
until a few days ago and
I don't think I ever --

1440
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,553
- Thanks a lot.

1441
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:52,605
- Learned to pronounce --
- Okay ...

1442
00:52:52,605 --> 00:52:53,588
- Your last name,

1443
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:56,569
but the only thing I know about you is

1444
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:58,690
I watch one single of your videos

1445
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,842
and in that one you were talking about

1446
00:53:00,842 --> 00:53:02,962
one is better than zero.

1447
00:53:02,962 --> 00:53:03,795
- Yes.

1448
00:53:03,795 --> 00:53:06,043
- If you can get your
message across to one person,

1449
00:53:06,043 --> 00:53:07,726
it's better than to zero.

1450
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,754
And that was at the time

1451
00:53:08,754 --> 00:53:10,879
when I was really dying to make videos,

1452
00:53:10,879 --> 00:53:13,604
but I really didn't dare
to put myself out there

1453
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,776
because of failure for people might think.

1454
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,509
So I did this one video and
there was one people watching

1455
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:20,610
and she became my client straight away.

1456
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,574
(stifled grin)

1457
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:22,524
So I just wanted to say that.

1458
00:53:22,524 --> 00:53:24,774
(applause)

1459
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:28,026
- That's awesome.

1460
00:53:28,026 --> 00:53:30,915
- And the question very briefly is like,

1461
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:33,784
you know all the salesperson thing

1462
00:53:33,784 --> 00:53:36,604
with the email marketing
and having a lead mark net

1463
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:40,163
and your London page and
building up your subscriber list,

1464
00:53:40,163 --> 00:53:43,157
I see a trend that people are starting

1465
00:53:43,157 --> 00:53:45,561
to scrap their email lists

1466
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:49,075
and creating Facebook groups instead.

1467
00:53:49,075 --> 00:53:52,359
So have their potential
clients into Facebook groups

1468
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:53,598
because that's more interactive.

1469
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:57,872
You can do Lives and Q & A
and sharings and Life Coach

1470
00:53:57,872 --> 00:53:58,705
and stuff like that.

1471
00:53:58,705 --> 00:53:59,906
So I just wanted to hear
your thoughts about that

1472
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:02,341
because right now I don't
where to focus my energies --

1473
00:54:02,341 --> 00:54:03,174
- Both.

1474
00:54:03,174 --> 00:54:04,318
- In my limited time.

1475
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:05,322
- Both.

1476
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:06,155
- Yeah.

1477
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:06,988
- Yeah.

1478
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:10,629
You know, like, both.

1479
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,067
Let's talk it out.

1480
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:14,621
Here's why it's important.

1481
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:16,782
Remember, watch what I'm, you know,

1482
00:54:16,782 --> 00:54:18,323
you haven't seen as much of my content.

1483
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:19,978
A big thing I say is watch what I'm doing,

1484
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:20,999
not what I'm saying.

1485
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:22,483
If you go to GaryVaynerchuk.com right now,

1486
00:54:22,483 --> 00:54:25,073
I want your fuckin' email.

1487
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:29,148
I don't talk about email the
way I did in 1996, 7, 8, 9.

1488
00:54:29,148 --> 00:54:30,386
Because I think it's established.

1489
00:54:30,386 --> 00:54:31,754
I think we all understand what email is,

1490
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:33,207
it's potential.

1491
00:54:33,207 --> 00:54:34,157
I used to have,

1492
00:54:34,157 --> 00:54:36,974
how many people here do
email marketing or have?

1493
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:40,268
In 1997, I had an email
newsletter of 200,000 people

1494
00:54:40,268 --> 00:54:43,371
for wine that had 91% open rates.

1495
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:46,057
Under-priced attention.

1496
00:54:46,057 --> 00:54:47,914
This isn't new for me.

1497
00:54:47,914 --> 00:54:49,501
I'm just figuring out how to articulate

1498
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:52,552
what I've been doing
for the last 20 years.

1499
00:54:52,552 --> 00:54:54,281
That's how I built a three
million dollar business

1500
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:57,332
to a sixty million dollar
business in five and half years

1501
00:54:57,332 --> 00:54:59,147
that had no money,

1502
00:54:59,147 --> 00:55:01,277
making all the right decisions.

1503
00:55:01,277 --> 00:55:02,944
So, here's why, yes.

1504
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:06,042
What happens if Facebook groups,

1505
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:07,112
organic reach,

1506
00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:09,067
they decided that's a new
place they need to monetize

1507
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,820
and they kill it and now you
can't reach those people.

1508
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,853
Like, you have to have both.

1509
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:15,962
You never want to be at
the mercy of a platform

1510
00:55:15,962 --> 00:55:17,949
and you need to always
have insurance policies.

1511
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:19,706
But people pick one or the other.

1512
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:20,606
The new wave says, yes Facebook,

1513
00:55:20,606 --> 00:55:21,439
and they're right.

1514
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:22,714
There's more attention there.

1515
00:55:22,714 --> 00:55:23,772
Email is spam.

1516
00:55:23,772 --> 00:55:25,073
Nobody is reading their email.

1517
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:27,598
It's not converting the same way, right?

1518
00:55:27,598 --> 00:55:30,927
The old guard says I'm
not gonna trust Facebook.

1519
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,428
You know when Facebook's you know,

1520
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:36,619
newsfeed started lowering
organic five years ago,

1521
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:37,452
four years ago,

1522
00:55:37,452 --> 00:55:39,315
they're like, aha, told you sucker.

1523
00:55:39,315 --> 00:55:41,600
The answer's both.

1524
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,320
Yes and yes as I heard
somebody whisper again, right?

1525
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,777
So again, I need everybody here,

1526
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,042
if I leave with anything and I,

1527
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:49,875
this is not,

1528
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:50,708
and DRock will tell you,

1529
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:52,038
this is not something that
I've been pushing very hard,

1530
00:55:52,038 --> 00:55:52,871
audacity.

1531
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:57,163
You have audacity.

1532
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:58,866
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1533
00:55:58,866 --> 00:56:00,590
Who the fuck do I think I am?

1534
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,626
If you wanna live that life
that you're a fuckin' coach

1535
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,773
and people should pay you for the shit

1536
00:56:05,773 --> 00:56:06,852
that's coming outta your head,

1537
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:09,102
you better fuckin' do both.

1538
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:12,253
(snickers)

1539
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:13,086
(applause)

1540
00:56:13,086 --> 00:56:14,753
- That's very clear.

1541
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:18,303
- I'm saying this 'cause
I wanna pressure you,

1542
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:21,045
just like clearly when you saw that video,

1543
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,128
that clicked for you,

1544
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,964
you can't put yourself,

1545
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:27,206
I never put myself in a vulnerable spot.

1546
00:56:27,206 --> 00:56:30,629
And just relying of Facebook
is a vulnerable spot.

1547
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:32,632
But it's where the attention is,

1548
00:56:32,632 --> 00:56:36,799
so I hedge it with having
email and SMS and my website

1549
00:56:37,756 --> 00:56:41,923
and my podcast and, and, and,
and, and, and, and I'm busy.

1550
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:45,892
You know, four offices,

1551
00:56:45,892 --> 00:56:48,240
200 million dollars in
revenue in VaynerX, right?

1552
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,323
Like two young kids, like,
fuckin' in Copenhagen,

1553
00:56:53,357 --> 00:56:54,459
like a fuckin', you know like,

1554
00:56:54,459 --> 00:56:56,241
and so if I'm doing,

1555
00:56:56,241 --> 00:56:58,991
now, my ambitions may be greater,

1556
00:56:59,972 --> 00:57:02,125
but I'm still not gonna let
you be in a vulnerable spot

1557
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,923
where you wake up one day
and a platform makes a change

1558
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:06,839
and you're like, what happened?

1559
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:09,409
People are going out of business
when they only rely on SEO

1560
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:12,320
of just email or just
direct mail or just Facebook

1561
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,221
or just Twitter.

1562
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:16,113
I wish Twitter stayed number one.

1563
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:18,873
I was one of the first people
to have a million followers.

1564
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:20,501
It was great.

1565
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:22,397
It's how a lot of you
first heard about me.

1566
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,095
That was my first coming out moment.

1567
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:25,694
I loved it.

1568
00:57:25,694 --> 00:57:26,901
I didn't want it to change.

1569
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:27,839
I won.

1570
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:28,707
You know how I won?

1571
00:57:28,707 --> 00:57:31,756
By spending 15 hours a day
replying to people on Twitter

1572
00:57:31,756 --> 00:57:34,002
for 3 1/2 years.

1573
00:57:34,002 --> 00:57:35,169
Do you know what that feels like

1574
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:36,161
when you wake up in the morning

1575
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:40,466
and you realize Twitter's
starting to lose its attention?

1576
00:57:40,466 --> 00:57:41,906
Do you know what I did?

1577
00:57:41,906 --> 00:57:42,957
I took the punch in the mouth,

1578
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:44,323
I spit my tooth out

1579
00:57:44,323 --> 00:57:48,229
and I started building
Instagram and Facebook.

1580
00:57:48,229 --> 00:57:50,302
I had no choice.

1581
00:57:50,302 --> 00:57:52,163
So, yes it's harder.

1582
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:53,499
It's more work.

1583
00:57:53,499 --> 00:57:55,459
But the alternative is ugly.

1584
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:57,444
You wanna go work at a bank?

1585
00:57:57,444 --> 00:57:59,905
(chuckling)

1586
00:57:59,905 --> 00:58:00,856
- [Host] Thank you.

1587
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:03,106
(applause)

1588
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:07,113
- Is that it?
- [Host] And unfortunately now

1589
00:58:07,113 --> 00:58:08,175
- I'm the show stopper.

1590
00:58:08,175 --> 00:58:09,008
- Okay.

1591
00:58:09,008 --> 00:58:10,365
- And that's my part of this thing.

1592
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:12,510
- I think we're going away
and coming back, right?

1593
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:13,346
- Yeah. Yeah.

1594
00:58:13,346 --> 00:58:14,884
- I think you guys need to decide

1595
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:16,195
and maybe with you guys,

1596
00:58:16,195 --> 00:58:20,312
is if, that when I come back
for the hour for the keynote,

1597
00:58:20,312 --> 00:58:24,419
you know, how much do we wanna
continue the Q & A at scale?

1598
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:27,795
Because so much of what I
talk about is online to watch.

1599
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:28,839
I'll let you guys decide.

1600
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:29,683
I'm thrilled to talk.

1601
00:58:29,683 --> 00:58:30,736
I love to hear myself talk,

1602
00:58:30,736 --> 00:58:33,544
but I'm thrilled and feel
like there's a lot sitting,

1603
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,501
I can feel it in the Q & A part.

1604
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:36,811
So you guys decide,

1605
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:37,644
you guys decide,

1606
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:38,733
but thank you so much.

1607
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:40,130
- Oh, you can't leave yet.

1608
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:40,963
- Oh.

1609
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:41,796
(applause)

1610
00:58:41,796 --> 00:58:45,407
- Because I have saved
actually a very great question

1611
00:58:45,407 --> 00:58:46,831
'til the last.

1612
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:49,914
So, before I let you go have a break,

1613
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,449
Casper has a question.

1614
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:53,282
- Great.

1615
00:58:53,282 --> 00:58:54,207
- I just wanna ask you Gary,

1616
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:55,886
let's say there's this guy

1617
00:58:55,886 --> 00:58:59,833
who has spent a year to plan something,

1618
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:00,899
plan an event.

1619
00:59:00,899 --> 00:59:01,732
- Yes.

1620
00:59:01,732 --> 00:59:02,565
- He spent all his money.

1621
00:59:02,565 --> 00:59:03,398
- Yes.

1622
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:05,807
- And he feels he has it down.

1623
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:07,968
It's going and it's gonna be great

1624
00:59:07,968 --> 00:59:09,703
and then the day before the event,

1625
00:59:09,703 --> 00:59:11,203
something happens.

1626
00:59:12,434 --> 00:59:14,690
The email that's supposed to go out

1627
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,008
with the last crucial information,

1628
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:18,606
it goes haywire.

1629
00:59:18,606 --> 00:59:22,773
All of sudden we have a guy
who has received 600 emails

1630
00:59:23,947 --> 00:59:26,697
from the organizer of this event.

1631
00:59:27,853 --> 00:59:29,507
Sounds like a terrible situation, right?

1632
00:59:29,507 --> 00:59:30,340
- Yeah, poor guy.

1633
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,173
- Exactly.

1634
00:59:31,173 --> 00:59:33,637
(laughter)

1635
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:36,118
Can you give an example

1636
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:38,200
of how you sometime turn something bad

1637
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,356
into something positive?

1638
00:59:39,356 --> 00:59:41,139
- I had something like this happen.

1639
00:59:41,139 --> 00:59:42,787
So,
- I don't know.

1640
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,886
- No, no, not how did this
something like this happen?

1641
00:59:44,886 --> 00:59:46,469
I had something like this happen.

1642
00:59:46,469 --> 00:59:47,302
- Oh okay.

1643
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:51,135
- I also had an email
from Wine Library, 2007,

1644
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,291
um nine years ago,

1645
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,458
go out instead of once, like 87 times,

1646
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:03,209
which made 11% of the list unsubscribe,

1647
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:06,498
get reported to Google,

1648
01:00:08,163 --> 01:00:09,903
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1649
01:00:09,903 --> 01:00:12,408
And it was probably one of the best things

1650
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,604
that ever happened to me.

1651
01:00:13,604 --> 01:00:15,350
Because what I did was,

1652
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,960
in that scenario,

1653
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,285
to try to parallel to
this make pretend guy

1654
01:00:20,285 --> 01:00:22,806
and what he should do,

1655
01:00:22,806 --> 01:00:24,007
I went on my merry,

1656
01:00:24,007 --> 01:00:27,695
I put things in motion to
get us back to white listed,

1657
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:29,270
get the data on what happened.

1658
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,564
I had to still run the store

1659
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:31,397
'cause it was busy.

1660
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:33,315
We had to get packages out.

1661
01:00:33,315 --> 01:00:34,725
But when that was done,

1662
01:00:34,725 --> 01:00:35,991
two days later,

1663
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:37,420
if I recall,

1664
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,816
on the weekend,

1665
01:00:38,816 --> 01:00:40,733
I sat down and I called

1666
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,576
and emailed every single
person that was affected

1667
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,123
for the next 31 days,

1668
01:00:49,123 --> 01:00:51,413
three hours here, eight hours there.

1669
01:00:51,413 --> 01:00:53,128
Sounds like this guy is lucky

1670
01:00:53,128 --> 01:00:55,878
it wasn't eleven thousand people.

1671
01:00:56,848 --> 01:00:59,086
Which makes me think it's
gonna be a piece of cake

1672
01:00:59,086 --> 01:01:01,448
to personally call ...

1673
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:04,781
(laughter and applause)

1674
01:01:08,386 --> 01:01:09,303
Look, look.

1675
01:01:10,977 --> 01:01:12,303
This is super interesting.

1676
01:01:12,303 --> 01:01:14,765
I don't know if I wrote this
in the Thank You Economy,

1677
01:01:14,765 --> 01:01:16,159
which is a book I wrote,

1678
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,578
but I definitely have said this publicly.

1679
01:01:18,578 --> 01:01:22,410
I believe that we expect things to happen,

1680
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:26,454
that we actually don't judge
that much on the bad thing.

1681
01:01:26,454 --> 01:01:29,950
We judge on the thing you do next.

1682
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:33,053
So much so, that I have at times

1683
01:01:33,053 --> 01:01:36,303
thought about doing
something slightly wrong,

1684
01:01:36,303 --> 01:01:37,367
not that crazy,

1685
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:40,200
just because I thought the apology

1686
01:01:41,228 --> 01:01:43,808
would be ROI positive to the entire event.

1687
01:01:43,808 --> 01:01:46,366
(laughter)

1688
01:01:46,366 --> 01:01:50,607
So I think something
amazingly good just happened.

1689
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:51,440
- [Casper] We'll see.

1690
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,273
- We will.

1691
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:54,917
- [Host] Well, you'll
get your chance later

1692
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:58,027
because Gary will be back
and we will of course

1693
01:01:58,027 --> 01:02:01,066
talk about what will happen.

1694
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:03,632
- Yeah I think the one thing
that we already thought about

1695
01:02:03,632 --> 01:02:06,062
was that we would very
much like these questions

1696
01:02:06,062 --> 01:02:07,502
and we would like to make them

1697
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:09,035
as interesting for everyone as possible.

1698
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:12,124
So we will make a small stand out here.

1699
01:02:12,124 --> 01:02:13,781
There's a small elevated stand out here

1700
01:02:13,781 --> 01:02:15,596
and if you feel like you
wanna ask a question,

1701
01:02:15,596 --> 01:02:18,186
you're more than welcome to
come and deliver your question

1702
01:02:18,186 --> 01:02:19,542
and we'll do a little
bit of screening before

1703
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:21,776
so we make sure that it's
relevant to everyone here.

1704
01:02:21,776 --> 01:02:22,609
So I --

1705
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:24,021
- I would also say, if I may.

1706
01:02:24,021 --> 01:02:26,483
Since we're just shooting
the shit up here.

1707
01:02:26,483 --> 01:02:28,647
As somebody who's obsessed
with Q & A so much so

1708
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:30,900
that the reason I wrote
the "Ask Gary V." book

1709
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,725
was I hoping it would be so successful

1710
01:02:32,725 --> 01:02:35,128
that every keynote I would
give for the rest of my life

1711
01:02:35,128 --> 01:02:36,459
would just be Q & A,

1712
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:38,270
and it's because,

1713
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:39,252
it's very interesting

1714
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:42,028
and we just had a bunch
of people randomly ask.

1715
01:02:42,028 --> 01:02:43,208
And I think as an organizer,

1716
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,171
there's so much,

1717
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:45,961
you actually make me very happy.

1718
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:47,830
You have such good intent

1719
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:48,809
to try to make the question valuable.

1720
01:02:48,809 --> 01:02:50,926
And some people may wanna pitch or thank

1721
01:02:50,926 --> 01:02:53,068
or things of that nature and I get that.

1722
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:55,220
But it is pretty amazing doing this

1723
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,175
for the last year or two, more Q & A.,

1724
01:02:57,175 --> 01:03:01,126
how much so many of these
things are universal.

1725
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:04,962
60, 70, 80% of the things
we're all dealing with,

1726
01:03:04,962 --> 01:03:06,602
they may have a different business,

1727
01:03:06,602 --> 01:03:09,182
but I think we can all
recognize in this last session,

1728
01:03:09,182 --> 01:03:11,171
there was so many things
that were relevant to you,

1729
01:03:11,171 --> 01:03:12,984
that you would have never thought to ask,

1730
01:03:12,984 --> 01:03:14,479
but my answer to somebody else's question

1731
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:17,129
might have been the unlock that you needed

1732
01:03:17,129 --> 01:03:18,340
for where your head's at, so.

1733
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,862
Also something to think about.

1734
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,389
- [Host] Give him a hand.

1735
01:03:21,389 --> 01:03:23,639
(applause)

1736
01:03:26,471 --> 01:03:27,437
- Later.

1737
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:30,668
Hey guys, in my continued
track to get feedback

1738
01:03:30,668 --> 01:03:32,476
to make the Vlog better,

1739
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:36,279
we'd love to get insights on
what micro piece of content,

1740
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:39,279
what one minute clip in today's Vlog

1741
01:03:40,157 --> 01:03:42,476
should I cut out and
make an Instagram post.

1742
01:03:42,476 --> 01:03:43,854
You get to be the post header,

1743
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:46,589
forget Iris, forget Dan and forget Drock,

1744
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:48,365
forget Kyle, forget Justin.

1745
01:03:48,365 --> 01:03:50,674
You get to pick the
one minute that we chop

1746
01:03:50,674 --> 01:03:52,922
and make sure you upload
your favorite parts

1747
01:03:52,922 --> 01:03:55,139
and we will post it on Instagram

1748
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:57,758
with a shout out to whatever
Instagram handle you want.

1749
01:03:57,758 --> 01:04:01,758
So make sure you put the
timestamp, 3:13 to 4:13

1750
01:04:03,662 --> 01:04:05,259
and put your Instagram handle in there.

1751
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,433
I'll give you a shout out on
my Instagram when we post it.

1752
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:08,266
See ya.

1753
01:04:09,654 --> 00:00:00,000
(blues music)
