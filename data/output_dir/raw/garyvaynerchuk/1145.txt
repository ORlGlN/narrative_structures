13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,970
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> model and so the question</font>

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,439
becomes if they're not going to sell

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,399

build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a product that delivers on that</font>

47
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,500
that is the intent or at least somewhat

48
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,180
eat you know the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes are</font>

51
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,890
social network to really drive there and

52
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,729
they may come up with something

53
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,350
innovative and<font color="#CCCCCC"> God bless and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm rooting</font>

54
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,479
for everybody all the time my big<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

55
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,280
is people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care that you're selling</font>

56
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,310
their data that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right let me say it</font>

57
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">again people don't care because the</font>

58
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,220
dirty little secret we're going to look

59
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">back at this video in 3 years 6 years 9</font>

60
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,180
years and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look smart again</font>

61
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,820
which is this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually want ads</font>

62
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,460
better targeted I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

63
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,159
Lionel Richie and<font color="#E5E5E5"> root beer ads when I'm</font>

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,229
in the market for another pair<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pumas</font>

65
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,939
or another pair<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Nikes I can normally</font>

66
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">where I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see sneaker ads we want</font>

67
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,670
to see them way way way more than you

68
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,890
think and somebody will jump in the

69
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,569
comments three or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you and say no</font>

70
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:18,170
no no cool fine but the data my gut my

71
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,880
intuition the things I'm seeing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

72
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">take them if they're good once they stop</font>

73
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,680
being ads and they start being content

74
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,480
that's the forefront of what I'm trying

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to push here that's what's going on back</font>

76
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,870
here when it actually brings you value

77
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,090
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it sells you you know like</font>

78
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">sports like I actually like sports no</font>

79
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,580
wonder i buy jerseys get it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

80
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">things one I think it's structured with</font>

81
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,030
some vulnerabilities to this has

82
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,770
happened a bunch of times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen</font>

83
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,260
this a bunch of times the sporah all

84
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,110
this stuff this happens a lot three so

85
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,610
far I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the product</font>

86
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that much though I do like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

87
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,510
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're making changes so big</font>

88
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,540
ups to that team my intuition early on

89
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,239
is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

90
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,190
becoming the next Facebook by any

91
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,170
stretch of the imagination that being

92
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,239
said this is not normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the process</font>

93
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:07,040
where I draw a line<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make a</font>

94
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,930
prediction and many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm not</font>

95
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,970
Nostradamus I just know when to react

96
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,890
it's too early<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make my final</font>

97
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,200
call want to see more behavior but my

98
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,580
intuition is they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out</font>

99
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,500
and charge you or do something else that

100
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,540
is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn off a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people not</font>

101
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mention not as many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

102
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,790
theoretically are you know excuse me too

103
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,260
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> theoretically like the</font>

104
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,670
notion but then when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to</font>

105
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,769
actuality like we like a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

106
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,750
in theory but then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't act on them</font>

107
00:03:32,750 --> 00:00:00,000
this feels like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them for me</font>
