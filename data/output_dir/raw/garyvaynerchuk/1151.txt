00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
muscle company asks how do you generate

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,130
novel ideas and an overpopulated

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,350
seemingly steel industry the fitness

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,370
industry for example the muscle company

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,610
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like saying that the muscle</font>

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,670
company I always find the best way to

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,880
attack an industry that you're in and is

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,820
stale and you want to innovate by

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,029
spending zero time in it one little fun

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,349
fact that most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,969
spent an awful uh excuse me an extreme

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">lack of time within the wine industry</font>

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,809
and within the agency in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stream I</font>

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,160
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been I've been to</font>

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,200
like six other agencies in my life

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,489
because the readings there I know

17
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,620
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it I read nothing about</font>

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,410
other agencies that ad age spend no time

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,180
asking my senior people about what they

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,309
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> at other agencies when I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

21
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:51,510
wine business everyone's like you should

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,770
go check out this store in Dallas

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,239
they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> X I'm like I don't give a</font>

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,360
crap for me the way I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been</font>

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,300
innovative is lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of education and I'm</font>

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,280
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> joking I tend to stay within myself</font>

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,890
and what comes natural and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I look to</font>

28
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,650
other industries so if i were you i'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,090
paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening in</font>

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,390
the food industry or you know in the

31
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,100
rock climbing industry or things

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,009
completely left field like hip-hop or

33
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,710
sports or just stuff that has nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,689
do with your industry because the best

35
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to stay within the zone and not</font>

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,900
innovate is pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to everybody</font>

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,280
else because they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same crap</font>

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 Pratt wait subscribe I need</font>

39
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,350
subscriptions because I can't push this

40

many right hooks in social
