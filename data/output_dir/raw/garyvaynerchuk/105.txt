1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:01,327
- [Female] You should
have been a therapist!

2
00:00:01,327 --> 00:00:02,171
- I am a therapist!

3
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:03,004
- [Female] You really are!

4
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:03,837
- I'm just disguised as

5
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:04,670
an entrepreneur!
- [Female] Yeah.

6
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,337
(hip hop music)

7
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,536
- [Gary Vaynerchuk] Clouds and Dirt

8
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:10,808
is the thesis that drives

9
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:13,900
my business ambitions and success.

10
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,441
When I think about the
clouds, it is the mission,

11
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:20,275
the highest level thinking,
the why, where am I going,

12
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:23,282
why, and it's the
marathon of my ambitions.

13
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,511
Whether that's to buy the New York Jets,

14
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:28,793
or whether that's to be the
open sourced entrepreneur.

15
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:31,094
The dirt is the work, it's the grind.

16
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:32,447
It's the actually doing it.

17
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:36,062
Replying to comments
with my own two thumbs.

18
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:39,577
It's never getting fancy
and understanding that

19
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:41,118
with all the great successes,

20
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:43,038
I still mean absolutely nothing.

21
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:46,431
I love the dirt, I strive for the clouds.

22
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,694
(reflective piano music)

23
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:51,047
(rewinding)

24
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:53,309
(upbeat music)

25
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,281
Hey everybody this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk,

26
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:59,643
and this is episode 273
of the #AskGaryVee show.

27
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,411
Ryan, couple things, Andy and I

28
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:05,248
have been looking at your
content while we're here.

29
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:07,034
You have to very seriously consider

30
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,210
a Facebook Watch show instead of YouTube.

31
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,010
It is very difficult in
a heavily mature YouTube,

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,082
to break out.

33
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:16,322
It is very difficult.

34
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:18,155
You have to be
disproportionately incredible

35
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:20,572
at tile images, at headlines,

36
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:23,055
at understanding the algorithm

37
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,673
and on top of it, be remarkably talented.

38
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:27,320
Meanwhile, Facebook,

39
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,569
in its quest to be very competitive

40
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,863
against YouTube and become a video player

41
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:33,552
is disproportionately helping

42
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,242
Facebook Watch shows
show up in News Feeds,

43
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:40,457
and there are far less people
producing shows on Facebook.

44
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,465
You have a supply and demand issue.

45
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:44,917
Google Facebook Watch shows,
learn everything you can,

46
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,634
and immediately go all in

47
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:50,282
and create your Facebook show, tomorrow.

48
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,538
The person that asks

49
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:54,202
never has the leverage.

50
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:57,122
The way you do it, is by
listening to me right now

51
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:59,618
and buying up inexpensive property.

52
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,164
It's called Facebook Watch.

53
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,042
- [Ryan] Okay.
- It's Malibu 45 years ago.

54
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,562
I promise you, this is what
I've been historically good at.

55
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:07,970
I don't have plaques of Uber,

56
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,913
and Facebook, and Twitter, and Tumblr.

57
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:13,091
It's for me to brag about my one scale,

58
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,682
which is, I can see it
a few seconds earlier,

59
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,218
and it doesn't take, Andy you know this,

60
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:18,378
I mean, you're doing it with me.

61
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:19,962
It doesn't take a rocket scientist.

62
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:22,378
We're just practitioners of our craft.

63
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:25,939
Just like James Toney's shoulders, right?

64
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,025
It's practitionership!

65
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:29,801
It will 100 percent,
I'm not guessing here.

66
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,078
You know everyone's like, yeah, you did,

67
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:32,230
I'm not guessing, musically,

68
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,054
I gotta love the other
day because I was right.

69
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,740
It was already big!

70
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,164
It wasn't like I guessed.

71
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:39,925
I'm not guessing here
Ryan, here's how you do it.

72
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,973
You get to interview the biggest

73
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:43,645
soccer players in the world.

74
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:47,062
When they ask for you to be on your show.

75
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,036
Go and build a huge audience.

76
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,645
It can be done on Facebook.

77
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,148
And when you tell Messi

78
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:56,588
14 million soccer fans watch your program,

79
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,668
I have a funny feeling
when Messi has a new app

80
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:00,692
- [Radio personality]
He's gonna wanna come

81
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:01,525
and put it on your program.

82
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,358
(laughs)

83
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:03,191
- And there you go!

84
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,531
Soccer is one of the biggest,

85
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,989
if not the biggest global
sport in the world.

86
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:06,822
- [Radio Personality] Yep.

87
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:07,655
There's tons of fans of it,

88
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,271
even America gives a crap now.

89
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,127
Obviously the US team not making it will

90
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:13,609
slow it down, but will not stop it.

91
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:17,023
Go and create a tremendous
show on Facebook Watch,

92
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:20,207
hold your breath and be
patient for 24 months

93
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,302
and watch them come to you.

94
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,802
(bell ding)

95
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,635
- Hey man, I appreciate it.

96
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:24,468
- I wish you nothing
but the best man, yeah.

97
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:25,521
Talk to you soon.

98
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:26,813
Thanks guys.

99
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:27,646
Take care.

100
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:28,484
What up, podcast?

101
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:31,900
Every Monday we send out ridiculous email.

102
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,908
Not only are we putting original content,

103
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:36,404
but a big strategy for me in 2018

104
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:38,252
is to disproportionately surprise

105
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,556
and delight the email newsletter.

106
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:40,389
You know, I don't know,

107
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,148
giving away 10 Porziņģis signed jerseys

108
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:44,755
randomly for the first 10 people

109
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:46,388
that read the email that day.

110
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:48,228
Or fly people in here, or,

111
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,061
blah, blah, blah.

112
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,894
Or VIP.

113
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:51,052
If you're in Utah on the 13th,

114
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,860
here's the front row of my speech.

115
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,075
If you're not part of it,

116
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:54,908
you're fuckin' up.

117
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:56,437
You're smart enough to be on the podcast,

118
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,636
but if you're not in the email,

119
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:58,931
you're not complete.

120
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:00,926
Check it, garyvaynerchuk.com.

121
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:02,956
(inspiring music)

122
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:03,789
What's up Vlog?

123
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,828
Getting a bunch of meetings done.

124
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,892
On my way to Facebook for a meeting.

125
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:09,975
Got a couple other calls here, I see.

126
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:15,851
Quincy Enunwa.

127
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:18,184
New York Jet, see him later.

128
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,668
Hasan Minhaj.

129
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:21,795
You know him?

130
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,797
The comedian.

131
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,220
Super pumped about that.

132
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,387
(texting)

133
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,093
Just like 99% of people watching,

134
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:32,676
nobody's listening yet.

135
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:33,509
That's okay!

136
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,342
That's not discouraging to me.

137
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,332
[Gary Voiceover] Nobody
listened to me at first either.

138
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:36,525
Let me say it one more time.

139
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:37,751
For over a year, nobody watched

140
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:40,109
my goddamn shows on YouTube.

141
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:41,661
The way to be discovered is to either

142
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,773
put out great content,

143
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:44,873
have one great piece of content go viral

144
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:46,293
and then everybody discovers you,

145
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,469
or become part of a community.

146
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:49,477
You're gonna get exposure,

147
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:50,957
you're gonna get some followers,

148
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,037
you're gonna contribute,

149
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:52,957
but you're also gonna learn

150
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:54,829
because you're gonna watch 90 pieces

151
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,097
of content doing well on Instagram.

152
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,684
Instagram, Instagram,
Instagram, Instagram, Instagram.

153
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:01,609
Big ups.

154
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:02,813
Heading into December.

155
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:04,554
I just dropped a post right now.

156
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,322
Right now, just a second ago,

157
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,275
I've never actually done this.

158
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,618
I've never jumped on live

159
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:12,026
on the back of posting something just

160
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:13,186
moments ago on Instagram,

161
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:15,099
but I'm so ridiculously fired up about the

162
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,133
$1.80 Strategy.

163
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,008
The $1.80 Strategy is something that

164
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:22,328
for the 15, for the 17 hundred of you

165
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:23,712
that popped up in a minute,

166
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:24,576
which is very nice, I'm flattered,

167
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:25,715
I love you, I love you, I love you.

168
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:26,999
For the 17 hundred of you,

169
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,582
the $1.80 Strategy,

170
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:32,614
the $1.80 Strategy is something that

171
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:33,878
can disproportionately help you.

172
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:35,902
I can't wait to get the email from you

173
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,414
in several months about
the $1.80 strategy blew up

174
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:41,804
your social, took you to the next level.

175
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:43,924
I'm super fired up.

176
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:46,428
Go right now, right now,

177
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:47,644
right now!

178
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:48,860
Go to my Instagram profile.

179
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,732
Leave right here.

180
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:50,942
I want the two thousand of you to

181
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:51,812
leave right now.

182
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:52,645
Leave!

183
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,724
End it.

184
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:54,557
Leave.

185
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:57,482
Go to my Instagram profile
and check out the post that

186
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,868
I just made, like it,

187
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:01,892
tag a friend who wants
to grow their Instagram.

188
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:03,615
A tactical piece of advice

189
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:06,942
that will work for the hardest core,

190
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:10,859
most disciplined, most
ambitious of all of you.

191
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:14,066
Go check out the $1.80 Strategy.

192
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,214
It's real.

193
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,254
It will work.

194
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:17,946
And for a lot of you that
have under a thousand,

195
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,754
under 10 thousand, or 100 thousand,

196
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,210
under a million followers,
it works for me.

197
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,207
It works for me, and it will
be the single biggest reason

198
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:29,950
many of you grow on Instagram,
which is your ambition.

199
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,783
And I love it.

200
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:31,616
I love seeing you guys leave.

201
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:32,815
I like that five hundred of you left.

202
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:33,854
Leave right now,

203
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,542
I want this 15 hundred number to go lower.

204
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:36,375
Leave right now,

205
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,656
go to my Instagram, leave!

206
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:39,574
Leave the livestream!

207
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:40,407
Leave!

208
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:41,757
There we go, 13 hundred, leave.

209
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:42,776
Leave the livestream,

210
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:44,648
go to my Instagram.

211
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:46,731
Watch the $1.80 Strategy.

212
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,183
Like it.

213
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:50,016
Comment it.

214
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:50,849
Share it.

215
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,070
But tag some homies.

216
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,974
Leave.

217
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:54,185
Leave right now.

218
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:56,414
Best process leave, I want you to leave.

219
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:57,247
Leave.

220
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,174
There are 11 hundred,
a thousand, I love it.

221
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,350
Leave!

222
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,960
I want to be here by myself.

223
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,966
Kyle, I want to be here by myself,

224
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:03,999
me, Avi, and Kyle,

225
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:04,974
That's I don't want anybody to

226
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,132
there we go, nine hundred.

227
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:07,096
Leave, go look right now.

228
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:08,702
Let's keep going down.

229
00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:10,382
Let's keep going down, 970.

230
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:11,898
Leave, leave, leave.

231
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,731
See ya.

232
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:13,564
See ya, see ya.

233
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:14,681
The $1.80 Strategy.

234
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,098
Changing your Instagram game.

235
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:22,280
Just wanna make sure
that at the most macro

236
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:25,705
Yo.

237
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:26,538
- [Passenger] Hello.

238
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:30,121
(gentle, upbeat pop music)

239
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:37,220
- Sorry Vlog, can't be
entertaining, busy as fuck.

240
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,402
So the first thing you have to do

241
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:41,152
is realize how young that is.

242
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:42,444
(bell ding)
And that is not the

243
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:44,969
normal thing a 27 year old understands.

244
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:45,802
- [Female] Right.

245
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:48,780
- Because you're coming from
a world where you're going up

246
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,516
and you're popping out to the real world.

247
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:51,485
Like this feels the time, like,

248
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:52,677
you gotta get your shit together.

249
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,044
- [Female] Yeah.
- You guys I'm sure

250
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,637
think about all sorts of things in life.

251
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:58,596
You need to wrap your head
around how young you are.

252
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,085
You need to get patient.

253
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:01,805
You can not figure, listen to me.

254
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:04,045
You can not figure this out
for the next five years,

255
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,973
wake up, and still be young as fuck.

256
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:09,828
You can think about having a
family, and a woman's body,

257
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:11,053
I respect all that.

258
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:13,061
But if you're gonna talk to me about

259
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:14,798
profession,

260
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,749
you have a lot of time.

261
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,468
Like, a lot.

262
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:19,540
You have to understand why this is the

263
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,044
most important thing to start with.

264
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:24,125
It changes everything if
you actually believe me.

265
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,325
- [Female] Okay.

266
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:26,477
- You're putting pressure on yourself.

267
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:27,310
- [Female] Yeah.

268
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,143
- And it's going to fuck you up.

269
00:08:28,143 --> 00:08:29,005
It's gonna make you do shit

270
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:31,204
you don't wanna do.

271
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:32,724
And the fact that you had the courage

272
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:36,832
to break the system already
makes me ambitious for you.

273
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,589
'Cause you already did the hardest part.

274
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:39,477
- [Female] Yeah.

275
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,317
- Who's opinion do you
value besides your own?

276
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,198
Here's one thing I'll tell you.

277
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:46,150
The truth will always win.

278
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,758
If you're not sitting on the couch

279
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:48,591
- [Female] Yeah.

280
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,222
- Waiting for his second contract,

281
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:51,854
can't wait to have babies and a big house,

282
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:53,414
because my man's gonna do it.

283
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:54,247
- [Female] Right.

284
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:55,574
- Well then, you will win.

285
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:56,486
- [Female] Right.

286
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:57,910
- If you're not, then you'll lose.

287
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,230
It's super easy.

288
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,534
So you'd rather be, using a football term,

289
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:02,367
you'd rather be down,

290
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,085
the way the Jets were playing this year

291
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,094
- [Female] Yeah
(laughs)

292
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:06,125
- It's nice that you're winning

293
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,093
going into the fourth quarter,

294
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,525
you'd much rather win the game.

295
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,468
You need to get macro on this.

296
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,301
- [Female] Yeah.

297
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,026
- Do not make a short term decision.

298
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:14,654
As long as you know that

299
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,885
you're doing the right thing,

300
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:16,718
you will win.

301
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:18,701
- [Female] So I guess my
question then would be like,

302
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,358
what do you say to people
who have tried so many things

303
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:22,869
and still have yet to do anything?

304
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:24,036
- Keep trying.

305
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,414
And you know what the real answer is?

306
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:30,032
You're scared to try the
thing that you might know you

307
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:32,414
wanna do because you're
worried about how it's viewed,

308
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:33,837
or can you do it?

309
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:35,935
- [Female] Yeah, that's
exactly the sentence

310
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:36,965
You should have been a therapist!

311
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:37,845
- I am a therapist!

312
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:38,678
- [Female] You really are!

313
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,511
- I'm just disguised

314
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:40,344
as an entrepreneur!
- [Female] Yeah!

315
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:41,830
My dream was like to do
makeup but I just feel like

316
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,053
it would be a joke.

317
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,125
I went to an Ivy League school,

318
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,718
I feel like people would
look at me like I'm a clown

319
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,640
and I don't wanna do it!

320
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,520
- I think you should do it.

321
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,832
And I mean fuckin' tomorrow.

322
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:52,631
(laughs)

323
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:53,632
- [Female] Like tonight.

324
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:54,913
It's just a matter of like,

325
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:56,753
doing it not in the way
everyone else is doing it,

326
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:57,810
because everyone's on YouTube,

327
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,130
everyone's doing the same crap.

328
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,536
- So I'll give you some advice,

329
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:02,345
I'm good at that too.

330
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,072
Google Facebook Watch,

331
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:05,808
start a Facebook Watch show,

332
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:07,535
it's hard to break out on YouTube.

333
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:09,504
Too much supply and demand.

334
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:10,824
Right?

335
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,984
Facebook Watch is just starting.

336
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:15,371
You can absolutely break out.

337
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:17,555
Just eat shit for three years!

338
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:19,002
If you're good enough to
go to an Ivy League school,

339
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:22,050
like, you've been positively
reinforced for a long time

340
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,971
around a game, the problem is that doesn't

341
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,330
match what the fuck you wanna do!

342
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,387
- [Female] No.

343
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:27,729
- You have to deploy humility.

344
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:30,212
And I don't know how
much humility you have.

345
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,661
But you need to deploy humility

346
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:35,027
and you also have to really
get confidence internally.

347
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,289
I think it's rad as fuck
that an Ivy League gal

348
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:39,634
wants to do makeup because
it's an interest of yours.

349
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:40,467
- [Female] Yeah.

350
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,386
_ It's a passion of
yours, like fucking do it!

351
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:44,561
- [Female] So if I post a
makeup video will you watch it?

352
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,394
(laughs)

353
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,987
- I will help you so much if you

354
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:48,633
have the courage to help yourself.

355
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,282
I think the biggest problem
right is you have to have a

356
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:52,906
real purpose that really matters,

357
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:55,441
not the sake of purpose
for the sake of purpose.

358
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:56,274
- [Female] Just sucks

359
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:58,905
(background music drowns out conversation)

360
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:01,186
- It's not a waste, it's your reality.

361
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:03,266
You do this right for three
years, nothing good happens,

362
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:05,929
but then it pops and you can
fucking get brands paying,

363
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:08,290
you can pay off student loans
in the hundreds of thousands

364
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,032
in one year if you make

365
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:12,513
400 thousand dollars in sponsored posts.

366
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:15,489
You've already quit, which
means you clearly are

367
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:17,275
strong willed enough to like,

368
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,649
most people don't.

369
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:19,482
- [Female] No.

370
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:21,273
- You need to really give
yourself a lot of credit for that.

371
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:24,122
You already did the hard
part, now you need humility.

372
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:27,817
Do you know why most real
celebrities are in deep shit?

373
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:31,329
They didn't have the
humility to jump on Instagram

374
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:34,914
when they were gonna have less
followers than other people

375
00:11:34,914 --> 00:11:36,124
and so they thought it was good for them

376
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,545
to stay off, and now they're finished.

377
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:39,587
You need to have the humility to

378
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,466
put up a video that has 47 views.

379
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:42,530
Put in the work.

380
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,389
You don't want to end up regretful.

381
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:45,265
- [Female] No.

382
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,979
- Because you know what's gonna happen?

383
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:50,083
You're gonna be angry at other
people for something you did.

384
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,883
You're gonna resent people
and it's gonna be a front.

385
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:54,643
It was you that didn't take the jump.

386
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:55,939
Not Quincy's mom,

387
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:59,235
not the judgment of your best
friend at Ivy League school,

388
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:00,547
like, what?

389
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,683
The fact that we have this?

390
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:04,779
Our grandparents didn't have this.

391
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,027
There was no nine to two.

392
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:07,083
You know how many fucking emails I get

393
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,043
from people that are homeless?

394
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,395
Single moms with six kids,

395
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,563
like fuckin',

396
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,931
this is a fucking lay up!

397
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,438
Now, we all have our own shit.

398
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:15,271
- [Female] Right.

399
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:16,104
- Right?

400
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:17,207
See, it's about perspective.

401
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:18,824
You're in such a great spot.

402
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:19,991
Take advantage of it.

403
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:22,183
If you actually understood
how young I feel

404
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:24,591
and how much life ahead of me I have,

405
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:26,047
you would feel so different.

406
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,628
I'm 15 years older than you are.

407
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:32,183
Fucking younger than I did at 27.

408
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,736
You're young as fuck.

409
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,911
And as soon as you wrap
your head around that,

410
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:38,307
all of a sudden it's like, whew.

411
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:39,140
Awesome.

412
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,973
- [Female] You're the
best, thank you so much.

413
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:40,806
- Take care.

414
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:41,639
- Likewise.

415
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,472
- Please don't

416
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:43,305
Good to see you.

417
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,527
Feel better.
- No, I'm gonna be watching

418
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:45,568
if you're watching my makeup video.

419
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:46,559
- Listen, listen, listen.

420
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,392
I'm dead serious.

421
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,151
You have to do it.

422
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,095
You will regret it.

423
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:50,941
- I know.

424
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,167
- And it will be the worst.

425
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,944
Regret is the worst feeling on earth.

426
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:55,840
- I know.

427
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,140
- Please just fucking do it, like what?

428
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,473
Just fucking go!

429
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:06,026
Unless you know how to story
tell in here, you have no shot.

430
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:06,859
Period.

431
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:07,692
Binary.

432
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:08,525
Oxygen.

433
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:09,865
For anybody in any business,

434
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,745
let alone the consumer
business that you're in.

435
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:12,961
Let alone,

436
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:15,088
you guys actually have
an authentic story that

437
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:19,096
once understood, is
disproportionately ROI positive.

438
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,448
So you have all the upside,

439
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:21,723
so you need to figure it out.

440
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:22,556
Fast.

441
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:23,933
I'm surprised by how much

442
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,053
confusion in marketing there is between

443
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:27,597
branding and sales.

444
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:28,917
And I think it matters more than ever,

445
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:30,933
'cause this can do both

446
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:31,766
and it needs to matter.

447
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:34,332
My personal brand has
17 full time employees.

448
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:37,761
So like, I'm living it but I'm
also committing financially

449
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:39,421
at a level that nobody's ever heard.

450
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:41,796
I probably have the single biggest

451
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:43,756
human production company in the world.

452
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,484
I believe proper marketing

453
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:50,277
in the land that we're going
into over the next decade

454
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:54,858
is disproportionately more
important than financial ability.

455
00:13:54,858 --> 00:13:55,691
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

456
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,326
- You're gonna spend money on marketing.

457
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:59,478
You might as well spend it smartly.

458
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:02,374
Do you know that I'm
filming, and that literally,

459
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,894
this is not a joke,

460
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:06,670
in 100 years my great-great-grandchild

461
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,704
Jeremiah (waves) will
literally sit in Justine's seat

462
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:11,437
through VR and actually feel like

463
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:15,040
they're in this meeting as we speak?

464
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,956
It goes so much further,
what you're talking about,

465
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,514
I have a search engine
that you can search,

466
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:23,512
when I say the word Jeremiah,

467
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,216
literally, right now,

468
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,544
in two months when this gets

469
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:29,194
documented in there because there's a lag,

470
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:30,704
because we don't have a big enough team,

471
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,608
you'll be able to search the term Jeremiah

472
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:34,304
and get right to this moment.

473
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:35,539
Not only will we be able to

474
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,888
chop it up into mini-documentaries,

475
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:40,768
every single word said by every single,

476
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:42,928
you wanna get to truth extremes?

477
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:44,416
If you do that,

478
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,912
and actually document,

479
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,432
you build data behind it,

480
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:50,502
it becomes disproportionately
more powerful

481
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:52,647
than the thing that you and I believed in.

482
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,053
The end.

483
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,470
(dramatic hip hop music)

484
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,464
Hey everybody this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

485
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:05,215
and this is episode 274
of the #AskGaryVee show.

486
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,366
Hasan Minhaj is in the building.

487
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,286
You're my best friend.

488
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:09,606
Oh, I haven't put most things on wax

489
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:11,206
because I don't know about most things.

490
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:13,171
Like, meaning I'm aware-ish

491
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:14,004
- [Hasan] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

492
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:15,376
- But the thing that I
like, take enormous pride,

493
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:16,921
like I understand what's happening,

494
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:19,082
I understand that thesis,
I understand Twitch,

495
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:20,544
I understand Blockchain,

496
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,377
I understand a ton of shit.

497
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:22,210
- [Hasan] Got it, okay.

498
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,178
- The thing that I think
has really, really, really,

499
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:26,353
worked for me is understanding
the difference between

500
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:29,907
understanding shit, and
being the best at something.

501
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:33,041
I'd love to talk more about Twitch.

502
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,417
And I may next year.

503
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:37,137
Actually, this is around
the time when I usually

504
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,692
get my shit together
because I'll go on vacation

505
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,585
in a couple weeks for a week or two.

506
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:45,151
About four hours into having
downtime I'm like, fuck this,

507
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,442
and I get crazy, and I
start thinking about,

508
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:48,692
like last year,

509
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:52,226
during this December break is
when I decided to get serious

510
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,882
about podcasts,

511
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:56,131
and serious about IG.

512
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:58,373
I have stayed directly in my fuckin' lane.

513
00:15:58,373 --> 00:15:59,206
- [Hasan] That's cool.

514
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,789
(bright music)

515
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:04,772
(bell ding)

516
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:08,772
(music drowns out conversation)

517
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:14,984
- Going into four hours
worth of meetings now.

518
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,968
One hour a piece times four.

519
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,173
At Hunt and Fish.

520
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:21,146
(bell ding)
So we'll see how that goes,

521
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,588
should be pretty good.

522
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:26,074
Get some stuff done.

523
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:29,241
(Italian jazzy music)

524
00:16:35,097 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughs)
