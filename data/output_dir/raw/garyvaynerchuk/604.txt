pride I think AJ is very successful life

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,500
because he knew how to calibrate the the

actually prefer them not to believe and

53
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,180

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,790
in my career where I had too much ego

66
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,110
and pride and didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the</font>

67
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,150
easy thing just stupid at the end of the

68
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,090
day the net score is the net score so I

69
00:02:21,090 --> 00:00:00,000
would give that thought
