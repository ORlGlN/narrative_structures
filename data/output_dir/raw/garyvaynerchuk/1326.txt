1
00:00:00,463 --> 00:00:02,834
- On this episode i talk about mistakes,

2
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:06,232
forest, lunch, and keynotes.

3
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:10,374
(energetic music and audience applause)

4
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,827
You ask questions and I answer them.

5
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:17,043
This is the #AskGaryVee Show.

6
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:22,028
(energetic music)

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,984
Hey everybody, this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk,

8
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:29,120
and welcome to episode number 42 of the

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,981
#AskGaryVee Show.

10
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,321
No fun facts, just thunder.

11
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:36,380
- [Voiceover] Mathieu says,
"Hello Gary, why do you

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,504
"rarely mention YouTube in
your digital recommendations

13
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:41,383
"despite the one billion
active users per month?"

14
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:45,104
- And this is a great question and I'm

15
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:46,880
really glad you asked it because

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,815
it allows me to address this head-on

17
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:51,942
on the #AskGaryVee Show.

18
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:57,010
The reason I don't
mention YouTube a lot and

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,686
didn't have it at the bottom logo of

20
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:01,223
Jab Jab Jab Right Hook,
DRock, you can show it,

21
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:04,453
is a really interesting
thing that I've thought about

22
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:06,174
quite a bit.

23
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:06,959
Which is

24
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:10,216
because I'm making a mistake.

25
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:13,044
And, you know, boy, do
I hate talking about

26
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:14,228
that stuff.

27
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:16,559
You know, here's what I think happened.

28
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:20,735
I jumped on YouTube so early back in 2006,

29
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:24,671
wrote Crush It! in 2009
about how YouTube and video

30
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,814
would make a lot of people famous,

31
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:27,531
a lot of stuff that's happening now.

32
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:29,907
And in a weird way, I think that,

33
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:31,915
you know I jumped to Viddler in 2007

34
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:33,400
so I didn't see through the YouTube thing,

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,681
that was a mistake as well.

36
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:38,758
I think that it's a foregone conclusion

37
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,127
in the back of my mind that I have

38
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:44,035
YouTube on a pedestal that is even above

39
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:46,895
everything else, maybe besides Facebook,

40
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:48,082
and I just haven't done a good job.

41
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:49,350
As a matter of fact one of the reasons

42
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,825
I started the #AskGaryVee
Show is to get a little bit

43
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:54,632
back into the YouTube culture and so,

44
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:56,811
honestly, I think that the reason I don't

45
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:59,059
mention it and dig into it

46
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:01,509
and push it harder is
because I thought I'd

47
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:04,089
figured that out and
kind of pushed that out

48
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:06,995
with Crush It! and was
so associated with that.

49
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:10,393
But that wore out in 2011 and I've just

50
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:13,708
done a piss-poor job of
continuing that narrative

51
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,842
and it's a hole in my tool belt in the way

52
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:18,867
that I communicate.

53
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:21,241
Obviously I take it seriously, and so,

54
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,164
you know, the reason I don't mention it

55
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:25,172
is because I'm making a mistake.

56
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,926
- [Voiceover] Yash says,
"You changed the intro music.

57
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:30,341
"Why?"

58
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:32,887
- Yash, cuz.

59
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,883
- [Voiceover] Vernon
asks, "What's one question

60
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:37,860
"you ask in interviews?"

61
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,018
- Vernon, I really like this question.

62
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:43,956
I'm really excited to take a stab at it.

63
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,136
I don't do it every time.

64
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:46,394
I'm not one of these guys who's like,

65
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:47,302
this is my go-to question, like

66
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:48,930
"When you were 13 and you
went through a forest,

67
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,782
and you pick--"

68
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:51,505
I don't have any of these weird things,

69
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,464
but I do always, especially
I think if there's a lot

70
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:57,117
of momentum in the interview,

71
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:59,999
I love to ask people to tell me, at this

72
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,245
moment in time, what they see the

73
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,661
professional career becoming.

74
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:06,582
I wanna get into the psychology of what

75
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:08,466
their ambition is and I pretty much

76
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:10,310
spend most of the interview trying to get

77
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,075
somebody comfortable enough to tell me

78
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,669
the truth to that question.

79
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,502
Because I don't care if
you want to be the CEO

80
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:18,834
of VaynerMedia. If you wanna just be,

81
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,775
move a couple levels up and have great

82
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,505
work-life balance. I
don't care if you even

83
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:24,601
want to come here and
work for me for two years,

84
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:27,951
suck out my IP and then
go start your own agency.

85
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:30,158
I don't care what your agenda is, I just

86
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,661
wanna know what it is so
I can help us get there.

87
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,288
Because the truth is,
I wanna keep people in

88
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:38,176
my ecosystem forever and the best way

89
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,661
to do that is to deliver
to them what they want.

90
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,581
And so the quicker I can
get into that insight,

91
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:45,831
are you work-life balance,
are you money hungry,

92
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:48,317
are you title hungry, are you entrepreneur

93
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:49,881
and just coming in here for learnings.

94
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,966
I don't care, I just need to know.

95
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,416
The quicker I know and the
quicker it's the truth,

96
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,360
the quicker we can do
things forever together.

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,104
And so that is usually the essence of the

98
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:01,332
interview question for me.

99
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:03,800
Can I tap through, can I
feel that I'm getting there?

100
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,931
Because that gives me a blueprint, a map.

101
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:08,068
Not only that, I have the
self-awareness, and I try to

102
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:11,131
talk to them about this,
that that will change.

103
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:12,521
You know, being a 24 year old dude,

104
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:15,298
26 year old female, it's gonna change.

105
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,094
You're gonna fall in love,
your life's gonna change.

106
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:18,521
Are you gonna start a family?

107
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,990
When you make a little bit more money

108
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,586
it becomes less interesting.

109
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:23,252
There's so many different
things that are going

110
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:24,485
on in one's life.

111
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:25,845
When you make a little money it becomes

112
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:26,961
way more interesting.

113
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:29,698
You get the bug, the blood's in the water.

114
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:32,069
I don't care, I just need
the communication funnel

115
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:33,542
and I want it to start from day one,

116
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:36,366
five minutes in to getting
to know each other.

117
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,576
- [Voiceover] Sarah asks,
"As a private music teacher

118
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,144
"I have limited hours to teach.

119
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:43,777
"What are your thoughts on
how to increase my income,

120
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:44,799
"or build a brand?"

121
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:48,054
- Sarah, a lot of thoughts on this.

122
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,803
It's called the Crush It! manifesto,

123
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,389
which is, there's plenty of damage between

124
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,512
11pm and three in the morning.

125
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:57,586
I get it, you teach,
you know, I don't know,

126
00:04:57,586 --> 00:05:00,118
teachers to me are actually,
my sister is a teacher,

127
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:03,308
like they have the most
time to do other stuff.

128
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:04,738
They have fairly good schedules.

129
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,985
There's the summer.

130
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:09,197
There's, you know, and
again, maybe you've got

131
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:10,876
a different kind of teaching thing, but

132
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:15,548
to me, if you want to build
more of a scalable brand,

133
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,065
you gotta put out content. You gotta

134
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:18,828
look at things like Skillshare where you

135
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,280
can put out your teachings and sell that.

136
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,535
There's a lot of ways to do it.

137
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,459
Technology has created
an enormous opportunity

138
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,522
for you to scale it.

139
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:29,584
You can do live Spreecasts
and Google Hangouts

140
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:32,976
that only have access to people that pay.

141
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:34,778
I would recommend putting
out a lot of content

142
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:37,442
at first as a gateway
drug to the opportunity

143
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:40,634
to charge people so you
can establish yourself.

144
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:41,856
But this whole notion of

145
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:46,108
where is the time, I need more time,

146
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:50,624
I just think people are
loaded with excuses.

147
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:52,258
They aren't auditing themselves.

148
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,847
They don't realize that
they're watching every season

149
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:57,263
of Homeland and Game of Thrones.

150
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,181
They don't realize that
they're having an hour

151
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:02,254
and 15 minute lunch, like lunch.

152
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:04,103
I've had two lunches.

153
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:06,066
Robert Souza, our new SVP made me go to

154
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,131
a lunch to meet somebody.

155
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:08,199
I was pissed.

156
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,457
I was like, why couldn't
we do that as 11pm drinks?

157
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:13,847
Lunch, like leaving and having lunch?

158
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:15,686
The inefficiency of that time?

159
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:19,045
So you know, I'm pissed at lunch

160
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,595
and I'm pissed at Game of Thrones and

161
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:21,991
I'm pissed at playing video games and

162
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:24,734
I'm pissed at a lot of
things in a world where

163
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:27,752
somebody wants more
financially or career-wise.

164
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:30,952
I love it for the people
that need it to escape.

165
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:33,804
I love it for people that are content

166
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:35,818
with their monies and their career path.

167
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:36,553
I love it.

168
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,434
As a matter of fact, I envy it.

169
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:41,251
Boy, if somebody could take a shot and

170
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:45,423
suck out some of my ambition,
I'd be really pumped.

171
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:46,319
You wanna do a start up?

172
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,906
Create a suck out the ambition app.

173
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:50,908
I'd be really happy about
that because I'd love

174
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:52,842
to be able to take a lunch.

175
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:55,865
I'd love to be able to relax
and play Madden against

176
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:57,377
somebody in Iowa, because
that's how you can

177
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:59,337
play Madden these days, with the kids,

178
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,524
for the last 10 years.

179
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:02,078
But I haven't been playing it because

180
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:04,411
I've been hustling,
because that's what I want.

181
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:07,516
And so, whether you're a hundred or zero,

182
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,662
you just wanna zen and live in
a mountain with no technology

183
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,244
or you wanna buy the Jets
and hustle your face off,

184
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:16,278
or anything in between, you
need to find your cadence.

185
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:17,914
And so if you're asking this question,

186
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:20,171
my intuition is you're
spending an hour or two

187
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,578
on things every day that aren't achieving

188
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:25,970
this extra brand or extra
monies that you're chasing.

189
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,028
So cut that crap out and
apply it to these things,

190
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:31,113
putting out content, writing content,

191
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:33,175
making videos, building up a brand,

192
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:35,003
engaging with people,
going to Twitter search,

193
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,648
Twitter.com/search

194
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:38,772
searching teachings around, you know,

195
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:40,858
key words around the things you teach.

196
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:43,853
Engage with people, say hello, cold call,

197
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:44,878
saw somebody shout that out

198
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:46,839
in the YouTube comments yesterday.

199
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,237
We talked about that, as a matter of fact,

200
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,218
link up that video.

201
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,818
People need to watch it.
That's a classic.

202
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:51,852
I don't know where you want it, DRock.

203
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,571
But you guys know which
video I'm talking about.

204
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,586
The cold call. I had a
shaved head in there.

205
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:57,872
Anyway, the bottom line is, you need to

206
00:07:57,872 --> 00:08:00,815
re-calibrate to your ambitions.

207
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,792
By the way, it may be going
from seven hours of sleep

208
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,611
to five hours of sleep
because you need all those

209
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:08,132
lunches and video games, and that's fine.

210
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:10,246
But if you want it, you just gotta go

211
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,051
and do that.

212
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,313
Thank you so much for watching

213
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:16,592
episode 42 of the #AskGaryVee Show.

214
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:17,326
Felt good about--

215
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:18,632
had an interesting demeanor.

216
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:19,450
Had an interesting demea--

217
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,351
Yeah, right DRock?

218
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:22,440
DRock, he's got my
demeanor of meter down, so

219
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,095
can I get a demeter
meter, like, can we get

220
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:27,589
a demeanor meter info-graphic here?

221
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,961
Thanks for watching the show.

222
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:32,698
I'm really enjoying it and
I'm really feeling the impact.

223
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:35,615
I'm starting to get
emails already from people

224
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,880
that have done certain things through

225
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,804
episode 16, 19, 23, how
about episode 23 by the way?

226
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:41,707
(ding)

227
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:43,179
I just did that for no reason,

228
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,749
(mumbles) when we go back.

229
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:47,530
I appreciate that, I love that interaction

230
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,160
and you keep asking questions,
I'll keep answering them.

231
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:54,538
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

232
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:55,808
There's a video question, right?

233
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:57,810
Let's do the video question.

234
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,220
Jab Jab Jab Right Hook
is actually what I do.

235
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,006
Give, give, give and then ask.

236
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:03,029
You keep asking questions,

237
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:04,377
I'll keep answering them.

238
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,911
And welcome to #AskGaryVee.

239
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,942
Do you consider yourself
in the VaynerNation?

240
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:12,490
Or do you consider yourself a Vayniac?

241
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,479
(typewriter keys clicking)

242
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:27,392
- Ishmael, somebody is very smart.

243
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:28,948
You've got me pegged.

244
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,661
Absolutely, I'm excited about
building the brand equity

245
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:33,467
of the #AskGaryVee Show so I can

246
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:35,346
have my ambition, and
you've probably heard me

247
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:37,313
say this five to 10
times in my career so you

248
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:39,848
might have a leg up from anybody
else who hasn't heard this.

249
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,600
Nothing would excite me more,

250
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,468
look, I've contemplated
television and other things

251
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:47,338
to build up my profile so
that my keynotes going forward

252
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,992
can be me walking into
a auditorium, an event,

253
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:53,988
and just going directly into
Q and A, #AskGaryVee style,

254
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:55,748
because the truth is, that's where you can

255
00:09:55,748 --> 00:09:57,105
bring the most value.

256
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:59,147
If people walk in with context of who I am

257
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:01,270
and my spiel, we can get right to it,

258
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,714
which is really bringing the value,

259
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:04,516
which is why this show matters so much.

260
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,479
So yes, my friend, the
answer to your question

261
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,312
is a big, fat Y-E-S.

262
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:10,977
I'd like the #AskGaryVee Show concept to be

263
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,415
my new keynote.

264
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:13,652
(beep)

265
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,842
Hey everybody, this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

266
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:17,479
and you're watching

267
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,196
(beep)

268
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:20,038
Hey everybody, this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

269
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:21,664
and you're (laughing)

270
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:22,302
(beep)

271
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,866
Hey everybody, this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

272
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:26,061
and (laughing)

273
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:27,832
You like that?

274
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:29,103
Oh crap, wait.

275
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:29,878
Subscribe.

276
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:32,044
(simulates fast-paced popping)

277
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,422
I need subscriptions

278
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:35,934
because I can't push this many right hooks

279
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,169
in social, so subscribe.

280
00:10:38,169 --> 00:00:00,000
