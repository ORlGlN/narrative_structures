1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,208
- On this episode,
Adam Braun stops by

2
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:04,417
to talk MissionU.

3
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:07,041
(hip hop music)

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,041
- [Gary] You ask questions,

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,875
and I answer them

6
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:26,750
This is The #AskGaryVee Show.

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,375
- Hey everybody,
this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk,

8
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:37,000
and this is episode
249 of The #AskGaryVee Show.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,875
I am really pumped up,

10
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,125
because one of
my favorite humans

11
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:41,959
is here with me today.

12
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,333
Adam Braun, founder
of Pencils of Promise,

13
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,542
a non-profit that I am
very deeply involved with.

14
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:48,834
As a matter of fact,
this is super fun.

15
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,458
Don't give me a
pat on the shoulder.

16
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,834
I just took four shots today.

17
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,250
- Yeah, you're going!
- 'Cause I'm going to Ghana

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,959
in a couple weeks

19
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,291
to see some of the
schools that we've been

20
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,250
putting to work.

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,000
- Now, over a hundred in Ghana
- So excited.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,875
- so I'm very
excited for you to see it.

23
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,959
- I want you to tell everybody

24
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,917
about your work in that world,

25
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:06,917
a little bit on that,

26
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,458
and then what
you're up to in a minute,

27
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,542
but I first wanna say
what's up to everybody.

28
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,417
Thanks so much for everybody

29
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,291
who's been watching the content.

30
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,125
The, what did we name it?

31
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,375
Fuck Them, Send 'Em to Me?

32
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,333
- [Andy] For All The Haters.

33
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,375
- Oh, you guys changed it?

34
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,083
These guys fucked it up,
but it should have been called,

35
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,792
Fuck Them, Send 'Em to Me.

36
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,166
Let's link that
up in this episode.

37
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,041
If you haven't
watched this video--

38
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,750
what did we get, five
million reach on that?

39
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,500
- [Andy] Yeah.

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,041
- Cool, so check that out,

41
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,625
but before we
talk Knicks and Jets,

42
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,875
and how the first time we met,

43
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,500
Mark Sanchez walked
into the restaurant.

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,250
- Yep, yep.
- Before we go into all that,

45
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,166
why don't you tell

46
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,458
the people that
are watching right now

47
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,583
what you're up to now,

48
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,750
and then we'll bounce back,

49
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,333
because what you're up to now

50
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,750
scratches an
itch that is very deep

51
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,542
in my soul.

52
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,208
- Yeah, so, right now,

53
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:55,625
I'm focused as a
co-founder and CEO of MissionU.

54
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,417
MissionU is a
college alternative

55
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,959
for the 21st century,

56
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,208
so we prepare
students for the jobs

57
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,000
of today and
tomorrow, debt-free.

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,208
We think, at our core,

59
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,834
that the current
college landscape

60
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,458
is fundamentally broken,

61
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,208
that students are leaving school

62
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,625
without the actual
skills needed to succeed

63
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,291
in their careers
and in the work force,

64
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,458
and even if
they do get a degree,

65
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,959
they're left with absolutely
crushing, crippling debt.

66
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:18,959
When I met my wife,

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,083
she had over
$100,000 of student debt

68
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,000
without getting
that bachelor's degree,

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,583
and, so, we are building a
one-year college alternative

70
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,500
for the 21st century.

71
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,417
You pay no
money at all up front.

72
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,875
We invest in
you for a full year,

73
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:30,750
and at the end of that year--

74
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,625
- Goose egg?

75
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,458
- Yeah, zero.
- Zero.

76
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,291
- Zero. Zero.

77
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,125
- Benoit Benjamin.

78
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:34,959
- Correct.

79
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:35,792
(laughs)
- Like, you pay zero.

80
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:36,625
- Yeah, yeah.

81
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,458
- Keep going.

82
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,375
I love that part.
- And then, once you complete

83
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,625
your year at MissionU--

84
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,750
- But it's hard
to get in, right?

85
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,792
- Yeah, I mean we've had--

86
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:43,500
- Like, you wouldn't take Jake.

87
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,291
Jake would apply,
and you'd be like,

88
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,583
"We're not gonna
make any return on him,

89
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,417
"so he's out."

90
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,583
- Well, here's one
thing that I think you,

91
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,000
in particular, would love.

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,875
We don't look at SAT.

93
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,708
We don't look at GPA,

94
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,083
and you don't have to
have a high school degree

95
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,458
to get into MissionU,

96
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,625
because none of those
things actually matter

97
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,750
or are clear indicators

98
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,166
of whether somebody's
gonna be a great contributor

99
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,875
to a great company, so,

100
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,333
when you get a well-paying job,

101
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,000
in making $50,000 or more,

102
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
you contribute
15% of your income

103
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,917
back to MissionU
for three years,

104
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:11,041
and that enables us to
extend that opportunity

105
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,875
onto the next student,

106
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,542
so we launched MissionU--
- You guys hear that?

107
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:14,542
- Officially--

108
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,542
- Like, think about
this business model.

109
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:16,750
It's completely aligned.

110
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,208
- [Eliot] I might apply!

111
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,583
- Yeah, I mean, you might--

112
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,417
you shouldn't,

113
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,750
because you're crushing it--
- So, I mean we're basically--

114
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,583
- But like I mean, I--
or maybe you should.

115
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,708
Like, it's really
interesting, right?

116
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,500
So basically, people apply.

117
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,458
It's a one-year thing.

118
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,291
- Yep.

119
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,333
- But you're
contractually obligated

120
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,708
to give 15% of your salary

121
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,291
once you make over 50K.

122
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,041
- Correct, but only if
you actually get there.

123
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,917
- Right, so are
people gonna be crafty,

124
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,417
and ask for like 49?

125
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,250
(laughs)
- I think there are

126
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,333
some people that are probably,

127
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,500
especially in like the
- They'll probably look

128
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,333
at mine or something,
- start-up world,

129
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,500
they're gonna look for 49.
- "Maybe 49!" (laughs)

130
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,834
- The thing is you have
an opportunity to defer,

131
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,208
and, so, let's say that
you complete the program,

132
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,375
and then you don't get a job

133
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,417
that pays you $50,000 or more.

134
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:50,959
That's used as
part of your deferment.

135
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,834
- And does the model work--

136
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:52,917
so as you can imagine,

137
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,291
being on the board
of Pencils of Promise

138
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,834
for the last four years or so,

139
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,417
I've gotten to
know Adam super well,

140
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,959
so he goes, "Hey, I'm
going into for-profit."

141
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,000
Part of my life.

142
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,792
We spent a lot of
time jamming about that,

143
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,041
so I was very close to it,

144
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,166
and then he's
like, "I got an idea!

145
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,125
"I got an idea!"

146
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,667
I think I was in a cab,
and it was raining,

147
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,708
and you were
like, "Here's the idea!"

148
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,542
I'm like, "I'm in!"
- Yeah.

149
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:10,834
- "I'm investing in this."
- You were literally

150
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,667
the first person I told

151
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,000
about it.
- I, and, so,

152
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,208
I love this thesis.

153
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,291
A lot of you who watch my stuff

154
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,708
know why I love this thesis.

155
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,541
Let me ask you a question

156
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,375
of something I don't know,
'cause I was so blindly in,

157
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,791
I didn't look at
every t and every i.

158
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,583
If Tyler did it,

159
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,667
he makes 42K in his first job,

160
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,792
but he gets
promoted and makes 63,

161
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,041
does he then go on the clock?

162
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:29,875
- Yeah.
- Got it.

163
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:30,875
So that's how it works.
- Yep.

164
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:31,708
Yep.
- So basically,

165
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,792
Don't collect debt.

166
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,625
We're gonna teach
you the right skills.

167
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,125
You signed up a
bunch of companies

168
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,792
that are hiring
the people outta this.

169
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,750
- Yeah, so our
employer-partners commit

170
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,834
to three things.

171
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,458
The first is they
advise us on the curriculum,

172
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,792
so that we're
actually teaching you

173
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,500
the skills and, you know,
software and tools

174
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,542
and whatever else that

175
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,166
companies are
actually interested in

176
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,333
that are leaders of industry,

177
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,041
and, so, the whole
industry tends to be

178
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,041
interested in those spaces.

179
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,625
The second is they
help us develop things

180
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,083
like case studies or, you know,

181
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,375
chime in and do Skype chats,

182
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,041
and you get
exposure to great leaders

183
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,208
of great companies,

184
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,291
and then the third
part is we give them

185
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,333
early preferred
access to hire our top grads.

186
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,041
So, you know, very
few companies in the world

187
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,542
are gonna guarantee spots.

188
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,917
You have to earn your own way,

189
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,291
but you're
gonna have an on-ramp,

190
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,500
you know, just as
strong, if not stronger,

191
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,166
than if you had a
traditional bachelor degree,

192
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,333
and right now, our
employer-partners are

193
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,208
companies like Spotify,
Lyft, Uber, Warby Parker,

194
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:23,708
Casper, Harry's,
Bonobos, Birchbox, VaynerMedia,

195
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,083
a handful of others,

196
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,875
so, you know, some of the
best companies in the world

197
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,458
that almost
every person I speak to

198
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,750
would do anything to work at.

199
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,750
These are the exact companies

200
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,917
that are helping us
design an experience

201
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,083
that is a perfect on-ramp

202
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,166
for the talent that
they're looking for.

203
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,792
- So when's the first class?

204
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:41,208
- So, we opened up admissions

205
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,708
exactly about a month ago.

206
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,750
- How's it going?

207
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,667
- So, we have 25 spots
for our September cohort.

208
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,917
We've had just about
3,000 applicants so far

209
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,625
for the first 25
spots in the first month.

210
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,083
- So that's gonna be, like,

211
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,583
a lot of disappointed people.

212
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,208
- Well what
we're now thinking is that

213
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,125
we need to launch more
cohorts and more quickly,

214
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,291
so we're targeting
- But I know you well enough

215
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,125
and I've watched you
- other cohorts in January.

216
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,041
- build other things.

217
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,083
You're gonna do it--

218
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,583
you're not
gonna go crazy, right?

219
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,750
You're, like, you're
gonna be smart about this.

220
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,250
- No, I mean, if we
stopped our admission process

221
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,667
right now, today,
which we're not doing,

222
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,542
we would still have less
than a 1% acceptance rate,

223
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,875
and that would
make us more selective

224
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,625
than Harvard and
Stanford combined,

225
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,458
so, we're gonna be
a selective institution,

226
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,333
but we don't look at the things

227
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,542
that traditional
academia usually values.

228
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,500
What we look for in
our admissions process

229
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,458
is character traits,
like, you know,

230
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,000
ambition, resilience, grit.

231
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you self-directed?

232
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Are you a motivated learner?

233
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,375
And then the soft skills, like,

234
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,708
do you work well in teams?

235
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,417
Do you communicate
ideas effectively?

236
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,917
So it's totally different.
- Now, you've built

237
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,041
an onboarding process

238
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,583
that gives you insight to that.

239
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,750
Are you guys also then
interviewing people after?

240
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,959
Like, what's your process?

241
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,792
- So --
- How are you gonna get

242
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:48,917
to this 25?
- Yeah, so--

243
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:49,750
- I'm not gonna get a weird text

244
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,625
that says, "Can you
talk to Sally on the phone?"

245
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,125
- (laughs) No, no,
don't worry about it.

246
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:53,959
- Thank God.

247
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,917
- I will ask you--
- I wasn't sure

248
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:55,750
what I signed up for.
- I will ask you

249
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,959
to actually
address the students though

250
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,792
once they're fully accepted.
- Yeah, duh.

251
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,083
I'm gonna give the first
13 commencement speeches.

252
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:00,917
- Yeah!

253
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,959
So Gary's in as our
commencement speaker

254
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,750
for the next 13 classes.

255
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,166
You heard it here first.
- (laughs)

256
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,250
- Four-step admissions process.

257
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,834
First step's called
Tell Us About Yourself,

258
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,917
so, you know, just
share who and what you are,

259
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,542
your background, you know,

260
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,875
what your kind
of aspirations are.

261
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,250
Second step is an
admissions challenge.

262
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,750
It's open book, so
you can use the internet.

263
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,291
We actually
encourage you to use Google.

264
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,125
It's untimed.

265
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,125
You can use any thing
except for another human,

266
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,708
'cause that's how the
working world actually works.

267
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,000
It makes no sense that
you take a test in a vacuum.

268
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,166
And then,
those who do well there,

269
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,625
they advance to
a group challenge.

270
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,667
The group challenge is probably
the most interesting part.

271
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,875
You enter a live
virtual classroom.

272
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,834
You get a prompt,

273
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,792
so one that we're using is like,

274
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,959
"Self-driving vehicles
are coming to our society.

275
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,834
"Will they have a
positive or a negative impact

276
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,125
"on our culture, and why?"

277
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,917
And you spend 35
minutes, as a group,

278
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,291
creating a
presentation that you give

279
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,291
for the last ten
minutes to one of our staff,

280
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,542
and we record the whole thing,

281
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,375
and we go back and
we watch that tape,

282
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,083
and then the final
step is a personal interview

283
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,417
with myself or another
member of the leadership team.

284
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,250
- I love it man.

285
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,291
- Yeah.
- Enjoying it?

286
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,166
- I'm loving it right now.

287
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,500
It's so interesting.
- How long were you running

288
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,458
Pencils of Promise?

289
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,667
- So I founded
Pencils of Promise October 2008,

290
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,750
and then, you know,
I was on board until,

291
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,291
in an active capacity,
until the very end of 2015,

292
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,500
so probably seven years,

293
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,875
and now I'm obviously
Founder and Board Emeritus.

294
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,542
I was actually almost
gonna stop by the office today,

295
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,250
and then I got
pulled away for a second,

296
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,125
but, I mean, I'm probably on
a Pencils of Promise email,

297
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,417
I would say, every single day,

298
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,125
but it's nice that
we have a great CEO

299
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,208
that's leading the
organization day to day.

300
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,125
- And how does it feel to, like,

301
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,959
be in the startup world?

302
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,375
You're living in San Francisco.

303
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,834
- Yeah!
- So you're in that bubble.

304
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:31,625
- Yeah.

305
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,082
- Has it been an
interesting transition?

306
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:35,166
You know, what I'm
fascinated by you is

307
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,500
you're the future of
philanthropy, in my opinion,

308
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,000
which is I grew up in a mindset,

309
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,875
and until I met you and
Scott Harrison and some others,

310
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,291
of like "Oh, I'll do my thing,

311
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,708
"and then when I'm old,

312
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,166
"then I'll start giving away

313
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,750
"and giving back."

314
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,000
I've changed that
mindset, obviously,

315
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,542
but even founders
were never as young as you.

316
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,583
You know, usually, it
was a different profile.

317
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,875
Wasn't a type A winner of
starting these kinda things.

318
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,708
- Yeah.

319
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,917
- So I've been very fascinated
about you re-entering the world

320
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:08,875
as a young man
off a decade of that.

321
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,500
- Yeah, yeah.
- How's it been?

322
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,792
- I mean, it's
probably one of the

323
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,708
most rollercoaster-ish
periods of my life,

324
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,000
partially because also,
Gary knows this very well,

325
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,875
but my wife gave birth
to twins five months ago.

326
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,458
Literally today,
they're five months old.

327
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,625
And so, I have like three things

328
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,875
that just entered my life

329
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,125
that I'm trying
to give my all to.

330
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,375
But, I couldn't be
more grateful or happy.

331
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,375
First all, I found something
much like Pencils of Promise

332
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,125
that lived at the
intersection of where,

333
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,834
I feel like my
personal purpose exists.

334
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,041
As well as, it gives
me the opportunity to

335
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,834
create a living that
I can support my family

336
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:46,542
and the things and
causes that I believe in most.

337
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,291
It's also, like I'm not a first
time entrepreneur anymore.

338
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,125
And you know, for
Pencils of Promise,

339
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,708
you were in those
board meetings with me.

340
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,208
I mean, they weren't always easy

341
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,583
but managing a 12
person board for years,

342
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,625
by the time I had replaced
myself with Pencils of Promise,

343
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,792
we had over a hundred
full-time staff in 5 countries,

344
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,917
we've founded
more than 400 schools,

345
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,291
raised well over
$40 million dollars.

346
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,375
So, it's fun to go
back to the building stage.

347
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,625
- [Gary] Yeah.
- That's what I missed.

348
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,792
I missed the
ability to take an idea

349
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,708
when you see
something wrong with the world

350
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,375
and you have a
different kind of vision for

351
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,792
where it could go that
nobody else necessarily sees.

352
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,000
Telling someone two years ago,

353
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,792
that I wanted to
build a college alternative

354
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:24,959
for the 21st century was like,

355
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,083
outside of you,

356
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,375
and a couple
other of our friends,

357
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,667
it was crazy.

358
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,708
- I was like,
"Yes, I'm committed."

359
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,125
- I think five years from now,

360
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,125
we're gonna look
back and be like,

361
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,000
"Of course."

362
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,625
College is so ridiculously
over-priced, it's not succeeding

363
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,375
for the students
that are looking to--

364
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,125
- But that's the
world we live in, right?

365
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,291
Like, hey, wouldn't
it be cool if you could

366
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,083
press a button on
your iPhone and a black car

367
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,333
would pick you up, you're
gonna jump into people's cars.

368
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,583
Telling people ten years
ago, you're going to go into

369
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,250
stranger's cars.

370
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,125
Like, parents of high
school kids are forcing kids,

371
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,708
of wealth, to have Uber
accounts instead of driving

372
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,500
because they don't
want them drunk driving.

373
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,792
So they're telling
their 15-year-old daughter

374
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,583
to get into a stranger's car.

375
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,834
- Yeah.
- Like, think about me

376
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,500
saying that ten years ago.

377
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,417
- Yeah, I mean,
it just didn't exist.

378
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,458
I would say, overall,
the difference between

379
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,417
New York and
San Francisco is massive.

380
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:16,291
- Yes.

381
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,125
New York's much better.

382
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,959
- I would agree.

383
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,542
As a city, San Francisco
doesn't hold a candle.

384
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,000
- San Francisco, you suck!

385
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,667
- That said, if you
lived just outside of the city,

386
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,125
- You still suck, no.
- SF is unbelievable.

387
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,875
It is unbelievable just outside.

388
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,834
- Real quick, I apologize.

389
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,250
Facebook, start
putting your phone numbers in

390
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,542
if you wanna talk about
startup culture, philanthropy,

391
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:38,166
clearly college or
alternatives, startup.

392
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,792
You wanna talk to me,
wanna talk about The Jets,

393
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,375
Jets and Knicks, 
we can do that.

394
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,959
So any
competition, the Brauns and

395
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,583
Vaynerchuks
definitely share that.

396
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,667
So anything you wanna talk
about putting your numbers in.

397
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,667
Andy, you've got numbers?
- [Andy] Yeah.

398
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,083
- Let's get the first one going.

399
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,041
What else, while we get
the first question going,

400
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,792
what else do you want the
masses to know about MissionU?

401
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,375
Raising twins.

402
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,875
What else you got to say?

403
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,583
- I think one think that's
kind of interesting about us

404
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,542
is where we're focused.

405
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,708
Right now, we have one major.

406
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,959
The front half of the
area is what we call foundation

407
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
and discovery, combination
of hard and soft skills.

408
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,750
The back half of the
area is on your major.

409
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,542
And right now, the
major that we're focusing

410
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,250
on is data analytics,

411
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,542
which is like this
exploding industry.

412
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,250
So boot camps tend to focus on

413
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,875
coding and software engineering.

414
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,875
That's not our focus,
we're on data analytics.

415
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,125
And these are
really well paying jobs.

416
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,959
You don't have to
have a college degree.

417
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,583
- Nick, hold on.
Adam's still talking.

418
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,708
I'm kidding.

419
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,250
Nick, it's GaryVee, you're on

420
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,166
The #AskGaryVee Show
with Adam Braun.

421
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,625
How are you?

422
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,208
- [Nick] I'm doing fantastic.
How are you, guys?

423
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,750
- Super well.
What's your question?

424
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,750
- [Nick] My question,
the one I stuck with was,

425
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,583
so in terms of,
you know, either of the things

426
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,250
I know of the
combo of the two things

427
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,291
that I know you two
are both really known for,

428
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,500
taking attention,

429
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,291
giving social media
the kind of slang term

430
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,417
of where we all live nowadays,

431
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,208
how would you guys utilize that?

432
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,834
What are your
thoughts on utilizing that for

433
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,000
creating
educational experiences?

434
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,375
You know, basically, using
those platforms to teach people.

435
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,333
If that makes any sense,

436
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,708
creating learning environment.

437
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,208
- So is the question like,
how would we think about

438
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,250
creating curriculum
on top of social

439
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,417
in a way of like
whatever Khan Academy

440
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:22,250
or all these other
platforms have done, collective,

441
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,667
things of that nature.

442
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:28,083
What's our opinion on layering
that on top of social itself?

443
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,333
- [Nick] That's like
exactly what I'm saying.

444
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,625
Do you guys have
any thoughts on that?

445
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,625
- No, I got you.

446
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,208
- [Nick] A more
specific question.

447
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,917
- I think the thing
that excites me most is

448
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,583
the opportunity that
every single individual

449
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,000
can both be a
teacher and a student.

450
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,959
Historically, you almost
had to have some type of

451
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,542
rote qualification, right?

452
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,375
You had to kind of
get a Phd in order to

453
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,125
be the sage on the stage.

454
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,291
And I think what Gary
has demonstrated, probably

455
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,625
better than
anybody else in the world,

456
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,000
is that you can use
social in building an audience

457
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,250
though education.

458
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,625
You know, your content, for
some people, is voyeuristic.

459
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,291
Like they just
love to watch your life.

460
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,708
But I think the main reason that

461
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,375
people love to watch
your life is they feel

462
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,667
that they're learning something.

463
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,333
And they're taking that and
applying it to their own journey

464
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,667
and I think
that many many people

465
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,875
are going to benefit
from that in the future

466
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,625
as more and more platforms,

467
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,208
not only that enable the
social layer, but focus on

468
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,917
specific niche areas
with in education emerge.

469
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,208
- [Gary] Here's what
I would say to this.

470
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,166
I would say that the internet
is the middle-man, right?

471
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,708
What we're seeing,
what we're living through

472
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,792
with Amazon and OTT
and Netflix and Uber

473
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,583
and on and on and on, Airbnb.

474
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,667
The internet is
the infrastructure.

475
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,375
And I think people are
struggling to understand that.

476
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,708
Back to your point in
using terminology, I believe

477
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,834
when the five to seven social
networks or content hubs,

478
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,750
because you know, people call
YouTube a social network now

479
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,708
even though it's not, per se.

480
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,625
That's the layer on top of
the internet that's current.

481
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,208
So I would say
that your intuition

482
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,291
or what you might be
thinking about is a startup

483
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,875
or where's the opportunity.

484
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,917
Of course.

485
00:14:56,917 --> 00:15:00,250
I mean, it's the communication
hub of our society.

486
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,583
In essence,
blog posts, video content,

487
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,959
these are seminars,
or books, or passages.

488
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,708
So I think there are
a lot of opportunity.

489
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,792
I would say the one thing that

490
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,125
people have to keep in mind

491
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,000
is when you're building
on top of something else,

492
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
you're vulnerable
to that something else.

493
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,834
So if you're building on top
of Facebook or Instagram,

494
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:21,625
you have to figure
out how to get as much

495
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,959
value out if it
than it gets out of you.

496
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,834
I was with a
media mogul just now,

497
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,083
and he was like,

498
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,208
he was smart, he's young.

499
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,125
He was smart.

500
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,000
He realizes he has
to get the value out of

501
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,959
Facebook and Instagram
that it gets out of him.

502
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,250
And so, I would say,
if you can figure out

503
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,792
how to get the value out of it,

504
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,792
then you're fine.
For example, look at my content.

505
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,667
If I wanted to charge,

506
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,458
I get 50 emails a day like,

507
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,000
"Gary, you need to charge $4.99

508
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,166
"for DailyVee a week,"
or whatever.

509
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,667
"I'll pay 10 bucks."

510
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,250
You know, people
say this all the time.

511
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,875
If I wanted to charge,
I wouldn't be

512
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,708
as comfortable building on
top of Facebook and Instagram

513
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,166
because there's no
infrastructure for that, right?

514
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,125
I don't want to pay the
huge toll booth to Apple

515
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,917
that is, you know,
30 cents on the dollar either.

516
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:08,000
So I would go direct, but
I think what you need to do

517
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,458
is figure out how
to get value out of it.

518
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,792
And I think anybody
who's starting out early,

519
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,250
in the beginning
you get much more value

520
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,417
because you're
building way under the awareness

521
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,542
and attention and then if
you're looking to monetize,

522
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,000
then you can
start moving it off.

523
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,500
- Yep. I agree.
- Cool, thanks bro.

524
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,917
- [Nick] Hey, thanks-

525
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,417
(beeping)

526
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,959
- So, when you
were finishing a thought

527
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:29,792
when we did the call,

528
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,291
so data analytics is the place
you decided to attack first.

529
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,875
- Yeah, I mean we spoke to

530
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,333
literally dozens and
dozens and dozens of companies,

531
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,333
hundreds of people that are
on the front lines of hiring,

532
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,750
and this space
of data analytics,

533
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,875
an article just came out.

534
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,500
Somebody sent me, I think it
was maybe last week,

535
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,375
with an interview with
Eric Schmidt at Google,

536
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,417
and the headline is,

537
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:50,208
"This Is The Most Important
Skill of the 21st Century."

538
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,333
and it's basically taking data

539
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,458
and being able to
use that to tell a story

540
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,500
to make a business decision.

541
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,708
And it lives in every
function of a business.

542
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,458
And we have a
huge shortage predicted

543
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,542
in the years ahead so
that's where we start.

544
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,333
- My entire career has
been predicated on my intuition

545
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,208
and then working backwards,

546
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,125
but what's far
more scalable is to

547
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,083
actually look at
the data and make those.

548
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,665
And people who can analyze
the data makes a lot of sense.

549
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:15,874
So is it the concept?

550
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,125
Are you guys going to
continue to create majors

551
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,834
that you think map to

552
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:22,834
underserviced by the market?

553
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,583
- Yeah, and now
what I'm interested in

554
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,708
is like in the health space,
nursing for example.

555
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,708
I mean, the amount of open
jobs in nursing is massive.

556
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,667
- Hey, it's Gary Vaynerchuk.

557
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,291
You're on The #AskGaryVee Show
with Adam Braun.

558
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,834
How are you?

559
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,583
- [Janet] I'm doing good.
How are you all?

560
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,875
- We're doing super well.
What's your name?

561
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,291
- [Janet] I'm Janet Adams.
- Hey, Janet.

562
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,250
- [Janet] And my question for
him, as someone who speaks

563
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,250
on college
campuses around the country,

564
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,542
trying to help students
get out of student loan debt,

565
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:54,667
his story about his new,
I think it's MissionU--

566
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,917
- Yep.
- [Janet] caught my eye

567
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,417
over the last
week and definitely,

568
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:01,417
I know that it's just
for a check currently,

569
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,917
but how are you gonna be able
to shift it in the future

570
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,417
to maybe cover other
majors that are available

571
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:12,917
and would it work
with Corporate America?

572
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:13,750
- Yeah, um.

573
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,708
- [Gary] It's
awesome that you said nursing

574
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,542
right before she,--
- I mean it's

575
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:16,375
a great question.
- [Gary] Go ahead.

576
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,083
- We're literally just
kinda diving into this.

577
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,083
I mean, our goal is, again,

578
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,959
to build a college alternative
for the 21st century.

579
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,083
That means multiple majors

580
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,500
serving multiple
different areas.

581
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,917
The most popular
undergraduate major

582
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,458
in the country
right now is business,

583
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,375
but I'm sure many
of us have met people

584
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,959
who graduated
with a business degree

585
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,917
and still have no
clue about how to actually

586
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,333
contribute to a company.

587
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,458
And so that's
why our first focus

588
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,375
is on data analytics
and business intelligence,

589
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,250
but as I was just
saying to Gary, you know,

590
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,834
a real area of personal
interest for me is nursing.

591
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,375
We have
literally millions of jobs

592
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,291
that are about
to become available

593
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,166
as we have an aging
Baby Boomer population.

594
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,500
The current population of
nurses are heavily retiring.

595
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,750
There's a lot of different
jobs that are gonna emerge

596
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,834
within just the
health space in general,

597
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,542
that I don't think
traditional education

598
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,083
is gonna prepare people for.

599
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,125
And then when it
comes to actually

600
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,125
the Corporate America
side, this is already happening

601
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,000
whether MissionU existed or not.

602
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,291
So PricewaterhouseCooper,
Ernst &amp; Young,

603
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,291
two of the biggest
accounting firms in the country,

604
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,625
in the last 18
months have removed

605
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,583
the bachelor degree requirement

606
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,000
in order to get a
job at their company.

607
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,542
Obviously, Google has
done it in the tech space,

608
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,792
but you look at like
industries as old as publishing,

609
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,375
Penguin Books, one of
the largest publishers,

610
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,250
also removed
the bachelor degree.

611
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,250
So I think we're gonna
see a really large movement,

612
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,083
especially as Millennials, in
the next five to eight years,

613
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,834
become the dominant hiring
component of our workforce

614
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,708
because so many, you
know, I'm a Millennial,

615
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,333
I'm at the top end,
but so many of us recognize

616
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,166
that whether
somebody got a degree or not

617
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,166
is actually not
all that important.

618
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,917
It's much more about, you know,
where they got into school

619
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,208
is a helpful sorting mechanism,

620
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,291
but it's only one data point.

621
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,708
How they present in the room,

622
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,542
what their references are,

623
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,083
what their previous
work experience,

624
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,041
things like internship,

625
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,208
all of that, I think is
gonna increasingly matter

626
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,542
much, much more
than their transcript

627
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:59,041
or their major or their
GPA 'cause I can tell you,

628
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,417
you know, in my entire career
I don't think I've ever looked

629
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,291
at somebody's
transcript, not once.

630
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,959
- [Janet] And that's why
I try to tell the student

631
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:08,875
I am my own company,
Debt Sucks University.

632
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,625
(Adam laughs) And
like even Gary has truly

633
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,959
helped me talk to the
students into different ways

634
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,083
to make sure that they're ready,

635
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,792
and I've started
him on to so many people,

636
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,750
but I just wanna turn
on the higher ed community,

637
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,708
then you, because
it's just interruption,

638
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,875
just like we talking
about with Uber and so forth,

639
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,708
and I just think higher
ed needs to really get ready

640
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,542
before Uber does the
same way they did to taxis.

641
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,208
- I think you're exact,
I mean look,

642
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,250
they are so
stunningly vulnerable

643
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,333
because they think
what Adam said is so right.

644
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,417
People are like oh
Millennials are coming

645
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,291
and this has already happened.

646
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,166
You have people in their
early 30s that are achieving

647
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,125
and becoming
leaders of our world

648
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,959
who look at the world
completely differently

649
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,708
and they're gonna be
the judge and the jury,

650
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,250
and so Samantha, 32 years old,

651
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,875
who knows that her
emotional intell, I mean

652
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,500
I didn't think Adam
was gonna be that great

653
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,166
'cause he did go to
Brown instead of the reverse.

654
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,125
Like I actually
pre-judge people in reverse

655
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,250
and that's gonna
become far more common.

656
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,291
And to your question,
the corporations,

657
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,333
you know, when you look at

658
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,792
if you're a
15-year-old right now

659
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,125
and you think about it's
three, seven years from now,

660
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,583
when you
understand first of all,

661
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,750
the corporations of
seven years from now

662
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,834
look a lot more like
Warby Parker and Casper,

663
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,291
whether those
companies win or not

664
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,750
after there's an
economic downside, I don't know.

665
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,208
That model is
definitely gonna win.

666
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,708
So, and what I mean by that
model, I mean newer businesses

667
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,083
that are gonna be worth four,
ten, 15, $100 billion,

668
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,208
like, they're coming.

669
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,208
And their DNA is so different

670
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,208
and they're gonna
be the decision makers,

671
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,583
and so I think you're
barking up the right tree.

672
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,250
I'm glad that it's
caught your attention

673
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,417
and you know, what
I'm most excited about,

674
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,834
I would tell
you besides the fact

675
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:48,208
that I genuinely
love this human being,

676
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,667
I'm just excited about the
legacy of being involved in it

677
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,625
because I know
there's gonna be more things

678
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,458
that look like it.

679
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,333
- Oh yeah.

680
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,917
- I know you're gonna
build the biggest one.

681
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,291
At least, it's
very important to me

682
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,917
that you accomplish that.
- Me too, me too.

683
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,750
- But, I think this is coming.

684
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,417
This is coming.
This is coming.

685
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,542
So, thanks for the call.
- And thank you for the work

686
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:05,250
you do as well.

687
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,083
- [Janet] Thank you so much.

688
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,208
It's something that I love.

689
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,875
I'm actually speaking
on a campus tonight

690
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,166
and I'm gonna go in
there and show them the threat

691
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,750
that are against them and
how if they want to learn--

692
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,500
- So if you can go to MissionU,
just the letter U.com

693
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,583
and there's a
video on the homepage.

694
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:19,458
Just play 'em that video.

695
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,166
I think it'll accomplish
what you're seeking.

696
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,750
- And tell them
to become Jets fans.

697
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,750
- Yeah that's key.
- That's important to us.

698
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,625
- [Janet] I'll tell them
just become GaryVee fans.

699
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:28,667
(Adam laughs)

700
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:29,625
- Well, I'll take
the Jets even more so.

701
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,375
Anyway, thank you, take care.

702
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,166
Very sweet, alright
let's keep it going.

703
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,250
So look I mean this
is really out there, huh?

704
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,625
- Oh yeah.
- Like when you went out there

705
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,959
and you've been
doing a bunch of podcasts

706
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,542
and getting some awareness
and obviously and all that,

707
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,708
have you been overwhelmed?

708
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,917
Have you been underwhelmed?

709
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:46,291
Has it come from
a different angle?

710
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,166
What's been the biggest
surprise of the reaction?

711
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,750
- Yeah, I think the
biggest surprise for me

712
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,291
is the last eight years
focusing on Pencils of Promise,

713
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,000
people were curious,
that was the reaction.

714
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,125
Like I'd explain
I started this organization,

715
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,875
we're building schools
around the developing world.

716
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,750
People were like oh
how do you train teachers?

717
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,959
Or how do you
pick your communities?

718
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,250
There was curiosity.

719
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,583
When I talk to people about
the state of higher education

720
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,917
in this country,
there is a visceral reaction

721
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:13,166
and everybody
knows that it's broken.

722
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,000
- It's coming.

723
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,792
- And everybody knows somebody's
going to be hurt by it

724
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,083
and so people are psyched.

725
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,250
- Kyle, it's Gary Vaynerchuk
you're on The #AskGaryVee Show

726
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,792
with Adam Braun. How are you?

727
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:24,041
- [Kyle] Dude, holy shit,
I'm amazing. How are you?

728
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,125
- I'm doing amazing.
Where are you from?

729
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,208
- [Kyle] Dallas, Texas.

730
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,417
- I love it my man.
What's your question?

731
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:32,542
- [Kyle] Alright man,
my question is

732
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:33,959
how do you go about
learning how to delegate?

733
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,667
I've gotten to the point now
with my business that I'm

734
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,417
needing help and I end
as doing everything myself.

735
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,917
And I end up as
paying people basically just

736
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:45,000
to watch me do the
work that I want them to do.

737
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,792
- What do you do?

738
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,375
- [Kyle] I'm in real estate.

739
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,375
- And what do
you want them to do?

740
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,917
Like, run open houses or
cold call or what are they

741
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,458
supposed to be
doing that you're doing?

742
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,708
- [Kyle] I mean really,
a little bit of everything.

743
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,959
The main thing that I do
is advertising and branding

744
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:02,500
for myself, so for them
it's more of just taking care

745
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,667
of leads, locking
down leads, getting things

746
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,291
scheduled on the calendar.

747
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,875
- Got it, so you're the top
of the funnel and you want

748
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,625
them to see it
through underneath you.

749
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,417
- [Kyle] Yes sir.

750
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:17,291
- Got it, and who
have you been hiring?

751
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,917
- [Kyle] I mean honestly,
I think this might be

752
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:22,500
my hitch up in going
for people that I just know.

753
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,291
- Which I'm not against...

754
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:27,333
You know, listen, I'll
be honest with you Kyle.

755
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,083
Honestly, I'm big fan
of that, believe it or not,

756
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,542
especially in your early days.

757
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:32,625
- I mean, that's your M.O.
- That's my M.O.

758
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,792
- I feel like I
hang out with Gary's crew

759
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,875
and it's like all his buddies--

760
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,333
- Yeah, I knew
his kids, I'm a big...

761
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,250
- [Kyle] That's
what I was trying to do.

762
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,959
I was trying to
give the same opportunity

763
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,125
that's been given
to me, to my boys.

764
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,750
- Here's the one thing though.

765
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,625
I didn't hire a single
one of my college friends.

766
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,625
- I don't hire
friends personally.

767
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,625
- But you had
Michael White, you...

768
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,875
- I get people
involved but it's...

769
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,750
I think at this stage
in my life I certainly can.

770
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,917
When I was in my,
call it, early to mid 20s

771
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:00,166
and I was building
something, it was hard for me

772
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,375
as leader to demand the
level of excellence that

773
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,250
I wanted without it kind
of hurting the relationship.

774
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,583
And so I just
stayed away from it.

775
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,375
Now I would probably
not have as big of an issue.

776
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,625
- Kyle, let me tell
you what the biggest thing

777
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,208
you need to figure out is.

778
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,166
- [Kyle] Okay.

779
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,458
- Whether it's your
friends or people like you,

780
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:19,917
you have to hire
people that are obsessed with

781
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:23,208
logistics and are
type A personalities.

782
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,500
- Mhmmm.

783
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,333
You have to hire that love
the shit that you and I hate.

784
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,458
- [Kyle] I feel you on that.

785
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:36,083
- You need to find
somebody who just loves Excel

786
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,625
and loves being
in their calendar.

787
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,750
And freaks out when
you're a minute late.

788
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,041
You need cross-your-ts
and dot-your-is.

789
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,375
I'm sitting with Adam
and asking him about details

790
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:50,000
of MissionU right now, with
you, because I don't do that.

791
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,583
You need to hire
people that do do that

792
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,375
because you're just
hiring homies or people that

793
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:58,333
look the part of you but
that's not what you need.

794
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,375
If you're the
quarterback you need to hire

795
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,417
offensive linemen,
they look different.

796
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:03,917
- [Kyle] Okay. 
- Yeah.

797
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,667
The other thing I would say is,
the start of my career

798
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,041
I was probably much
the way that you were.

799
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,625
I was the person who
needed to do everything

800
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,875
myself because I
believed I could do

801
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,417
it better than
anyone on my team.

802
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,166
Then I spent three years
at Bain, which is arguably

803
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:18,542
the top culture in the
world for a corporate company.

804
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:22,667
What I saw there was,
that they spend an insane

805
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:25,041
amount of time
training people below them

806
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,834
to do the job that
they're doing today

807
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,917
so they can focus on
the next higher level issue.

808
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:31,208
So my biggest piece of
advice to you is, you should

809
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:34,083
look at how you're
spending your time and it might

810
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,917
feel really strange and
really awkward but you should

811
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:39,083
actually delegate, let's
say in the next two weeks...

812
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,959
- All, all...
- Call it 50%...

813
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,125
- Maybe all, of your time--

814
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,250
- All, it's two weeks.

815
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,208
- Teaching the people
that you are delegating to

816
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,583
to do all of your
exact responsibilities.

817
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:50,875
Literally to the
point where they can do it

818
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,917
as well if not
better than you can.

819
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:54,250
And then it will
free up your time.

820
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,250
Because at the end of the day,

821
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,375
delegation is a matter of trust.

822
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,041
And right now you're
not trusting these people

823
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,834
and that's because you
haven't invested in them.

824
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,291
- Or because they're losers.

825
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:05,208
- [Kyle] How do you go about
showing someone the vision?

826
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:08,542
You know, for me it's easy to
see because it's my vision.

827
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:10,041
How do you go
about showing someone...

828
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,834
- You don't, you
get rid of people

829
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:13,083
that don't buy into your vision.

830
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,542
If these are your
boys and they don't see

831
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,875
your vision, that
should be real fast.

832
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,166
- [Kyle] Okay.

833
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,583
- It's binary, brother.

834
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,125
Either they're bought
in that you're going to be

835
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,875
the biggest fucking
real estate mogul in fucking

836
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:26,500
Texas, America, the world,
the universe, or they don't.

837
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,291
And if they're just
there to collect a paycheck and

838
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,875
it's kind of easy because you
don't make them work hard.

839
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,458
You've got a problem and you
need to cut that cancer out.

840
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,083
- [Kyle] Okay, fuck yeah.

841
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,834
- I mean, that's it man, right?

842
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,625
I don't try to convince
anybody about my vision.

843
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:43,708
I'll give you my
fucking vision one time and

844
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:46,917
if you're not
bought in, fuck you.

845
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,750
- [Kyle] Nah yeah, fuck yeah.

846
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,375
I appreciate that, I really do.

847
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,917
- Yeah, and let me
tell you another thing...

848
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,291
- [Kyle] On how you look at it.

849
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,208
- But that's how
you look but that's

850
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,542
not how you're acting on it.

851
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,208
- [Kyle] Okay.

852
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,834
- You notice, if you've
been watching my content,

853
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:02,041
you know how I say
I never try to sell anybody,

854
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,667
like I'll try to
sell you one time but

855
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,542
if you're not in, you're out.

856
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,959
Like, it's fine, by the way,
I have hundreds of

857
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,917
employees at VaynerMedia
that are not fully bought in.

858
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:13,083
You need them, it's fine,
but I don't dwell on it.

859
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,708
I'm not emotional about it.

860
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,667
Like it doesn't
mean anything to me.

861
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,500
I'm on my mission and
so you need to just...

862
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,417
If they're literally
your homies or acquaintances,

863
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,041
the reason I built
companies with friends and

864
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:28,458
family is 'cause they are
automatically bought in usually.

865
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,750
If they're not, man, they're
just taking advantage of you,

866
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,000
slash, you need to
check your ego at the door.

867
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,083
You're right, it's about trust.

868
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:39,250
I love the fact that I know
every single person here

869
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,542
either is doing a
job that I can't do.

870
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,083
But if they're doing
my job, right like...

871
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,333
So the PR team,
the new business team,

872
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,500
Andy's job, those
are shitty jobs because

873
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,208
those are
things that I could do.

874
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:52,333
But I know if they're
doing it as an 8.3 to my 10,

875
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,917
or a 6.7 to my 10,
I can't do everything.

876
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,792
- And I'll tell you, the
greatest feeling in the world is

877
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,875
when you have a team
around you that takes

878
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,125
all those responsibilities
off your plate and

879
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,250
allows you to focus on
the thing that you can do

880
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,750
exceptionally well,
that they can't.

881
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,250
But right now you're
trying to do too many things.

882
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,333
- [Kyle] That's what I want,
I want the team, man.

883
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,542
I've been doing
everything on my own for

884
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,417
like five or six years.

885
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:16,625
- Then you're not
surrounded by the right people.

886
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,917
- [Kyle] That's what
I've been thinking...

887
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:22,625
- Or, or, or, or, or...

888
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,375
Let's do some basic math.

889
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,792
Let's say there's
four things you do and

890
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,250
you think you do
'em better than anybody.

891
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,750
Let's award you 10
full points, right,

892
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,959
you're getting 40 points.

893
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,917
Problem is there's 87
things that need to be done.

894
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,750
Do this math, if everybody
else is doing a two or

895
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,041
three but you're
getting all 87 things done.

896
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:41,000
The net score's greater.

897
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,875
People are crippled
by perfection

898
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,333
or doing everything right.

899
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,542
I think the thing
that I've always done

900
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:48,375
really well is you
just keep moving forward.

901
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,500
Just keep moving, nothing's
every going to be perfect.

902
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,291
So it's one of
two things, either

903
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,542
your homies suck
shit or you suck shit and

904
00:29:57,542 --> 00:30:00,250
you like the ego boost
that you're better at it than

905
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,792
your average,
below average friends,

906
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,625
which means
you'll never be that big.

907
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,542
You've got to
figure out which one it is.

908
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:07,166
And it's probably
a little bit of both.

909
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,000
You know what I mean?

910
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,375
It always is
a little bit of both.

911
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,917
- [Kyle] I would agree,
for sure.

912
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:11,792
- That's it, man.

913
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:12,917
- [Kyle] I
would definitely agree.

914
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:14,333
So just increase my action,

915
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,417
and bring more people involved,

916
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,875
and just let it happen?

917
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,708
- And figure out,
are you holding it back

918
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,166
because it makes you feel good

919
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,458
that you're a
better salesperson,

920
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,667
the amount of people I watch

921
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,708
that build one and two
million dollar businesses

922
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,542
'cause they get
off on being the best

923
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,208
at all these little things,

924
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,959
it happens every day,
and I'm always like,

925
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,750
okay, that player's
gonna be an average player,

926
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,083
'cause they don't realize,

927
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,291
notice how I always talk about
sucking shit and everything?

928
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,250
And I suck at this,
- [Kyle] Yep.

929
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,125
- Like, you have to take
pride in your shortcomings,

930
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,792
because then you
start acknowledging them

931
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,250
and then, you know,
everybody's fronting

932
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,750
that they're so
awesome and everything.

933
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,667
I suck at
almost everything, yet,

934
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm winning because
I surround myself with people

935
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,375
that know what
they're doing in that world.

936
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,417
I can't edit videos
like these characters.

937
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,667
- Mhmmm.

938
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,875
- [Kyle] Well, I think
that the problem I have

939
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,375
is that I see what,
I personally feel like

940
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:02,250
I see the potential in
the people that I bring on,

941
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,250
and I just can't get
them to actually see it,

942
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,333
or at least,
tap into it on themselves.

943
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,000
- Yeah, but if
you see it and they're

944
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,500
not bringing it to fruition in
a very short period of time,

945
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,917
then those
aren't the right people

946
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:14,125
that would be good at business.

947
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,500
- Yeah, you might also suck
at motivating people, bro.

948
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,750
- [Kyle] Okay.

949
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,625
- Like, that's a real part,

950
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:20,834
like me,
- Oh, yeah.

951
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,166
- We have to
understand these variables.

952
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,000
This is for everybody, right,

953
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,250
Kyle, I have no idea.

954
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,583
Like, it could
literally be that they're,

955
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,667
they're milking you and
they don't wanna do anything,

956
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,291
and you're the homie that's
kinda dragging everybody up,

957
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,375
that could be the case,
but I would also say,

958
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,625
maybe your management
style and leadership style

959
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,125
is making them go in reverse,

960
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,875
because maybe when
you should be using honey,

961
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,083
you're using vinegar, and when
you should be using vinegar,

962
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:45,959
you're using honey, it
could be an indication on you.

963
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:48,083
- [Kyle] Okay.
And I don't know, right?

964
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,959
- [Kyle] I definitely know,
I know that I suck at,

965
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,917
like I want to work with people,

966
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,458
I don't want
people to work for me.

967
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,500
- Okay.

968
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,917
- [Kyle] And, and that's a
big thing for me personally,

969
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,166
and I think
that at the same time

970
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,500
I'm too at fault with that,

971
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,417
because I don't want
to be someone's boss,

972
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,166
I want to, you know,
I just want to be,

973
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,333
does that make sense?

974
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,875
- Hell yeah it does.
- Yeah.

975
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,500
- Hell it does. Big time.

976
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,959
- Yeah, I mean,
- [Kyle] But I think,--

977
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:11,708
- That's where you kinda,--

978
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,333
- [Kyle] They almost want a boss.

979
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,583
Without knowing it.

980
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:18,041
- Dude, everybody wants a boss
that they go work somewhere.

981
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:18,625
- Yeah.

982
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,625
- If you go work somewhere,
you're looking for a leader.

983
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,291
- Yeah.

984
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:24,125
I would say you need
to step into that roll,

985
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,667
and not try to be
every person's friend,

986
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,250
in fact, there's
also a big difference

987
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,500
between a boss and a leader.

988
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,625
People are looking for a leader.

989
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:30,166
- [Kyle] Mhmmm.

990
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:30,875
- That's what
they need you to be.

991
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,166
Not the boss, they need
you to be a leader.

992
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,125
- [Kyle] That's what
I want to be.

993
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,834
- How old are you?
- [Kyle] I truly do. I'm 22.

994
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,083
- Good, man. You're a baby.

995
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,625
You're like, like, you're
a real fuckin' baby, right?

996
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,917
So, like you've got plenty
of time to mold into this.

997
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,125
The fact that
you're aware about this,

998
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,500
the fact that
you're watching this,

999
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,917
the fact that
we're talking about this,

1000
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:46,792
and you got time man.

1001
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,250
I wouldn't cripple yourself.

1002
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,375
You are literally a child.

1003
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,542
Like, you're 22 years old.

1004
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:53,458
You got a lot of time.

1005
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:57,166
Listen, at 22, I was not able
to give critical feedback,--

1006
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,166
- Right.
- to my employees.

1007
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,000
I wasn't good at it.

1008
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,500
- Hearing that you're
22 changes the equation.

1009
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,792
I mean, I was 24 when
I started Pencils of Promise,

1010
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,333
it was my friends
that were around me,

1011
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,458
helping me throw
these parties, raise money,

1012
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,959
and I could never
order them around,

1013
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,542
and, you know,
I just didn't have the,

1014
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,458
call it self-confidence,
as the, you know,

1015
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,750
leader of the organization,
I was always grateful,

1016
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,917
all those things,
but at the end of the day,

1017
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:18,917
it becomes very clear
where the talent rises,

1018
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:21,000
and the cream really
does rise to the top,

1019
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,917
once you set a clear vision,

1020
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,041
and then you
start holding people

1021
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:25,750
accountable to real results, so.

1022
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,125
- And you might have some,
- I wish you luck, man.

1023
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,041
- I mean, Adam had
snobby friends like Brad H.,

1024
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,959
you know, who could
never take feedback. (laughs)

1025
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:33,458
So you gotta be careful with
who you surround yourself with.

1026
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,458
Brad, I love you.

1027
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,417
Kyle, good luck. Be patient.

1028
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:37,542
- [Kyle] Alright, man,
I appreciate it.

1029
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:38,208
- Here's what I would say,

1030
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,041
let me give you one
real tangible thing.

1031
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,125
Go have your first
ever negative conversation

1032
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,542
with one of your employees,

1033
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:45,750
just go taste it.

1034
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,125
Just go in there,
- [Kyle] Okay.

1035
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,166
- Sit down Rick, and be
like, Rick, listen to me.

1036
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,708
We've been friends since
Little League and 4th grade,

1037
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,542
I love you, you're the best,

1038
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,875
you saved me from drowning
in the river in 9th grade,

1039
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,625
but here's the
problem, you suck,

1040
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,208
so either you get
your shit together,

1041
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,250
or I have to fire you.

1042
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,166
- [Kyle] Alright man.

1043
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,417
Hey, I really
appreciate you taking the call--

1044
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:06,166
- Kyle.

1045
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:06,959
- [Kyle] giving me
all the advice,

1046
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:09,166
- Don't jump off real quick.
You gotta promise to me that

1047
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,917
you're gonna go
have that conversation.

1048
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,041
- [Kyle] No, I literally am,

1049
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,625
I gotta meet with a
couple of my guys tonight,

1050
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,875
so we're gonna have a talk.

1051
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,875
- Like, really,
now when you said

1052
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:18,542
a couple of your guys,

1053
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:19,708
if you're gonna
have that conversation,

1054
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,875
make sure you have it
one-on-one.

1055
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:21,708
- Yep.

1056
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:22,708
- Don't start
lumping people in, okay?

1057
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:23,583
- [Kyle] Individually?
- Yeah.

1058
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,125
- One-on-one.

1059
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:24,833
- Because when
you start lumping,

1060
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,125
somebody's feelings get hurt,

1061
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,417
it can get confusing.
Let me tell you

1062
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:29,583
what losing players do.

1063
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:31,750
If they're both
sitting there, I'd be like,

1064
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,417
oh, it's Adam who screwed
up, he's just bringing me

1065
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,417
here to make it more palpable,

1066
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:38,500
like, you've got to do
that one-on-one, okay?

1067
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,333
And you really, listen man,
you really have to go there.

1068
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,500
- Mhmmm, and
start the conversation

1069
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,542
by framing it up as,
I want to talk to you

1070
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,333
to get feedback, and
right then and there,

1071
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,375
that's gonna set the tone.

1072
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,291
This isn't like a friendly,
normal conversation,

1073
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,625
this is about
getting that feedback,

1074
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,417
having that tough
conversation that you need.

1075
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:57,417
- And just say,

1076
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,750
listen, I love you, but.
- Yeah.

1077
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,417
- Make this a but conversation.

1078
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:03,083
Be like, listen,
we're homies for life.

1079
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:08,166
But, you know, you're
lazy as fuck, asshole.

1080
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,166
- [Kyle] No, yeah, I, honestly,

1081
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,500
everything you're
telling me I feel like

1082
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,417
I already know,
I just haven't had the,--

1083
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,708
- I know you know,
you don't have the balls

1084
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,417
to do it yet,
because most people don't,

1085
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,959
and the reason I'm not
letting you get off the phone,

1086
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:22,500
is usually people
need this kind of pep talk,

1087
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,750
and I'm worried that I haven't
put enough energy into you,

1088
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,166
and that in the next four
hours it's gonna go away,

1089
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,375
and then you're
gonna shit the bed.

1090
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,417
So the reason I'm
keeping you on the phone,

1091
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:33,458
is I'm trying to
give you the audacity

1092
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:34,917
to actually get this done.

1093
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:36,500
Because the
first time you do it,

1094
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,250
remember how scared
you were to kiss a girl?

1095
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,083
- [Kyle] Oh yeah.

1096
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,250
- Remember how after you did it,

1097
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,333
you weren't scared anymore?

1098
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,333
- [Kyle] Yeah, immediately.

1099
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,959
- You need to go have

1100
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,125
this negative,--
- No reason.

1101
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,166
- you need to have, you need to

1102
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,959
go have this
negative conversation.

1103
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,959
It will change the
course of your career.

1104
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,333
- [Kyle] I appreciate it,
I really do.

1105
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,208
I mean, I'm actually
opening up the Austin market

1106
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:01,333
in about a week, so
I gotta do this now,

1107
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,333
and that's why I gave you,

1108
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,875
I asked the question,
and I've literally

1109
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,083
been sitting in
Walmart just hoping

1110
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,583
that you guys would call me, so.

1111
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,750
- Andy K saved your
day in Walmart, I love it.

1112
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,959
Love you bro.

1113
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,083
- [Kyle] Alright man,
appreciate it.

1114
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:13,333
- You got it.
- Take care.

1115
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,166
- It's cool.

1116
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,166
Call-in's fun, right?
- Yeah, that's great.

1117
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,959
- We're like
Mike and the Mad Dog.

1118
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:18,792
Who are you?

1119
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,375
You're more Mike?
Am I Mad Dog?

1120
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,000
- Yeah, definitely.

1121
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,708
- All right, fine.

1122
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,417
- I think amongst the two of
us, you definitely are Mad Dog.

1123
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,166
(Gary and Adam laugh)

1124
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,375
- Mike!

1125
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,917
So, that was interesting.

1126
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,083
- That was great.

1127
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,166
I mean, the whole
thing shifted for me

1128
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,000
when he said he was 22.

1129
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,208
- Yeah, and I
could tell, the voice,

1130
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,083
I was like, "He's young."
- [C.J.] Hello?

1131
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,000
- Yo, it's GaryVee,
you're on The #AskGaryVee Show,

1132
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,542
with Adam Braun,
what's your name?

1133
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:40,500
- [C.J.] You gotta
be kidding me, man.

1134
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,583
- Not joking.
(C.J. laughs)

1135
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,208
- [C.J.] Yo, my
name is C.J. Reynolds,

1136
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:49,000
I teach in West Philadelphia.
- Born and raised?

1137
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,708
- [C.J.] You know,
on the playground's

1138
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,291
where I spend most of my days.
(Gary laughs)

1139
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,583
- I love it, C.J., how are you?

1140
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,917
- [C.J.] I'm doing great, man.

1141
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,208
I'm sitting here
watching your feed

1142
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,041
and I'm waiting for the
next question to be done,

1143
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,166
so I could know if
you were gonna call.

1144
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,667
- Well guess what, you won.

1145
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:02,500
- [C.J.] My kids
are coming in the room

1146
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,750
to ask me something real quick,

1147
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,708
give me ten seconds,
I'll be right with ya.

1148
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,041
- Ten, nine, eight--

1149
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,375
- [C.J.] So here's my question.

1150
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:08,875
- Okay, oh us.

1151
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:12,083
- [C.J.] I have students that
I teach in West Philadelphia,

1152
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,291
I teach at a all boys school.

1153
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:16,250
And we're talking, like,
inner city Philadelphia

1154
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,917
and, you know, I'm
gonna show them this feed,

1155
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:19,959
and what I would
love to show them,

1156
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:22,583
is you giving them some advice

1157
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,625
as to what to do
after high school,

1158
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,166
if the don't
want to go to college.

1159
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,458
Because coming
from me, it's like--

1160
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,834
- Yeah, you're the teacher.

1161
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:31,708
- [C.J.] The same
thing over and over again.

1162
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,333
- Yeah.

1163
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,041
- [C.J.] I'm a teacher,
I teach ninth grade literature.

1164
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:38,750
I actually, I hit you
up on Twitter a while ago,

1165
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,750
when you were looking for--

1166
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,125
- Oh, schools to come,
I actually, yep, yep.

1167
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,291
Do we have one, right?

1168
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,792
Go ahead, okay.

1169
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,834
- [C.J.] So what could
you speak to my students

1170
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:50,417
to kinda give them something to,

1171
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,625
you know, they're not
just hearing me but they're,

1172
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:56,208
they know who you are, we
watch your videos in class.

1173
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:59,458
They keep asking
me, they're like...

1174
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:03,834
So, I'm always giving
them your information,

1175
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,959
and telling them what
I think you would say,

1176
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,208
but I would love for you

1177
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,708
to speak to them
directly if you could.

1178
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:09,708
- I could.

1179
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,291
Now, like, help
me a little bit here,

1180
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,750
because the truth is,
let's start from the top,

1181
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,792
and I'm talking to the class
now, and you can clip this.

1182
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,083
We'll even send you a clip,

1183
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,417
got it Tyler?
We'll send you this clip.

1184
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:21,166
First of all,
how many are there?

1185
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,417
- [C.J.] I have,
this graduating class

1186
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:24,417
is about a hundred students.

1187
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,542
- Right, so for the hundred
of you, you're all different.

1188
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,875
Like, if you don't
want to go to college,

1189
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,583
if you want to
figure out what to do,

1190
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:31,583
all of you are different.

1191
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,959
Some of you can sing,

1192
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:37,083
some of you are math based,
and you can be analytical.

1193
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,667
There's a million
things you could do.

1194
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,333
Obviously it's crazy
we got you on this show,

1195
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,166
because of MissionU, so
you gotta go check that out.

1196
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,917
There's a million
things that I could tell you.

1197
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:47,458
Here's the one
thing I can promise you,

1198
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,417
you need to work
your fucking face off.

1199
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:53,125
And, nobody gives a
shit about where you grew up.

1200
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:57,583
Like, nobody's gonna feel sorry
for you, circumstantially,

1201
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:59,250
or feel positive for you.

1202
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,125
Like, whether
you're born in the ghetto,

1203
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:03,208
or you're born to a trust fund,

1204
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,291
at the end of the day,

1205
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,375
once you hit the
real world, nobody cares.

1206
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,667
'Cause then the clock's on.

1207
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:10,000
If you're a trust fund baby,
people are judging you,

1208
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,333
like, you suck, it's
all 'cause of your daddy.

1209
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,166
If you're fucking
from the ghetto,

1210
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,375
it's like, you have no shot,
you don't look the part.

1211
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,834
Either way, nobody cares.

1212
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:22,208
The end, the only thing that
you should be figuring out

1213
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:23,583
is what are you good at,

1214
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:26,667
and so you should
try a lot of shit, right?

1215
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:30,083
And then you need
to work every minute.

1216
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:32,041
If you're not
gonna go to college,

1217
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,542
you're gonna
have to work, right?

1218
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:37,083
Like, if you're not gonna
use the brand of the degree,

1219
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,083
and before MissionU means
something to the whole world,

1220
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,083
you're gonna have
to work, and prove it.

1221
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,917
And nobody's gonna feel bad
that you're working two jobs,

1222
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:47,583
or that you don't have
time to hang out anymore.

1223
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,750
C.J., you know this.

1224
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,417
Look, these kids, they're young.

1225
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:52,750
We've all been young.

1226
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,375
The biggest thing
that's going on is,

1227
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,792
it's all the same
advice over and over.

1228
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:01,291
You have to
work your brains out,

1229
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:05,208
and you have to realize,
nobody cares about you.

1230
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:08,750
And once you go into that
place, and you're super solo,

1231
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,208
then you have a prayer.

1232
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,834
But for any second

1233
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:14,375
that you think
somebody's gonna save you,

1234
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:18,750
Bernie Sanders,
Donald Trump, the government,

1235
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,291
your sister, the people
that feel bad for you.

1236
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,834
Like, nobody gives a fuck.

1237
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:26,542
Do they understand that C.J.?

1238
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:27,959
I'm askin' you, I'm asking you.

1239
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:31,417
- [C.J.] You know,
so I hear ya, and so that's...

1240
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:33,625
Unfortunately, I think
that that only comes,

1241
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:37,208
that understanding
comes with doing, right?

1242
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,583
- It's the
Mike Tyson thing, right?

1243
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,500
As soon as you get
actually punched in the mouth,

1244
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
then you're like, "Oh..."

1245
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,834
- [C.J.] Exactly,
and so a lot of my guys

1246
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:47,208
have been literally
punched in the mouth

1247
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,708
many times in their lives.

1248
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,834
And so it's about,
like, helping them to see

1249
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:54,959
that there's kinda more to
themselves, or that there's,

1250
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,333
they have more to offer than...

1251
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,542
You know, they've kinda
been beaten down already,

1252
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:02,583
and some guys seem a little bit,

1253
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:06,583
you know, like they have
been to injured to move on--

1254
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,708
- Is what, it's just,

1255
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,208
do they have the
chip on their shoulder

1256
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,250
that somebody owes them

1257
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,375
something because
it was fucked up,

1258
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,500
or do they have no self esteem

1259
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,959
because everybody
told them they can't win?

1260
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,000
- [C.J.] Both.
You know, it's a both thing--

1261
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,792
- That's exactly right.

1262
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,792
- [C.J.] We're
talking about boys.

1263
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,250
So, it's a all boys school,

1264
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,083
where, you know, 90% of my
guys don't have a dad at home,

1265
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,667
which literally, it
makes my job easier,

1266
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:31,375
because, you know, you're a
guy that shows up every day

1267
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,625
and tells kids that you love
them, and that you see them,

1268
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:36,625
and that they're not invisible.

1269
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:40,917
But it's me doing that
with my crew at school,

1270
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:42,291
over and over and over again,

1271
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,250
and so for like the, you know,

1272
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,417
Akil Dandlers, and
the Elijah Goodwins,

1273
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:50,792
and the, you
know, Mark Slawders...

1274
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,708
And I'm shouting them
out so they're gonna go,

1275
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:56,542
"Oh shit, Reynolds, you just
said my name on the internet."

1276
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:58,000
- Hey Reynolds, can
I ask you a question?

1277
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,583
If I paid for the bus, like,
I know schools are fucked up,

1278
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,500
so they can't take advantage,
but if I paid for the bus,

1279
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,208
can you bring like
eight or nine of 'em up here

1280
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,125
and hang with me for an hour?

1281
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:07,750
- [Reynolds] I'll go.

1282
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,000
I will be up
there this afternoon

1283
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,166
if you pay for the bus.

1284
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,458
That's what I'm gonna do.
- Cool.

1285
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,917
So cool.

1286
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,583
Send an email to
Gary@VaynerMedia.

1287
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,291
I'm gonna pay for the bus.

1288
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,667
You're gonna come up here.

1289
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:20,250
We're gonna film it, 'cause
then I'll get into real deep.

1290
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,750
I don't want to be the
guy who's just shouting

1291
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,458
to 100 people without context.

1292
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,708
Let's take
eight or nine of them.

1293
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,291
Do some fucking contest.
- [Reynolds] Let's do it.

1294
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:27,708
- Reynolds, do
whatever the fuck you gotta do

1295
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:29,417
to pick eight or nine of them.

1296
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,542
Bring them up here,
we'll jam with them,

1297
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,875
we'll film that,
and then you can use it

1298
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,917
because they look
the part of the other

1299
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:39,583
90 and the 100 next year,
and the 100 next year.

1300
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:43,875
And I knew the answer to
my question was both, right?

1301
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,583
Here's the problem.
And this is for everybody,

1302
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,125
this is not
just inner city kids.

1303
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,166
It's for everybody.

1304
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,959
Johnny Texas, you know,
Rick Oklahoma,

1305
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:53,750
and Pam Peru.

1306
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,667
The bottom line is it's one
of the two opposite things.

1307
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,834
Either you have a
chip on your shoulder

1308
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:02,792
and you think the world
fucked you and you're unlucky.

1309
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,667
Or you've
actually been suppressed

1310
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,917
and told you can't, right?

1311
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,750
In a different way than that.

1312
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,792
- [C.J.] Yep, yep.

1313
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:11,208
- It's not the
circumstance, it's the verbiage.

1314
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:14,000
You actually have parents,
they just suck.

1315
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,500
Right? They're in pain,

1316
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,208
so they don't
want you to succeed.

1317
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,000
Misery loves company.

1318
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,417
It all ends up in
the same place, Reynolds.

1319
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:22,417
Which is...

1320
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:24,250
It doesn't matter!

1321
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,583
And that's what I want
these kids to understand.

1322
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:29,708
It just doesn't matter.

1323
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,000
Because once you
get on the field,

1324
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,458
it's just the field.

1325
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:36,208
And so the quicker you
can make that mind shift...

1326
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:38,750
And then the other
thing that none of us realize

1327
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,625
is how much time you have.

1328
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,500
- Yeah.

1329
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,333
- Like if I knew I as
an 18-year-old...

1330
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,041
I did and that's why I won,

1331
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,917
but I didn't even
know to the extreme.

1332
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:47,959
The biggest thing I'm gonna do

1333
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,458
with those eight or
nine kids, Reynolds,

1334
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,333
is I'm gonna
make them understand

1335
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,667
they just have to
put their head down

1336
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,417
for 15 years.

1337
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:55,625
And think about, when you're 18,

1338
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:56,875
what 15 years sounds like.
- Yeah.

1339
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:59,041
- Right? It took forever.
- [C.J.] No, it's nothin'.

1340
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,583
- Well, it's nothing
to us as we get older.

1341
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:01,917
When you're 18?

1342
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:02,750
Dude, I'll be honest with you,

1343
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,000
15 years feels
even a little bit long

1344
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,583
to me right now and I'm 41.

1345
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:07,875
When you're 18, 15 years
is your whole fuckin' life.

1346
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:10,458
When you tell them,
eat shit for 15 years,

1347
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:13,708
you'll be 33, a child,

1348
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,500
and you can then go win?

1349
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
That fucks with you,

1350
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,000
if I can break through
and get them to understand.

1351
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,375
- The only other thing,
this is Adam.

1352
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,792
The only other
thing I'll add in,

1353
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:25,000
and I think, one,
it's amazing that Gary's

1354
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,208
gonna bring these kids up here,

1355
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,875
and I will
absolutely be watching

1356
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,792
that session that
you have with them,

1357
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,333
but the thing that I've seen,

1358
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,875
and this is the one
thing that as a teacher

1359
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,500
I think you can
most instill in kids,

1360
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,708
is that you
become your expectations.

1361
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,583
And people find
their expectations,

1362
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,333
sometimes externally,
sometimes internally,

1363
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,708
sometimes it's a
parent or a coach

1364
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:44,041
or a teacher or a mentor,

1365
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,291
that helps you understand
your self-expectation.

1366
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,375
Other people are just

1367
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:49,166
intrinsically born
with this belief

1368
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,083
that they're gonna
go do something great,

1369
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:53,083
but you become
your expectations,

1370
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,542
and so every one of those kids,

1371
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:56,458
regardless of
their situation today,

1372
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,500
if they can
redefine the expectation

1373
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,458
for their future,

1374
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,542
then that creates
the underlying motivation

1375
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,166
to bust ass for
the next 15 years,

1376
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,250
but if they don't
have the expectation

1377
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,708
of the outcome in the future,

1378
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,625
and they don't hold
themselves accountable to it,

1379
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,417
then they won't
get to that place.

1380
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,083
- If they understood The Man
that's holding them down

1381
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,834
is in their fucking dome,

1382
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:16,750
everything would change.

1383
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,083
- [C.J.] True, yes.
I love it.

1384
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,625
So hey, listen, can I
shout one thing out real quick?

1385
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,166
- Yep.

1386
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,083
- [C.J.] If people
want to check out my guide,

1387
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,041
I have a YouTube site called
- Do it, go.

1388
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:30,000
- [C.J.] Real Rap
with The Reynolds.

1389
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,792
I post teacher videos,

1390
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:33,750
like how people that
teach in the inner city

1391
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,917
should stop going
there for two years

1392
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:38,333
to, like, do their
good deed and then move on,

1393
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,250
but they should,
like, go there and stay,

1394
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,792
and this is how you can stay

1395
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:44,750
and like, how you can just
keep crushing it every year,

1396
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,041
year after year,

1397
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:48,083
no matter what the
kids bring in with them,

1398
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,125
that you're, like,
helping them and loving them.

1399
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,166
- What's the name of
the video series again?

1400
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,000
- What's the name again?

1401
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,208
- [C.J.] It's called
Real Rap with The Reynolds.

1402
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:58,417
- Real Rap with The Reynolds.

1403
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:00,750
Good, we'll put it there. 
(bell dings)

1404
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,667
Reynolds, I can't
wait to fuckin' see you.

1405
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:03,917
You better get
your ass here soon.

1406
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:05,792
The season's almost over.

1407
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,000
I'll see you soon.

1408
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,291
I'll see you next week.

1409
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,583
Let's figure it out.
See ya.

1410
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:10,500
I think that's a good one.

1411
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,000
Nah, I think that's good.

1412
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,792
That was fuckin' awesome.
- That was great.

1413
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,250
- He hit on all the
right things, right,

1414
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,750
the cliche, like,
I'm a good person,

1415
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,500
two years kind of thing.

1416
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,834
Adam, how do you want
to close this out here?

1417
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:21,708
And then you get to ask
the question of the day.

1418
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:22,917
- I get to ask the question.
- Mhmmm.

1419
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:25,417
- To you? Or to?
- No, to the world.

1420
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:26,959
A.K.A., a
couple thousand people.

1421
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:27,917
- Yeah.

1422
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:33,500
I want to hear

1423
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,708
what your hope is for your
children's higher education.

1424
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:40,417
- I'll answer mine real quick

1425
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:41,625
and then you guys
can all answer yours.

1426
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,417
I know a lot of you are young
and far away from children,

1427
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:44,708
many others have children,

1428
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:45,875
and I'd love to see answers.

1429
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,750
Mine is very simple, which is,

1430
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,375
I just want my kids to be happy.

1431
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,667
First of all, I'm
unique because I made it

1432
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:54,917
without higher education,

1433
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,750
so I have no
expectations or wants or needs.

1434
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,250
I want them to do
what they want to do,

1435
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,291
A.K.A., in reverse, too.

1436
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:04,417
If Xander wants to be the
greatest scholar of all time,

1437
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:07,000
with no practical execution,

1438
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,875
the thing that I
would make fun of,

1439
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,417
that I want him to
be the greatest fuckin'

1440
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,875
pontificator and theorist ever,

1441
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,375
as long as that is
what he wants to be about.

1442
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,000
So, from my standpoint,

1443
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,458
that's what I want out of it.

1444
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:21,208
I also recognize
they're seven and four,

1445
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:24,083
11, 14 years from today,

1446
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,625
with things like
what you're up to,

1447
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,125
the way technology's working,

1448
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,959
and the way the
ecosystem's playing out,

1449
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:31,000
this is why I'm so upset
for all the parents I have

1450
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,542
on the Upper East
Side of Town School

1451
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:33,417
and all these things,

1452
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,667
is they don't realize,

1453
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,792
Horseman and Avenues,

1454
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:40,583
they don't realize the buzzsaw
that they're walking into.

1455
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:42,625
They think their
kids need to go to chess,

1456
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:43,875
and they need to be
six-year-olds that are prepping

1457
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,125
for S.A.T.s, and I'm like,

1458
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,083
what the fuck world do you think

1459
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,708
little fucking Johnny,

1460
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:49,542
excuse me, not Johnny,

1461
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:53,875
little fucking Hudson
is gonna be living in?

1462
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:55,959
Anyway, that's my answer.

1463
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:56,792
- I like it.

1464
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,000
- I love you, brother.
- I love you too, man.

1465
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,834
- Adam Braun.

1466
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:00,750
You keep asking questions,

1467
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,667
we'll keep answering them.

1468
00:48:02,667 --> 00:00:00,000
