1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,460
- What up VLOG?

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,679
It's me, in a meeting
that I'm about to have.

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,898
Just continuing the day,
interacting with a lot of people,

4
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:14,508
have a really interesting vibe today.

5
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:17,318
No D Rock cause a lot of
meetings that I couldn't go to,

6
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:20,158
plus kind of a saddened heart a little bit

7
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:22,159
with all the news out of Vegas.

8
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:25,242
♫ We're unstoppable.

9
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:32,069
- Yo, it's Gary V.

10
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:37,247
- If you actually don't give a fuck

11
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:40,237
the way I didn't of what
people think about you,

12
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:43,590
all through your 20's,
like you just don't care,

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,268
like you literally don't.

14
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,228
And, you just build
something for yourself,

15
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:48,707
you have a much better chance.

16
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:52,078
Just close your eyes until you're 29.

17
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:55,161
Just close your eyes until you're 29.

18
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:57,758
In Chicago.

19
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:00,686
Just got a bunch of
meetings done in Detroit.

20
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,139
Just enjoying the day,
enjoying it with people

21
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:06,457
I appreciate and having
fruitful meetings and debates,

22
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,290
just grinding through.

23
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,347
Flip it on D Rock.

24
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:12,508
Productive day?

25
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:13,617
- Phenomenal.

26
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:15,019
- [Gary] Ryan Harwood.

27
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,267
Is PureWow gonna do well?

28
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,087
I turned it off.

29
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,746
♫ Although it seems illogical,
until you follow your dreams

30
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:21,916
- What's up Instagram?

31
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,116
I haven't posted all day

32
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:28,286
because my heart was hurting
and my stomach was empty

33
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,453
and I just didn't feel it.

34
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:34,347
But, I just wanted to jump
on and very simply say,

35
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:35,676
I love you guys so much.

36
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:38,097
The engagement of everything
going with you guys

37
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,596
on the DM and the emails, tweets,

38
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:42,956
really lifting my spirits today.

39
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:44,265
Tough day.

40
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:46,537
Just really appreciate you, Youtube.

41
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:48,787
Thanks for watching,
thanks for commenting,

42
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:50,094
thanks for the feedback.

43
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:51,405
Tom Petty just passed away.

44
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:52,238
What a legend.

45
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,678
Tom Petty, you see that.

46
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,845
What up my man? Thank you.

47
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,983
Nice meeting you man.

48
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:01,316
Thanks for saying what's up.

49
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:02,706
Keep saying hi everyone.

50
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,755
I'm fucking flattered as fuck.

51
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,206
Don't ever be shy.

52
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,737
Or give me a head nod,
like if you see I'm busy

53
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,357
with the family or something.

54
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:11,616
A little head nod.

55
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:14,199
I like winking, you've seen it.

56
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:17,254
Team Human, forever.

57
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:21,537
I have so much love for the human team.

58
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:22,756
Just got love for you.

59
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:23,937
Just grinding through

60
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:25,867
and just really wanted
to take another second,

61
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:27,357
and this is going to be
just a fucking love fest,

62
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:28,857
but, it is what it is.

63
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:33,084
Make sure that you guys know
how much I have for all of you.

64
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:36,345
Literally, brushing my teeth
and wanting to make sure

65
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,807
that you guys know I love you.

66
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,783
Every day is different,
that's why you vlog.

67
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:42,574
Just wanting to send you my appreciation,

68
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:44,572
wish you the best,

69
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,045
and for the fun moment,

70
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:47,694
who's your favorite Knick, Ryan?

71
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:49,375
- My favorite Knick right now?

72
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,208
Frank.

73
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,849
Frenchie.

74
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,096
- Ryan's a big Knicks fan.

75
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:55,486
And CEO of PureWow.

76
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:56,622
He likes their point guard.

77
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:57,936
♫ I feel it's really meant to be

78
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:59,364
♫ I know I've got to chase my dreams

79
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:00,713
♫ The universe is handing me

80
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,903
♫ The seeds of hope of growing these

81
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:08,070
♫ Hands to the sky if you know what I know

82
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:14,251
- Watching important video on Youtube.

83
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,291
On Vimeo, it's so weird.

84
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:26,051
♫ You'll finally learn to stand up OK.

85
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,732
- If there's any thesis I
believe in more than anything

86
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:30,090
it's hacking culture.

87
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,186
It's understanding what
people give a shit about

88
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:34,029
and figuring out how to penetrate it

89
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:35,767
and bring value to it.

90
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,907
And the way I always start
is that I'm always trying

91
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,247
to find people that are authentic to it,

92
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:41,188
understand it, understand
the origin stories,

93
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,747
where it came from, have been part of it.

94
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:45,839
I did that with social media,
with Kevin Rose and others.

95
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:48,459
I've done that in wine with Bobby Catcher

96
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,542
and Noah Bass and others.

97
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,537
And, when I look at
crypto-currency and specifically,

98
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:56,799
eSports, that's what I want to do.

99
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,627
I've spent some time
with some great people,

100
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:00,508
but for me the Hector
meeting was super exciting

101
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,939
because I knew he was ingrained in it,

102
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,857
authentic to it, and a good dude.

103
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,509
Plus, had a ton of context for me,

104
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:07,597
those are the kind of
meetings I want to take

105
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,559
and that's what really
propelled me to take the meeting

106
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:14,318
and really the excitement
I went into that meeting.

107
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:15,659
- Gary, my man.

108
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,492
- Real pleasure.

109
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:17,325
- Pleasure man.

110
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:18,548
- I'm gonna drop off my bags
and be out in one second.

111
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,716
Honestly, of course, but
you go with who you go with.

112
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:24,750
- Yeah.

113
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,799
- People sitting on the
couch right now over thinking

114
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,558
who their perfect partner is,

115
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:32,389
like get somebody who's
right and fucking go.

116
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,129
- And be prepared to make
up for the shortcomings

117
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:36,388
if they're there.

118
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:37,918
- 100,000%.

119
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:39,808
- Ultimately, it's up to you, right?

120
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:41,529
- [Narrator] Wait, what?

121
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:42,716
What the hell?

122
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,027
Gary, what is that there for?

123
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:47,825
- Whether something fails or
not, it's ultimately up to you.

124
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:50,460
- I like people that have
been around a thing for while

125
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,379
and are coming at it
patient, the right way,

126
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:57,049
and we'll get to know each other better.

127
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:57,987
You travel a lot?

128
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,346
- I do man.

129
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,537
- You have a family?

130
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:01,547
- I do.

131
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:04,265
Judith, my wife, and
Olivia, seven years old.

132
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:05,689
And, then five dogs.

133
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,188
- Five?

134
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:09,675
Five, my favorite number.

135
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,300
By the way, real quick,
while I've got you, Youtube.

136
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,629
The reason I do this in pictures

137
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,327
is five's my favorite number.

138
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,660
- I didn't mind sacrificing,

139
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,141
not receiving a ton of
cash during those years

140
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:21,070
because I knew that in the end ...

141
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,903
- You were building something.

142
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:22,736
You were patient.

143
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:23,569
Patience.

144
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,081
So, when did the eye come into your world.

145
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,192
- About a year ago.

146
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,542
- About a year ago, what happened?

147
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,591
- I was watching Casey and Ice Vlog.

148
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:33,071
Because I started vlogging and the reason

149
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,581
that I started vlogging
was because, two things;

150
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:38,400
I wanted to inspire my players by acting.

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,100
I couldn't bring myself to say ...

152
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,320
- You've got to do this
if you aren't doing it.

153
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
- Because their excuse was
always like, I'm competing,

154
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,153
I am professional.

155
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:47,520
- I'm busy.

156
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,338
- And I was like, well,
it doesn't take that long

157
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:51,419
to connect with your fans
and maybe build a brand

158
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,300
that lasts.

159
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,308
- That's been the most fun for me.

160
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:58,390
Nobody's outworking me and I'm doing it.

161
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,700
Now, I've got D Rock.

162
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,092
You're really doing it.

163
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:02,430
I'm respect that.

164
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,000
But, even like today, I don't know D Rock,

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,121
have I sneezed 7,000 times already today?

166
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:08,249
I know we haven't been filming a lot,

167
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,938
but the way I'm feeling,
head cold right now,

168
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,680
99% of people are laying
in bed, out tomorrow.

169
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,522
- Yeah.

170
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:17,602
- You're either going to
will yourself to victory

171
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:18,435
or you're not.

172
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:20,092
- You know what is beautiful about that is

173
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:22,251
that when I used to work at AIG ...

174
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,117
- [Gary] You'd be home.

175
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:26,390
- I would dread getting up
at 8:30 to be at work at 9,

176
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,640
because I was that close.

177
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,682
Now, I wake up with my eyes open.

178
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,829
- Dude, if I felt like
the way I feel right now,

179
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,680
I'd be out of school the rest of the week.

180
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,513
Dead.

181
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,672
You know, because my brain
would let myself go to

182
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:43,101
that real fever place.

183
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,121
Right now, I'll fight it.

184
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:47,060
And, I'll do everything
like water and wash hands.

185
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,031
I'll do everything right, I'll fight.

186
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,569
And, I had to wake up
at 4:30 this morning,

187
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:51,888
are you kidding?

188
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:52,770
When you love it.

189
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,980
Anyway, so you're watching Casey ...

190
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,001
- Can I get a selfie with you?

191
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,239
- Yeah sure.

192
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,072
- Sorry man.

193
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:57,905
- It's alright man.

194
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,741
- [Fan] You're shooting right
now and I'm interrupting.

195
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:00,809
- No worries.

196
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:01,719
- I'm so sorry.

197
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:02,552
- That's alright.

198
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:03,921
- Let me tell you
something man, this year,

199
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,910
I went from, in real estate,
I went from last year

200
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,238
selling like 15 properties to 57 this year

201
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:12,368
and I watch you almost every day.

202
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,201
- Thank you brother.

203
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:14,034
- So thank you so much.

204
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:14,867
- You're welcome brother.

205
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,450
- Let me get a selfie with you.

206
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,413
- Nice to meet you, what's your name?

207
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:21,246
- Theo.

208
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:23,310
- Theo, nice to meet you
man, a real pleasure.

209
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,239
Like your sweater man,

210
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,489
and your beard.

211
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,541
Dude, listen, eSports is
a beast, it's a monster.

212
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,458
It hasn't even started.

213
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,189
Everybody in this place
right now, if you're like

214
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,372
eSports, eSports, like yeah, some people,

215
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:38,998
other people are like, what?

216
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:39,831
- Yeah.

217
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:42,240
- There's not a soul in
this hotel in a decade

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,073
that is like what.

219
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:43,906
- What is that?

220
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:44,739
- And, by the way, I lived it.

221
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:45,648
It was called social media.

222
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:46,860
- Yeah.

223
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,290
Isn't that the craziest thing.

224
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,282
- I started making videos on
Youtube in February of 2006.

225
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:52,365
- Yeah. Geez.

226
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,672
I think I uploaded graffiti video in 2006.

227
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,338
- You know what I mean?

228
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:02,621
- Bro, when you asked, I don't
want to get too detailed,

229
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:06,362
but I was taking a shower
and I was listening to you

230
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,409
on my JBL and I was like
who here remembers the world

231
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:09,242
before the internet?

232
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:11,630
- You're like on the shampoo.

233
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,463
- I lived it.

234
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:15,482
- Yeah man, that's why
we know how big it is.

235
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,732
- When is yours gonna ... ?

236
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,622
- Mine's gonna air in two days, right?

237
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:22,810
Two, three days?

238
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,443
- More than likely I'm gonna
steal a couple of key points.

239
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:27,694
- You take whatever you want.

240
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:28,527
- Alright, cool.

241
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:29,360
- It's all yours.

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,193
- Alright, appreciate it.

243
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,695
- Free of charge, so far.

244
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:33,961
You've got to work harder.

245
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,282
You better work smarter.

246
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,845
You better try things.

247
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:39,173
You better keep your
subjectiveness and your ego

248
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,522
at the door, because that slows you down

249
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,483
and it doesn't make you do.

250
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,606
I changed that thumbnail, I won.

251
00:08:45,606 --> 00:00:00,000
Calvin I told you.
