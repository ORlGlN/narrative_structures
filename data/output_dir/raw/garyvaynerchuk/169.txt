1
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:01,478
- Oh my God!

2
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:02,809
- Yeah.

3
00:00:02,809 --> 00:00:04,081
- They, I mean...

4
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:07,498
("In Numbers" by Jaleel)

5
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:17,180
- Congrats, you're in fucking debt.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,180
(laughing)

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,580
You need to be more Better
Homes and Garden, and less QVC.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,413
Got it?

9
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:24,246
- Thank you so much, Gary.

10
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:25,334
- You're welcome, you're
welcome, take care.

11
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,277
- [Passerby] Gary, love your mic show.

12
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,900
- Thank you so much,
man, I appreciate that.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,858
How are you?

14
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:30,911
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, man.

15
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,642
- I have been following you for so long.

16
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:33,758
- Thank you, man.

17
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,224
- Since I was like 15 years old.

18
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:36,057
- Awesome.

19
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:37,342
- I appreciate it, thank you so much.

20
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:40,618
- My pleasure, man, enjoy your day.

21
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:43,618
Eight, six, seven, five, three oh...

22
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,295
My hotel room in 20 minutes.

23
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:52,252
Email Stephland and Tyler
and push it 15 minutes,

24
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,787
so we'll do it at 11:15.

25
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:54,811
I hope you guys, uh...

26
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,418
First of all, about to
go work out with Jordan

27
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:58,750
who's been building my muscles.

28
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,905
I'm gonna show you behind
the scenes interactions

29
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:04,684
on email, text, DM's, in daily vees

30
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:06,841
'cause I think it can show some color.

31
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,735
I keep saying 'watch what
I do, not what I say',

32
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:11,256
this is one of the ways that I can

33
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:14,589
extend the way that I help you watch me.

34
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,575
That little chat that DRock and I had is,

35
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:34,982
is the start of it.

36
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:37,685
♫ With gold stains on my shirt

37
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:41,970
♫ Gaze my eyes down on my fate

38
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,905
Great day here in Boise,
Idaho, about to give a speech,

39
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,376
super pumped about live library tomorrow,

40
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:51,063
just had two great client
calls at Vayner Media.

41
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:52,752
Life's fucking good.

42
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:54,986
Just now, that little phone thing.

43
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:56,873
That was the best fucking
shit you've ever done.

44
00:01:56,873 --> 00:01:58,234
How many peeps?

45
00:01:58,234 --> 00:01:59,777
- Uh, we've got about 400.

46
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,906
- Juliusdein, nice to meet
you, hey, how you doing?

47
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:02,890
- Hey, it's a real pleasure.

48
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,723
- Yeah, you too, man.
- Just who I was looking for.

49
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,157
- Sit down here, I'll take
you up in just a second.

50
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:06,562
- What's up, man, how are you?

51
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:07,750
- [Camera Man] Nice to meet you, man.

52
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,708
- Touch a card.

53
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,374
- Take it out, do not let me see.

54
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:11,207
- Okay.

55
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,588
- Show everyone the eight of spades.

56
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,164
- Wow.

57
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:15,761
- All the cards are different, by the way,

58
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,037
just so the camera sees that.

59
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:17,995
Alright, this is what we're gonna do.

60
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:19,011
So, Gary, you're a business
guy, obviously very smart,

61
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:21,558
into the hustle, into
paying attention, being fit.

62
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,944
- The smartest, yes.

63
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:23,962
- Yeah, you're the smartest.

64
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:25,681
So, here we go, watch,
do me a favor, alright?

65
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:26,925
Do not take you're eyes off that eight.

66
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:27,758
- Yes.

67
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:29,569
- Alright, here, push it in
for me, push it in, yeah?

68
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,339
Do not take your eyes
off that eight, okay?

69
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,612
Pay attention, alright?

70
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:33,570
I know you're all about paying attention.

71
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,167
- I can't even, like, I
saw it from the corner,

72
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,489
I'm like how that happens is ridiculous.

73
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:38,952
You guys that really know how to do it.

74
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:39,785
- Yeah.

75
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,034
- It's some different shit, bro.

76
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:41,908
- Yeah.

77
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,960
Just touch a card,
doesn't, yeah, that one.

78
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,771
Okay, just doesn't
matter, we can all see it.

79
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:47,338
It's not one of those types of tricks.

80
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:48,834
Alright, so jack of clubs,
this is what we're gonna do.

81
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,594
I want you to just hold
your hands out for me.

82
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:52,144
Alright, this is what we're gonna do.

83
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:54,213
I'm gonna take the
jack, you guys see that?

84
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:56,250
Okay, I'm gonna put that jack
into your hand like this.

85
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,108
Okay, put your hand on top,
and this is what I'm gonna do.

86
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,732
I'm gonna take the, I'm gonna
take the seven of hearts.

87
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,166
Alright, squeeze onto the
jack, watch the seven.

88
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,331
You guys all see that?

89
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,602
I'm gonna take the seven,
like this, here we go.

90
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:08,328
- I'm holding it so fucking hard.

91
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:10,131
- Hold on, let me just, uh...

92
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:12,516
(blowing out) Bam, now I've got the jack.

93
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:14,392
- I just can't, I can't.

94
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,794
- [Man] That's so crazy.

95
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:16,884
That is so great.

96
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:18,561
- Yeah, I know, I mean...

97
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:19,788
You have to understand,

98
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm like holding it with my whole life.

99
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,061
My whole fucking life, I'm
holding it with my whole life.

100
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:25,061
- [Man] I mean, your hand, you were...

101
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,141
Oh, that was crazy.

102
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:26,974
- My man.

103
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,809
To the YouTube hustlers
that just watched that,

104
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,885
when did you realize social and content

105
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:34,163
was really changing your world?

106
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:35,103
What was like...

107
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:35,936
- At university.

108
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:38,295
I'm 23, at 21, that's when
I started making content,

109
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:39,443
I did it relentlessly.

110
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:40,276
- Where?

111
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:41,234
- Uh, I was in London.

112
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,408
- No, on what platform first?

113
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:44,632
- I started on YouTube,
didn't find much success,

114
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:46,201
went to Facebook, and on Facebook I found

115
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,830
pages that could share my videos.

116
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,128
- And you were hitting
them up, messaging them?

117
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,438
- Yeah, I hit up hundreds,

118
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,563
and then I got one main
page that hit me up,

119
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:54,399
that shared me, my page went from

120
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,989
like 100 likes to 7000 likes overnight.

121
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,503
- And that was it.
- Bam.

122
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,189
- The most important part,

123
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,188
he was bisdeving and hitting
up 100 people and saying

124
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:04,214
look at where to look
at, look what I'm doing,

125
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:05,684
finally somebody said yes...

126
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:06,763
- Yeah.

127
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:07,937
- And that's it.
- That's it.

128
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:10,445
- It's not serendipity,
you went out and took it.

129
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:11,857
- Yeah, and that give me the motivation.

130
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:13,741
Five months later, got
my first viral video,

131
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,644
that took me from about
10,000 to half a million

132
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:18,142
likes overnight, and then,
you know, all the way up now.

133
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:20,503
Now I just hit 12 million
followers yesterday, so sometimes.

134
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:21,928
- It's really amazing, man, congrats.

135
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,330
- Good seeing you.

136
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,429
- Alright, let's do this, yeah, let's go.

137
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:26,679
(applause)

138
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,650
Thank you.

139
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,507
DRock, are you filming this?

140
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,597
Where do you live?

141
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:35,684
Well, first of all...

142
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:37,354
- I live here, and there's a
spot right down the street...

143
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:40,010
- Listen, listen, listen, listen,

144
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,938
that's gonna happen now, I think.

145
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:46,375
It's so crazy, you're funny,
you're smart, you know me.

146
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,914
You know that now I'm getting,
like, now I'm blacked out

147
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,731
and want do destroy your face.

148
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:54,184
Let me do something, for real,
based on what you just said.

149
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:56,127
I want you to come to
Vayner Media for a day,

150
00:04:56,127 --> 00:05:00,082
I'll pay for your flight
and the hotel, and during...

151
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,986
And, and during that day,

152
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:06,548
we'll play bubble hockey
and we'll see what's up.

153
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:08,798
(applause)

154
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:12,335
Alright, DRock, let's interview you.

155
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,998
- [DRock] Nope, let's not.

156
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:15,957
- Yeah, it's, I gotta figure it out.

157
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:17,570
Take your bag off, this
is how we're doing it.

158
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,015
You told me to be more vloggy, here we go.

159
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:21,290
- You're doing a really
good job, you were tight.

160
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,509
- It was really good today, right?

161
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,101
Yeah, by the way, I'll
only be interviewing DRock

162
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,556
after I feel like it was good.

163
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:28,749
It was a good one, guys,

164
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:32,355
we might have to put this
whole keynote on YouTube,

165
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:34,571
which I'm now trying to
do, actually, these days.

166
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,407
Facebook is where I'm
most of the keynotes.

167
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,557
Or are we doing the Gary
Vayner trip channel thing?

168
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:39,733
- [DRock] Yeah, Gary Vayner trip.

169
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,204
- Okay, so we'll be doing
some stuff, it's coming soon.

170
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:44,581
Alright guys, I'm gonna
give my official prediction

171
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:47,439
to Jack M's each week on Snapchat,

172
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,194
this is the official official, like,

173
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:51,269

174
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,152
Oh my god.
- Yeah.

175
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,961
- I mean, you've gotta,

176
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,447
that's gotta be a core
of this whole episode,

177
00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:59,094
there's nothing more ridiculous that that.

178
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:02,830
Literally, like this wonderful,
kind moment at the airport.

180
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,391
That is unbelievably awesome.

181
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:17,781
- You've told me that you
sort of do that at games.

182
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:19,431
Like, you like, attack the individual.

183
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,776
- You got to see it in real life, yeah.

184
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,259
- Yeah, I was like 'oh my
god, he's actually, he doesn't

185
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,059
give a shit, he's gonna go right
in for the kill right now.'

186
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:30,534
- No no, no no, Josh,
you're confused, my friend,

187
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:33,564
I'm a winner, you root for winners, dick.

188

189
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:38,628
Be careful.

(laughing)

191
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:43,038
- [Man] They love you, you're the best.

192
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,688
- But seriously, I
appreciate you, thank you.

193
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,938
(laughing)

194
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:51,821
- First, let me give you
your power, that's yours.

195
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,202
Thank you very much.

196
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,646
How are you, I'm Gary.

197
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:56,800
- Gary, Al says to tell you hello.

198
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,123
- Hi, my pleasure.

199
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:02,065

203

- Should I put it out there that if I,

204
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,155
if the Jets lose every
game, I'll shave my head?

205
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:16,806
Phil, should I shave my head
if the Jets lose every game?

206
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,076
That's what I should do.
- A million percent.

207
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,587
- Yeah, that's what I should do.

208
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:20,630
- Yeah, a million percent.
- Alright.
