00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk about something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,430
not super complicated it's not going to

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,500
be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long video but I set an</font>

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,090
interview today and really hit everybody

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,580
on the call pretty hard and I think it's

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,429
pretty important to understand the

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">statement was I said that social media</font>

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,760
to me is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> stake and to most people in</font>

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,619
the business world today 99% of them

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,550
it's pepper and I guess what i mean by

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,050
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,910
whole movement whether you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,430
it social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> because oh by the way it</font>

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,660
was called web two point oh three

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,510
minutes ago you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't care what</font>

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call it but not understanding that</font>

18
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is now a platform that is superior</font>

19
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,860
and dramatically more powerful than the

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,760
television or print or radio it is a

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,550
massive mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reason I've been</font>

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,350
successful in it at some level whether

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,510
you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not or you think that</font>

24
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,250
depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things the</font>

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,329
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I've been able to build</font>

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,039
brand equity and build businesses on

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,469
this platform is that I truly believe

28
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,149
the social web the one that requires

29
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,610
interaction the one that requires people

30
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that have some status like myself to not</font>

31
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,630
think of themselves as big but

32
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,510
actually care is very important and I

33
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,280
think that the reason I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to</font>

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> results and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make things happen is</font>

35
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,330
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all of this as the</font>

36
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">stake the main meal and not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nuance</font>

37
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,159
like pepper this isn't sprinkling this

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,840
needs to be agenda this isn't something

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,640
you carve out of your small budget and

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,220
give ten thousand dollars to to play

41
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,009
this is the game this is the stake not

42
00:01:32,009 --> 00:00:00,000
the pepper
