a tough time selling their advertising

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,009

different places you know considering

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,430
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help or who might help but</font>

a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the percentage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do your own</font>

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,039
their competitive edge um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see</font>

31
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,809
how that's being a hypocrite going on

32
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,580
building my brand using that I'll use

33
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,920
anything I'll go fly in a kite that

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,290
being said after<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tish said that and by</font>

35
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I highly respect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tisha's point</font>

36
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,130
of view because that's what's up I

37
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,530
respect it and then Derek followed up

38
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tisha's responds by saying at terrier I</font>

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,650
have never understood<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gary Vaynerchuk</font>

other than having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big mouth I've never</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">found much value what he says so a</font>

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,890
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> good lessons one always search</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name maybe there's different ways</font>

44
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,860
people spell your name not every name is

45
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,090
as difficult as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vaynerchuk and number</font>

46
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,150
two um a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people email me and say</font>

47
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,710
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the charisma I have</font>

48
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,990
they're not extroverted they're not this

49
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,460
they're not that well guess what you are

50
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,560
what you are introverted quiet may be

51
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,780
poised probably a lot more polished we

52
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,360
all have our different styles own yours

53
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,880
because look just because I'm over top

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,409
and exciting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you love that well</font>

55
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,360
clearly Derek<font color="#CCCCCC"> alert thinks that I'm a</font>

56
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,030
jerk probably or two over top or have no

57
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,640
substance behind me being so excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

58
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,009
I respect that though I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Derek is</font>

59
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,930
wrong because you know I've proven a

60
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,490
couple chops here and there but I've got

61
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,780
a lot more to prove and I respect that

62
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,470
two things definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> one always search</font>

63
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,700
what's going on about yourself because

64
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,160
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a pulse of what p</font>

65
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,540
think I think you shouldn't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

66
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,460
anybody thinks and you should care what

67
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,920
everybody thinks think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

68
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,160
number two um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

69
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,460
important to always always always

70
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,890
interact respect of other people's

71
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">feelings and counter them just like I'm</font>

72
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,910
doing now on Gary Vaynerchuk<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm I'm</font>

73
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,620
countering because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tish is wrong</font>

74
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,850
I don't think being a hypocrite when I

75
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,860
see something is out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to</font>

76
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,970
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that are in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

77
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,410
industry get out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start building</font>

78
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,700
their personal brand so when they get

79
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,930
fired by the newspaper when they lose

80
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,550
their inventory and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're</font>

81
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,230
advertising dollars that they actually

82
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">have something to do and build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you</font>

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,480
that's helping me build my brand that's

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,820
what I do and number two Derek jumps in

86
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,040
there and I respect that and I think

87
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,300
it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of people that</font>

88
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,710
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're introverts and don't</font>

89
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,210
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much charisma or whatever the</font>

90
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,770
heck they think that they should know

91
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,700
that there's plenty people that are

92
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna respect and appreciate their style</font>

93
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,630
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more than my style but I think</font>

94
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really do is get out</font>

95
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,780
there have a pulse of what the market

96
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,210
saying do what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe in talk about</font>

97
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,430
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in crush your content</font>

98
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,410
own you and but own you unabashedly just

99
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,570
owned you but respect others and I

100
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,840
respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> pish and Derek and I'll link up</font>

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,640
