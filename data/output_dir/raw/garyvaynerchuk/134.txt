1
00:00:00,224 --> 00:00:02,766
♫ Ooh, we're unstopable

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:05,683
♫ We're unstopable

3
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:11,169
(sleek electronic music)

4
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:21,017
- What's going to happen with retail

5
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:23,368
over the next seven to ten years

6
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:28,011
is going to be so massively
disruptive that I wonder,

7
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,527
you want to talk about catching,

8
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:33,860
you want to talk about catching a trend.

9
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:38,873
It's the conversation
of the next 20 years.

10
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,224
I mean, the Lord &
Taylor's, the Toys'R'Us,

11
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:43,648
these are the previews,
these are not anomalies.

12
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,275
These are previews.

13
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:46,963
I mean, J.C. Penny and Sears have

14
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,963
zero chance of being
alive, this is not a, zero.

15
00:00:52,497 --> 00:00:53,943
- And this is where they jump off.

16
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:56,753
They think this is a story
of internet verus stores.

17
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:57,586
- Correct.

18
00:00:57,586 --> 00:00:58,419
- No.

19
00:00:58,419 --> 00:00:59,252
- It's not.

20
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:00,264
- Okay, it's much deeper than that.

21
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:01,097
- No.

22
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:02,179
You start getting into Lord
& Taylor's, and Macy's,

23
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:04,223
and Bloomingdale's, they've
got double pressure.

24
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:05,589
They've got the internet
issue, they've got

25
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:07,577
brands going direct to
consumer, and more importantly,

26
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:11,131
the brands, their vendors
are clearly our competitor,

27
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,421
but their a double edge sword.

28
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,964
I think Ralph Lauren is going to be

29
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:16,295
out of business in 15 years.

30
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:18,755
Like, these brands are not
marketing in Instagram,

31
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:20,964
they still think it's
print and other bullshit.

32
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:21,797
- (mumbles)

33
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:24,331
- And Uniqlo, it's, it's, by the way,

34
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,612
being in Singapore right after

35
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:28,820
the Uniqlo meeting and
seeing Uniqlo everywhere.

36
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,877
- That, see, is almost two dimensional.

37
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:34,002
You have the stores that are
like the Sak's of the world

38
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:36,064
that you ask, what's
their reason for being?

39
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:36,897
- That's right.

40
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,215
- And how do they reinvent themselves.

41
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:40,653
And you have a brick and
mortar versus internet,

42
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:43,255
versus you know, how do you
provide value to the customer?

43
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:44,838
Then you have the brands.

44
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,944
The brands actually can survive.

45
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:49,403
You know, some of them
are doing really well.

46
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:50,236
- 100%

47
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:51,100
- You know, the question there

48
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,936
- They have the most up side.

49
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,390
- Yeah, they can do very well, if in fact,

50
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,718
they learn how to market
to this new consumer.

51
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:56,683
- Right, the problem is.

52
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,587
- The old brands have a hard time.

53
00:01:58,587 --> 00:02:00,729
- Yeah, I mean, the problem is, you know,

54
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,828
whether you're old or new,
it's just your behavior, right?

55
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:03,661
- Yeah.

56
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:04,494
- I always tell people, I'm like, look,

57
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:06,845
there's 68 year old executives who are

58
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,418
a hell of a lot more in
tune to what's going on

59
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:10,328
that 26 year olds that I know.

60
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:13,724
Like, it's unbelievable how, this is

61
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,063
a game right now of have and have nots.

62
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,189
- Oh, I call it the winners and losers.

63
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,022
- That's it.

64
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,080
- Same thing.

65
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,128
Spotify.

66
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:21,227
- I'm a big believer.

67
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:22,586
Spotify I love.

68
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:23,419
You know when you

69
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,274
- My kids, see, people have to talk

70
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:28,251
to is the next gen people
because my son (mumbles).

71
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,939
- Yeah, you're too old, we need to find.

72
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,955
- Yeah, but that's when, you
have to keep trending up.

73
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:33,244
- No, can I tell you why Spotify, though?

74
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:34,910
It's actually not because kids listen

75
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,263
to it, or anything of that nature.

76
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:38,416
There's not a lot of
companies on earth that have

77
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,104
that many credit cards
getting recurring revenue

78
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:43,488
each month, their ability to add OTT.

79
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:47,350
Spotify tomorrow starts doing videos on,

80
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,547
if Spotify tomorrow did Behind the Music,

81
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:53,062
and did one hour documentaries of every

82
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:55,823
emerging artist, they would get an extra

83
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,079
ten dollars a month from
everybody as an OTT.

84
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,236
- Why don't you talk to them,
have you talked to them?

85
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,115
- I have some real ideas for them.

86
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:04,198
(upbeat piano music)

87
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:07,469
- Let's go.

88
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,273
I think there's an over-estimation,

89
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:18,793
an over-focus on hustle,
work your face off,

90
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:22,276
which I'm very proud of
and very passionate about,

91
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:25,561
but I don't think there's as much focus on

92
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:26,927
you know, empathy, and gratitude, and

93
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:30,120
give more than you take, and perspective

94
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,181
which is stop focusing on dumb shit.

95
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:35,848
So, I was a little
strategic on the sneaker.

96
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:46,355
Minnesota, middle America, you know,

97
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,357
I have a funny idea.

98
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:53,875
I want my book event in Minnesota
during Super Bowl weekend,

99
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,220
to be the biggest event attended.

100
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,869
Because that's just funny and ridiculous.

101
00:03:57,869 --> 00:04:00,692
So, we will be doing
that, so be prepared for

102
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:03,692
Saturday, February 3rd in Minnesota,

103
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:07,129
a ridiculous book launch.

104
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,906
If you're in the Minnesota area, if you're

105
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:11,744
flying into Minnesota, if
you want to be a part of

106
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:14,810
amassing thousands of
people into one place

107
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,423
so that everybody's like,
what football legend is there?

108
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,163
No, this is Gary V.'s book party.

109
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:22,413
I want to upend and disrupt Super Bowl.

110
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:26,317
So, let's do that.

111
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:32,412
Fill out the form if you
want to be part of the crew

112
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:34,431
to help, not because you just want to help

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,899
because you're going to be in Minnesota

114
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,743
and you can drive people to the event.

115
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,016
Or I've got some idea how.

116
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,136
Hey, Alex.

117
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:40,969
How are you?

118
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,505
- How soon is (mumbles)?

119
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,689
- Vayner nation, Alex is here.

120
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,939
(laughing)

121
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:56,379
It's over ambition and
substantial humility,

122
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,858
and so I've been able to
articulate, at least for me,

123
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,989
in a comfortable manner
in, like, clouds and dirts.

124
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:03,748
Like, have big goals, like, go for it.

125
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:07,444
Be smart, really be thoughtful,
but always be humble

126
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:10,151
and execute and stay in the trenches.

127
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,069
Always be a practitioner in your craft.

128
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:15,661
Those things matter to me.

129
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:18,570
What matters at the end
of the day is if you agree

130
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,511
with me binarily, that
it's happening here,

131
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:24,729
now the question becomes, what
are you going to do about it?

132
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,494
First thing you need to
do is, everybody in here

133
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,760
needs to take a step back and get

134
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,121
really self aware really quickly.

135
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,601
Because self awareness and empathy are the

136
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:35,188
two pillars that will make you successful.

137
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:37,788
These are two things I do that nobody sees

138
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:40,026
because of my persona, because of other

139
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:43,436
alpha characteristics I
have, they're the disguised

140
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:45,802
superpowers that have
gotten me here today.

141
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:47,659
But the reality is, a long time ago,

142
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,323
through amazing parenting and the

143
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:51,792
serendipity of being an
immigrant at the right time,

144
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,760
I got real self aware
real fast, and started

145
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,027
triple-downing on what
I was, verus pandering

146
00:05:57,027 --> 00:05:58,293
to everybody else.

147
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:00,545
And so, the security and confidence

148
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:02,404
and all the other things
that were put into me

149
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,912
allowed me to be good at this
game for the last ten years.

150
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:07,680
And the reason I'm stressing such a E Q,

151
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,333
kind of fluffy thing to
you, it is the framework

152
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,819
that will allow you to be successful.

153
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,717
It is strategy.

154
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,031
Either you have the right strategy,

155
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,150
or you have the wrong one.

156
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,175
Too many kids under 30
want to get there so fast,

157
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,458
and it breaks them because they short cut,

158
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,775
and they create the vulnerabilities that

159
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,248
don't allow them to get there.

160
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:26,194
So, when I just looked my
18 year old self in the face

161
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,974
and said, your intuitions are right.

162
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:32,415
Do this, do that, exactly
right, you'll be real happy.

163
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:33,248
You got it.

164
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:34,081
Thank you, guys.

165
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,631
(audience applauding)

166
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:39,214
(mellow music)

167
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:54,604
- Okay, bye bye, alright, bye bye.

168
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:55,437
Hey, bro.

169
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:56,552
- Sorry to bug you, man, how are you?

170
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:57,385
- No worries, how are you?

171
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:58,218
- I'm well.

172
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,088
I just moved here from
Indiana on Thursday.

173
00:06:59,088 --> 00:06:59,921
- Congrats.

174
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:00,754
- Thank you.

175
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,808
I was hoping to maybe
get some time from you,

176
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:03,953
whenever you've got some free time,

177
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:04,877
sit down and B.S. with you.

178
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,421
- Okay, well, you do me a favor.

179
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,681
Send me an email right now.

180
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:08,514
- Okay.

181
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,113
- In the title, put I'm
the guy from Indiana.

182
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:10,946
- Okay.

183
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:11,779
- Tell me what's on your mind.

184
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:12,612
- Okay.

185
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:13,492
- And then I'll try to
get you a date in January,

186
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:15,117
when I actually have openings.

187
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:15,950
- Man, that's awesome.

188
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,783
- Awesome, man.

189
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:17,660
- Really appreciate you,
really, thank you very much.

190
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,493
- Good luck to you, brother, take care.

191
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:20,505
Brand wins every time.

192
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:23,047
And they're kissing cousins,
like, all the skills

193
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,137
that make somebody great
at something that we would

194
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,465
all argue is on the other
side of their tracks,

195
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:28,298
it's the same shit.

196
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:29,885
That's why I love talking to kids in,

197
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,999
like, urban, underprivileged demos.

198
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,007
I'm like, dude, the
same way you sell weed,

199
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,519
is the same way you can build
a 100 million dollar company.

200
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,092
It's the same fucking game.

201
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,996
The same way my friend sold
fucking CD's from the back of,

202
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:44,427
it's the same game, it's just (clicks).

203
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:46,128
The framework, right?

204
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:49,610
And the same way, whether it's courses or

205
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,786
offers or whatever it is, it's (clicks).

206
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:52,619
And it's patience.

207
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,346
And really, you guys have the advantage

208
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:56,078
because you can wait a little bit longer

209
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:58,138
because you've got something in place.

210
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:02,305
So, there's a very intriguing
time to make that jump.

211
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,556
Hire every discipline.

212
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:09,740
Tomorrow, have written content every day,

213
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,256
audio content, your podcast will kill.

214
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:13,423
- [Business Woman] Yeah.

215
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:14,721
- And again, remember?

216
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:16,238
Watch what I'm doing, not what I'm saying.

217
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:18,641
Clearly, it's like you
said, a lots taken from me.

218
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:21,578
Why did I care about my
podcast and rebranded the

219
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:24,261
audio experience, like,
why did that happen.

220
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,625
Not for my health.

221
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,317
It's because I believed in the medium.

222
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,352
And since I rebranded,
now I'm a top hundred

223
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:32,380
podcast without ever doing a podcast.

224
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,971
Don't hire for skill, or
don't train for skill.

225
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:38,433
Train for mindset.

226
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:41,134
Make sure when you start
adding people that, you know,

227
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,357
Iris, why am I hot on Iris?

228
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,786
To give her a compliment.

229
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:47,206
I think she's got skills,
but when I look at her

230
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:50,021
and watch her, she has
intuitive communication skills

231
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:52,379
which can be deployed against anything.

232
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:56,546
When you have the taste, you
can be the chef of any meal,

233
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,797
if you have the mindset
to be open to not saying

234
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:03,251
you not just a sous chef
of sushi, but you can also

235
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:08,227
be a classically trained French
chef as long as you're open.

236
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,438
So please, please, please,
first and, this is the most

237
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:14,438
important thing I can tell
you, as you start evolving,

238
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:19,431
it's about being open and
nimble and excited about change,

239
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:22,524
which is a very rare
commodity for an employee.

240
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:26,553
Because they were taught
garner a skill and trade on it.

241
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:28,928
If you're talking about
what I'm up to, which is

242
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:33,476
fucking all-time, it's in
those subtle fucking margins.

243
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:35,311
- On your point on that, too, like,

244
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,455
after all the presentations
you've had so far today,

245
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:42,287
I was going to go out and
hire for the five skill

246
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:45,034
team members that I need
in order to chop up and do

247
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,151
killer content and all that kind of stuff,

248
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:49,533
instead of, again this is
the value of the nuance

249
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,596
and the detail of talking
to people who've done it,

250
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:54,421
and played the game, and they go no.

251
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,524
Go and hire for the
attitude, for the kid who's

252
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:59,732
hungry enough to want to work for you

253
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,961
for free throughout the year, that's,

254
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,442
and they'll get the skill anyway.

255
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,108
- The skill is a commodity.

256
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,977
The mindset is everything.

257
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:09,560
(mellow music)

258
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:16,223
(laughing)

259
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:18,517
- Emily, appropriately,
realized that "see ya" and

260
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:22,100
"got it" is the same
exact thing, actually.

261
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:27,409
Of that, am I doing Nate and
Trout after this tonight?

262
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,203
Okay, can you put that in the schedule?

263
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,454
Holy shit, I flew back from
Singapore with that dude.

264
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:33,287
He's an architect.

265
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:34,262
He's just some random guy.

266
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:35,784
- [Emily] That's awesome.

267
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:37,450
- That was super weird.

268
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,700
(laughing)

269
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,303
(mellow music)

270
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,216
- Hi.

271
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:46,167
- Welcome to (mumbles)

272
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,000
- Thank you.

273
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,833
- Hi.

274
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,666
- How are you?

275
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,499
- Emily. Awesome.

276
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:50,992
- This is cool.

277
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:51,825
- Yeah.

278
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:57,062
(laughing)

279
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:58,062
- I love it.

280
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,541
Is failure important?

281
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:03,041
- On a bigger macro, patience and failure,

282
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:07,865
they all ladder up to one
thing, which is insecurity.

283
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:09,600
The reason people don't put
themselves in a position

284
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
to fail, the reason people aren't patient,

285
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,918
is they value other
people's opinions too much,

286
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:16,642
which then dictates their behavior,

287
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,755
which then gets into all of this.

288
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:21,412
Realize, is if you don't hold on to it

289
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,259
with the thought of in case it fails,

290
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:26,412
because you just need to realize
it's your scarlet letter.

291
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:28,617
Literally the reason people are scared,

292
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:31,034
always, is the outside force.

293
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,037
Having a failing business
and everyone's like, oh see,

294
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:37,809
you could never do, or whatever
the cliche shit is, right?

295
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:38,887
- [Interviewer] Yeah, yeah.

296
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:40,119
- It just doesn't fucking matter.

297
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,268
You know why?

298
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,677
So that's one piece.

299
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:45,032
- [Interviewer] But they
told me I couldn't do this.

300
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:47,386
- And even if it didn't succeed,

301
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:48,919
what, they're such better people?

302
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,456
Like what, I'm such a better person than

303
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:51,804
other people because I
can build a business?

304
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:53,504
That's bullshit.

305
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,443
- [Interviewer] But it's not listening

306
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:55,542
to other people (mumbles).

307
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:56,375
- That's it.

308
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,828
If you told me, it's too big to fail,

309
00:11:57,828 --> 00:11:58,926
I'm like, that makes sense.

310
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,996
But if you also told
me four years from now,

311
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:04,603
it doesn't play, I'm like
okay, Lyft, or Google,

312
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:07,166
or Apple, or (mumbles), like, I don't feel

313
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,131
like it's too big to fail.

314
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:10,967
First of all, I don't think
anybody's too big to fail.

315
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:15,134
The only company that I
could say I feel 100% is here

316
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,543
in ten years is Amazon and Facebook,

317
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,713
if Mark and Bezos are running it.

318
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:24,668
- [MC] Our amazing
speaker, Gary Vaynerchuk.

319
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:27,668
(audience applauds)

320
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:31,867
- Yo, yo.

321
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:34,561
Thanks for coming out.

322
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:35,978
Jesus, what's up?

323
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:38,893
Like those seats up there.

324
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:41,271
- What are some of the
things that do keep you going

325
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:43,384
and motivate you and pushes you?

326
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:46,134
- Gratitude, 100% gratitude.

327
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,468
The fact that I'm even a human being.

328
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,193
I don't want to be a rhinoceros.

329
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:52,741
(audience laughing)

330
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,774
Seriously, like, what do
you think's going on here?

331
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,662
No, I mean it, I take
shit in a super-macro.

332
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:58,374
Like, I'd much rather be me than

333
00:12:58,374 --> 00:12:59,924
this fucking ugly green carpet.

334
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,076
(laughing)

335
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:02,710
Kidding, I just wanted to
make a joke about the carpet.

336
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,760
(laughing)

337
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,867
I love green, I love green,
I make my shoes green.

338
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,955
Like, but you know what, you know,

339
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,412
like, what's the alternative?

340
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:12,855
Like, being blessed with
the, you know, I love this

341
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:14,686
400 trillion-to-one, I
know some of you know it.

342
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:17,708
Like, so you've been blessed
with a life, I get it.

343
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,879
You weren't born into a rich
family, you're the wrong

344
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,849
skin tone, you're this, you're, I get it.

345
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,266
But, fuck, we got the at bat.

346
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:30,687
You won the lotto, you won
it, you got the at bat.

347
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:31,668
Do something with it.

348
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,874
Especially now, your
grandparents didn't have this.

349
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:37,124
The internet is crazy shit, it just is.

350
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:39,238
It just is.

351
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,278
And so, why do you think
everybody's getting outed now?

352
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,457
Because three old white guys don't

353
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,390
control the media any more.

354
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,444
The fuck do you think is happening here?

355
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:51,417
This is the greatest
era ever, for anybody.

356
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:54,394
The market, the platform is the internet,

357
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:56,964
this is unbelievable, unprecedented times.

358
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:59,184
We will look back at this
two hundred years from now,

359
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:01,348
like, these fuckers
had a good opportunity.

360
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:03,954
This is buying, do you know
somebody bought the land

361
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:07,884
that we're on right now
for a dollar at one point?

362
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:10,012
That's what's happening
with us on the internet.

363
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:13,999
The attention of the end
consumer is cheap right now.

364
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,812
You can grab it around whatever the fuck

365
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,763
you want to be about, and it doesn't

366
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:21,269
cost you anything other than your time.

367
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,346
And so many of you are
complaining, but then are

368
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:26,922
too fancy to put in the
15 hours a day to get it.

369
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:29,535
I got no respect for that.

370
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,155
I got no respect for anybody who complains

371
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:34,104
and isn't putting in the work.

372
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:35,543
Because it's an excuse to not do.

373
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,871
(audience applauds)

374
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:39,787
And let me tell you, on
this issue, and I see some

375
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:43,357
of you get it, you can
trick 99% of the losers,

376
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:45,876
but you're not tricking the 1%.

377
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,999
So, the only people
listening to your bullshit

378
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,999
are the other losers in your circle.

379
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:53,219
It's truth.

380
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,552
Straight fucking facts to the face.

381
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:56,682
(audience applauds)

382
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:58,981
Only person listening
to your bullshit are the

383
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,345
people you surround yourself
that are losers too.

384
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:06,625
Don't complain, nobody's
listening, nobody that matters.

385
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,310
Your mom has to listen.

386
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,541
(audience laughing)

387
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,845
But let me give you an update, she thinks

388
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:11,728
you're a loser too.

389
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:14,346
(audience laughing)

390
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,828
I just want to try to buy the Jets

391
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:18,150
way more than buying the Jets.

392
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,201
Like, if I pull this shit
off, shits gonna get crazy.

393
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,250
(laughing)

394
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,501
Like, and it's cray because I
really feel like I'm going to.

395
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:29,520
Like, I laugh at how much I
actually think, forget about,

396
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,962
listen, to amass the wealth
to do it is ironically

397
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:38,014
funny to me, that's the part
that I'm most confident about.

398
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:42,142
I'm most confident that
I'll have the money.

399
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:45,526
It's, does that time well
when the Johnson family

400
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:48,636
wants to sell it, what
happens in culture, like,

401
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:51,619
forget about all, forget
about making the money.

402
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:54,022
The fact that I have the
audacity and the optimism that

403
00:15:54,022 --> 00:15:57,807
not only will I amass the
wealth, but that specific team.

404
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,541
Like, I don't want the
Bengals, you know, like?

405
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,678
(laughing)

406
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:05,115
So, it's so crazy how
it plays out in my head.

407
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:08,237
But here's the best part, and
you'll be there to see it,

408
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:12,482
if I don't, I'm having so
much fun and so much happiness

409
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:15,065
trying to get it, and
trying to pull all of you up

410
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:17,251
along the way while I'm trying to get it.

411
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,335
Fuck, if one of you get
it, I would love that

412
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:21,973
because then it would happen
on merit, you were good enough.

413
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,272
The thought that maybe the
next owner was built from

414
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:28,606
something I created would be
so batshit crazy, you know?

415
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:30,547
And I've also got a super
secret plan, and I'll

416
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,353
share it here today for the first time.

417
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:33,584
(audience laughing)

418
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:36,169
I figure if I can get every
single person in America

419
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,136
to really give a fuck
about me getting the Jets,

420
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:41,226
that when they become
available, if I'm not ready

421
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:43,201
financially, I'm going to crowd
source the fuck out of it.

422
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:46,146
(audience laughing)

423
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,143
- Being the Gary that you are today.

424
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:49,211
- [Gary] Okay.

425
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:51,282
- And you could face
yourself 25 years ago.

426
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:52,689
- [Gary] Talk to my 17 year old self.

427
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:55,032
- Yeah, if you could say
something to yourself

428
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,100
for only ten seconds, what would it be?

429
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
- You're gonna be right.

430
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:04,300
(audience applauds)

431
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,329
You know?

432
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,438
That's what I would say, man.

433
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,453
I did everything the way I want.

434
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:09,632
I'm so proud of how I did this.

435
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:13,714
And I haven't even started,
but like, I ate shit, like

436
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:17,350
I just don't, you know,
you just don't get it.

437
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:18,803
You will only get it if you know somebody

438
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:20,673
that knows me during that time.

439
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,641
You'll only know me if you
know somebody I went to

440
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,258
high school with and they'll tell you that

441
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:26,529
every weekend of my entire
fucking high school life,

442
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,754
all of them, I worked 13 hours a day.

443
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:30,281
That every fucking summer vacation day,

444
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,475
when everybody did shit and
went to the Jersey shore

445
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:35,433
and hooked up, I fucking worked.

446
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:38,175
You'll only know if you
actually saw my tax return

447
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:41,095
only ten years ago, because I
didn't make any fucking money

448
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,235
because I was building a
legacy, doing the right thing,

449
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:46,115
building, building skills, being patient.

450
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:49,065
I only give advice that I took.

451
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:51,467
I only eat my own dog food.

452
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:54,841
And so, I would tell him,
you're gonna do it right.

453
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,919
Thank you guys.

454
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,919
(audience applauds)

455
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:03,479
I just want to see how good I can be.

456
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,574
I don't know how else to say, man.

457
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:07,495
I've only known this game, you know?

458
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,725
I just want to see how good I can do.

459
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:12,702
I like building businesses, I like,

460
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:15,366
you know deploying my thoughts.

461
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,953
I feel like my intent is in a good place.

462
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:20,840
I feel good about myself,
I feel good about it.

463
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,423
And it's curiosity.

464
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:26,484
Like, I love working, I
love producing impact,

465
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:28,863
I love producing products,
I love challenging

466
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:31,381
myself to seeing how well I do understand

467
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,908
culture and attention and the game.

468
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:35,741
Like, it runs the gamete.

469
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,970
And I want to build the
infrastructure for all the

470
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,577
things that matter for me
in the next 40 years, right?

471
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:44,160
So, it's just playing the game.

472
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:48,693
Hey, thank you guys, thank you.

473
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:49,526
- Drive safe.

474
00:18:49,526 --> 00:00:00,000
- Thank you.
