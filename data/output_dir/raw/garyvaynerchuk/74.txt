1
00:00:00,393 --> 00:00:01,640
- What up, vlog?

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,706
I like the camera angle here at Budin.

3
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:06,849
This meeting I had with
an incredible couple

4
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:10,139
around their dog training
business is lights out.

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,301
Really valuable for a lot of you.

6
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,429
Sorry I'm losing my
voice here a little bit.

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,262
Check it.

8
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:16,274
Check it out.

9
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:17,580
And pass this one on.

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,965
Because this is really relevant

11
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:21,517
for ton of your entrepreneurial friends.

12
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:25,684
(upbeat music)

13
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:29,962
What's been the biggest change

14
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:33,300
from when you guys kind
of came across my stuff?

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,991
- [Kaelin] I would say for me, personally,

16
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:38,140
content.

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,981
I've been up until now

18
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,492
like selfish with the content.

19
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:47,245
Like I don't want to give
too much information out.

20
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:48,945
Because every single dog
that I've worked with,

21
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:49,918
I've seen results.

22
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:51,777
100%.
- That's incredible.

23
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:53,320
- So.

24
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,178
I haven't wanted to give out that content.

25
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:57,011
- [Gary] I see.

26
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:58,133
- And then after listening to you.

27
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,461
- [Gary] You thought
it was a secret sauce.

28
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:00,838
- Yes, exactly.

29
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:01,671
So, I'm like, if I'm going

30
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:03,387
to give this out for free.

31
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:04,220
Why would anyone hire me?

32
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,683
Why would anybody pay?

33
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,166
- But it works the reverse.
- Almost $200 an hour.

34
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,635
Total reverse.

35
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:12,263
After listening to you I'm
like he gives out everything.

36
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:13,952
And people still.

37
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:15,318
He's giving you everything you need.

38
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:17,218
People still want to work with you

39
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:18,303
with their unique business.

40
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:19,136
- [Gary] Sure.

41
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:20,125
Because there's always
- Stuff.

42
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,486
- [Gary] And as much as you learn,

43
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:23,049
there's always the nuances of the details.

44
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,959
- Exactly.

45
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,187
- Plus just the fact that
sometimes people just want

46
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:29,205
to pay back somebody
that's done right by them.

47
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:33,367
Like if we designed
$1000 website of logos,

48
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,843
you would much rather
hire Vayner media to do

49
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:39,236
that for you than somebody you
might have used in San Diego.

50
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:40,615
- For sure.
- It's how it works.

51
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,478
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

52
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,208
So that's been the biggest thing for me.

53
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,041
For sure.

54
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:49,158
I've seen from you after
listening to Gary is patience.

55
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,641
He had like zero patience.

56
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:53,360
So right before we
started listening to you,

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,922
I actually reached out
to Danielle Bernstein.

58
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:56,480
Do you know who that is?

59
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,768
She has the blog We Wore What,
was on Forbes 30 under 30,

60
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:02,149
because she was looking for a dog trainer.

61
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:03,875
- [Michael] She posted an Instastory.

62
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,319
- Yeah, so I reached out to her.

63
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,544
And she flew me out here.

64
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,953
Mainly because she's like

65
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:10,323
I interviewed all these
other dog trainers.

66
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:11,888
Nobody was normal.

67
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:14,069
So she's like this girl looks normal.

68
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,717
I'm going to fly her out.

69
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:17,908
So after working with her.

70
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:18,942
I would say.

71
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:22,117
So I took a week off, worked
with her, stayed with her,

72
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:24,380
helped her introduce
her puppy to other dog.

73
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,743
And just have that transition smoothly.

74
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,179
After that for

75
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:31,522
about a month and a half
the business declined.

76
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:33,587
Because I took a week off.

77
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,726
And this was right before
we started listening to you.

78
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:39,452
And so Michael of course,
was like, oh my gosh.

79
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,647
This wasn't worth it.
- [Gary] Makes sense.

80
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:42,884
- What the hell is happening?
- [Gary] I'm empathetic.

81
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:45,460
- I thought this was gonna be huge.

82
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,466
And then once he started to listen to you,

83
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,368
he's like patience, patience.

84
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:51,805
It's not about the present.

85
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,084
Don't be looking at the present.

86
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:56,640
When we stopped focusing
at every single day.

87
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,448
Oh my god we're not
selling like a package,

88
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:00,842
you know, this person didn't convert,

89
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:02,991
when we just looked at the bigger picture.

90
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:07,212
Like the content, just keep
doing, trust in the process.

91
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:10,108
- It's brand versus sales.

92
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,583
It's just so big.

93
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,974
It's so big.

94
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:15,216
It's, um, I'm just, you know--

95
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:16,567
People struggle.

96
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,274
And I'm empathic.

97
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:21,129
I'm competitive.

98
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,903
I didn't always have.

99
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,206
People are like oh it's
easy when you have it.

100
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,240
It's not that.

101
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,127
It's that it just doesn't make any sense

102
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,726
to look at your life in a six week period.

103
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:33,998
When your life is much
longer than six weeks.

104
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:37,054
To me the biggest disconnect is people's,

105
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:40,140
you know I always say your
ambition versus your actions.

106
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,252
If you wanna build something.

107
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:43,436
You guys aren't working
for Bank of America

108
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:46,813
or Vayner media, or, you know, McDonald's.

109
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,585
You're working for yourselves.

110
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:50,808
And when you wanna do that,

111
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:53,037
like it doesn't make
sense not to be patient.

112
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:54,603
You want something so big.

113
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:55,878
I don't think everybody understands

114
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,353
how big it is to be able
to live life on your own.

115
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:01,195
In your control and how you do it.

116
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:04,722
And so if you're asking the
universe for such a thing.

117
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,950
Of course, it should be worse and harder,

118
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,878
and longer and grindier and difficult.

119
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:10,989
Of course!

120
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,924
- [Kaelin & Michael] Yeah.
- Ya know?

121
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:15,162
That's the thing I need
to find a better way

122
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:15,995
to articulate.

123
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:20,162
Which is do you actually
understand what you're asking for?

124
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:25,693
Do you understand that you're
asking to live a top 1% life

125
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:28,193
in a 7.7 billion person world?

126
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,366
If you then wrap your head around

127
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,837
what you're actually aspiring to do.

128
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,606
Well, then all of a
sudden all the bull shit

129
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:38,397
that comes along with it makes
a hell of a lot more sense.

130
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:39,757
Everybody thinks they're entitled to it.

131
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:43,249
- [Michael] Just short term thinking.

132
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,082
- Yeah.

133
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:49,248
I lose on a daily basis everyday.

134
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:53,274
Everyday I'm losing.

135
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:55,541
On the daily basis, ya know?

136
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,208
But I think I'm winning
on the decade basis.

137
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,404
It's cool, makes me happy.

138
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,924
You been here all day?

139
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:05,757
Anything interesting?

140
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:07,483
Say hello to anybody
or they all been busy?

141
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,316
- [Kaelin] Everybody.

142
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:09,477
Every single person on your team.

143
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,107
- Good.
- [Kaelin] It's been amazing.

144
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:12,590
- It's been fun?
- [Kaelin] Yeah!

145
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,423
- Oh, so fun.

146
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,039
We've gotten a lot of good advice.

147
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,178
- And you've spent good,
obviously you came out here.

148
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:18,661
Do you guys spend time in New York?

149
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,931
- [Kaelin] Yeah, I train
some dogs in New York.

150
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:23,734
So there's a lot of people
that reach out to me.

151
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:26,001
Because of that one influencer out here

152
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:30,081
that's like you know, she
trains Danielle's dogs.

153
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,149
I need her.

154
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:34,327
And they wait every two
months for me to come out.

155
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,313
So I started coming out
here six months ago.

156
00:05:36,313 --> 00:05:38,372
So since then I've come
out every two months.

157
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,325
And there's always more
and more dogs to train.

158
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:43,103
- [Gary] That's cool.
- Yeah, so fun.

159
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:45,118
- So that's how you
monetize your business?

160
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:47,376
The training, is there
anything above and beyond that?

161
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:48,557
That's more scalable?

162
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,534
- The training's the
business, local in San Diego.

163
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:54,336
And then occasionally people in New York.

164
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:58,590
And then a personal brand,
she just wrote a book.

165
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,556
More like a business
card, just credibility.

166
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:02,746
- Expensive business card.

167
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:03,792
- [Gary] Of course.

168
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,325
You guys self published it?

169
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:06,158
- Yes.

170
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,347
- [Gary] That's why it's expensive.

171
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:08,480
- [Kaelin & Michael] Yeah.

172
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,213
- You just want to be
known as the best dog--

173
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:13,041
- [Kaelin] I started
this business a year ago.

174
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,058
A year and a half ago.

175
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:15,181
- Why?

176
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:17,849
Because you knew you had a knack?

177
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,782
- I always wanted to be a veterinarian.

178
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:20,812
- [Gary] Yeah.

179
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:23,613
- So I had an internship
at a vet hospital.

180
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:26,949
And with everything
medical, there's politics.

181
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,570
And so that just like
broke my heart to see.

182
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,148
- [Gary] You're like fuck.

183
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:32,159
- This is not want to do.

184
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,855
- [Gary] You're like nobody
cares about the animals.

185
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:34,963
- I was devastated.

186
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:36,721
Because ever since I was three years old

187
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:37,870
I wanted to be a vet.

188
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,047
- [Gary] It's the same
thing every teacher,

189
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,280
every politician,

190
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,080
everything that goes into
something bureaucratic.

191
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,316
- So it was never like I have

192
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:46,954
to be a professional dog trainer.

193
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:47,901
Nothing.

194
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,487
It was just something resorted back to

195
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:52,090
what am I passionate about.

196
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,059
Fostering dogs, being involved in rescues,

197
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:56,913
and connecting with dogs.

198
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,038
I just knew that I always

199
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,580
had this special connection with dogs.

200
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,190
And I can communicate to owners

201
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,667
this dog is doing this because of this.

202
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:09,401
So I was giving advice to a
friends among like rescues.

203
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:11,961
And soon I became the go
to trainer at rescues.

204
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:13,254
- It's so funny the way you described

205
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:14,875
that's the same way I feel about business.

206
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,111
I always know what the other pieces are

207
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:18,347
that create the thing.

208
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:19,946
Which is how you thought
it about it, right?

209
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:20,779
- [Kaelin] Exactly.

210
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,183
- Dog's peeing because
you're doing this on food,

211
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,651
or the relationship.
- [Kaelin] And I can see that.

212
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,793
- So interesting.
- [Kaelin] The owners can't.

213
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:26,692
- I get it.

214
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:29,931
- You see the pieces
of the business puzzle

215
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,090
that other people don't see.

216
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,614
- [Gary] 100%
- Yeah, totally.

217
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:37,132
So from that, just
everybody asking me advice.

218
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:39,174
I'm like I could make
a living off of this.

219
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:41,945
Giving my advice and
I just used everything

220
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,047
that I've learned.

221
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,454
- [Gary] So where are you
putting out content now?

222
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:46,287
Intagram?

223
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:47,953
- [Michael] Facebook and youtube.

224
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:48,786
- Just started YouTube channel.

225
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:49,971
- [Michael] Snapchat a little bit.

226
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,687
- [Gary] What kind, like a vlog style?

227
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,291
- Not quite.

228
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,497
- [Gary] How to, like
little pieces of content?

229
00:07:55,497 --> 00:07:56,478
- Pieces of content.

230
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:58,573
So like training sessions
like an hour long.

231
00:07:58,573 --> 00:07:59,406
- [Gary] Have you thought

232
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,763
about doing a call in podcast show?

233
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:02,867
Like Ask Gary Vee?

234
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,028
- We want to do an ask the trainer show.

235
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:06,703
- I think you would kill that.

236
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,459
Like the amount of people
that would call you

237
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,567
to a google voice number.

238
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,688
Again, like I do with about business,

239
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:15,631
you're like look, I'm not there.

240
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:17,590
So I don't know what's Snuffy's doing.

241
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,034
But the three cliche things I see

242
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,565
when a dog is tearing the fence,

243
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,858
is you've got them on a leash too much,

244
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,824
she's eating the wrong kind of food,

245
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,578
do you have a second dog?

246
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:31,687
Like if you can, the reason I'm successful

247
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:34,703
is because I can see the pieces.

248
00:08:34,703 --> 00:08:38,294
I know the 47 patterns
that they normally are.

249
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:39,397
I can do that.

250
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,268
The reason I can still do
Vayner media and other things is

251
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,227
surely if I can get more details

252
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,881
than I can 100% get it done.

253
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,945
You might not be able to
answer everything every time.

254
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:52,992
But you might be able to
help eight out of 10 people.

255
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:56,216
I would highly recommend doing a podcast.

256
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:58,222
Highly, and I would highly recommend

257
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:00,593
doing a asking you questions.

258
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:01,449
That's the whole show.

259
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,671
You have to do nothing.

260
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,385
You have to have some
audience, go on Instagram live,

261
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:06,465
put up phone numbers,
pick the phone numbers.

262
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:08,094
I mean you've seen ask Gary Vee, I assume.

263
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:09,444
It's not super hard.

264
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:10,277
- [Kaelin] Yeah.

265
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:11,402
- It would work.

266
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:12,911
- Instagram live do you think?

267
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,075
- [Gary] You need to get
the phone numbers, right?

268
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,869
So whether it's Facebook
live or Instagram live,

269
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,176
I don't know where you're audience is.

270
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:21,113
You need to be able to pick
some phone calls, numbers,

271
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:23,461
because you don't have a switch desk.

272
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:24,811
So you need to have a phone,

273
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,227
speaker phone, or however you do it.

274
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:28,772
This is my way, there's
probably smarter or better ways.

275
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:29,887
But you need to just pick phone numbers.

276
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,484
And be like hey, Karen from Kansas City,

277
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:32,383
what's your question?

278
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:34,584
Because you don't want them calling like,

279
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:37,035
or maybe you do want a switchboard.

280
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,135
I don't fucking know.

281
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:39,584
I mean, I don't know how
you guys do it in San Diego.

282
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:42,644
But, you know bottom line
is you wanna get a show

283
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:45,991
where you record it and
for 30 minutes, 20 minutes,

284
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,579
you answer three to five questions.

285
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:50,804
And I think most
knowledgeable professionals--

286
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:51,637
time to go--

287
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:53,623
- -most knowledgeable professionals

288
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:56,851
should do an ask format show right now

289
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:00,277
on Facebook or in podcast form

290
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:01,824
or from Google.

291
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:05,375
Because Q and A besides
interviewing somebody,

292
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,731
Q and A is the easiest
way to create content

293
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,445
instead of creating it yourself.

294
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:11,872
You know the whole document versus create?

295
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:14,041
Maybe you don't want
to be reality TV stars

296
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,768
and document your whole day.

297
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:17,571
So if you don't want to go that route.

298
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:19,326
You know, my whole thing is just start.

299
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,652
And what hold everybody back is creation.

300
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:24,594
Which is why document over
create became such a big thing.

301
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:27,623
But not everybody wants to
put be on camera all the time.

302
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:30,068
So the next version of document

303
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:34,202
over create is document, Q and A, create.

304
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:35,687
The Q and A's the middle one.

305
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:36,786
The Q and A's the way for you

306
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,624
to produce unbelievable content.

307
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:40,624
And you don't have to do anything.

308
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,714
You just have to answer four questions

309
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,425
which you know how to do.

310
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:45,649
The biggest reason
people aren't successful

311
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,567
is they don't actually know the answers.

312
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,525
They're playing the part.

313
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,317
There's a lot of dog trainers

314
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,508
that are trying to be
celebrity dog trainers

315
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:54,730
on Instagram right now.

316
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,321
That don't know what the
fuck they're talking about.

317
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,154
- [Kaelin] Oh yeah.

318
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:58,049
I know.

319
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,048
- Same way is physical trainers,
same way as business gurus,

320
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:02,347
wine experts, sneaker heads,

321
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:05,241
there's a whole lot of
fucking faking going on.

322
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:07,319
But if you actually have the goods?

323
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,670
Q and A, you know why?

324
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,386
You can show your skills on the spot.

325
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:11,773
You're not scared of anything.

326
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:13,959
You know why all these
fuckers don't do Q and A?

327
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,876
They want to control the message.

328
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,061
They don't have the fucking answer.

329
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:18,842
Q and A, you're on the spot.

330
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,148
The reason I only want to do Q and A is

331
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,139
that's where I get to show my strength.

332
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,136
- [Kaelin] Yeah, totally.

333
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:24,987
- Cool.

334
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:27,203
I gotta go.
- [Kaelin] Awesome!

335
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,262
- [Gary] Leave your three cents.

336
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:30,179
I gotta go.

337
00:11:32,690 --> 00:00:00,000
(soothing jazz music)
