1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:03,618
- Just close your eyes until you're 29.

2
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:06,388
Just close your eyes until you're 29.

3
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:07,221
♫ We're unstoppable

4
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:10,221
♫ We're unstoppable

5
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,422
As you guys can see, it
was super passionate,

6
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:17,467
I'll say it again.

7
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:19,654
Monday morning is super
gloomy in New York.

8
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:21,982
Really trying to figure
out how to show you guys

9
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:24,313
these meetings, so this is how I want you

10
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:25,872
to start the blog, Tyler, period.

11
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:27,935
You can take care of the
rest, you know I never impose.

12
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:31,819
But desperate to figure
out how to hack in here,

13
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,694
so let me try to figure this out.

14
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:36,834
So first meeting was with Steve Babcock,

15
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:39,537
the chief creative officer
and Claude, the head of HR,

16
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:42,543
and we're just auditing the
200 people in the department

17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,898
who's killing it, I think
it's imperative to dig deep,

18
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:46,916
and spend time with your big players,

19
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,173
so I want to do more of that going

20
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,327
into the rest of my career,
and then talking about

21
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,335
who is struggling and making
sure we're giving them

22
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:56,499
radical candor, I think you
never want to be in a place

23
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:58,954
where you surprise people
if they're struggling,

24
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:01,239
and I think at times
when you're good peeps,

25
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,775
you kinda want to hold it in

26
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:04,279
and I think we do that in our real lives,

27
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:05,745
and I think we do it in organizations

28
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:07,852
and so that's very much top
of mind, and so I did that.

29
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,680
I then jumped into a
meeting here with Alan,

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,676
Alan is the CFO, and I'm
just getting the updates

31
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:14,377
to how August went, what went
well, what didn't go well.

32
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:17,167
And plenty did not go
well, plenty of stresses.

33
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:19,373
This tone that you're feeling
from me comes from that,

34
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:21,446
as I'm processing like
how do I get better?

35
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:24,920
Then, fun things happen, like
Andy K. gets a new haircut,

36
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,653
and it puts me in a good mood.

37
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,586
Show me those sides, show
me that fading, Andy, yeah!

38
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:32,003
And so for all the headaches,

39
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:35,457
you get some awesome news
like Andy's new haircut

40
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,675
it makes you feel like
you're heading to Amsterdam.

41
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:39,089
I don't know what D-rock is doing,

42
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:41,840
this guy just sitting
there thinks he's fancy.

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,902
So this is how the place
is run these days I guess.

44
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:45,282
Plenty of work to do.

45
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:46,572
Hey everybody this is Gary Vanderchuck,

46
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,758
super pumped about my trip to Singapore,

47
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:52,567
big shoutout to Slush, very
excited about doing this Q&A,

48
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,734
let's get into it, D-rock.

49
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:57,813
You know, I think my biggest mistakes

50
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,413
have been the things I haven't done,

51
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:01,483
invest early in Uber,

52
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:04,983
pass on TV shows that became monster hits,

53
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:09,788
you know, I'm just
crippled by opportunity.

54
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,954
So my mistakes are not I did this, I lost,

55
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:14,123
I came back up, they're hidden mistakes,

56
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,621
which in a lot of ways are even worse,

57
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:18,052
because you're always wondering
what if, what if, what if?

58
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,513
Or mental strains, you
know, you want to win,

59
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,124
and you're always questioning

60
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:25,350
I mean should I have
started to enter Media?

61
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,088
Should I have gotten into
my family's business?

62
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:29,753
Would I have gone to Silicon Valley

63
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:33,027
in 1996 and made a
quadrillion, I don't know.

64
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:36,057
You know, it all is what
it is, I can't complain.

65
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:38,092
I don't dwell, I hate these questions,

66
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,684
to be very frank with you,
because you're asking me

67
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:44,165
to look back and I think
that's a fundamental flaw.

68
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,635
It just doesn't matter what
my biggest mistakes are,

69
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,293
it just matters what I do with
those things going forward

70
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:52,543
and so that's where I'm at.

71
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:57,103
- So this is a review,
firstly, for crushing it.

72
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:57,981
- Go ahead.

73
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:01,455
So hey youtube, this is
Colin, a very handsome

74
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:03,417
and very smart, Colin helps-

75
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,391
he's basically my copywriter,

76
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:07,001
ghostwriter of my current stuff,

77
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,879
Steph writes the books,
but for these articles

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,517
you've been seeing for
Medium and GaryVaynerchuk.com

79
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:14,079
this was a whole new thing we're doing

80
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,836
called crushing it, which is more

81
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,368
him interviewing people that
are following the thing,

82
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:19,205
Crushing it, the book
coming out in January,

83
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:22,139
but my blog posts, he
takes content from the web,

84
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,537
starts the framework,
pitches me the concepts

85
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,205
of like articles we should be writing,

86
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,691
based on what he's seeing in the cycles,

87
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:30,172
I say yes or no, transcribes
my words into english,

88
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:33,675
asks me five to seven
questions to add more to it,

89
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:37,047
then reads it back, then I
change an adjective or two here,

90
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,638
and make sure it's my voice,
but that's how I scale

91
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:41,163
with the infrastructure.

92
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:43,287
- Because I heard him say 90% of people

93
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,551
won't do this, so what got you started?

94
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,155
- They key reason that people win

95
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:49,491
in the 2017 flip challenge-

96
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:50,584
Like what is this hammer worth?

97
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:52,918
More than anything, is the
upfront work and research.

98
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:55,508
Babbin didn't hear that
I have creators now,

99
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:57,755
and wants to learn while they're here,

100
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:00,025
he was a creator, as a 12, 13-

101
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,179
when did you start, did you start making?

102
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:03,142
Nine.

103
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,153
The upfront works.

104
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,216
So anybody who's trying to
do the 2017 flip challenge

105
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:08,457
$7.99 better than zero!

106
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,277
Go and study all the sold results

107
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:13,266
of stuff that you see, so
that you become educated,

108
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,776
and then we can go find it; go ahead.

109
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,153
Guys everybody, listen.

110
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:18,093
You don't have to be that wealthy-

111
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,540
like Americans, especially Americans,

112
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,075
you have shit around your house.

113
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,742
Literally clothes you don't wear anymore

114
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,850
that can start that capital.

115
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,347
This is a great story, keep going.

116
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:29,016
- Should he quit his
job working at the mall?

117
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:30,381
- Anybody that works at the mall

118
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,686
should quit right now and
do the 2017 flip challenge.

119
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,053
Now, when I say quit
right now, quit mentally,

120
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:37,561
do what this dude did,
and get some sort of base

121
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:38,884
over the next month,

122
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:40,663
and get the fuck out of there by December.

123
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,751
I've just become completely
and utterly obsessed

124
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:45,281
with the destruction of-

125
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:47,364
I basically think what's
happening in the creed

126
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:51,307
of production world is what
happened with Uber and Amazon.

127
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:52,361
What do I want to do?

128
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,992
I want to let the market come to me.

129
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,635
Just talking about Vayner Productions,

130
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,506
our production facility
out in Long Island city,

131
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,649
operations, make it
better, make it better.

132
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,647
What are we doing, how are
we servicing ourselves?

133
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:03,121
How are we going to
service the outside market?

134
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:04,573
How are we going to
provide original content?

135
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:06,405
Like fucking just running an organiz-

136
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,735
this is just a meat and potatoes
kind of episode, I hope.

137
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,902
Run my business, Vayner X.

138
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:14,093
♫ I got this soft setting on comfortable

139
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:15,555
♫ Netting a G on my mind

140
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:17,209
♫ I been at this seven years

141
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,044
♫ And watched family fall behind

142
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:20,448
♫ I'm losing touch with my people

143
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:22,014
♫ I'm throwing dough in the back

144
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:25,235
- You know, if we didn't
think we were capable

145
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,242
of building one of the biggest firms,

146
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:30,184
built on, I think everybody
talks the same game,

147
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:33,719
so to me it's just gonna
be about execution.

148
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:35,894
I just got off the phone call

149
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:40,083
with some Vayner Sports
business, still working on that,

150
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,892
and now jumping on a call with actually

151
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,675
the former contestants
from Plan of the Apps.

152
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:47,457
I'm not a one and done guy,

153
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,909
I'm in the business of people forever

154
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,904
looking at Bavin right
now, who I love so much,

155
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:53,492
who's now in my heart and family.

156
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:56,898
Do I want him to be with me forever?

157
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,939
Yes.

158
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,322
Do I see a scenario where tomorrow

159
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:02,367
or seven years from now he may
want to go do something else?

160
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,349
Sure.

161
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,588
But does that mean that's
it's like done and sealed?

162
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:07,568
Absolutely not.

163
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,437
Always in the family.

164
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:10,189
Obviously the people that
are there, you gotta treat

165
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:11,594
a little bit better,
otherwise they'll leave,

166
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:12,644
but that's that.

167
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:14,160
Same way I think about junior sports.

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,284
If a kid signs with us
and blows out his knee,

169
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:18,617
he's in the Gary Vayner Sports business.

170
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:20,405
He comes and works for
Vayner, I get him a job,

171
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,866
I get him or her a job,
that's what I'm about.

172
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:27,458
And that's what I'm doing
with those contestants.

173
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,471
So I like that.

174
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,858
You need to be optimistic and patient,

175
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,077
and everything will work out.

176
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:34,078
If you're not, it won't, the end.

177
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,578
You're fucking 21.

178
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,421
Like I get that you want to apply it,

179
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:39,698
like I want to apply it too,

180
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,029
lack of patience, bro.

181
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,790
Wrap your head around not giving a fuck

182
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,441
about any advancement until you're 29,

183
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,391
but then every day trying to get better,

184
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:48,649
you will fucking win.

185
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,381
Just close your eyes until you're 29.

186
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:52,381
Patience, man, patience.

187
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,131
Everybody's looking up to audit themselves

188
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,632
where they are now.

189
00:06:56,632 --> 00:07:00,799
I promise you, show me everybody
you think is fancy at 22.

190
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:04,259
Show me where they were.

191
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,088
Fucking laying in their
vomit in their dorm room.

192
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:09,880
You know what I mean?

193
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,913
Like cool, like I get it.

194
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:15,892
Just don't vomit in your
dorm room and work every day,

195
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:18,157
but don't look at yourself at
21, do you know what I mean?

196
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:21,928
Just close your eyes until you're 29.

197
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:25,087
Just close your eyes until you're 29.

198
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,171
All your buddies for the next ten years

199
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:29,242
are going to be judging themselves,

200
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:31,044
they're gonna be looking
around, like where am I?

201
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,076
Where am I?

202
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,955
Every body who is trying to
figure out where they are

203
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,122
you need to be thoughtful,
but people are dwelling.

204
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:43,762
There's a big difference
between awareness and dwelling.

205
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:45,155
Be aware of where you're at,

206
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:48,763
I'm always aware of where
I'm at, but I don't dwell.

207
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,787
I don't obsess over.

208
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:53,392
And people that dwell and
obsess over where they're at

209
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:55,309
in their 20's, you just

210
00:07:58,349 --> 00:07:59,793
close your eyes.

211
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:02,460
(hip hop music)

212
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:10,543
Alright, a pretty shitty travel experience

213
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:13,707
flight had some issues,
couldn't find our driver,

214
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:16,687
got a cab, wasted a shitload of time.

215
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:20,187
Jordan hates wasting time, I hate it more.

216
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,384
Work out next.

217
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:25,551
(hip hop)

218
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,326
Going to Amsterdam right
now, looking forward to it.

219
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,265
I'm having a huge problem with my TSA.

220
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,232
Tyler Z., I'm not happy.

221
00:08:36,232 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not fancy, it's just
those minutes count, so ...
