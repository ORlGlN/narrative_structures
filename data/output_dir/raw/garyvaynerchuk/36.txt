1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,270
- It's just mental.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,200
Tomorrow, go and do something
you've been wanting to do,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,270
This is not Airport Gary.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,120
Well like, I'm not gonna put this on.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,850
That you're desperately scared about

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,160
what your parents, the world, the market,

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,230
you social media followers will think.

8
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,400
Do it and then see how not scary

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,617
all the negativity actually is.

10
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:24,117
("Belly" by "Slice" Wong)

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,520
There aren't right answers.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,620
Tomorrow, do the thing that
you've been scared to do

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,840
that is the most practical,

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,670
not move across the country,
something practical.

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,980
Start a YouTube page,
tweet about something.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,920
Like something, something.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,200
You have to understand
there's just decisions,

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,686
there's no right or wrong,
let me tell you why.

19
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:47,622
When you make a decision, you don't know

20
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:50,330
what happened of the other decision.

21
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,590
Do one thing that makes you uncomfortable,

22
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,240
see the reaction from the audience

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,740
and your inner family and your friends

24
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,780
and realize very quickly
that it wasn't as scary

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,590
as you thought, that feedback.

26
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,379
To go from here to here
because I'm not even

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,480
asking you to go to here,
you've gotta understand,

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,750
there's no right answers.

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,700
There's just doing.

30
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,404
What?

31
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:20,493
- [Drock] So it's been a minute.

32
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:21,430
- It has.

33
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,263
I have an idea.

34
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:23,850
Something just caught my attention.

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,140
In the meme video, can you have somebody

36
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,340
design one that starts the,

37
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,780
the top left is a two times bigger version

38
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,624
of my Instagram logo?

39
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:37,690
- [Drock] Okay.

40
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,920
- I think it might stop people even more.

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,610
The calm before the storm.

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,907
Yeah, speaking in New Orleans

43
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,990
to a pretty awesome crew
of contractors, insurance

44
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,920
policy executives and
so, just ready to rock.

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,430
- [Announcer] Everybody stand
up and give a big welcome

46
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,868
for Gary Vee!

47
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,868
(audience applause)

48
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,370
- How are you?

49
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,990
- [Man] Dude great to see you again man.

50
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,640
- It's always good to see you bro.

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,115
- [Man] First of all thank you so much

52
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:15,013
for everything you put out.

53
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:16,730
I've been following, watching
what you've been doing

54
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,870
for years and have built my brand off of

55
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,980
my version of that.

56
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,010
- I love it.

57
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,670
Let's stay in the theme of
Crush It and Crushing It.

58
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,580
Let's go into it a little
deeper because maybe,

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,590
maybe you'll inspire more than I will.

60
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,700
How did that first start?

61
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,370
Like gimme the details behind that.

62
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,530
When did you first find me, when was that

63
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,300
and where were you at
and what happened next?

64
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,220
- [Man] Started following
you when you wrote Crush It

65
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,140
and became kind of just a follower,

66
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,150
just watched kind of self
indicative at that point.

67
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,610
I was working in the corporate world.

68
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,730
- Okay.

69
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,240
- I didn't have my own agency,
I didn't have my own company

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,840
and certainly didn't have my new company.

71
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,100
But watched what you did
and saw how you did it

72
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,500
very thoughtfully and
very real and very humbly

73
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,180
which I thought was the key to this.

74
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:03,120
So just fast forward, I've
been following you for years.

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,490
March 6, 2017, in a Facebook
group, CPA Accounting person,

76
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,070
in a Facebook group, somebody needed help

77
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,940
writing Ad Copy, you know the story.

78
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,080
I went into the group and
helped them rewrite their ad

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,730
in the group which led
to 15 people saying,

80
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,070
wow I wish I could write ads like that.

81
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,120
And then I made the
stupid mistake of saying,

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,090
if you ever need help, email me or DM me.

83
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,552
That week I had 100 requests
and my company soared.

84
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:34,610
Six months later we hit the local scale

85
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,167
and you at dinner in October recommended

86
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,320
that I get an operations person.

87
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,020
Best fucking advice ever.

88
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,635
- I'm good at this shit.

89
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:46,610
(audience laughing)

90
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,800
- [Man] No dude I sent you
email with the snapshot.

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,762
You saw that email?

92
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,595
- I did.

93
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,230
- [Man] Our revenue
stream, like that since

94
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,063
I brought a brand.

95
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:55,460
- Guys, self-awareness.

96
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,140
You don't have to be great at everything.

97
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,620
You have to be great at figuring out

98
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,830
what you're great at and
then surrounding yourself

99
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,390
with everything else.

100
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,300
Humility.

101
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,140
You've got your ego caught
up in this narrative.

102
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,580
Excuse me for a second while
I've got you guys, hiring.

103
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,620
So many of you have not fired somebody

104
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,380
that you desperately need to fire

105
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,149
because you're the one that hired them

106
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,519
and you have more pride
in being good at hiring

107
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,179
than running a good business.

108
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,510
This is the psychology that matters.

109
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,490
- [Man] So my question to you is this.

110
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,560
In my breakout presentation,
I'm actually showing people

111
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,290
how to build that brink,
everything you talk about.

112
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,470
Just my version of it.

113
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,285
How do I get our customers, our clients

114
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:40,130
to stop giving a fuck about
the buy now, click here,

115
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,621
get into my funnel and
get into the storytelling

116
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:43,454
of their business?

117
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:44,370
- You don't.

118
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,460
What you do is what I do which is

119
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,070
you're gonna go on a journey of spending

120
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,470
a fucking decade
exhaustively standing up here

121
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,100
yelling and screaming and ranting

122
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,880
or calmly or whatever you do.

123
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,880
All you can do is put out the
truth and let the chips fall.

124
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,480
You heard me very carefully.

125
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,930
Two.

126
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,730
My great ambition here is
that two of you listen and do.

127
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,537
That is some bullshit numbers.

128
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:11,980
There's hundreds and
hundreds of people here

129
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,760
but that's what I've learned
which is like, you can't.

130
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,770
What you can do is aspire
humbly and authentically

131
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,670
to get them there and
then just let your skill

132
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,340
and talent and work
ethic create the legacy

133
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,660
of how many people you
were able to get there.

134
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,700
Right, look how I'm thinking about it.

135
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,150
From my tree, it's like a coaching tree.

136
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,260
From my tree to you, to
you to them and so for me,

137
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,390
there's enormous amount of
pride in how many people

138
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,650
I've been able to hit but some of them

139
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,330
maybe in your breakout session.

140
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,630
I'm here and you're here.

141
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,930
Some of the people here
didn't get hit by what I said

142
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,070
but maybe in your breakout session do

143
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,910
and honestly that feels incredible for me

144
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,489
because I know where that seed started.

145
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:52,322
(audience applause)

146
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:53,780
Thank you.

147
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,113
Thank you.

148
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,860
Thank you so much.

149
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,810
Thanks New Orleans.

150
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,073
- Did you see mom signing the book?

151
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:08,073
- No.

152
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:10,622
- Mom got asked to sign a book.

153
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,110
- It's gonna start soon.

154
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,180
Mom better start working on her signature.

155
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,700
Negativity can be leading at halftime.

156
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,570
But positivity always wins championships.

157
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,023
- Are you taking on new shoes?

158
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:26,990
- What's that?

159
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,823
- Bringing out new shoes?

160
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,910
A new set, like a new style or anything?

161
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,900
Oh, okay perfect.

162
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,733
- Three and four.

163
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:32,800
- You've just changed me.

164
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,633
- Thank you brother.

165
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:34,730
- I'll be one of your two.

166
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,140
- Thank you brother, makes sense right?

167
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,740
- Yeah well, I'm a writer,
I'm an ex-director,

168
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,990
I'm an ex-movie producer,

169
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,570
and I'm not doing anything with video.

170
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,560
- That's fuckin' crazy.

171
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,078
Like the fact that you have that

172
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:45,911
and you probably like it.

173
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:46,801
- I love it.

174
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:51,170
- Yeah, to me that is like super ignorant.

175
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,072
- You have any rule or ritual,

176
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,300
anything that you do with your life?

177
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,630
- I've one rule.

178
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,420
Try to give more to the other person

179
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,087
than I want in return.

180
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:06,350
- Right.

181
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,710
- Every interaction.

182
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,750
- What about everyday before coffee?

183
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,583
Anything, nothing weird?

184
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,416
- Not for me.

185
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,249
- Nothing.

186
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,170
- But man, I'm doing it
every second of my life.

187
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,780
I'm trying to give you a better answer

188
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,832
than giving you an answer
that has value for me.

189
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:19,080
- Right, right.

190
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,750
Give 'em more back than you got.

191
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,913
- 51, 49.

192
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:23,990
- Appreciate it.

193
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,550
- Biggest changes in like, content like,

194
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,500
do you think it's--

195
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,333
- Audio.

196
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,560
Audio.

197
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,840
There's no straight.

198
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,200
There's three things.

199
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,870
But there's moments where there's spikes

200
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,860
and when there's spikes,
it's like real estate.

201
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,020
There's land grab.

202
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,390
There's a land grab in
podcasting right now.

203
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,223
- Still sold on podcast?

204
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:43,834
- 100%

205
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:44,667
- Alright.

206
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,250
- We're on Facebook,
Instagram, about to get on,

207
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,350
I'm trying to push us to get onto YouTube.

208
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:55,330
LinkedIn is like in the
works and so is Twitter.

209
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,780
- But it's also not just
wide, which I believe,

210
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,790
but it's deep.

211
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,623
- Yeah.

212
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:01,580
- Like you could be on Facebook,

213
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,710
you could be a contractor, you
could be a real estate agent,

214
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,020
you could be a basketball player

215
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,600
but are you winning?

216
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,620
You gotta make sure
you get your depth down

217
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,660
along with your width.

218
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,010
Too many people think
like oh we're gonna add

219
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,190
podcasting, we're gonna add this.

220
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,960
But like the thing that
I think I'm doing well

221
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,060
is it's wide and deep.

222
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,110
But that's why there's 17 fuckin' people.

223
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,170
And I'm not even happy.

224
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:28,300
I think people don't realize
to be great, you need both.

225
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,930
You need to be wide and deep.

226
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,230
You just saw the highlight.

227
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,400
That's why Drock is pushing me to expand.

228
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,530
A lot of you think the answer is,

229
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,730
well I'll start a podcast this year

230
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,330
or I'll start a blog too,

231
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,570
or I'll do YouTube videos
too with my Facebook

232
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,403
or vice versa.

233
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:43,440
A lot of you are like oh,
now I'm gonna do Facebook,

234
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,870
Facebook Watch along with my YouTube.

235
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,410
The problem is 99% of you haven't gotten

236
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,540
the thing you're doing down, right?

237
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,010
So it's, that's the key to me.

238
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,430
I think a lot of people are confused by

239
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,830
what's working for me.

240
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,580
You know, I'm not always just obsessed

241
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,520
with doing everything,

242
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,490
I'm obsessed with doing
everything right and deep

243
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,000
and getting the value out of it

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,020
but also not being crippled.

245
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,620
For example, we had Facebook
down a year and a half ago.

246
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,750
I don't feel like we have it down.

247
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,010
I think we've mailed it in
a little bit in a podcast

248
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,500
kind of Instagram world back on my team

249
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,030
so now I'm like oh shit, over
here I've gotta go deeper.

250
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,880
So it's not only about going
wide or deep in a moment,

251
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,010
it's about going wide
and deep at all times

252
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,460
and understanding you're
pulling those levers.

253
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,560
So you're just always
getting your game better.

254
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,490
It's like being a
professional athlete like

255
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,100
you know, even the best,
the LeBrons, the Stephs,

256
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,970
the Kobes, they talk about
like refining their game

257
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,900
in season 12 of a hall of fame career.

258
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,990
I'm in a hall of fame career.

259
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,810
I'm trying to get better at every nuance,

260
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,210
deeper, wider, always and too many of you

261
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,240
are confused at just adding something,

262
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,850
widening out is the solve, is the unlock.

263
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,220
There's no fuckin' solve or unlock,

264
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,850
there's just a fuckin' process.

265
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,020
- Thank you.

266
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,500
- That last clip with that kid,

267
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,740
that's gonna really help a lot of people.

268
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,030
That's a real clip.

269
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:59,610
Worry about your craft, not the algorithm.

270
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
It is, that's the meme.

271
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:08,610
Now I'm so happy for you.

272
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,330
Not for anybody else back
home so that makes me happy.

273
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,990
No time to post, there's no hashtag,

274
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,930
there's no certain content,
there's no certain people

275
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,160
that follow you, there is no hack.

276
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,360
What there is is consistency,

277
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,699
of like putting out great content.

278
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:22,520
- I think the thing that
people are missing about

279
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,730
the working 20 hour a day train is

280
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,270
it's not about that, you
have consistently said.

281
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,240
You just have to be
disciplined not to give up.

282
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,530
I mean, yes work hard but the point is

283
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,970
don't work hard and then quit.

284
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,740
Like work hard for a decade.

285
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,470
Be self-aware

286
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,730
because self-awareness and
perseverance and delusion,

287
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,030
you know perseverance
and delusion, look Ryan,

288
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,420
you're gonna be successful in pretty much

289
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,770
anything you do because you
have the tools to be successful,

290
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,260
you understand the patterns that like,

291
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,280
you'll be successful.

292
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,690
If you texted me tomorrow
and be like dude,

293
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,780
sold the house, the tree house,

294
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,480
starting a lemonade
business direct to consumer

295
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,470
and Amazon, I'm like that's
gonna be a successful

296
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,380
lemonade business.

297
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:13,810
But that's the same way that like,

298
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,750
you know LeBron would be successful

299
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,020
if he wanted to be a football player.

300
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,500
Now he might not be NFL but he's just

301
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,580
a fucking beast athlete.

302
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,820
I think there's a lot of people right now

303
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,220
that want to be an entrepreneur
because it's a like

304
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,030
a rockstar status stuff
right now but they can't.

305
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,100
And so for me, self-awareness like

306
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,410
I don't want people to just not give up

307
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,610
because guess what,
there's a lot of people

308
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,300
that have been trying to
build a business for 11 years

309
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,920
and it's never gonna happen but

310
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,710
they could be an amazing number three.

311
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,780
They should be you and I number three.

312
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,760
So self-awareness, delusion,
complaining's my biggest one.

313
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,160
Literally 98% of my
conversation is predicated on

314
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,812
if you're unhappy, the
strategy that does not work is

315
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:58,480
going to other people's
social media and trolling them

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,870
because you're unhappy with yourself

317
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,470
or going to the bar at 4:30
and drinking three Bud Lights

318
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,230
and complaining to the bartender,
that's not the strategy.

319
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,860
Tomorrow, go and do something
you've been wanting to do

320
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,430
that you're desperately scared
about what your parents,

321
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,190
the world, the market,

322
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,230
you social media followers will think.

323
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,290
Do it and then see how not scary

324
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,360
all the negativity actually is.

325
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,890
You have to understand,
there's just decisions,

326
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,310
there's no right or wrong

327
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,720
because let me tell you why.

328
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,646
When you make a decision, you don't know

329
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:33,030
what happened of the other decision.

330
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,250
Do one thing that makes you uncomfortable,

331
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,210
see the reaction from the
audience and your inner family

332
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,360
and your friends and realize very quickly

333
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,110
that it was as scary as you thought.

334
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,410
That feedback.

335
00:12:46,296 --> 00:00:00,000
