1
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:03,255
- I don't think you have a lot, Babon.

2
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:04,747
He just shook his head.

3
00:00:04,747 --> 00:00:06,909
Babon doesn't have a whole lot.

4
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:08,727
And honestly, to be very frank,

5
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:11,586
I think this could be the
best episode of DailyVee ever.

6
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:14,586
♫ We're unstoppable

7
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:16,337
Hey guys.

8
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:18,117
I'm gonna try to figure out
something for today's episode.

9
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:21,028
Literally the entire day is predicated on

10
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:23,971
internal meetings that we can't show

11
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,498
so we're trying sit here,

12
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:26,476
figure it out.

13
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:28,438
How we're gonna hack it.

14
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:30,567
Maybe on some of my
drives I'll do some rants.

15
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:31,699
Talk a state of the union.

16
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,820
Why don't you have the team talk?

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,653
You know what we'll do today?

18
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:35,130
We'll social commentate
on some of the business

19
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,017
things that happening in the world.

20
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:36,850
(ding)

21
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,958
So why don't you get the team,

22
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,360
look at some of the headlines.

23
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,783
I'll do a little reading
for a quick minute

24
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:42,079
and I'll give my two cents on

25
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,287
Toys "R" Us going out of business.

26
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,555
So let me just talk to you guys about why

27
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:47,613
Toys "R" Us filing chapter 11 matters.

28
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:48,530
Toys "R" Us

29
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:52,889
did two things over
the last couple decades

30
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:53,723
that make no sense.

31
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:55,645
One, very early in the 2000s,

32
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:57,639
they outsourced themselves to Amazon.

33
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:00,262
They didn't believe in the internet

34
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:02,631
17 years ago, so they let
Amazon do their fulfillment

35
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:05,128
which started people
getting used to buying toys

36
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:06,847
on the internet through an Amazon world.

37
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:09,194
But most importantly,
they just didn't innovate.

38
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,108
You know, and when you
don't innovate, you die.

39
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:12,343
Like you could've made,

40
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:14,152
Toys "R" Us three years
ago could've created

41
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:17,193
the National Lego Championships,

42
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:18,077
and everybody would be--

43
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,133
There was a million--

44
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:20,713
They could've made slime centers.

45
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,605
They could be killing it right
now with their locations,

46
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:24,901
but no, they choose

47
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,452
to just like sell toys out of it.

48
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:27,953
And none of you wanna go there.

49
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:29,894
First of all, you're gonna go to Walmart

50
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:31,862
and pick it up for less money anyway,

51
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:33,542
while you pick up your
groceries and everything else.

52
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,976
And if you even wanna
leave your fuckin' home.

53
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:36,809
And you don't.

54
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:38,840
And so you'll go to
Amazon and do it that way,

55
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,719
or buy it from somebody's
YouTube channel link,

56
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,523
or Instagram account.

57
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:46,106
It's the best example right now

58
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:50,544
of like how in trouble everybody is

59
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,807
if they fuckin' rest on their laurels.

60
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:54,001
You know if Toys "R" Us,

61
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,116
the dominant niche retail leader

62
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:01,191
of a humongous multi-billion
dollar category

63
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,899
is finished,

64
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:04,918
what do you think is gonna
happen over the next 6 years?

65
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,778
You know classic day of being a CEO of

66
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:07,812
big fuckin' company.

67
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,645
(murmuring)

68
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,170
Yeah, I've been really in it, right?

69
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,126
Like,

70
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:12,276
we're fuckin' in it.

71
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,497
We're fuckin' in it.

72
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:16,080
(mellow music)

73
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:27,704
That's cool.

74
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:28,766
What is it?

75
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:29,612
- It's just new hardware,

76
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,367
probably connect the glasses.

77
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,423
- Connect the glasses?

78
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,523
Glasses that talk?

79
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:36,280
- Yeah voice and comments.

80
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,150
- You want me to tell everybody
what I think about that?

81
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,309
I like it.

82
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,142
Dude, guys

83
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:43,060
every single thing is
gonna interact with every

84
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,979
single thing.

85
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,429
Go find a clip right now of
me talking about smart pants.

86
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:47,996
Everything in the world will be smart.

87
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,411
Your shirt, your pants, your
underwear, your sneakers,

88
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,318
your socks.

89
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,936
That's what I think about smart glasses.

90
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:54,698
This coffee cup is gonna tell me

91
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:56,413
that this coffee's cold.

92
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:58,909
It's gonna give me a
recommendation of a cool coffee

93
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:00,905
that's gonna automatically order it

94
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:01,738
through my phone.

95
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:02,582
It's gonna show up here.

96
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,848
I mean, it's fuckin' all.

97
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:08,659
- What's going on in Gary's
World, his brand director?

98
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,170
I was pretty impressed with
the Reddit kid's content

99
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,003
that he sent through.

100
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:13,836
- Yeah it was baller.

101
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,248
♫ I got internship on internship

102
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:16,673
♫ Inside my resume

103
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:20,016
I thought we were in the
content business? (laughs)

104
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:20,849
- They're the same.

105
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,595
Well we've leveled up.

106
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:23,560
Content business

107
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,470
and now we're just media.

108
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,461
Media conglomerate around one human being.

109
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:31,016
- Who is that?

110
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:33,172
- The savage in there.

111
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,089
(group conversing)

112
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:38,143
(clicking)

113
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:38,997
- What am a I walking into?

114
00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:40,545
A round table discussion?

115
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:42,559
- [Man In Front Seat] So
the first part is just you

116
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,076
(audio cuts out)

117
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:45,193
from home lending plus

118
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:46,399
CEO
- CEO.

119
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,441
Oh this is more business talk?

120
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:48,686
- [Man In Front Seat] This was
the follow-up from that talk.

121
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,519
- Yeah, this is good.

122
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,369
We're doing that now?
- [Man In Front Seat] Yep.

123
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:51,202
- Awesome.

124
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,035
- [Man In Front Seat] So,
we can count on that on

125
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:52,885
the way out.

126
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:54,367
Round table, I have no
idea what you're doing.

127
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,039
(laughing)

128
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,960
- I was making a joke that I don't know

129
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,418
what I'm doing until the morning,

130
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:02,174
when I take first glance at it.

131
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:04,080
The fact that I don't know what I'm doing

132
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,240
20 minutes before what I'm doing it,

133
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,669
is even a whole nother level.

134
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:09,849
I just don't know what I'm doing.

135
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:10,682
Hey kids,

136
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,380
the key to success is not
know what you're doing.

137
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,683
- [Man In Front Seat] Wing it.
- On the fly.

138
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:14,516
- Okay man.

139
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:15,349
- Willie Morris.

140
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:16,182
- Drinks or something soon?

141
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,015
- Yeah, I'd love that.

142
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:17,848
- Okay.

143
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:21,709
- Heading into a meeting
with our Chase client.

144
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,270
One of the biggest brands in the world.

145
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,485
Joe Whitmarsh,

146
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:26,130
long time--

147
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,963
show Joe.

148
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,519
Long time vet at VaynerMedia.

149
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,942
Made that show, Grow Your CEO Life.

150
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,876
800 emails.

151
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:36,876
1,500 texts.

152
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:41,200
I think there is just
not enough appreciation

153
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,812
for the amount of volume
of work and effort,

154
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:48,070
and energy, just energy needed
to sit on top of something

155
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,903
successful.

156
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:50,136
A lot of people want

157
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:51,061
these big companies

158
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:52,663
that you guys all wanna build.

159
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:54,220
I just wanna make sure
everybody understands

160
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,891
the emotional drainage that
is happening in real time.

161
00:04:57,891 --> 00:05:00,224
Make sure your energy is up.

162
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,020
(mellow music)

163
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:15,720
Long day.

164
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,738
8:24 p.m., New York.

165
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:19,460
About to go into two meetings.

166
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,112
I was with clients the whole day.

167
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,804
I don't think you have a whole lot Babon.

168
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:25,274
He just shook his head.

169
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,496
Babon doesn't have a whole lot.

170
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,345
And honestly to be very frank,

171
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,319
I think this could be the
best episode of DailyVee ever.

172
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,322
Make it short as fuck.

173
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:36,036
Show it what it is.

174
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,263
It's real simple.

175
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:38,835
Like

176
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:40,471
just a lot fuckin' work.

177
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:41,500
Lot of grinding.

178
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,161
Every day's different.

179
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,729
Not everyday is super fun and glamorous,

180
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,435
even with fuckin' some cool,
up and coming hip hop music.

181
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,979
Some interesting edits.

182
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,372
Some different angles.

183
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:55,496
Like sometimes YouTube,

184
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:56,781
it just is what it is, right?

185
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:57,614
Like,

186
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:00,128
Babon can only do so much.

187
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:00,961
You know.

188
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:05,043
Just fuckin' 15 hours of
fuckin' hustling today.

189
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:07,508
Client, client, client,
client, client, client, client,

190
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:08,341
you know?

191
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:09,510
Just what it was.

192
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,998
Just what it is.

193
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:13,510
That's actually what it is
a whole lot of the time.

194
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,115
Luckily--

195
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,327
I love that you're, right?

196
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:17,523
That all it really fuckin' is.

197
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:19,690
Like we find our, you know

198
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:21,661
the speeches help.

199
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,519
The traveling helps, but like.

200
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,512
- [Babon] It's kind of boring though.

201
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:28,098
- Yeah man, the whole
thing's fuckin' boring.

202
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:31,304
You know, I'm a little bit
entertaining as a personality

203
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:35,498
and I'm putting out, I'm
showing and talking about

204
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,199
stuff that matters to people.

205
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,059
If they're really paying attention,

206
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:42,726
watch what I do, not what I say.

207
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,922
We, you know.

208
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,153
I think the thing that's not boring is

209
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:49,650
it's fuckin' real,

210
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,700
it's the fuckin' truth.

211
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,471
And so for every one of you

212
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:53,907
trying to get yours

213
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:54,950
in your genre,

214
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,783
in your world,

215
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:56,616
your way,

216
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,619
no special effects are more
powerful than a true story.

217
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,999
The story always wins.

218
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,582
(mellow music)

219
00:07:14,860 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah man, the whole
thing's fuckin' boring.
