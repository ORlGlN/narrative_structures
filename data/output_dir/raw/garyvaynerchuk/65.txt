1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:04,886
- Sales, sales, sales, something
I don't talk about enough

2
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:06,508
and very much the foundation of my career.

3
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:08,320
Something I'm gonna
challenge myself in 2018

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,296
to talk more about.

5
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:11,076
This keynote's a little bit from 2016,

6
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:12,336
but I think your gonna enjoy it.

7
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:14,069
Here's the full episode so
for all you sales people,

8
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:17,077
tag up your sales homey in the comments

9
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:19,455
and enjoy, sit back, and listen.

10
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:22,122
(hip hop music)

11
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:29,070
(band music)

12
00:00:30,904 --> 00:00:34,071
(audience applausing)

13
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:40,291
Whoo, it is dark.

14
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,150
Thank you so much for that warm welcome.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,126
Excited about this.

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,379
I think, when I think about
making something happen

17
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:50,640
in the world, selling
something, getting a donation,

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,726
getting voted for.

19
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:55,491
Whatever the transaction is,
I always break down that world

20
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:58,027
into sales and marketing.

21
00:00:58,027 --> 00:01:00,531
I think that I spend a
lot of time these days

22
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:03,665
in the marketing funnel
and really helping a lot

23
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:06,548
of my digital start ups and my
friends in digital marketing.

24
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:07,871
Oh, that you so much.

25
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:09,416
Good reaction to the darkness.

26
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,863
Jets jersey, that makes me super happy.

27
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:16,370
Trying to convince a lot
of people to go from sales

28
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,891
to understand the value of marketing.

29
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:22,294
I'll tell you right
now, through and through

30
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:24,957
when I pass away and they open me up,

31
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:27,963
I'm a salesman through and through.

32
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,633
I've been my whole life,
big ups to the sales people.

33
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,808
So coming to a sales conference
is a lot of fun for me

34
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:35,447
and I think there should be
more of them in our space

35
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:39,193
because I think the issue with
a lot of my marketing friends

36
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:42,170
and people is it's very up in the clouds

37
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,289
and it doesn't really
end up creating the thing

38
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:49,400
that I think we're all tied
to which is the transaction.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,518
What is the KPI?

40
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:52,424
What are we actually trying to do?

41
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:54,519
I'm gonna give you a little
background of where I came from

42
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,378
for the people in here
that don't know my story

43
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:58,031
because I think it matters.

44
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:00,033
Then I want to talk about what I would do

45
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,528
if I was in this audience.

46
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:06,318
What I try to do as a salesman
is I try to reverse-engineer.

47
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:09,293
I try to figure out while on
stage who the audience is.

48
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:12,869
I try to figure out what
Simon and Seth and Arianna

49
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,491
and Frederick have already said,

50
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,058
'cause I know their spiels
really fuckin' well.

51
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:18,995
I'm trying to think about what
can I say that's different

52
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:21,626
that's gonna actually bring value.

53
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:24,997
The truth is, and I know
those four very well.

54
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:27,721
Frederick I think is a pure-bred salesman.

55
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:32,022
I really do think that
I was born very lucky

56
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:34,085
in that I think my
parents are very opposite.

57
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:37,188
I think I feel very
kinship with my marketing

58
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,794
and with my sales.

59
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:40,055
That's what I want to focus on

60
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:42,275
because I think a lot
of people here can make

61
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,685
a lot more money if they
eliminated two things:

62
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:47,352
one, laziness, to be very frank;

63
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,204
and two, idealistic points of view

64
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,081
of how they've made
their money in the past.

65
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:58,010
One of the biggest concerns I
have sitting here in a world

66
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,759
where I am hungry to get one
to two people, three people

67
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,076
to get a lot of value out of this talk

68
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:06,011
is the way you made your
money before is my enemy.

69
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,477
The way you've been successful
yesterday is my enemy.

70
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:12,800
It is stunning if you understood
what runs through my head

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,706
every morning on how little
I think anybody should give

72
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:20,251
a fuck about anything I
achieved yesterday back.

73
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:23,747
You're really only as
good as your last at bat.

74
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:25,448
The thing that I'm most passionate about,

75
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:29,008
I think many of you guys and
gals can agree with me on this,

76
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,859
is the landscape of sales
and all of communication

77
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,103
in our society has had a fundamental shift

78
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:37,781
over the last decade
because of technology.

79
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,970
There's just a lot of
people that are doing things

80
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,121
that are not bringing them
real value for their actions.

81
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,954
My religion in sales is attention.

82
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,429
Before I even think about how
to sell you my SAS product

83
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,445
'cause it's better than
the one that you're using,

84
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:56,178
or my wine, or why you should
us VaynerMedia and my agency,

85
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,265
or a new pair of sneakers,
or whatever you're selling

86
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:00,620
in this room.

87
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,794
Mid-market, enterprise,
small start up, the one thing

88
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:08,711
that connects us is the
end person's attention.

89
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:12,024
This is what I want to focus on at first.

90
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:16,353
My career of being
obsessed around attention

91
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:19,520
started when I was six,
and I'm not kidding.

92
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:20,688
This is an interesting story.

93
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,389
I was born in the Soviet Union.

94
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,726
I came here as a kid.

95
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,443
My dad eventually got a job as a stock boy

96
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:26,813
in a liquor store in New Jersey.

97
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:27,869
I originally lived in Queens

98
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,279
then I grew up in Edison, New Jersey.

99
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,381
In Edison, when I was
six and seven years old,

100
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:35,798
I tricked, manipulated, sold.

101
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,619
I sold my friends on the idea of standing

102
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:44,281
behind a lemonade stand all day.

103
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:47,069
So when I was six years old,
I had a six lemonade stand

104
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,321
franchise in Edison, New Jersey.

105
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:51,542
How many of you remember Big
Wheels, those little bikes?

106
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,551
I used to ride my Big
Wheels at the end of the day

107
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,944
every summer and pick up my cash

108
00:04:56,944 --> 00:04:59,150
like I was little Tony
Soprano or something.

109
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,662
(audience laughing)

110
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,316
So I was a salesman early on.

111
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:06,679
It's funny, the reason my
friends were behind the register

112
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,285
selling the lemonade and I wasn't.

113
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:09,467
It wasn't 'cause I was fancy.

114
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,372
It wasn't because I didn't
want to do the work.

115
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:14,664
It's because, and this is me
now realizing this years later,

116
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,696
it was because I was
obsessed with attention.

117
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:19,310
While my homey's stood
behind the lemonade stands,

118
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,154
I walked up and down the streets.

119
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,044
By the way, for a lot of
the youngsters in here,

120
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,997
this was the 80s when
kids just went outside

121
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:26,367
and did random shit.

122
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,367
I would walk up and down the streets

123
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:34,967
and literally, this is how sick I am,

124
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,779
I would sit at the cross
sections of streets,

125
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,859
Tingley Lane in New Jersey,
Inman Avenue in New Jersey.

126
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,550
I would sit there and
I would watch people.

127
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,125
I would sit there for an hour.

128
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,854
I'm seven, six, seven eight years old.

129
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:52,003
I would it there for hours and
I would watch cars drive by

130
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,618
and I would try to see if
I could see their faces

131
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:58,587
and I could figure out which tree or pole

132
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:00,698
to put the lemonade stand sign on

133
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:02,683
because that would be the better one

134
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,714
because they would see
it and buy lemonade.

135
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:09,345
Early it was intuitive to
me at such a ridiculous age

136
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:12,401
that the number one
asset was the attention

137
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:16,591
and then what I had to
say is what mattered.

138
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:21,206
That the creative, the product,
the copy was the variable.

139
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,190
That the thing I said on
the other side of the phone

140
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,371
was the variable.

141
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:28,892
But before I could say it, no
matter how good my game was,

142
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:31,822
did I actually have their
attention or was I speaking

143
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,200
to somebody that wasn't paying attention.

144
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,035
I believe that the far
majority of this room

145
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:39,944
has become disconnected with the reality

146
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:42,967
of the end-consumer's attention.

147
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,756
We have taken for granted
whether through laziness,

148
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:49,538
not being compensated for it,
or whatever other variable.

149
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:51,465
You are not being good at what you do?

150
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:52,426
I don't know.

151
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,009
I believe that the market
of sales has lost its way.

152
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,426
I think it's the speed of attention shift

153
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:01,372
in today's society.

154
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:03,089
I went on to have a very
big baseball card business

155
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,853
when I was 12 and 13.

156
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,420
When I was 12, 13 I was
selling baseball cards

157
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,011
in the malls of New Jersey.

158
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,563
I was making two to 3,000 dollar a weekend

159
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:13,831
as a baseball card salesman.

160
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:16,052
I don't know about you
guys, but when you're 14

161
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:19,719
and you have $30,000
in cash under your bed,

162
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:24,888
and you're not selling weed,
you're a good fuckin' salesman.

163
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:26,305
So that was good.

164
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:29,723
By the way, I plan on
buying the New York Jets

165
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:31,645
which I think projected
by the time I'm ready

166
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,677
is gonna cost me between five
and eight billion dollars

167
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:37,410
and I'm convinced that when I
was 13 and had $30,000 in cash

168
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,426
it will be the richest I've ever been.

169
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,953
I just couldn't even begin
to think about spending

170
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:43,143
that kind of money.

171
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,033
When I was 14, my dad ruined my life,

172
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,262
dragged me into the liquor store,

173
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:48,041
paid me two bucks and hour to bag ice.

174
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,207
He now owned his own store
in Springfield, New Jersey.

175
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:53,349
I went from like being my own entrepreneur

176
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,334
and doing my thing to
working in this store

177
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:58,028
called Shoppers Discount
Liquors that I hated

178
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,666
because I bagged ice for 15 hours a day

179
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,320
and walked home with 30 bucks.

180
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,170
That was a bad--

181
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,729
That was two or three years of dark ages

182
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,226
of my professional career.

183
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,415
When I was 16, 17 I was allowed upstairs.

184
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:09,463
I realized people collected wine.

185
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:11,873
That was interesting to me
'cause I was into collecting

186
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:14,330
and I embarked in my career.

187
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,299
My career took an interesting turn

188
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:18,850
because I discovered the internet.

189
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,851
In 1997, I launched one of
the first E-commerce wine

190
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,843
businesses in America
called Wine Library dot Com.

191
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:27,482
I grew my dad's business

192
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:31,403
from a three to a 60 million
dollar business in five years.

193
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:33,845
I did it through sales and marketing.

194
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,577
I did it in two ways.

195
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:38,775
One, I was out marketing everybody
by buying Google Adwords,

196
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:39,845
by doing email.

197
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:41,467
How many people here do email marketing?

198
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,688
Raise your hands.

199
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:47,831
In 1997, I had a 200,000 person
email database selling wine

200
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,414
that had 91.3% open rates.

201
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,360
Right, yeah.

202
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,301
Now, it wasn't 'cause I was such a hero.

203
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,487
That same list now is like 31.3,

204
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:00,495
it's because nobody was doing it.

205
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,574
The thing that I want
to talk to you about is

206
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:06,741
the stunning excuses that
my salesmen friends make up

207
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:11,766
for not doing SnapChat,
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,

208
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:15,490
or LinkedIn content.

209
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,396
I love my sales friends who
are like, "I do LinkedIn."

210
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:18,341
I'm like, no, no, no.

211
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,522
You don't do LinkedIn.

212
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,680
You sit there and you
fuckin' try to connect people

213
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,145
and you're a fuckin'
spambot you motherfucker.

214
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:26,059
(audience laughing)

215
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,226
Not a saleman.

216
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,666
Fuck.

217
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,303
Anyway, sorry.

218
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,721
(audience laughing)

219
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:35,682
Truth, truth, like I do LinkedIn sales.

220
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:36,974
No you don't you just click buttons

221
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,164
and you hope and pray and
you control copy and paste

222
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,352
the same fuckin' message to every person

223
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:43,747
'cause you're fuckin' lazy.

224
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:44,830
So, anyway...

225
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,961
Real estate, when there's
a new vacation destination

226
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:56,411
or new town or Hudson Yards
is being built right here,

227
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:59,450
the people that buy first,
if they're right, win.

228
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,507
You don't get the beachfront
property by waiting four years

229
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,254
for what's the value of it.

230
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:08,421
I believe that a purebred
salesperson is never crippled

231
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:13,046
if her or his actions are not fruitful.

232
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,209
I believe a purebred
salesperson understands that

233
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:19,344
that's part of the game,
that's part of the hustle.

234
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:22,966
There's so much upside
by doing a new tactic,

235
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:26,389
even if you hit it once
out of every nine times,

236
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:29,503
the overall ROI of all those hours

237
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,920
becomes a net positive score.

238
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,921
That is why I think I've been successful.

239
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:38,969
My career in sales has be
predicated by not being crippled

240
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:43,337
by overworking to learn
something new, period.

241
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:44,587
It is insanity.

242
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,002
Let me use that word aggressively.

243
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:52,342
It is insanity for you to disrespect

244
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:56,547
all the social media platforms
and what they can mean

245
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:57,744
for sales for you.

246
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,870
You have to understand, if one person

247
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,635
executes transactions
through it, then you can too.

248
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:05,651
The problem is, it's hard.

249
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:07,526
The problem is, it takes time.

250
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:11,164
The problem is, there's a lot
of easier ways to do it today

251
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:13,022
but those things go away.

252
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:16,851
Anybody here that's been
doing email sales for 15 years

253
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:20,220
knows what I'm about to say
which was 10 and 15 years ago

254
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,347
it worked better.

255
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:23,180
Right?

256
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,970
Because we play in one
game, my friends, all of us.

257
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,082
You're trying to reach that
person on the other end,

258
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:33,379
we play in the B to B
arbitrage of attention.

259
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,515
It's just supply and demand.

260
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:37,294
How many people, by a show of hands,

261
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,305
this is actually interesting.

262
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:39,342
Let's start with this.

263
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:42,083
Let's establish that lying is the devil.

264
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,754
I have no interest in your head nods.

265
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:45,595
I want full fuckin' hands.

266
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:46,556
Here we go.

267
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:50,723
How many people here, now,
in 2016, actually hate it

268
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:57,732
when another person, another
human being calls them.

269
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:00,558
Raise your hand.

270
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:01,724
Raise it high.

271
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:03,110
I want you to look around.

272
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,008
Look around.

273
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:05,882
Raise it higher, just real high please.

274
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:09,443
These are human beings,
our fellow human beings,

275
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:13,159
who actually hate when another
human being calls them.

276
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,112
Let me tell you why and
then let me tell you

277
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:16,719
why it's important for this conversation.

278
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:20,924
The reason they hate it
is because time has become

279
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:24,106
the number one asset to
every person in this room.

280
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:25,933
The emerging pillar in our society

281
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:29,225
besides the health and wellness
of our family and money,

282
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:32,028
the number one emerging pillar of value

283
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:34,580
to everybody in this room and
everybody in this conference

284
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,841
and everybody outside is time.

285
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,133
Calling somebody when
they weren't expecting it

286
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:44,050
has now become stealing one's time.

287
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,220
Because we have alternative
of when that person calls

288
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,977
you can say, just text me, just email me.

289
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:54,221
I will call you back on my time.

290
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:57,844
It is my belief that when
I audit the sales ecosystem

291
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,734
and all the start-ups I'm involved with

292
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,813
and all the businesses I'm involved with

293
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:05,313
that sales people steal their clients time

294
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,964
for their vested interests
instead of reverse

295
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:12,917
engineering the value
of that person's time.

296
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,083
It is in our best vested
interest to send that email.

297
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,267
It is in our best vested
interest to make that phone call.

298
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:20,950
We are not reverse engineering the fact

299
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,651
that these people have become busy.

300
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:26,258
Now, another thing that's
extremely fascinating for me

301
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:29,866
being in this room, I grew
up in B to C my whole life.

302
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:32,528
Only seven years ago, when
I started VaynerMedia,

303
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,102
did I go into the B to B world.

304
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,551
Just for the people that don't know here,

305
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:38,669
I have a 650 person social-digital agency

306
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,583
that I've grown the last four years

307
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:45,379
from a three to a 100 million
dollar business in sales,

308
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,212
not fuckin' valuation.

309
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:50,924
By the way, that's another conversation

310
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,924
for another fuckin' day.

311
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,294
I think the thing that will be interesting

312
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,853
to a lot of people here is I've done

313
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,933
that mainly on not selling.

314
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,980
Like we don't really do RFPs.

315
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,902
I'm not interested in
selling somebody who--

316
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:05,225
I would tell my number--

317
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:07,619
If somebody said what's your
most religious sales tactic,

318
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:11,179
it is not to try to sell to
somebody who is unsellable.

319
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,754
I think one of the most fascinating things

320
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:14,880
that I've audit when I
look at the sales ecosystem

321
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,826
is how much people take time trying

322
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,684
to convert somebody who's unconvertible.

323
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,293
Yes, your product may
be 8,000 times better,

324
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:25,475
but if that boss's boss
is best friend homies

325
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:30,058
with the alternative legacy
software, you fuckin' lost.

326
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:31,286
Then I watch people think

327
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,004
that they're gonna convert it on merit.

328
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:34,642
There's no fuckin' merit.

329
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,099
There's just human beings
making human decisions.

330
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,525
I think that we need to get a
lot less romantic about that

331
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,501
and start being much more
practical about the ecosystem.

332
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:45,825
Let me tell you another way
that I've grown that business

333
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,471
that I think of instead of pontificating

334
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,212
and cursing up here, let
me give you direct tactic

335
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:53,117
that I think a lot of you guys can use.

336
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,180
Couple books ago, 'cause I decided

337
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,662
to write those kind of things,

338
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,693
I wrote a book called
"The Thank You Economy".

339
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:00,190
Super interesting to me.

340
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,852
It's the notion of if you
provide so much up front value

341
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:06,545
to an individual, can
he actually guilt them

342
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:08,751
into buying shit.

343
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:12,184
Especially if all your
actions are predicated

344
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:15,098
on not expecting them to buy it.

345
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,673
That's the big part.

346
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:20,831
When the energy of your
tactics is to convert,

347
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,060
you will lose.

348
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,391
When your energy is to
disproportionately bring value

349
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:28,092
and let the chips fall where
they may, you will win.

350
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,513
It will change your behavior.

351
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,077
It will change the
energy of the execution.

352
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,771
Let me give you a story.

353
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:38,393
VaynerMedia, there was a
certain CMO that I really wanted

354
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:41,685
to get to because I really
wanted their business.

355
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:44,473
I don't like doing RFPs
because it's a crapshoot

356
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:47,088
and we're not very good at them, right.

357
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:50,112
I have the fortunate
nature of having a brand

358
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:52,097
so a lot of business comes
to me, but this one wasn't

359
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:53,593
and I wanted it.

360
00:15:53,593 --> 00:15:54,868
So I decided to follow--

361
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:57,704
And this is my number one tactic

362
00:15:57,704 --> 00:16:00,192
for every person in this
room that I am positive

363
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,807
that if you actually put
in the work and do it,

364
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:03,832
that you will email me--

365
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,646
This is really the reason I'm giving this

366
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:07,139
is 'cause I want you to
email me in four months

367
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,016
and be like, "Hey man,
I saw you in New York

368
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,940
"at the Sales Machine Conference.

369
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,087
"I thought you were a
little bit ridiculous,

370
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,308
"but I did this thing
and it actually worked.

371
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,615
"Cool, thanks."

372
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,647
That's it, that's what I want.

373
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:19,480
And here's the tactic.

374
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:22,073
How many people here are in B to B sales?

375
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:23,885
Raise your hand.

376
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,333
Awesome.

377
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,807
Coming from B to C and now being in B to B

378
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:29,523
and being part of companies
like Budding Medium,

379
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,524
Perculated, and Wildfire
that we've had successful

380
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,296
exits in and watching
the landscape of sales

381
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:35,367
in that environment.

382
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,241
I've done very well with
my B to B investments.

383
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:41,336
I am stunned how much easier
it is to be a B to B salesman

384
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:42,833
then a B to C salesman.

385
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,274
You literally know the
name of the fuckin' person

386
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:47,353
you're selling to.

387
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:48,725
This is a big deal.

388
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:52,440
It's a big deal because by
knowing the name in 2016,

389
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,504
you have the opportunity to
use big data in your advantage

390
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:59,781
on a micro-level to create
the world that you want.

391
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:01,340
Let me explain.

392
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,923
I found the CMO that I wanted on Twitter.

393
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,686
Some of the people that
you're trying to get to

394
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:06,519
won't be on Twitter.

395
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,641
They may be on LinkedIn.

396
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:08,506
They may be on Facebook.

397
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:09,861
They may be on Instagram.

398
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,326
But the fun part is 60-70%
of your prospects are on

399
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:16,334
one of these platforms and
putting out data publicly

400
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,744
on what they like and what they're in to.

401
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:20,602
I followed this individual and I noticed

402
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:24,839
that he was a humongous St.
Louis Cardinals baseball fan.

403
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,770
This is when my plan went into action.

404
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:30,416
I started watching everything
he was tweeting about.

405
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,786
Ironically, I'm like a cobra in the grass.

406
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,316
I'll tell you the number one thing

407
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:37,173
that really separates good salespeople

408
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:39,580
from bad salespeople is patience.

409
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,802
I'm patient as fuck.

410
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:44,353
So I was staying in the
grass, just waiting.

411
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:46,337
Collecting content, being patient,

412
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:50,827
really mapping what he's
into, paying attention.

413
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:54,229
Ironically, it coincided with
my fantasy baseball league.

414
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,230
So I'm in my fantasy baseball draft.

415
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,009
I've got the team I want.

416
00:17:58,009 --> 00:17:59,726
I've got a couple of empty
slots on the reserve thing.

417
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:00,860
I'm like, "You know what?

418
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,223
"I'm gonna draft this up-and-coming
rookie Cardinals player

419
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:07,239
"for maybe other reasons

420
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:09,774
"than just winning my
fantasy baseball team."

421
00:18:09,774 --> 00:18:10,767
So I drafted--

422
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,035
Any Cardinals fans in here?

423
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:15,053
Any couple, maybe two or three.

424
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,209
I drafted a guy by the
name of Kolten Wong,

425
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,321
infielder for the St. Louis Cardinals

426
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:22,234
before he was even in
major league baseball.

427
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,124
So then I wait.

428
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:27,857
And I wait for Kolten Wong to
get up to the major leagues.

429
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,133
And I wait for Kolten
Wong to do something good.

430
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,212
And then I see what I needed to,

431
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,543
him Tweeting about Kolten Wong

432
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:37,433
which allowed me to jump
into that tweet and say,

433
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:40,457
"Hey, I have Kolten
Wong on my fantasy team.

434
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:41,843
"Isn't he awesome."

435
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:44,064
He replied, "Yeah, he's awesome."

436
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:45,167
That's it.

437
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,458
Patience, remember.

438
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,958
Don't close on the first date.

439
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,724
So we interact a little bit more

440
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:53,489
about the Cardinals, they're
making their playoff run.

441
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:56,689
Somewhere about three weeks
later, he tweets me back

442
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:59,285
and says, "Hey, I seen that you're a CEO

443
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,513
"of a digital agency.

444
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:03,648
"We're thinking about maybe changing up

445
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:04,766
"our roster a little bit.

446
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:06,656
"Is this something we could talk about?"

447
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:08,323
We sure fuckin' can.

448
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:13,089
(audience laughing)

449
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:16,171
I want to give you real data here.

450
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,926
Less than an hour of work,

451
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:23,399
being patient spread off of
probably about four months,

452
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,982
I was able to convert that strategy

453
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:28,786
into a 3.6 million dollar paying client.

454
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:29,619
Right?

455
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,129
Sales, sales, but sales not that look like

456
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:37,638
here's a blank email that I'm gonna blast.

457
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:41,150
Everybody's obsessed with scalability.

458
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,938
Everybody is obsessed with scalability

459
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:48,105
and all the action in sales
is scaling the unscalable.

460
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:51,719
I believe that sales, even
in today's environment,

461
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:55,153
is still a very (spitting)
face-to-face game.

462
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:55,986
Right?

463
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,169
I think a lot of us agree with that.

464
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:58,838
I think the biggest
disconnect from the people

465
00:19:58,838 --> 00:20:00,571
that just heard that in this room,

466
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,689
that have done that their whole lives,

467
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,768
they were like, "Yeah, hell yeah."

468
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:07,251
Is that they don't realize
that technology is now

469
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:11,846
the scalable gateway drug
to the human interactions.

470
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:12,822
I sell--

471
00:20:12,822 --> 00:20:15,106
I'm going to Cleveland
right now after this.

472
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:17,264
There's a basketball game I want to see.

473
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:19,785
I'm gonna sell on that
plane on the way there

474
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:24,689
because I'm using technology,
Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn,

475
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:27,241
and these platforms as a gateway drug

476
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:30,281
to create an interpersonal relationship.

477
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:32,108
There are people I know very well

478
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:34,833
that I've spent very little
time with in real life,

479
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,263
but I do that through those channels

480
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:38,870
and then when we see each other

481
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,444
there's a total different feeling I have

482
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:41,705
for these three individuals.

483
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:44,130
These are people I could never
even have a relationship with

484
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,358
without this technology.

485
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:47,641
These are people that I
haven't even met more than once

486
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:50,177
that I feel enormous kinship towards them,

487
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:51,531
and the dude with the Jets jersey,

488
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:54,448
because I've put in the sales work.

489
00:20:57,438 --> 00:20:59,706
Why do you go golfing with a client?

490
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:02,431
Why do you eat a fuckin'
steak with a client?

491
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:04,195
Why do you go to networking events?

492
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:08,086
You do it to create context at scale.

493
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:10,401
You do it to create context.

494
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:14,565
The absolute closer and
the enabler and the jabbing

495
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:18,732
and the flirter, that
essence of energy is context.

496
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:22,739
If you know that girl's boyfriend.

497
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,117
If you know their
interest in the Cardinals.

498
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,528
You have a leg up on the competition.

499
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:29,827
It's why you spend time with your clients

500
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:32,017
and the decision makers
and the influencers

501
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:35,891
of the decision makers because
you are building context.

502
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:39,278
What technology today does and
these five or six platforms

503
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:42,050
that are the current
state of social media do

504
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,396
all at the finger tip of your phone

505
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:46,917
when you're going to take a
piss or flying to Cleveland

506
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:47,909
or whatever you want.

507
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,744
Ultimately scalable, you
can do it at any time,

508
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:54,319
six p.m., one a.m., whatever
you want, however you roll.

509
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,036
You get up early, you get up late.

510
00:21:56,036 --> 00:22:00,494
You can hustle in these
platforms and create context.

511
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:04,699
The fact of the matter
is, almost nobody does it.

512
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,550
Nobody does it because they lack patience.

513
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,383
They short--

514
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:12,718
You know how many of you in
this room have a point of view

515
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:15,047
on what Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter

516
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,276
can do for your business

517
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:20,168
and you've never used the fuckin' product?

518
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:21,537
It's real, thanks for that one clap.

519
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:22,419
I liked it.

520
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:25,065
(audience laughing)

521
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:29,617
So we live in 2016 in a world
where the majority of you,

522
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:31,271
when you live like a normal human being

523
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,358
and don't put on your
sales outfit for the day,

524
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:36,705
would never convert on the actions

525
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:40,879
that you take as a sales
person during the work day.

526
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:44,250
The amount of you that
delete every fucking email

527
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,864
that you get that is a bulk email.

528
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:49,732
The amount of you that will
never answer that phone.

529
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:51,510
The amount of you that nev--

530
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,692
Who here is super fired up to go home

531
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:58,929
and go through their
direct mail carefully?

532
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:02,846
I'm fascinated by the
disconnect of who you are

533
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:06,442
as a human being and how you act

534
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:09,860
when it's in your vested
financial interest

535
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,963
for another human being
to act the way you want

536
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:16,255
because it's more convenient for you.

537
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:18,161
That is the arbitrage.

538
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:22,414
And that will always be
the arbitrage forever.

539
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:25,359
So many of you have done business
because of word of mouth.

540
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,192
Right?

541
00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:27,391
How many people here
have landed more business

542
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:29,811
because of word-of-mouth
from a prior transaction?

543
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:31,670
Raise your hands.

544
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,709
If you didn't raise your hand,

545
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,395
you just don't fuckin'
understand it or your lazy

546
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:35,907
and that's fuckin' interesting too.

547
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:39,530
(audience laughing)

548
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,734
When I think about social
media, all I think about it

549
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:46,147
as the plumbing of
word-of-mouth in our society.

550
00:23:46,147 --> 00:23:49,232
I'm fascinated by how much business I do

551
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:52,510
with somebody after I actually sell them

552
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,997
and what I do with them to
create that word of mouth

553
00:23:54,997 --> 00:23:58,163
versus what I did to get
them in the first place.

554
00:23:58,163 --> 00:24:00,857
The enormous amount of
energy that we all deploy

555
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,234
as salespeople to get the business

556
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,392
versus what we do with that business.

557
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:07,834
Even if it's hand it off
to an account person.

558
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,866
If you were that point of reference,

559
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,386
you're ability to stay in
that ecosystem and bring value

560
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:14,339
is incredible.

561
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:17,205
Again, I implore you
to understand the value

562
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,734
of public data.

563
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,939
Let me give you a B to C scenario,

564
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:22,813
but you can deploy this in your own world.

565
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:25,289
Wine Library, before "Thank You Economy",

566
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:27,307
I wanted an example for my keynotes

567
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:30,532
about how I was doing
the "Thank You Economy".

568
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:34,202
I was very passionate about
having somebody buy something

569
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:36,313
on Wine Library that was inexpensive

570
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:39,037
and then overwhelming them with a gift

571
00:24:39,037 --> 00:24:40,392
based on their big data.

572
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:44,062
I love sports, so no question
this is another sports story.

573
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:46,976
Guy buys a case of Pinot Grigio for $111.

574
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:50,226
We made 17 bucks in profit on the case.

575
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:54,394
We had to find people with unusual names

576
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:55,702
because we had to find them on Twitter

577
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,245
and this was still 2011.

578
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,459
So finally we found one.

579
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:00,175
They were having a tough time
finding people on Twitter

580
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,563
that were buying wine for the first time.

581
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:03,703
I wanted a first time customer.

582
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:04,916
Guy buys a case of
Pinot Grigio in Chicago.

583
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,570
We made 11 bucks.

584
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,688
They find him.

585
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:09,184
He has an unusual name
like Vaynerchuk, you know.

586
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:11,122
We find him, it's definitely him.

587
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:13,925
We look and we find his Twitter.

588
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:17,879
His whole Twitter stream
is about J Cutler,

589
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,800
the quarterback of the Chicago Bears.

590
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,714
Just tons of J Cutler.

591
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:22,478
I love you, J Cutler this, da, da, da.

592
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:23,439
Great.

593
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,872
I tell the Thank You department

594
00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:26,951
which is something we have at Wine Library

595
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:29,772
which is not customer
service, it's offense.

596
00:25:29,772 --> 00:25:31,345
Customer service is defense.

597
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:34,070
The Thank You department kicks in

598
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:38,606
and we go and buy him a $350
jersey signed by J Cutler

599
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,402
and we send it to him.

600
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:44,293
ROI negative on that transaction,
I think we can all agree.

601
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,447
So now I'm pumped.

602
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,711
We finally found somebody, we sent it.

603
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:49,378
You know my keynotes are coming up.

604
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,449
I'm gonna have a great case study.

605
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,380
He's gonna buy a lot of wine.

606
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,245
He's gonna do something.

607
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:53,143
It's gonna be unbelievable.

608
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:54,938
I can't wait to tell all of you.

609
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:59,105
Three weeks go by, mother
fucker didn't get back to us.

610
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:01,727
I'm like, "What the fuck?"

611
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:06,420
Ungrateful asshole! (laughing)

612
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,885
Nothing.

613
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:09,130
I'm like calling four times a day.

614
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,492
I'm like, "Your sure, I know it's in spam.

615
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:13,824
"Get the I.T. department,
this is impossible."

616
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:14,657
Nothing.

617
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:18,801
I'm boarding a plane to
Orlando, I get a phone call.

618
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:19,761
"Gary."

619
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,594
I'm like, "Yeah."

620
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:21,478
They're like, "We got something."

621
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:23,653
I'm like, "Finally, what did he do?"

622
00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:24,660
"Better."

623
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,109
"Okay, better?"

624
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,322
They're like, "Listen to this."

625
00:26:27,322 --> 00:26:28,346
I'm like, "Okay?"

626
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:32,513
"We just got an order from
Plano, Texas for $6,000

627
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:35,623
"worth of red burgundy."

628
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:37,166
I'm like, "Great."

629
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,308
"Now, that's great, but wait 'til you hear

630
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,883
"the note in the order."

631
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,317
I'm like, "Cool."

632
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,978
"Dear Wine Library, first of
all, what a great red burgundy

633
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,129
"selection you have.

634
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:47,798
"Make sure you don't
ship this, it's hot here.

635
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:49,278
"Hold it for awhile.

636
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:51,940
"Ship it when it's cooler."

637
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,023
Next, "P.S. You sent my friend, John,

638
00:26:58,136 --> 00:27:00,987
"a Bears jersey the other day

639
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:03,618
"when he bought some wine from you.

640
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:07,118
"P.S.S. I'm a huge Bruce Springsteen fan."

641
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:11,264
(audience laughing)

642
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:20,196
For very little money and
for a solid amount of effort

643
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:22,928
you could go home from this conference

644
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:24,739
and go through your entire
Rolodex of everybody

645
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:28,315
that you sold something
to in the last year.

646
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,055
Go on social media, look at their data,

647
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:33,513
and do something that shows effort.

648
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:36,371
Let me tell you what's not effort.

649
00:27:36,371 --> 00:27:39,298
The at scale, hand written
note, that wasn't hand written,

650
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:42,298
it was just a tactic to fake effort.

651
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:45,812
What about actual effort?

652
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:48,332
What about actually sending
me something about the Jets,

653
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,306
or root beer, or Lionel Richie

654
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:51,676
because it's very easy to figure out

655
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:54,386
I like those three things.

656
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:56,449
What people are underestimating is

657
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:59,174
the word-of-mouth ecosystem
that we actually live in

658
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:03,001
because this thing has
changed our behavior.

659
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,293
I don't know if you've noticed,

660
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:07,254
but we now have all defaulted
into this amazing notion

661
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:09,979
that we should tell the world
everything about everything,

662
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,152
always about everything.

663
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,271
It's what we do.

664
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:15,792
For some reason, everybody
needs to know our two cents

665
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:18,752
on the game last night, on
where the world's going.

666
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:19,585
This is what we do.

667
00:28:19,585 --> 00:28:20,478
We share now.

668
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:23,912
You may not like it, it's the
reality of the marketplace.

669
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:26,211
One thing that people
share more than anything

670
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:29,157
is when they are caught
off-guard or that they can feel

671
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:32,755
that somebody gave them
more effort than the market.

672
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:36,922
My belief is that the
greatest version of a person

673
00:28:37,836 --> 00:28:40,860
in the world is a purebred sales person.

674
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,264
Let me tell you why.

675
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:44,781
My definition, one man's definition,

676
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:49,192
of a purebred salesperson
is one that is obsessed

677
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:52,673
with providing more
value to the other person

678
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:55,807
than they ask for in return.

679
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:57,666
When you make that mental shift,

680
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:02,375
and more importantly, when your
actions start speaking that,

681
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:05,125
things start to massively unlock.

682
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:09,715
I have built both of my
very large businesses

683
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,487
on one backbone, which is I want to know

684
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:15,196
what this person's
gonna say at my funeral.

685
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:18,189
I have no interest in selling
in something I don't believe.

686
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,914
I know for fact that there's
a staggering percentage

687
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:24,033
of people here as they
become educated in the market

688
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:26,080
they sell in that they
actually do not believe

689
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,143
that their product is the best.

690
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,923
I could not function in that environment.

691
00:29:29,923 --> 00:29:30,774
I'm not judging you.

692
00:29:30,774 --> 00:29:32,443
We all have our different
paths and different things,

693
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:35,058
loans, mortgages, respect.

694
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:36,444
Not trying to go there.

695
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:38,838
But I would tell you that
when you fully believe

696
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:41,106
in what you sell, through and through,

697
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:42,949
it gets a hell of a lot easier.

698
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,036
When you actually give a fuck

699
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:45,753
about the other person more than you,

700
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:48,336
it gets triple easy my friends.

701
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:52,479
So, I implore all of you to understand

702
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,636
that we're living
through a marketplace now

703
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:57,707
where our consumers have
more information than ever.

704
00:29:57,707 --> 00:29:58,920
You're not gonna win a deal

705
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,543
on inefficiency of
information of our consumer.

706
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:06,308
I implore you to start
producing two things.

707
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:09,080
One, leading with the heart
and reverse engineering

708
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,742
what your end consumer,
whether they bought from you

709
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:13,443
or they're your prospect.

710
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:15,349
What makes them tick above and beyond

711
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:19,451
being the decision maker
of your fuckin' product.

712
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,728
And number two, start
thinking about the people

713
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:24,343
you've sold to after you sold to them

714
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:26,564
and understand what they
can mean to your business

715
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:28,769
by you actually caring about them as well

716
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,344
because they're still valuable to you

717
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:32,722
even though you hooked up.

718
00:30:32,722 --> 00:30:33,888
Got it?

719
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:34,721
Cool.

720
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:38,943
I'd like to spend the rest
of my time very honestly

721
00:30:38,943 --> 00:30:40,629
with you on Q&A.

722
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:42,755
I know that the mics are back there,

723
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:45,118
so if you guys can start
lining up, I'll wait for people

724
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:46,536
to get back there.

725
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:47,764
Please don't be shy.

726
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,702
This is why I don't like
the mics that stand.

727
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:50,867
I like to move it around.

728
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,190
I find people are lazy and don't just want

729
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,718
to walk back there, but please go there.

730
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,214
I'd love to get far more detailed.

731
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:59,231
Those are my fundamental
principles on sales.

732
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:03,153
I think it's stunning how many
people have not recognized

733
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,949
that technology doesn't
replace the way we all sold.

734
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:10,178
Technology is enabling the
scale of how we old sold.

735
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:12,162
I think that's probably--

736
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,390
If you ask me what I wanted

737
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,950
to leave with more than
anything, it's that.

738
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,738
I'm, I fly all around the
country to close my deals.

739
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:21,061
I want to be in the goddamn room.

740
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:22,621
I don't even like Skype.

741
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:24,149
I lose the context.

742
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,023
I need to feel the energy.

743
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:29,535
The amount of work that I do
to get on third and a half base

744
00:31:29,535 --> 00:31:32,323
through Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram is remarkable.

745
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,426
The context I have on the
levers that I need to pull

746
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:39,915
in that room, shit's sold
before I fucking got there.

747
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:41,065
You like that?

748
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:41,900
Thanks.

749
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,002
(audience laughing)

750
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:43,835
That was a good way to end.

751
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:44,688
Thank you.

752
00:31:44,688 --> 00:31:47,855
(audience applauding)

753
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:52,500
Alright, the good part.

754
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,044
What's your name, my man?

755
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:54,881
- My name's Shawn.

756
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:55,714
Can you hear me?

757
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:56,820
- [Gary] Clearly.

758
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,182
- Well you inspired me
to leave my corporate job

759
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:03,041
to create my own business
because according to you I'm 25.

760
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,373
I'd be fuckin' stupid to
stay at my corporate job.

761
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:06,223
- [Gary] I believe that.

762
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:07,530
- So I followed what you said.

763
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,255
- [Gary] Do you have the
chops to pull it off?

764
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:11,483
- Well I've been doin' it a year

765
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:13,358
and I've been making more
money working for myself,

766
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:15,878
taking Tuesday off, and
working on a Saturday

767
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:17,501
because I took the risk.

768
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,367
- [Gary] Mazeltov!

769
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:19,200
- Thank you.

770
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,033
- [Gary] Good for you.

771
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,455
- But Jill Reiley turned me on too.

772
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:22,635
She's standing right over there.

773
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:23,470
- [Gary] I see, I see.

774
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,809
- So I got to give her the credit.

775
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,786
- [Gary] Are you willing to
kick her a little commission?

776
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:28,873
- Everything's negotiable.

777
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:31,881
She made me read one of your
books before I worked for her.

778
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:32,714
- [Gary] Go ahead.

779
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:37,441
- Right now, I help sales
and marketing work together

780
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:41,253
and one of the things is
sales managers they want KPIs,

781
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:42,086
- [Gary] Yes.

782
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,363
- Like calls, touches,
that don't make sense.

783
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:44,196
- [Gary] Yes.

784
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,120
- One thing I advocate for,
like with social selling,

785
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,412
is use LinkedIn touches,
okay, instead of call metrics.

786
00:32:49,412 --> 00:32:50,245
- [Gary] Yes.

787
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:51,078
- And they're against it.

788
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:53,255
What you're talking about is
even pushing that further.

789
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:54,088
Right.

790
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,027
Using LinkedIn, Twitter, other tools,

791
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:59,965
but corporate sales people
and even marketing managers

792
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:02,264
and directors, VPs.

793
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:03,383
They don't want to go that way.

794
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:05,277
They still want 150 calls a day.

795
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:07,667
So how do you incentivize them or say,

796
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:10,391
hey you got to abandon all the KPIs, allow

797
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:12,062
people to use LinkedIn.
- There's only one way.

798
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:13,321
- There's only one way.

799
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:17,416
The CEO of that company has
to change the incentives.

800
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:20,708
Let me tell you how quickly you
can get a sales force to do.

801
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,677
Every single thing that
is wrong at VaynerMedia is

802
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:27,229
one billion percent my fault.

803
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:28,062
Right?

804
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:29,579
It's run from the top.

805
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,734
You can get a sales force to get involved

806
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:35,958
in social tomorrow, make
the KPIs around that.

807
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,887
If you actually incentivize
the behavior, they will do it.

808
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:42,087
One thing I love about
us, me being a salesman,

809
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,836
is though we're fuckin' easy.

810
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:45,363
We are reverse engineering how we get

811
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:47,930
our fuckin' bonuses and our money.

812
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,907
We are blindly--

813
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:51,727
If tomorrow your company said
if you send out a thousand

814
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:53,679
Tweets that are not automated, by hand,

815
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,444
and that's how you make your bonus,

816
00:33:55,444 --> 00:33:57,258
you're sending a thousand
tweets not by hand

817
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:59,239
and that's how you're
making your fuckin' bonus.

818
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,547
So the answer to your question, my man,

819
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:01,649
is it's not in the middle,

820
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:02,988
it's not in the upper middle,

821
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:05,225
it's the gal and the guy at the top

822
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:07,020
that has to change all the rules

823
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,337
to the behavior of the sales organization

824
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:11,556
and it happens really fuckin' quick.

825
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,462
I'll tell you, this is
gonna throw you for a loop,

826
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:16,659
I have forced some of my start-ups

827
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,173
to add more calling in
as a KPI 'cause they want

828
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:22,929
to go completely automated and technology

829
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:25,889
and they disrespect the phone.

830
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,858
Do I think the phone is
losing in conversion?

831
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:28,692
Yes I do.

832
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,473
I think it's behavior in the market.

833
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:31,466
Do I think it's zero?

834
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:32,599
Absolutely not.

835
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,851
Do I think it's silly
to just have one move?

836
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:35,684
Yes I do.

837
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:38,043
- [Shawn] Awesome, thank you so much.

838
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:38,876
- Thank you brother, thank you.

839
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:39,982
My man over here.

840
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:40,815
- Hi Gary.

841
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:41,726
- [Gary] How are you man?

842
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:42,909
- Great man.

843
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,168
Big fan of your SnapChat channel.

844
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,393
- [Gary] Thank you brother.

845
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:46,823
- I watch all the time.
- Thank you man.

846
00:34:46,824 --> 00:34:48,871
- So I'm from Gainesville, Florida.

847
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:50,446
Big tech scene there.

848
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:51,280
- [Gary] Yep.

849
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,841
- John Spence, speaker,
he's from there too.

850
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:53,880
- [Gary] Yep.

851
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,250
- He'll attest to it.

852
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:58,751
I like using business as a force for good.

853
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:04,229
That's like what I've
been doing my entire life.

854
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:07,852
Here's the thing that we're doing now.

855
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:09,711
We do microfinance loans
- Okay.

856
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:10,892
for needy entrepreneurs
- Yes

857
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:12,089
in East Africa
- Okay

858
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:13,884
through cultural tourisms

859
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:15,255
and we do it at zero percent interest.

860
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:16,231
- [Gary] I love it.

861
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:17,869
- So that's taken off as number one two

862
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:20,736
in Tripadvisor dot com and
Lonely Planet Guidebook now.

863
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:21,681
- [Gary] Yep.

864
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:22,956
- So we're getting all the tourists.

865
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:26,343
The other thing we do, we have a site

866
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:28,013
called Saganet dot org.
- Okay.

867
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:30,596
We do e-mentoring for
K through 12 students

868
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,864
to get them interested in STEM fields

869
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:33,697
- [Gary] Yes.

870
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:35,274
- by partnering them with--

871
00:35:35,274 --> 00:35:37,258
partnering students, teachers,
classrooms, and families

872
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:41,149
with NASA scientist or other
career scientists virtually

873
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,173
around the world.

874
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,212
- [Gary] Okay.

875
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:44,614
- That's taken off and that's partnership

876
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:46,331
with the Carl Sagan
Foundation as well (mumbling).

877
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:49,891
So here's my new business
idea and I want your blessing

878
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,970
or your criticism on it.

879
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,301
So I just acquired my dream house.

880
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:55,214
- [Gary] You did.

881
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:56,128
- Right before coming here.

882
00:35:56,128 --> 00:35:58,067
I was in Montreal, flew down
to Gainesville, Florida,

883
00:35:58,067 --> 00:35:59,770
signed a piece of paper,
and flew right back up here

884
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,795
to see you actually.
- Amazing.

885
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:02,018
- [Gary] Thank you, congratulations.

886
00:36:02,018 --> 00:36:03,075
- Thanks to John.

887
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:03,908
Thank you.

888
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,436
It's a beautiful Victorian from 1903.

889
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:06,995
I'm gonna turn into
- 1903 is a great year.

890
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:08,176
It is, was, right?

891
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:09,404
(audience laughing)

892
00:36:09,404 --> 00:36:10,885
If you have some wine from 1903,

893
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,224
I'd love to stock it in there.
- I wish.

894
00:36:12,224 --> 00:36:13,909
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna turn it

895
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,742
into a boutique hotel.

896
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,605
10,000 per night to stay there

897
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:23,470
and it's going to be a
donation to my 501(c)3.

898
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,534
Everything gets donated in,
your fee for staying there

899
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:31,015
becomes 100% donated to
a 501(c)3 tax write off

900
00:36:31,015 --> 00:36:34,165
and then I use it entirely, I
don't take any salary from it,

901
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:35,378
to do good in the world.

902
00:36:35,378 --> 00:36:36,370
- [Gary] Okay.

903
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,386
- On top of that, we have, I have buddies

904
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:39,961
that have car rental
companies for exotic cars.

905
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:43,521
I have other friends that
have jet leasing companies.

906
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:45,710
What we're gonna do is
bizspoke sort of system

907
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,057
where we're gonna have the
billion dollar package.

908
00:36:48,057 --> 00:36:52,224
For one billion dollars,
watch for this on Indiegogo.

909
00:36:53,192 --> 00:36:55,775
For one billion dollars you
can buy a room in the house

910
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:57,838
and you can give it to
your kin and for that

911
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,724
we'll fly you from wherever you
are in the world to us for--

912
00:37:00,724 --> 00:37:02,958
And then we'll show you what
we're doing with your money.

913
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:06,095
And then we'll take you anywhere
in the world you want to go

914
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:07,496
to see it in action.

915
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:09,558
Then we'll bring you
also back to Gainesville

916
00:37:09,558 --> 00:37:11,952
and we'll put you in touch
with thought leaders,

917
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:14,173
scientists, anything that can
make this happen in the world

918
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:15,480
and make that happen.

919
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,654
Again, it's a billion dollar
donation to a 501(c)3.

920
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:21,821
- Anybody who doesn't think
that cool, is being silly.

921
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:23,598
I love it.

922
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:24,691
- [Man] Sweet, so that's a blessing?

923
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:26,709
- Cool, it's a blessing and I'll take a--

924
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:29,792
When the Ranger's schedule comes out,

925
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:32,015
this is in Montreal right?

926
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,641
- [Man] Oh no, this gonna
be in Gainesville, Florida.

927
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:35,874
I'm from Montreal originally
- Oh, the house is in Florida?

928
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:37,497
So go haves, this is in Gainesville.

929
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,426
- Got it.

930
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,978
Well I don't want to go there,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

931
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:42,757
I'll also take a night
in the $10,000 hotel.

932
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,174
Cheers, cool man.

933
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:46,210
Yes dear.

934
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,719
- [Brown haired Woman] Hi

935
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,805
- Hey.

936
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:50,065
- Thank you for the talk, Gary.

937
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:51,326
I have a question.

938
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:55,137
Just like you and Beyonce, we
all have 24 hours in a day.

939
00:37:55,137 --> 00:37:57,216
Knowing that time is valuable

940
00:37:57,216 --> 00:37:59,579
and if you do your due
diligence with clients

941
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:02,241
how do you, with your inbound leads,

942
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:06,226
vet and qualify them
to know how you can get

943
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:07,911
killer clients on your roster.

944
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,297
I own a digital marketing agency.

945
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:10,289
- [Gary] Intuitively.

946
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:13,581
- Yeah, my other question
in case you answered

947
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:15,456
that really quick.

948
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:19,253
Can you tell us a story if
you did your due diligence

949
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:22,496
and you sent the $350 jersey and all that

950
00:38:22,496 --> 00:38:25,096
and you get to the very end
and then you lost business?

951
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,229
Or a big client--

952
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,041
- [Gary] Like lost as
a in we didn't get it?

953
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:30,514
- You closed and lost
and then any business

954
00:38:30,514 --> 00:38:31,585
that you--

955
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:33,191
- [Gary] Closed, had it, and then lost it?

956
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:34,703
- You pitched it and you got really far

957
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,231
and then it was a close loss.

958
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,334
- [Gary] Happens all the time.

959
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:38,200
- Yeah.

960
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,657
- [Gary] Just fundamentally
not crippled by it.

961
00:38:40,657 --> 00:38:42,752
Like I've never thought
- Just moved to the end

962
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:44,690
about that in my entire life.

963
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,563
I think the biggest reason people lose

964
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:48,502
is they spend all their fuckin'
time thinking about that

965
00:38:48,502 --> 00:38:50,502
and I don't give a fuck.

966
00:38:52,014 --> 00:38:54,266
- [Brown-Haired Woman] Perfect.

967
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,510
- I mean it's the truth, by the way.

968
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,786
On a very serious gig and I think

969
00:38:56,786 --> 00:38:58,188
a lot of you are getting it.

970
00:38:58,188 --> 00:39:03,134
Dwelling on a loss,
microanalyzing why it happened,

971
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:06,993
it happened because of
750,000 different random

972
00:39:06,993 --> 00:39:09,213
shit things that you
couldn't of controlled

973
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,686
or because you fucked up.

974
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:14,049
Neither one of them's really
that valuable to think about.

975
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:16,254
I'm just on to the next one.

976
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,087
- [Brown-Haired Woman] Thanks.

977
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:19,136
- You're welcome.

978
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:19,969
It's true.

979
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:23,342
Again, there's some
things that I believe in,

980
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:26,067
like in purebred sales and
purebred entrepreneurship

981
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:29,799
that have clearly gone awry
in the last half decade

982
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:30,799
to a decade.

983
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,942
If you're a sales person,
and you guys all know this,

984
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:34,997
this is why you're here.

985
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,659
I mean if you're here, you're
not scared of the loss.

986
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:39,061
You're not crippled by the loss.

987
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:41,250
Now, some of you are more
crippled than others.

988
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,235
I think the most successful of the bunch

989
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:44,983
are just literally unphased.

990
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,771
It's insane to me how I was scared

991
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:49,567
that I was gonna have
to recall one for you.

992
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,157
That's how little I remember them.

993
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:54,040
And they happen every fucking month.

994
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,710
We lose pitches all the time.

995
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,852
I'm like they're just
stupid fuckin' people

996
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:59,175
'cause we're the best.

997
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:00,939
(audience laughing)

998
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:02,606
That's what I think.

999
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:04,955
- Hi Gary.
- Hey man.

1000
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:08,074
My name is Steven Wolkins
and thanks for the talk.

1001
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,437
I can relate to you in
a lot of ways just being

1002
00:40:10,437 --> 00:40:12,959
because I came from a B to C world

1003
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,547
and now I'm in a B to B world.

1004
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:16,580
There's a lot of different things

1005
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,706
and I think a lot of the
themes that we've talked about

1006
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:20,123
in this conference as a whole

1007
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:21,242
and one of the things
you brought up is just

1008
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:22,770
kind of caring about that other person

1009
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,203
on the other side of the table.

1010
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:25,085
Right?

1011
00:40:25,085 --> 00:40:27,148
One of the things I keep
trying to think about

1012
00:40:27,148 --> 00:40:30,960
is how do we teach that
to other people as well

1013
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,422
because I genuinely am
interested in people.

1014
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:35,654
I genuinely love to help people

1015
00:40:35,654 --> 00:40:37,449
and that's kind of my philosophy on sales.

1016
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:39,875
But we're all incentivized on that dollar.

1017
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,505
Like how we make our own
money which is necessary

1018
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:44,427
and I completely get that.
- As we should be.

1019
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:47,719
But how do you then teach someone empathy

1020
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:50,822
and actually caring,
genuinely asking how are you

1021
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:52,313
and actually caring what the answer is.

1022
00:40:52,313 --> 00:40:56,109
- [Gary] I don't know other
than telling every sales person

1023
00:40:56,109 --> 00:41:00,630
in this room go reverse engineer
the 500 best sales people

1024
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,488
you've every heard of or know.

1025
00:41:02,488 --> 00:41:05,386
Everyone of them has
the same fuckin' shtick

1026
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:07,827
which is they play a
marathon instead of a sprint,

1027
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:09,749
they deploy empathy and gratitude,

1028
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:11,182
they're more patient.

1029
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,577
I don't know how to teach those things.

1030
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:15,798
When it's so in everybody's face.

1031
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:19,548
It is so in everybody's
face, it's just hard.

1032
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:22,523
It's hard to be patient because

1033
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:25,453
you want a new fuckin' watch.

1034
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:26,703
It's just real.

1035
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:31,501
I don't know and very
honest with you, I do it.

1036
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:33,501
I put out content and scale

1037
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:35,013
but I really don't give
a fuck if any of you

1038
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:36,935
take it an go use it.

1039
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:38,872
I really don't.

1040
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,093
I can't come to your
house and make you do it.

1041
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:45,260
By the way, it's called
meritocracy and capitalism.

1042
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,859
The people that do it win

1043
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:50,686
and the ones that still think
that there's some fuckin'

1044
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:53,066
short-term system that they're
gonna be the one person

1045
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:55,317
that's gonna figure it
out and crush in sales,

1046
00:41:55,317 --> 00:41:57,128
they don't win as much.

1047
00:41:57,128 --> 00:41:58,461
As it should be.

1048
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:00,544
Cool.

1049
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:04,405
(audience applauding)

1050
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,869
- [Red Shirt Man] Hey
Gary, is D-Rock here?

1051
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:06,800
- D-Rock is here.

1052
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,854
He's right there.

1053
00:42:07,854 --> 00:42:09,791
- D-Rock, you're the man.
- Stand up D-Rock.

1054
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,791
(audience cheering)

1055
00:42:13,902 --> 00:42:17,147
The little plug for D-Rock is
he's been shootin' Gary live

1056
00:42:17,147 --> 00:42:19,714
unto they call Daily V.

1057
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:21,322
It's super bad ass.

1058
00:42:21,322 --> 00:42:23,069
- I appreciate it brother,
let's talk about it.

1059
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:23,969
We talked about sales today.

1060
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:25,904
I believe in marketing and branding.

1061
00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:28,095
I put out a daily Vlog
two-three times a week

1062
00:42:28,095 --> 00:42:29,102
that follows me around.

1063
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:30,503
It shows the stories of
being an entrepreneur.

1064
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:31,336
People watch it.

1065
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:32,173
They like it.

1066
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,717
And then they want to do business with me.

1067
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,654
It's not super complicated like.

1068
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:37,245
So if you put out content.

1069
00:42:37,245 --> 00:42:39,261
It's one thing to do surprise and delight,

1070
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:41,261
the Jets jersey and things of that nature.

1071
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:43,214
What about if you actually put out videos

1072
00:42:43,214 --> 00:42:46,176
or audios or written
articles about your stories

1073
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:48,727
and how you were a good sales
person or your best things.

1074
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:51,231
How do you bring value?

1075
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:52,901
I bring value to people in my ecosystem.

1076
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:56,445
I want zero in return because
I know the network effect

1077
00:42:56,445 --> 00:42:58,028
creates the return.

1078
00:43:00,084 --> 00:43:02,147
- I run a D.J. entertainment agency.

1079
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:03,974
We do events all over the city

1080
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:06,904
and also digital marketing consulting.

1081
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:09,865
You inspire me to actually
film kind of a day in the life.

1082
00:43:09,865 --> 00:43:11,913
I just shot it on Sunday.
- Love it.

1083
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:14,338
I like to think I live a very interesting

1084
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,197
life worth sharing.

1085
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:19,205
- [Gary] I think, just so you
know, I think reality T.V.

1086
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:23,474
and voyeurism and human
behavior proves we all do.

1087
00:43:23,474 --> 00:43:26,545
Everybody, the whole 15
minutes of fame thing

1088
00:43:26,545 --> 00:43:29,743
is now that everybody's
famous to 15 people.

1089
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:32,357
The market's gonna decide
how interesting you are.

1090
00:43:32,357 --> 00:43:35,649
You're gonna be interesting
to a million people or 74.

1091
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:38,107
But it's clearly got an opportunity.

1092
00:43:38,107 --> 00:43:39,082
- [D.J.] It sounds like you answered it

1093
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:40,059
before I even asked the question.

1094
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:41,004
- That's what I like to do.

1095
00:43:41,004 --> 00:43:42,359
- [D.J.] Pretty much--

1096
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:43,902
- Times invaluable.

1097
00:43:43,902 --> 00:43:46,722
- [D.J.] What advice
would you give to somebody

1098
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,635
that really hasn't created
a lot of video content,

1099
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:51,352
has some following online--
- Just live it.

1100
00:43:51,352 --> 00:43:52,394
- Just live it.

1101
00:43:52,394 --> 00:43:55,133
Nobody wants anything that's manipulated.

1102
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,912
Just do you.

1103
00:43:56,912 --> 00:43:57,889
You may think it's interesting.

1104
00:43:57,889 --> 00:43:58,786
I may not.

1105
00:43:58,786 --> 00:43:59,716
It doesn't matter.

1106
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:02,078
The easiest thing to do is to be yourself,

1107
00:44:02,078 --> 00:44:03,733
it's also the hardest thing to do.

1108
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:04,615
Right?

1109
00:44:04,615 --> 00:44:07,166
So I would tell you as
somebody who loses--

1110
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:08,804
You know how I've lost business?

1111
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:10,380
I cursed at a board meeting

1112
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,576
and somebody was very conservative

1113
00:44:11,576 --> 00:44:14,128
and said, "Let's not give
business to that fuck face."

1114
00:44:14,128 --> 00:44:15,136
(audience laughing)

1115
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:16,270
Right?

1116
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:19,437
But that's okay because I win net-net.

1117
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:22,114
I will tell you that it's really--

1118
00:44:22,114 --> 00:44:25,028
The one thing I can't do is not be myself.

1119
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:26,681
It's been the thing that is absolutely

1120
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:29,705
separated me from the pack.

1121
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:30,698
- [D.J.] Awesome, thank you.

1122
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:31,753
- You got it.

1123
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:32,871
I'm gonna sneak one more in.

1124
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:33,704
Let's do it.

1125
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,762
Last question, I'm so sorry.

1126
00:44:34,762 --> 00:44:36,163
They're like buzzing me here.

1127
00:44:36,163 --> 00:44:37,093
Go ahead, darlin'.

1128
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:38,149
But you hit me up on Twitter.

1129
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:39,064
I promise I'll answer it.

1130
00:44:39,064 --> 00:44:40,243
- Hi Gary.

1131
00:44:40,243 --> 00:44:42,007
I work for a nonprofit
and I know you've done

1132
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:44,023
a lot of work with nonprofits as well.

1133
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:46,856
We rely tremendously on volunteers

1134
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,158
and we're trying to monetize
with that volunteering.

1135
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:54,151
We're showing companies
there's a value to that.

1136
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:57,049
Translate to charitable contributions.

1137
00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:01,160
How do we honor, do you have
any ideas of how we can honor

1138
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,318
that contribution of volunteering

1139
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:07,485
but also surprise and delight
those potential customers.

1140
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:11,336
Essentially these corporations
that have these charitable

1141
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:14,044
contributions to give in
a way that makes sense

1142
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,509
for a nonprofit.

1143
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:17,635
- [Gary] I want to make sure
I'm following this right.

1144
00:45:17,635 --> 00:45:18,974
Give me a little bit more context.

1145
00:45:18,974 --> 00:45:20,171
Like go a little more detail.

1146
00:45:20,171 --> 00:45:21,117
What do you guys do?

1147
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:24,014
- Sure, we sell opportunities
for employee engagement.

1148
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:28,015
So team building, volunteering,
but a lot of companies

1149
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:30,251
they say, "Well we're
already giving our time.

1150
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:33,355
"Why do you also want to have
a charitable contribution?"

1151
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,938
Whereas the reality is there's a cost

1152
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:38,442
to running these events
and there's also a value

1153
00:45:38,442 --> 00:45:39,497
to these companies.

1154
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:41,230
- [Gary] I see and what
those employees are doing

1155
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,388
is actually something charitable?

1156
00:45:43,388 --> 00:45:44,348
- Yes.

1157
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:47,294
- [Gary] Right, so you're not
taking them to softball games.

1158
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:48,538
That group is team building around

1159
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,507
doing something charitable.
- Exactly.

1160
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:51,421
So the organization almost thinks

1161
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:53,121
you're almost double dipping.
- Yes.

1162
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:54,303
Yes.

1163
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,053
Challenging for sure.

1164
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:03,376
I think, as I think about that,

1165
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:06,274
I reverse engineer, I think
one of the things you need

1166
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:07,738
to think a whole lot about

1167
00:46:07,738 --> 00:46:12,085
is the ROI of a cohesive
unit and retention.

1168
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:13,692
Something I'm very passionate about is

1169
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:16,149
emotional intelligence versus IQ, right.

1170
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:17,567
I think one thing to really--

1171
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:21,126
Businesses are funny, they like money.

1172
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:24,749
So the first place I would
go is to run a report

1173
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:27,978
or analyze what actually
happens to the retention

1174
00:46:27,978 --> 00:46:30,971
of their employees if
they actually do this.

1175
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:33,192
If you told me as the CEO of VaynerMedia

1176
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:35,428
that if on top of giving you my people

1177
00:46:35,428 --> 00:46:37,855
during their work hours to build a home,

1178
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:39,414
that I have to give you $10,000

1179
00:46:39,414 --> 00:46:42,081
but you're gonna save me $27,000

1180
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:45,997
because 2.7 of my employees are gonna stay

1181
00:46:45,997 --> 00:46:47,667
for a year longer and I'm not gonna have

1182
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:50,281
to spend money on recruiting
and replacement costs.

1183
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:53,889
Because when that's the ethos, go there.

1184
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:55,558
The biggest problem is people get too--

1185
00:46:55,558 --> 00:46:57,275
The reason I've been successful
on the boards and NGO

1186
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:00,944
and you know of my work is
because I've brought business DNA

1187
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,819
to the nonprofit sector.

1188
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,008
Let's eliminate the romance.

1189
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:06,396
Don't tell me the fluff.

1190
00:47:06,396 --> 00:47:08,962
Tell me that I'm gonna save $17,000 a year

1191
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:12,411
by giving you $25,000 and
I'll write you $50,000.

1192
00:47:12,411 --> 00:47:13,781
Got it?

1193
00:47:13,781 --> 00:47:14,614
- [Nonprofit Woman] Thank you so much.

1194
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:15,447
- You're welcome.

1195
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,782
(audience cheering)

1196
00:47:17,782 --> 00:47:19,263
Thank you guys.

1197
00:47:19,263 --> 00:47:21,232
I'm sorry Bro, I'm sorry.

1198
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:22,806
Thank you.

1199
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,639
Bye guys.

1200
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:27,248
Sales people leave your two
cents on what you just heard.

1201
00:47:27,248 --> 00:47:28,081
Will love to get your comments.

1202
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:29,012
Let me know.

1203
00:47:29,012 --> 00:00:00,000
