1
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:03,909
(upbeat instrumental music)

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:11,375
- Hello Hong Kong, thanks
for hanging around.

3
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,208
I will try to deliver.

4
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:16,617
One thing I've been thinking a lot about

5
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:20,607
as I've been spending time
walking the conference hall

6
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:23,526
and spending the day today in Hong Kong

7
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:26,247
is just the diversity in the audience

8
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:30,946
of where we come from, what
we're trying to achieve.

9
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,801
And I gave a lot of thought to,

10
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:36,326
what do I really want to
deliver in this keynote?

11
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:39,611
How do I bring value, I think,
one of things that, you know,

12
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:41,535
when I think about products or services

13
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:43,975
and definitely when I
speak or create content,

14
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:45,443
how do you bring value?

15
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:47,283
Like, what's the trade here?

16
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:48,789
I'm getting your attention,

17
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,717
I want to bring you value in return.

18
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,983
The thing that really stands out for me

19
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:56,860
is the one thing that I'm confident in,

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,593
the one thing that I'm
absolutely confident in,

21
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,843
is what attaches all of us.

22
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:04,001
What is the one common theme?

23
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,609
Whether you're a start up,
whether you're a professional,

24
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:09,401
whether you're a student,
solo entrepreneur,

25
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:11,997
large company, starting tomorrow.

26
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:14,642
What is the one thing that guarantees

27
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:18,428
a connection point that
we can all agree on

28
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:22,394
and get value out of the
framework that I create here?

29
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:24,346
And I think that comes
down to one simple thing,

30
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:26,562
that no matter what
you're doing in this room,

31
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:29,411
whether you're trying to
raise money for a non profit

32
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:32,156
or you're trying to
sell a thin tech product

33
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:34,514
or trying to raise capital

34
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,133
for what you're trying to achieve,

35
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,388
the one thing that we all trade on

36
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:40,889
in this room is attention.

37
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:44,757
If you're not sitting and
debating, on an every day basis,

38
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:47,840
on how you as a human or as a company

39
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,465
act like a modern day media publisher,

40
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,662
how you communicate,
whether in written, audio,

41
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:58,208
or video form, and then which platforms

42
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,281
are under priced and over
priced, you're basing,

43
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,511
missing the punchline.

44
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:05,117
It doesn't matter how
good, bad or indifferent

45
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:08,491
your product or service is
if nobody knows about it.

46
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:10,043
You're vulnerable.

47
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,360
And the thing that I'm curious about

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,137
is where everybody in this
room is on the life cycle.

49
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:19,044
Because if you've had success
for three or four years

50
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:22,193
you might've fallen in love
with what got you here.

51
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:24,597
The biggest concern I have,
and I see some heads nodding

52
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:29,170
already, is what got you here
today is always the thing

53
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,505
that's not gonna get you to tomorrow.

54
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:35,484
For example, for me, if you ask me today,

55
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:38,302
what am I most paying
attention to, where do I see

56
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:42,385
the next arbitrage, it's
absolutely around audio.

57
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm obsessed with what's
going in the U.S. market,

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,141
not only around podcasts,
and this is global,

59
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:53,918
but especially around
what's going on with Alexa

60
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:58,489
from Amazon, Google Home, and
the future Apple Home Pod.

61
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,331
The one thing I promise you is

62
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:01,718
that every single person here,

63
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,794
besides the health and
wellbeing of their family,

64
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:05,711
and money, values time.

65
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:09,385
And time is emerging very quickly.

66
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:12,260
If you take a look, and
this is extremely prevalent

67
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,809
through the Asian market, European market,

68
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,937
South American market, U.S. market,

69
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:21,224
time's value is exceeding
on an everyday basis.

70
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:22,226
As we become more busy,

71
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:26,525
we start valuing time
tremendously, tremendously.

72
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:29,323
That is what Uber, and
other transportation apps,

73
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:32,000
have traded on, it's saving you time,

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,321
even the perception of time
is a good business model,

75
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,980
but the thing I think
I'm very fascinated by

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,884
is how much sound and audio
will be selling back to you

77
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:46,525
time founded that you used to not have.

78
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:49,350
When you watch a video, which
I think we can all agree,

79
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,805
video content is scaling in importance

80
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:56,003
and is absolutely in the
prime of its medium right now.

81
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,375
When you're looking at video,

82
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,053
it is taking up your time.

83
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:01,658
Audio is incredibly passive,

84
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,538
and so the thing that
I'm trying to force down,

85
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:07,853
energy wise, in this
keynote, is the following.

86
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,789
Number one, no matter
what you do for a living,

87
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:14,825
you need to think of
yourself as a media company.

88
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:17,159
Your company, if you are a SAS tech,

89
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:21,060
you are a media company comma SAS tech.

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,328
If you are a consumer social network,

91
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:27,543
you are a media company
comma social network.

92
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:30,951
If you're a human being,
you are a media company

93
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,066
comma human being.

94
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,609
When you wrap your head around that,

95
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,009
you start understanding
what you should be doing,

96
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,151
which is, in your natural way,

97
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,455
producing stories for people to consume

98
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:46,002
to bring awareness to what you do.

99
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:50,182
So one, if you are not
taking this opportunity

100
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:54,349
for what it is, you've already
put yourself in second place.

101
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:57,566
This is the moment.

102
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,009
Number two.

103
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,877
Entrepreneurship got popular,
and that means it's dangerous

104
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:04,385
because there's a lot of people

105
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:06,649
that raised their hands that
have entrepreneurial tendencies

106
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:09,581
and aren't necessarily entrepreneurs.

107
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:11,347
Just because you say
you're an entrepreneur

108
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:13,969
doesn't mean you're a
successful entrepreneur,

109
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,263
and the reason I bring
that up is not to be like

110
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:17,962
I'm cool, you're not, or
anything of that nature.

111
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:19,914
There's just one very important thing

112
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:21,753
that is not being discussed enough.

113
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:24,246
We talk about working smart and having

114
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:26,348
the right strategy and
having the right product.

115
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:29,765
I'm stunned by how much pushback there is

116
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:33,945
when I talk about working hard.

117
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:34,945
There is no.

118
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,899
Zero people you know that have
built a successful business

119
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,254
without working their face off.

120
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:46,919
There are people that
have inherited money,

121
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,367
there are people that
have had that dynamic,

122
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,201
but you know nobody, nor does the world,

123
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:55,097
that has started from zero and
built something substantial

124
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:58,928
that hasn't put in a
disproportional amount of work

125
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:00,220
to get there.

126
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,372
It is the one utterly
controllable aspect of our game,

127
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:06,590
and if you really want this,

128
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,086
please really start thinking
about maximizing every minute.

129
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,517
That doesn't mean neglecting your family.

130
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:15,930
That doesn't mean neglecting your health.

131
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,565
But I am stunned, as
somebody who is spending

132
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:20,235
an enormous amount of
time in this ecosystem,

133
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:23,235
by how many people have the ambition

134
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,734
and their mouth is running

135
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:26,814
to what they're going to accomplish

136
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:30,046
and their actions don't map to it at all.

137
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:34,556
- Hope everybody's ready for
this session because I am.

138
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:35,389
Gary, how you doing?

139
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,053
- Yes, I'm doing well.

140
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:38,054
How are you?

141
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,056
- Great.

142
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:40,161
- Hello, Hong Kong.

143
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:41,918
(cheering)

144
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,559
Hello, Hong Kong.

145
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:45,566
(cheering)

146
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:48,341
- So basically we're
talking about, you know,

147
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,147
when you have fear, you just
don't give a shit about it,

148
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:52,435
just go for it.

149
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:56,602
- Listen, everybody's, I'm
petrified of my mother's health,

150
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:59,228
like petrified,

151
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:00,964
so I have fear.

152
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:04,474
I just think life's about alternatives.

153
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:06,444
Life's like, I don't give a shit

154
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:09,174
when people talk to me about theory.

155
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,522
It's binary.

156
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:14,022
Like when your spouse gets terminally ill,

157
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:18,246
theory doesn't matter,
you have to navigate.

158
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:21,008
When you lose your biggest
client that represent.

159
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,230
How many people here have businesses

160
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,437
that have very large clients

161
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:26,526
that represent big
portions of their business?

162
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:27,598
Raise your hand.

163
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:28,703
How many people here have a client

164
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,337
that represents more than
50% of their business?

165
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:32,670
Raise your hand.

166
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:37,191
I mean that's fucking
scary for these 11 people.

167
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:40,065
Like their businesses suck.

168
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:42,800
Like they need to, like one
more time for the 11 of you.

169
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,846
I want to give you a piece of advice.

170
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:46,589
You need to, like tomorrow,
like you should leave

171
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,030
this talk right now, leave,

172
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,532
and start getting other
customers because that's scary.

173
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:54,642
Like who wants to be that vulnerable

174
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,502
to something that they don't control?

175
00:07:56,502 --> 00:08:00,018
You know, so for me,
like there's just things

176
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:01,225
that you can't control.

177
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:03,273
If the 11 of them lose
that client tomorrow

178
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:06,124
because the decision
maker that is their client

179
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:08,105
goes to a different company

180
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:11,497
and the new one doesn't
like them or has a sister

181
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:14,530
that has a similar business,
they're in panic mode.

182
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,677
They've got to adjust.

183
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:19,758
And so, you know, you know how
many people here's businesses

184
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:22,591
rely on somebody that is not them?

185
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:26,533
It is scary how many
people's businesses here

186
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:30,381
that the most important person
to the business is not them,

187
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,066
that it's a sales person,

188
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,756
that it's a technical leads co-founder.

189
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,903
It's somebody else.

190
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:38,494
That is scary,

191
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:40,570
and so there's a lot of
things we don't control

192
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,716
when we build our businesses, the market.

193
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:47,011
Don't even, listen, I'm a boy
that's born in Soviet Russia.

194
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,549
You start thinking about markets

195
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,382
where you have to be
nice with the families

196
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:53,334
that run the country, fuck.

197
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:54,226
Right?

198
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,757
there's a lot of things
we don't talk about

199
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:57,858
that make it scary,

200
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:01,148
which is why I don't
like the current state

201
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,528
of entrepreneurship in the world

202
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:08,190
because it seems very
party and popular and cool,

203
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,520
and it is literally everything but.

204
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,481
I started my daily vlog.

205
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,615
Yes, I like attention and I want selfies,

206
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:18,421
but much more because I
want people to see how hard

207
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:22,225
it really is, how long every day is,

208
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:26,693
if you really want to
be successful, and so.

209
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,872
I'm scared of everything,

210
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:32,979
which actually, ironically
means I'm scared of nothing.

211
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:34,041
- Right that is.

212
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,043
- Do you understand?

213
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,044
- Yeah, I got what you mean.

214
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:37,045
- It's like got it?

215
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:38,046
I know it's a funny little statement,

216
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:40,484
but by accepting fear of everything,

217
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:44,796
it kind of makes me numb and
makes me not fear anything.

218
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:45,899
- [Woman] Anything, yeah.

219
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,519
- What is your advice
for young entrepreneurs

220
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,690
in college that are
trying to start businesses

221
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,148
and run them themselves?

222
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:52,398
- Quit college.

223
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:54,350
- [Man] Quit college?

224
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,631
- I'm probably, I'm probably.

225
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:59,621
If you're actually an entrepreneur, yes.

226
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:01,773
Because I promise you
college is doing you zero

227
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:04,231
for entrepreneurship.

228
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:07,790
You cannot teach entrepreneurship
in a college environment

229
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,296
because it is an unbelievable reality

230
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:14,388
of like you have to navigate
it to know what to do.

231
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:15,574
Are you collecting debt?

232
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,001
- No.

233
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:18,001
- Okay, good.

234
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:21,981
Well then you just have
to decide, you know.

235
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,749
Look, what I would tell you to do is,

236
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,293
you know what I would tell you to do,

237
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,769
if you were my brother, if you were AJ,

238
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,773
I would say you've got to make a decision.

239
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:31,286
Either you realize that these
are the last couple years

240
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:33,009
that you can really, really, really enjoy

241
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:35,895
and not do shit and enjoy them,

242
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:39,482
or you could put all your
energy into your business

243
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:41,242
and let your grades go to shit

244
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,754
and either get kicked out

245
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:46,906
or let them push you through the system.

246
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:48,977
If, you know, you have to also understand,

247
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,437
my definition of an entrepreneur

248
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:53,829
is a little bit different than
I think a lot of people's.

249
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:57,502
My definition of an entrepreneur
is you can't breathe

250
00:10:57,502 --> 00:11:01,252
other than when you're
running your business.

251
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:04,316
- [Woman] Hello.

252
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:05,319
- Hello.

253
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,321
- It's me again.

254
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,932
I'd like to thank you so much.

255
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:10,864
First of all, I've been
watching your talks,

256
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:12,136
your videos, a lot in the morning

257
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,525
because my mom never supported me

258
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:17,209
and I had to hear and watch somebody

259
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,173
that will give me this push and.

260
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:20,175
- I get it.

261
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:21,174
- [Woman] And thank you so much for that.

262
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,175
I really appreciate it.

263
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:24,215
- I will tell you, and I
apologize for cutting you off,

264
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:28,205
I was so supported by my
mom to be an entrepreneur

265
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:29,979
and I want to remind people,

266
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,035
and this is a great
crowd to understand me.

267
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,523
I was an immigrant.

268
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:36,666
If you're an immigrant or you
come from immigrant parents,

269
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,118
education is the way out.

270
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:42,052
Every Russian, Jewish boy and girl

271
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:43,934
that came from the Soviet
Union with my parents

272
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,634
was getting straight A's
on their way to Harvard.

273
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:49,172
I was getting straight F's.

274
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:52,511
So for my mom to have the self esteem

275
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,727
to not care what the
other parents thought,

276
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,894
to let me do my thing, was such a gift

277
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,153
that I now produce
content on a daily basis

278
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:05,768
because I feel guilty
that I had it so good

279
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:09,123
and I want to provide that for you guys.

280
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:11,161
That is why I do it.

281
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:12,739
And so I think the biggest thing

282
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:13,572
that you need to understand is

283
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:17,739
the best product will always
win if people know about it,

284
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:21,561
right, and so I think the thing

285
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:25,865
that I spend a lot of
time on is I'm a marketer,

286
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:28,573
I like to market, I understand marketing,

287
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,937
I'm a business builder,
I've built businesses.

288
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,215
I think there's an incredible interesting

289
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:35,975
kind of graph between the
quality of your product

290
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:38,158
and how many people know about it.

291
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,455
So for example, if you're a great marketer

292
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,578
and you listen to everything that I say

293
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:44,562
and you get a lot of attention

294
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:47,266
and your business isn't working,

295
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,924
a lot of times it happens to
do with your product sucking.

296
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:53,614
You know, like we don't spend enough time

297
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:55,688
talking about the product
or service you're selling,

298
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,350
you know, so please, if
you're sitting in the audience

299
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,321
and you're looking for the magic pill

300
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,159
or you think that you're going to be able

301
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,373
to siphon some information that's going

302
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,722
to allow you to play in
the edges of the arbitrage

303
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:09,896
of opportunity, please
make sure you're looking

304
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:13,482
at your product and service
to make sure it delivers

305
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,408
because if you follow my blueprint,

306
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:18,363
if you get results from my ideas

307
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:20,499
that you then become an executor of,

308
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,764
if your product sucks,
all that I'm going to do

309
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:25,282
is expose your product faster

310
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:28,622
and you're going to go
out of business faster.

311
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:30,455
So please start there.

312
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:35,613
But after that, please
understand the following.

313
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:39,495
The is a golden era of
marketing for one simple reason.

314
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:41,995
The places where our attention

315
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,898
and our consumers' attention
are, are now driven

316
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:49,068
by marketplace bidding dynamics,

317
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:52,969
not by writing an upfront
check to get the ads.

318
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:54,495
Please understand this.

319
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:57,326
Please understand that the
biggest difference for us,

320
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,923
as communicators, is we don't
need millions of dollars

321
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:05,006
to do television and print
and outdoor and direct mail

322
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:06,006
to hit mass.

323
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:09,774
We are trading on marketplaces,

324
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,636
Google, Facebook, Snapchat.

325
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:15,070
These are biddable marketplaces.

326
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,737
The reason this is the best time

327
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:21,620
is because those marketplaces
are under priced.

328
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,951
Those marketplaces are
under priced right now

329
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,916
because the biggest companies in the world

330
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,083
are not spending enough money on them.

331
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:34,155
You have to understand, when
there's a come to Jesus moment

332
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:37,431
and the biggest brands in
the world properly spend

333
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:40,218
in everything that I talk about,

334
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:43,689
everything I talk about
becomes null and void.

335
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:47,022
We are ridiculously lucky because we get

336
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:50,556
to navigate through this time.

337
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,124
For anybody over 30, and
especially if you're over 40,

338
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:56,986
you really recognize that,
because for the over 40 crowd

339
00:14:56,986 --> 00:15:01,426
in here, we lived pre
internet in a lot of ways.

340
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:03,481
The scale is remarkable.

341
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,944
The impact is high.

342
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:07,050
The upside's enormous.

343
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,571
And to be very honest, I think most of us

344
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:11,830
are just taking it for granted.

345
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,586
I don't think we understand the impact

346
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:16,895
of how much the opportunity is real,

347
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:21,267
and for me, it becomes
disproportionally compounded

348
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:24,758
because you're actually
at this conference.

349
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,740
You're actually part of a very small,

350
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,909
interesting group for me,

351
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:30,681
which is I know how
big the opportunity is,

352
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,864
I know that 99% of people
have no idea it's happening.

353
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:37,874
You do, so you're part
of 1% of the whole thing

354
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:40,320
that understands it's happening.

355
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,237
Now it's yours to lose.

356
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,800
I would argue that if you
are not able to achieve

357
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,806
what you want to achieve in life,

358
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:50,927
and you're at this
conference during this time,

359
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:53,344
then you really mis-executed,

360
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:56,311
then you really got into the things

361
00:15:56,311 --> 00:15:59,592
that I worry about when I put out content,

362
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,482
which is you worry way
too much about stuff

363
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:05,759
that does not matter, that
you're worried way too much

364
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,489
about other people's opinions,

365
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,299
which is the biggest reason
you don't take chances

366
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:14,238
because you worry about how
people judge your failures.

367
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:16,565
Then you're doing a lot of other things

368
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:20,232
that are leading to
huge levels of mis-shots

369
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:23,507
and missed opportunities.

370
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:26,198
And so that's why I speak so much

371
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,253
about being insular,
having the right intent,

372
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,353
because literally, fundamentally,

373
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:33,658
if you synthesize
everything I've just said,

374
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:36,658
non-action is the fundamental reason

375
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:40,219
that most of you will fail,

376
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:41,546
at this point.

377
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,359
Being in this room, at this conference,

378
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:47,520
during this time, and understanding

379
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,906
quite a bit of what's actually happening.

380
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:52,640
Non-action, which if you take all the way

381
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,307
to the seed of a human
being, is insecurity,

382
00:16:57,202 --> 00:17:01,764
which is probably the biggest
reason that I create content,

383
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:05,931
because I hope that you use
me as your shield to do shit.

384
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:09,675
Period.

385
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:13,460
Most entrepreneurs in the U.S., which is,

386
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:17,077
oftentimes, not always, because
of cultural differences,

387
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,881
but oftentimes you get to see a preview

388
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,031
of what's happening before it happened.

389
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:24,918
When I think about my friends

390
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,819
that have built successful businesses

391
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,821
in Southeast Asia, by
simply paying attention

392
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:32,374
of what's happening in America

393
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:36,541
and then replicating some
version of it in the market.

394
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,890
It is literally the dream come true.

395
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,799
You know, American entrepreneurs got mad

396
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,692
at those brothers in Germany, right,

397
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:48,656
who had ripped off the
ideas and built a business.

398
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:51,004
I always was so upset about that.

399
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,404
I mean I think Facebook has proven

400
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,237
that there's no ripping
off if it's a feature.

401
00:17:57,698 --> 00:17:59,378
And I think I would also argue

402
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,736
that ripping off by looking
at a different business

403
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:06,590
in a different market
and then interpreting it

404
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,935
into your market is far from ripping off.

405
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,102
I think it's called smart.

406
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,983
So I would highly recommend,

407
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:18,502
I don't know if it's pride,
which I think holds back

408
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:21,603
a lot of people, but please take advantage

409
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:25,606
for the disadvantages one
could think they have,

410
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,141
there's only five million here.

411
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,965
If you want to do it in Indonesia,

412
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:31,599
there's a lot of people, but
there's so many micro-climates,

413
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,717
so that's, you know, so many
different segmentations,

414
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:35,297
mainly in China.

415
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:39,165
Whatever you would deem a disadvantage,

416
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:42,641
please understand you have
the greatest advantage,

417
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:47,160
which is 90% of things
are human, not cultural.

418
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,743
90% of things are human, not cultural.

419
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:54,194
If you're capable of
understanding the culture

420
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:56,851
of your consumer and
layer the cultural context

421
00:18:56,851 --> 00:19:01,690
on top of the human thing
that is happening in America,

422
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,785
you are halfway home.

423
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:08,329
An unbelievable advantage
to be an entrepreneur

424
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:11,304
in this region and watch things play out,

425
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:13,054
by the way, for free,

426
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,279
no report needed, no
hiring Boston Consulting

427
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,019
or Bane and McKenzie,

428
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,282
by reading and watching
videos and downloading apps,

429
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:25,732
something that I don't believe most people

430
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,524
in this conference are
taking full advantage of

431
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:33,104
or respecting enough of how
big of an advantage that is,

432
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:37,298
and to me, very honestly, I'm
quite selfish when I speak.

433
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:39,371
I dream in three years from now.

434
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:41,965
You email me, nothing
would make me happier

435
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,671
than getting an email from somebody here

436
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:46,755
who said they had a 50 million dollar exit

437
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:49,778
because you know they just
looked at what was working

438
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:53,945
in America and they built
the replica-ish of it here.

439
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,370
Please do that, please understand
how big of a deal that is,

440
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,528
and I would argue it is your
singular biggest advantage

441
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:06,710
in this market to be able
to be shown what will work,

442
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,989
and then allow you to interpret it,

443
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:12,989
oftentimes with very
little change in the model.

444
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,373
Cool?

445
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:16,603
Cool.

446
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:18,280
So those are some of the
top of the funnel things

447
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,474
that are really on my mind.

448
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:22,807
I continue to execute, I continue to do.

449
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,817
I'm very fascinated by how much time

450
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:30,325
people spend dwelling and debating.

451
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:35,113
I think we glorify strategy
and we underestimate execution.

452
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:37,876
I feel like if you look
historically and rewind

453
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:41,322
the biggest successes, the
strategy came from the execution

454
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:44,334
and you did some Monday
morning quarterback.

455
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:47,434
I'm a real genius in hindsight

456
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:51,166
because I can manipulate how
I got there after the fact.

457
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,874
I'm going to talk about so
many things in different ways

458
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,801
than the intent that was at first

459
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:58,447
because you don't even
realize that your strategy

460
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:00,361
came from it because when you're doing,

461
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:02,818
the strategy's happening in real time,

462
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:06,234
you almost forget why you were
doing it in the first place,

463
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:10,476
and so I promise you,
indecisiveness and debate

464
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:13,723
and pontificating, and ultimately ego,

465
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:16,967
is stopping so many people
from being successful.

466
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,470
- [Man] Hi, Gary, my name is Terrence,

467
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,344
and I'm 20 this year.

468
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:22,627
So just one question for you.

469
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:25,233
I've been listening to
you for about a year now,

470
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,903
and I'm just trying to figure out,

471
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,833
as a 20 year old without any experience

472
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,400
in my parents' business, I've wanted to do

473
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,983
a video blog, an audio podcast,

474
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,683
but I don't have the
experience to actually do it.

475
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:42,992
So which should I focus on?

476
00:21:42,992 --> 00:21:45,266
Building up the experience in the business

477
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:48,834
or should I go direct to
help market the company?

478
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:53,023
- Well listen, if you started
a podcast and a video blog

479
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:57,190
about being experienced in
the craft, that would be bad,

480
00:21:58,812 --> 00:22:02,145
faking it, but if your podcast was about

481
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:07,484
the experience of learning the craft,

482
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:11,298
you'd probably have a lot of
20 year olds following you.

483
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:12,301
- [Man] Okay.

484
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:14,539
- So I don't think it's
about getting the experience.

485
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,132
When I talk about I built
a business for 15 years

486
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:20,390
before I came out, right,

487
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,370
I say that because that's what happened,

488
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,895
but I have a funny feeling if the internet

489
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:28,265
was around when I was a kid like this,

490
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,057
I might have started documenting
my journey right away.

491
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:34,008
I just wouldn't be
walking around like I was

492
00:22:34,008 --> 00:22:36,024
a business building guy,

493
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:40,811
I would be talking about
being a young, ambitious guy

494
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:42,374
who used to sell baseball cards

495
00:22:42,374 --> 00:22:44,404
and now I'm about to do it for wine,

496
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,950
and I would take people
along with my journey.

497
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,786
That's my biggest problem with people

498
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:51,694
that don't have experience, they're lying.

499
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:54,447
They're lying that
they're business experts

500
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:58,224
or my favorite, you're a
20 year old life coach,

501
00:22:58,224 --> 00:23:01,914
because, you know, you've lived life.

502
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:05,606
So to me, I think you
can start the podcast

503
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:07,218
and the video blog.

504
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:10,425
I mean I wish I did that
because I, there was,

505
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:12,425
I probably cried, cried,

506
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:18,840
50 times in the first 10 years
that I worked with my dad

507
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,589
because they were very painful fights

508
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,285
and that would have
been incredible content

509
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:24,609
that I wish you guys could watch

510
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:28,167
if you're in a family business
because it turned out okay

511
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,848
and it would have been really
cool to see how that happened

512
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:34,998
and why and how i was able
to give more than I took

513
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,294
and how I loved my dad more than the money

514
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:40,874
and how I thought about what
I could do in my 30s and 40s

515
00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:44,096
and it's okay to lose in my 20s,

516
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,100
but I wouldn't have walked around

517
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,842
and said I was a marketing genius

518
00:23:46,842 --> 00:00:00,000
because I thought I was gonna be.
