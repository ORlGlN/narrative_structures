1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:03,388
(funky upbeat music)

2
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,259
- No matter who's making America great,

3
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:12,675
I'm 50 years old and I'm driving a truck

4
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:13,715
and I'm gonna happy,

5
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:15,050
'cause it's gonna be a 11 percent growth

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,883
in the next five years.

7
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:16,919
Then all of a sudden,

8
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:19,554
bang, UPS, bang, American Express,

9
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:23,137
postal service, Uber,
automated, heroified.

10
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:25,771
What am I gonna do then?

11
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:26,897
'Cause I'm sitting here telling you

12
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:27,814
that America is gonna be great,

13
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:28,731
and I'm gonna be good forever.

14
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:29,564
- Yeah, I mean look,

15
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:31,019
that's going political.

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,242
Like, anybody, anybody,

17
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,699
that thinks the President
of the United States,

18
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:36,284
whether it's Barack or Donald

19
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,955
or Bernie or Hillary

20
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,674
is gonna help them,

21
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:41,229
they're a fucking loser.

22
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,062
(audience laughs)

23
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:42,936
Straight up.

24
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:44,747
I promise you, you are!

25
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:46,036
That means you need somebody

26
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:47,598
(audience laughs)

27
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:49,931
So whether your President is

28
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:52,380
for minorities and females

29
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,006
or your President is for the

30
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:56,670
26 year old white male
that's got no skills,

31
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,011
here's the punchline.

32
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,188
The market is the market.

33
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:02,011
What is the 54 year old going to do?

34
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:02,844
Adjust!

35
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,932
Or lose!

36
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,107
- [Man] Right, but how do we

37
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:07,940
how do we get that message out to say,

38
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,773
you know what?

39
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:10,566
You can probably drive
a truck 'til you're 55,

40
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,644
you can program in tech and do those

41
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:13,477
'til you're 90.

42
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:15,564
Talking to BMW, they said that

43
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:18,908
they can't get enough
kids to be technicians

44
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,539
because their theory is

45
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:25,160
the old mechanic with the
big grease on his shirt.

46
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,163
I was talking to the head of the

47
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:29,252
head of the machinery operations

48
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:30,419
meaning crane operations.

49
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:33,420
They said their jobs
are empty for 15 months.

50
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,592
These kids can go to school for one year,

51
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:37,757
come out and make $150,000 dollars

52
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:40,555
but yet, they're going to a school,

53
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:43,097
50 percent of them will
retire with the title

54
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,059
of a job that doesn't exist today.

55
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:46,476
They're staying in school for four years,

56
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:47,683
half of them is digital classes,

57
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,436
they're leaving with
$300,000 dollars in debt

58
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:51,311
and they still don't know
how to operate anything.

59
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,854
So, how do we get the parents in this room

60
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:55,026
to save that money?

61
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:56,680
How do we get the kids in this room,

62
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,737
well not the kids in this room

63
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,937
but who's gonna watch
us online to understand

64
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:01,240
what they need to do and move ahead

65
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,755
and not think,

66
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,700
a diploma is gonna save me,

67
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,540
the President's gonna save me,

68
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,366
welfare's gonna save me or anything else.

69
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,939
How do we, what happens then?

70
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,357
What needs to happen?

71
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:13,451
- Carnage.

72
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:15,884
(mild laughter)

73
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:18,259
Carnage needs to happen.

74
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,676
People are complacent.

75
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:23,009
Here's most people's strategies in life.

76
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,267
(laughing)

77
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,272
- [Man] You holding your breath?

78
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:32,940
- I mean, I really have no
passion for this conversation.

79
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,568
Like, if you're not capable
in 2017 to Google shit

80
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:38,321
and figure out what's
going on in the world,

81
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,482
fuck you.

82
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,404
(crowd exclaims, laughs)

83
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:42,327
I'm being dead serious!

84
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:43,993
By the way, I'm being really serious!

85
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:46,745
What role does the government play

86
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:48,538
or thought leaders or this and that?

87
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:50,413
Whatever that cliche statement of like,

88
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:53,165
the teacher comes when the
student is ready, right?

89
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,918
I believe in that thing,

90
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,503
I don't know, I'm not

91
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:59,051
lots of things happen!

92
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,054
Lots of things happen in life!

93
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:01,887
Right?

94
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:03,120
I woke up one morning and realized,

95
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,953
you know what?

96
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:06,557
This liquor shipping law
is never gonna get better.

97
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:08,055
There's dirty politician money,

98
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,059
they're gonna keep paying this off

99
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:11,119
and I'm not gonna spend
the rest of my life

100
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,352
worrying what the 'right' thing to do is

101
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:14,559
and what's right.

102
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,782
No, they're gonna keep
paying off politicians,

103
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,396
state by state and
because I'm the biggest,

104
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:19,772
I'll always be picked on.

105
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:20,898
So I adjusted!

106
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:22,738
I started over.

107
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:23,988
I started over.

108
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,822
Like, I started over.

109
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,662
This whole Wine Library
thing and I got so lucky,

110
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:29,495
guess what?

111
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:30,578
I owned zero percent of Wine Library,

112
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,582
'cause it was under my father's name,

113
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,794
so I had no collateral to even start it.

114
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:35,953
I started VaynerMedia by getting somebody

115
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:38,002
to pay me $80,000 dollars
to do a marketing campaign.

116
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,465
And I built it.

117
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:40,382
And so that's what's gonna happen

118
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:41,215
and everybody has their version,

119
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,553
not everybody has my
business talent to build

120
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:44,301
billion dollar companies.

121
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:46,181
But if you're making $74,000

122
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:48,805
or $197,000 or whatever you're making

123
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:50,512
and your market gets fucked,

124
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:53,937
I don't see truck driver
Johnny feeling bad for

125
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:57,606
Rick the bookstore owner,
'cause Amazon came along.

126
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:00,023
This has happened forever!

127
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:02,740
This is not the first time
that innovation fucked shit up!

128
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,863
Nobody's crying for the
farmers in middle America,

129
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:08,139
nobody's crying for
the people in Cleveland

130
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,025
who own the docks!

131
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:12,492
This is what always happens!

132
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:14,454
So this is what's up now!

133
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,543
And so what 55 year old Charles has to do,

134
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:21,126
when he is out of a
job is get another job.

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,504
Whatever that job is.

136
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:26,793
So if Charles is smart, and has skills,

137
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:29,010
he's teaching himself something now

138
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,268
to be ready for three years from now!

139
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:34,055
But Charles wants to watch football.

140
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:36,139
But Charles wants to drink at the bar.

141
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,933
- [Man] So he needs to put his 20 percent

142
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,268
into what's going on in the future.

143
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,446
- Mister, that's right.
- And bank that.

144
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,732
- You're damn right.

145
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,819
I know tens of thousands of people,

146
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,566
and I know thousands of
people extremely well

147
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,242
and I know hundreds of people deeply well.

148
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:51,101
There is no correlation
between how much money

149
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,867
someone makes and their
level of happiness.

150
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:57,378
I have friends who make
$47,000 dollars a year

151
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:59,189
and are the happiest people I know.

152
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,040
Their work life balance is on point,

153
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,881
they're part of two soccer teams,

154
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:03,966
they play video games,

155
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,545
they watch every show they want,

156
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:07,803
they take two vacations
that they scrap together,

157
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,139
and they're freakin' happy as hell.

158
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,008
And I know tons of
people who I grew up with

159
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:13,762
in the Silicon Valley boom

160
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:15,764
who have hundreds of millions of dollars

161
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,854
in their bank account,
and are as miserable

162
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:20,934
and as lonely and as
broken as you'll ever see.

163
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,851
So I implore all of you

164
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:26,108
to please reverse engineer and figure out

165
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:30,659
who you are and figure out
what level of monetizing

166
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,035
and stuff you need

167
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,038
and what level of creativity you need.

168
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:35,867
I promise you one thing,
one thing that will

169
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,165
catch you very off guard.

170
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,789
I should be way more rich.

171
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,419
I leave money on the table every day!

172
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:46,420
I have left ungodly amounts
of money on the table.

173
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,048
I spend tons of times sending DM's

174
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,266
and engaging with people,
meeting people randomly

175
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,641
and not cashing in.

176
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:56,602
I actually believe the
statement I am about to make.

177
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:58,930
I think that I love the journey

178
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,977
and the game of entrepreneurship so much

179
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:06,105
that I have subconsciously
sabotaged my financial upside

180
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:08,142
to make sure I can play
this a little longer,

181
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:10,447
'cause I fear if the numbers
keep getting too big,

182
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:13,657
eventually it will take the fun out of it.

183
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:16,327
When you were lucky enough, like I am,

184
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:19,375
to actually do something
that you love so much,

185
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,748
do something that puts pressure against

186
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,623
the one thing you care about besides it,

187
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:26,799
which is the time I spend with my family,

188
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,506
my family's my whole life.

189
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:31,263
And being this, and doing this

190
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:33,643
is the only thing that cuts into that.

191
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,888
I couldn't breathe if I
wasn't an entrepreneur.

192
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:39,849
I didn't breathe when I
wasn't an entrepreneur.

193
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,269
That's the reason I got
D's and F's in school.

194
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,441
'Cause I just couldn't be me.

195
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:46,194
And I'm not capable of that.

196
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:49,903
And so, I think being
here excites me because

197
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:53,241
I think, coming to not
L.A., San Francisco,

198
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,699
New York, London is
always more fun for me.

199
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,574
It always feels a little more practical.

200
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:58,869
It always feels like
there's a little bit more

201
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,003
chips on the shoulder
which is what I have.

202
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,791
But I want to remind everybody,

203
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,794
just because you didn't
grow up with a trust fund,

204
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:08,592
just 'cause you don't
live in Silicon Valley,

205
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,548
the market doesn't care.

206
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:12,214
If you are good enough, you will win.

207
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,967
So when I was a young kid,

208
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,260
I made a lot of money
selling baseball cards

209
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,222
and comic books and toys.

210
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,016
And then I started working
for my dad's business

211
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:21,897
and I was making,

212
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:24,143
when I was 22 to 28, I was making

213
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,022
35 to 55 thousand dollars a year.

214
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,317
But I had no expenses.

215
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:29,610
I didn't go on vacations,

216
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,571
I didn't buy fancy things,
so I saved my money,

217
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:34,405
I saved my money, I saved my money.

218
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:37,325
And then when I had hundreds
of thousands of dollars

219
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,829
I didn't have millions.

220
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:41,702
And by the time I was 33, 34

221
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:43,374
when I had that opportunity,

222
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:44,541
I'd still not bought a home,

223
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,829
I was still in an apartment.

224
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,796
I was 33 years old, and I was renting

225
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:52,505
because I was saving cash
to go on the offense.

226
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,543
And so when I had a chance
to invest in those companies,

227
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:55,971
I put hundreds of thousands of dollars,

228
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:59,134
not millions, but those
hundreds made millions.

229
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:00,893
Made tens of millions and so,

230
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:01,726
that's it.

231
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,018
Nothing crazy, nothing

232
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,561
I didn't have any crazy, crazy advantage,

233
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,767
there's a lot of people that
make $55,000 dollars a year

234
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,305
when they're 23.

235
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,778
The problem is, they go to Coachella.

236
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:13,275
And they want to buy a watch.

237
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,988
And they want to buy a BMW.

238
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:15,821
And I didn't.

239
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,861
So I ate shit for 13 years,

240
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:20,955
and then I had a moment, and I struck.

241
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:21,948
- So what should we do, Gary V?

242
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,741
Let's wrap this up, what should we do?

243
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:25,170
What should people do?

244
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,998
- People should fuckin' stop complaining.

245
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:27,831
- [Joe Rogan] Right.

246
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:28,664
Good call.
- People should figure out

247
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:29,497
who the fuck they are.

248
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:30,330
- [Rogan] Good call.

249
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,972
- People should not listen
to America propaganda

250
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,592
of fixing the shit they suck at,

251
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:37,175
they should be tripling down
on what they're good at.

252
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,886
They should be competent in certain areas,

253
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,887
but you're not gonna become Beyonce

254
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:46,354
or your bone structure is a certain way,

255
00:08:46,354 --> 00:08:47,729
you're not going to solve everything.

256
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,987
Your IQ can get a little bit better

257
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,979
but don't worry about the incremental,

258
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:54,521
figure out what fuckin' puts you on fire

259
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:55,729
and you're halfway decent at.

260
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:57,784
If you're lucky enough
right now to be listening,

261
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,657
and you're good at what you like,

262
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,996
become tunnel-fuckin'-vision.

263
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:04,953
Because there's way too many voices

264
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,752
telling you what and how,

265
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:07,710
and here's the other thing,

266
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,952
and this is the big one, Joe.

267
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:10,212
Because you have a humongous audience.

268
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:13,376
The biggest thing that
I've seen dividends from

269
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,338
have the conversation with the person

270
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:16,714
that's holding you back.

271
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:18,554
The reason most people who
are listening right now

272
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:20,127
are not doing that thing,

273
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,350
is they're worried about
the opinion of somebody.

274
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,765
Usually, their mother.

275
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,785
Usually, their father.

276
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:30,146
And the reality is, is
that your spouse may be

277
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,400
the person holding you back,

278
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,857
and you have to have that conversation.

279
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:33,804
- [Rogan] Cut 'em off!

280
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:36,155
- We have to get to a place
where you're doin' you

281
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,937
because the number one thing that

282
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:40,439
scares the fuck out of me is regret.

283
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:42,070
And you're gonna sit there at 72,

284
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,618
and you're gonna say I
wish, I wish, I wish.

285
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,663
And whether that's money,

286
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,835
or spend more time with your family,

287
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,542
there's a million ways to do this.

288
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,703
Not everybody wants to buy the Jets,

289
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:52,414
not everybody wants to
smoke weed on the beach

290
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:53,505
in the Bahamas.

291
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,293
Everybody's got a different fuckin' thing.

292
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,657
Figure out what your fuckin' thing is

293
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,881
and stop making fuckin' bullshit excuses.

294
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:01,342
Who the President is, your mom did this,

295
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:02,927
I missed it,

296
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,471
'I had that idea for Uber',

297
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,804
then why didn't you fuckin' do it, dick?

298
00:13:51,362 --> 00:00:00,000
(modern hip hop music)
