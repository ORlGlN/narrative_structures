1
00:00:01,054 --> 00:00:02,250
- I just had an incredible
eCommerce meeting here

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,580
on a Saturday, as you guys know,

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,660
I don't usually work on Saturday,

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,380
but I'm here for All-Star
Weekend in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,100
The weather is fuckin' phenomenal.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,930
'Bout to go to Baron Davis' event,

7
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,310
I think I'm going to rip it up pretty good

8
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,110
for the NBA players.

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,630
And just living the dream,
puttin' the pieces together,

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,850
eCommerce, selling stuff, it's good.

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,828
It's fucking good.

12
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:24,661
- [Boy] Vlog?

13
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,494
- What's that?

14
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:26,327
I do.

15
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,410
- What's your name?

16
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,243
- Gary.

17
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:29,268
- Oh, you're Gary Vee?

18
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:30,101
- I am.

19
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:30,934
- Whoa, nice, that's sick,

20
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:31,767
can I make your vlog?

21
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:32,600
- Yeah, of course, what's your name?

22
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,433
- Sruly.

23
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,520
Sruly what are you into?

24
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,480
- Sneakers.

25
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,313
- You flip 'em?

26
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:37,681
- Yeah.

27
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:38,514
- My guy.

28
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:40,820
What's the best flip you've had?

29
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,405
- Well I'm actually pretty new, yeah.

30
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:45,479
- So, do you have a flip yet or not yet?

31
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,900
- Nah, but.

32
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,290
- So you're an aspiring
flipper, not a flipper.

33
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,450
There's a big difference
between doing and aspiring to,

34
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,750
he doesn't flip kicks, he aspires to.

35
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,326
So, Sruly, get your shit together.

36
00:00:57,326 --> 00:01:00,409
(drum and bass riff)

37
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:04,801
- Can I take a photo of you?

38
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:05,634
- Can you take a photo
with my wife over here.

39
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:09,000
- Actually, you know what,
I'm going to take you.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,833
- So, what, are you speaking today?

41
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,598
- Yeah, but I have no idea what or how,

42
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:15,620
or about what, but I'm about to find out.

43
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,752
- What's going on, my guy?

44
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:17,585
- What's happenin'.

45
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:18,490
- Thanks for the invite.

46
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,890
You ready drink?

47
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,028
- Ready to sip with a sip.

48
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:23,101
- A little sippy-sip?

49
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:26,642
- Here, yeah (talking under crowd noise).

50
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:28,353
- This is the way I do it.

51
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:30,250
Just go right through it.

52
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,890
Best trick in the game.

53
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,350
- How ya doin', man, you alright?

54
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,920
- I'm really good, my man, real pleasure.

55
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,151
Guy, good to see you
again, man, how are you?

56
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:38,984
- Good.

57
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:39,817
- You feelin' good?

58
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:40,650
What's up, man, how are you?

59
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,483
- Nice to meet you.

60
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:42,632
- Real pleasure, my man, how are things?

61
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:43,887
- How you doin'?

62
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:45,860
- Congratulations, my guy.

63
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,000
- Nice to meet you.

64
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,852
- Fuckin' what's up, man, congratulations.

65
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:49,099
- I appreciate that.

66
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,370
- That was amazing.

67
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,320
- Everything's good, ya ya ya.

68
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,200
- Crazy feeling?

69
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,310
- Yes, it's amazing.

70
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,195
- Climbing that mountain.

71
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:56,937
- Yeah, it was a lot of work, but I mean,

72
00:01:56,937 --> 00:02:00,420
the roller coaster, everything,
but we finished on top, so.

73
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,110
- Ya man, it's a real pleasure.

74
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,943
- Thank you.

75
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:04,920
- It's been really fun, getting
to know you family and crew.

76
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,053
- Ya, this is my team.

77
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:07,384
- I facetimed with your
Mom, which is a lot of fun.

78
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:08,310
- Oh, you did?.

79
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,250
- She's lovely.

80
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,324
- Ya, she loves you.

81
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:11,639
- Thank you, thank you.

82
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,472
- He loves you too.

83
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:15,630
- I love him back, I just
told him he smelled great.

84
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,696
Fuckin' crazy, man.

85
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:20,100
It's just, you know, like, as a fan,

86
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,068
I've been trying to win a ring since 82.

87
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:22,901
(laughing)

88
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,211
This guy gets a quick little trade

89
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,183
and he picks one up quick.

90
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,090
- Luck of the draw, man.

91
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,339
- Ya man, that worked out nice.

92
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:31,730
Ya, but you know what, luck
of the draw, that part,

93
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,540
but a whole lot of fuckin'
hard work, you know?

94
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,440
- Right.

95
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,909
- I wish people understood
how hard pit-athletes work.

96
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,290
- They don't understand it.

97
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,150
- They don't get it.

98
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,292
- They think they're
just so overpaid, like.

99
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,086
- It's just about money.

100
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:48,090
- Ya man, it takes so much.

101
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,530
You guys gettin' work in this week?

102
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,363
- Yeah.

103
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:51,240
- There's a lot going on.

104
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,811
All-Star in LA.

105
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:55,036
- It's different.

106
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:55,869
- Different.

107
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:56,702
- How are you?

108
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:58,020
- Always good, huge fan,

109
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,508
worked with this on his social digital,

110
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:01,480
want to get him on your
podcast eventually,

111
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,450
after the season's over.

112
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,283
Who do I talk to?

113
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,116
- Me.

114
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:05,610
So good to see you.

115
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,896
Favorite guy from Planet of the Apps.

116
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,051
(laughing)

117
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:10,878
Yo, what up, Snapchat?

118
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,740
DRock, DRock motivated me, talkin' about,

119
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,840
what up, baby, tell him, shh.

120
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,343
I like the shh so much.

121
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:24,510
(friendly chattering)

122
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,990
Yo yo yo, what up, Facebook?

123
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,330
About to speak at this conference,

124
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,840
Baron Davis' conference,

125
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,850
but more importantly, excited to come on

126
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,850
and talk to you guys about
my new First In Line thing.

127
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,730
It is very very very simple.

128
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,720
It is basically a messenger
and text situation,

129
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,200
where I'm gonna put out
jabs and right hooks.

130
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,320
It's gonna be opportunities
to get free shit.

131
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,730
I've already got two companies

132
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,640
that are hitting me up with some stuff.

133
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,120
Where the first 500 people
that fill out the form,

134
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,690
boom, get it, free stuff.

135
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,139
Tons of stuff is being thrown at me

136
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,760
I don't need it, or want it,

137
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,260
but I want to share it with my community,

138
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,930
so that's what you're going to see

139
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,070
from First In Line, the opportunity

140
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,392
to buy First In Line stuff like,

141
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:11,420
these limited edition K-Swiss,

142
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,180
there's only 150 pairs.

143
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,400
And so, people from First In Line

144
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,570
are going to be able to get that first.

145
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,700
And then, next time I
get a Facebook beanie,

146
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,050
I'm going to ask for 50 of them,

147
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,330
boom, put 'em out on First In Line,

148
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,163
and you got 'em.

149
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,020
Somebody want a one hour class with DRock,

150
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,828
to learn how it's done,
boom, First In Line.

151
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:28,667
- [DRock] One hour.

152
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,270
- One hour, fuckin' DRock.

153
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,898
You gonna give it too them DRock?

154
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:32,731
- Ya, of course.

155
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,564
- Good, boom.

156
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,020
So that's what's up,
that's how we're doin' it.

157
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,085
First In Line, First
In Line, First In Line.

158
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:43,110
(friendly chattering and laughing)

159
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,350
- I'm Tosca Musk, I worked on Tiki Bar TV.

160
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,719
I produced Tiki Bar TV
way back in the day.

161
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,490
- No kiddin', yeah, oh my God,

162
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,323
that's some old school stuff.

163
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,827
- Early days.

164
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,978
- That's amazing, how are you?

165
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:54,811
- Good, how are you doin'?

166
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:56,590
- Oh God, that just
brought back such a flood

167
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,910
of good memories.

168
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,502
There was literally five vlogs.

169
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:00,335
- Yeah.

170
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:01,650
- There was like five video shows.

171
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,796
- And we were one of them.

172
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:04,077
- You sure were.

173
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:06,690
- And I remember I met you at,

174
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,750
I think it was at South by Southwest,

175
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,230
that first time, when Kevin Rose

176
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,320
sent out that tweet, to
say let's have a party

177
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,298
at this bar, and all of us
showed up there randomly.

178
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:16,410
- It was the best, those were some days.

179
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,302
- Back in the early days,

180
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:18,757
when nobody else was on Twitter.

181
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:20,990
- When you could get
5000 people to show up

182
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,823
with one tweet.

183
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:25,643
Those secret wine parties
that I was throwing back then

184
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:27,239
were so fun.

185
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:30,319
Ah, Tiki Bar TV, and the
guy with the hat, right?

186
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,990
- Yeah, Johnny Johnny.

187
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,850
- Johnny Johnny.

188
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,683
- Johnny Johnny.

189
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:36,933
- I gotta get key-bo movin' too.

190
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,540
- Are those yours, are those your jogs?

191
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,373
- Look at this.

192
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,206
- Those are the K-Swiss'?

193
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,437
Oh, you're a fuck-head, look at you.

194
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:45,590
- This is a limited
edition that I'm dropping

195
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,423
next Wednesday.

196
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:47,871
Don't tell 'em five-time, baby!

197
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:48,830
- Ooh!

198
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,663
- Five time!

199
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:50,496
- Put a five up, put a five up.

200
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:51,430
- Five time.

201
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,850
- Like, I'm sure there's somebody in here

202
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,646
that think they can hoop better than me.

203
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,820
(laughing)

204
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,900
Even though those are lies.

205
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,210
(laughing)

206
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,320
- You gonna get a good spot?

207
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,568
- [Male Off-Scree] Yeah.

208
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:02,740
- I feel like I'm gonna.

209
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,911
To answer your question, my
number one objective right now,

210
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:10,911
in general, is to make good traits alpha.

211
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,270
- Oh.

212
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,710
- So, what I'm real
passionate about right now

213
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,485
is making empathy and gratitude
and kindness cool as fuck.

214
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:19,815
(woman talking off stage)

215
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:21,080
- What, you like that?

216
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,155
- That's the black term for that.

217
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:24,632
- I know what it is.

218
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:26,882
(laughing)

219
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,088
- My God, what up, baby?

220
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:32,290
- How you doin', man.

221
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,123
- Good to see you, how are you?

222
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:33,956
- Good to see you too.

223
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:34,844
How's the weekend going?

224
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:35,677
- Real good.

225
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:36,510
- Ya ya, straight
forward, appreciate that.

226
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,443
- Thank you.

227
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:38,383
- You're what we need though,

228
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:39,366
- I'm tryin'.

229
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,787
- You got that social impact.

230
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:41,703
- Truth.

231
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:44,190
- [Gary] There's nobody that
makes it in to the league

232
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,364
without sacrificing things,

233
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,160
and I think successful
entrepreneurs is the lead.

234
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,010
There's nobody who's hit it,
who did it, who got lucky.

235
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,300
People love lucky, people love excuses,

236
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,360
you're in control of your shit.

237
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,870
The internet's changed everything.

238
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,530
Every excuse coming out of your mouth,

239
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,380
the answer is d-am, because the internet

240
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,360
has changed everything.

241
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,950
We haven't calibrated how big it is.

242
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,270
There's no middle man, there's no system,

243
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,020
there's no old white dude stopping you.

244
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,350
Go do your thing.

245
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,870
This internet thing is real as fuck,

246
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,770
and so for me, I just think
it's the greatest time

247
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,570
to be alive, and if you're not winning,

248
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,040
during this era of internet at scale,

249
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,270
and fuckin' nine straight
years of economic growth,

250
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,749
then you suck.

251
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:30,166
(friendly chattering and beat music)

252
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,080
How many people under
30, raise your hands,

253
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,720
right, right, tons of.

254
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,688
So one of the things I hate
is people shit on millennials,

255
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:47,480
they're the same, everything's the same.

256
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,340
You knew lazy people, you
knew hard-working people.

257
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,260
Millennials have so many advantages,

258
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,627
under 30 has so many advantages.

259
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:56,284
Actually the only
disadvantage I think they have

260
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:58,810
is they haven't been
punched in the mouth yet.

261
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,340
They haven't lived through 2008, or 2001.

262
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,680
There's a lot of people in here over 40

263
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,610
who are rich on paper,
or made it in 2001, 2006,

264
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,860
and then the economy got fucked, right?

265
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,230
It's real cool when you're
an Instagram influencer

266
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,270
and making $100,000 in sponsorship deals,

267
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,920
until the world melts and
those brands aren't paying.

268
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,055
Ya so, here we are.

269
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,750
Listen to me, I'm going crazy right now,

270
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,366
and Twitter probably posted like 17 posts,

271
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:32,780
it's the same thing, my face red,

272
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,210
and all it says is, and question mark.

273
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,917
The level of excuses, you
know, my parents did this,

274
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,740
I grew up there, their
stuff sucks, mine's better,

275
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,590
debt, my boss fuckin' sucks
and he's suppressing me.

276
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,770
The answer to everything is, and ?

277
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,610
Like what are you gonna do about it?

278
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,670
And, what the fuck are you
gonna do about it, right?

279
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,310
Sitting and complaining
does jack fuckin' shit.

280
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,960
And so no matter what you tell me,

281
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,880
you email me, you dm me,
you spill everything.

282
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,700
I got compassion, I got empathy,
but after I absorb that,

283
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,830
and show you that I care, the
answer is always going to be,

284
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,663
and ?

285
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,590
What the fuck are we gonna do about it.

286
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:19,600
Way-on, just made a piece of cut-cut.

287
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,840
It's so true.

288
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,290
Well, I got a ticket for you.

289
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,283
Ya, you're comin' in.

290
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,990
So my big fear right now is like,

291
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,840
look, be smart, be thoughtful,
like build something

292
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,230
that you can control.

293
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,090
Like, everybody cryin' about Instagram

294
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,720
and Facebook's algorithm.

295
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,370
It was free, you built on it for free,

296
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,890
so they changed it because
the attention of that user

297
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,900
is everything, that's what matters,

298
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,020
and so they're gonna do
it, what's right for them,

299
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,020
and so if you're crying that
your organic reach dropped,

300
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,210
then fuckin' work,
start a fuckin' podcast,

301
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,480
fuckin' start a newsletter, do something

302
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,660
instead of crying that you got 7,000 likes

303
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,008
instead of 11,000, you fuckin' loser.

304
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:00,857
(laughing)

305
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:01,690
It's true!

306
00:10:02,942 --> 00:00:00,000
(drum and bass beats)
