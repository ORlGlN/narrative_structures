1
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:03,172
- Headed to Portland, early morning.

2
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:07,541
Red-Eye back, grinding on this Monday.

3
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:09,947
Let's do it.

4
00:00:09,947 --> 00:00:13,114
(Southern rock music)

5
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,273
♫ Am I too dangerous

6
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:33,677
♫ For you dear

7
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:35,813
♫ Scared of a little smoke

8
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:38,061
♫ And the music's too loud for your ears

9
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,659
♫ You've been wasting

10
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,878
- We're running early.

11
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:43,167
- It's so impressive.

12
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,792
It's like, literally the first time

13
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,325
I ever heard such a thing.

14
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:48,043
Already been covered based on
what you guys know about me,

15
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:49,413
based on what you know about them?

16
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,131
Where do you think you want me to go?

17
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:51,964
- We've been think-

18
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,465
- [Assistant] And I think
the one topic traveled-

19
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:54,417
- Offense?

20
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:56,000
- [Assistant] Yeah.

21
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:01,847
- Yeah, there's also
already questions asked.

22
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:04,563
♫ Then you want to see

23
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:06,851
♫ That the glorious

24
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:09,101
(laughter)

25
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:11,983
- Is it one of those thin ones?

26
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:14,397
I see yeah, this much
time for the whole thing.

27
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:15,230
- [Assistant] Okay, killer.

28
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,063
And do you want that one?

29
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:18,531
- I may go a little bit
thank you economy on it too.

30
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:20,655
It's funny, I had a really
interesting text conversation

31
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,664
with AJ, had a six hour
flight this morning.

32
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,906
We were talking about Jamal Adams,

33
00:01:23,906 --> 00:01:25,823
the Jets rookie phenom,

34
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:28,295
I love this kid, so much charisma.

35
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,746
And we were talking about intangibles.

36
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:32,347
I really, really, really
want to talk about the gray.

37
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,216
The intangibles.

38
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:37,130
Really the reason why I have
not been physically gifted,

39
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,301
but still have won a lot of games,

40
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,891
because it's the intangibles,

41
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,389
it's not the black and white.

42
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:43,724
About to go on stage here in Portland.

43
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:44,595
Real pleasure, man.

44
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:45,428
- [Fan] Right on.

45
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:46,261
- Congratulations for everything.

46
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:48,438
- Yeah, thank you.

47
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,528
- [Announcer] If you
guys all could just...

48
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,025
Let's welcome to the stage Mr. Gary V!

49
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,275
(applause)

50
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,199
(classical music)

51
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,488
- Fuckin' intangibles,

52
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,567
like the stuff you can't measure,

53
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,622
you can't measure this, right.

54
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:07,165
You can measure how strong, or how fast.

55
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:09,208
You can measure how IQ smart,

56
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,043
you can measure how many hours.

57
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,540
You can measure all the black and white.

58
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,537
It's the gray intangibles that

59
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:15,884
are really the fundamental difference.

60
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:19,831
As you push yourself to be a
better fuckin' human being,

61
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:22,885
Better things start happening
for you in your actual

62
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:26,217
selfish business wants and needs.

63
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:29,607
And it comes from kindness,
it comes from patience.

64
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,151
It comes from a million different places

65
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,276
but it's slight little intangibles.

66
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:35,400
I never have to rush to the
arena, and I'm like, weirdo.

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,233
Hey, anybody?

68
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,072
Are we done?

69
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:38,024
- [Girl] Yeah one more, one more.

70
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,857
- [Gary] Yes, let's do it.

71
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:40,485
- The truth is undefeated.

72
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:41,368
Truth wins.

73
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:42,201
- Yeah.

74
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:43,910
- And so, I've become
comfortable in that truth,

75
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,246
even at my own peril.

76
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:49,413
I speak about my shortcomings
a lot more than I used to,

77
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:52,339
because if you're gonna embrace it

78
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,172
you've gotta embrace it fully.

79
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,005
- I know.

80
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:54,838
- It's playing a different game

81
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,763
than everybody else is playing.

82
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,713
It is that thing that makes people win.

83
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,385
I'm about to do this
interview for these guys.

84
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:01,638
For what the blog or?

85
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:02,471
- Yeah, for-

86
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,304
- Social?

87
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:04,137
Just content.

88
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:04,970
- Yeah, content.

89
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,803
- Just about to do some fuckin' content,

90
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,222
Stayed on stage forever,

91
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,941
got a big fire back home
that I've got to address,

92
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:11,855
got a phone call, gotta
get to the airport.

93
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:12,737
(laughter)

94
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:13,724
Meet and greet.

95
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:14,769
Let's do Rhodo.

96
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,023
- So I have two questions.

97
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:16,856
- Go ahead.

98
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:17,689
- Cool.

99
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:18,522
The first one's about Snapchat.

100
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:19,355
- Okay.

101
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:22,315
- So, I run the Snapchat for a franchise.

102
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:23,148
- Yeah.

103
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:24,974
- It's based out of Arizona.

104
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:25,821
(girl whoos)

105
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:26,654
Hey!

106
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:27,487
(laughter)

107
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:28,619
- I'm just like, it's up so early.

108
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:29,583
They had to catch a flight.

109
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,616
- She's a gangster.

110
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:31,449
- I know.

111
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:32,532
- That's your girl?

112
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:33,496
- Yeah I'm dating her.

113
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,040
- Dude, you're dating her?

114
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,712
Like, she's really your girl.

115
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:37,545
Okay.

116
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,125
That's Not exactly where I was going

117
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,681
but it makes it awesome.

118
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,514
Go ahead.

119
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,883
- So what is it?

120
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:47,265
What can I be doing-

121
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:48,345
- To make it better?

122
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:50,771
- Not only to make it better,
'cause like, well, damn,

123
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:51,979
yeah, I guess, but like-

124
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,185
- Do you want people
to come into the store?

125
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,018
- What's up?

126
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:56,983
- You want people to come
into the business right?

127
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:57,853
- Hell yeah.

128
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:00,059
- Let me throw a really
interesting curve ball at you.

129
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,323
You should literally take
the account right now,

130
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:03,565
look at it, and be like,

131
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:07,732
"Hey guys what can I do here
to make it better for you?"

132
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:11,785
Like one of the craziest moves in social

133
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:15,407
that I find fascinating is
just asking the audience

134
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:16,464
what they want.

135
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:20,166
You will be blown away by
how much feedback you get,

136
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,873
that will unlock, right?

137
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:22,710
Literally, like,

138
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,672
"Hey it's Rhodo," you know?

139
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:27,389
"I run the fuckin' ship for this store."

140
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,259
Like, "What up?

141
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,687
"I need you guys to tell,"

142
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,812
and now you've got, Snapchat's
legit now, you can just keep

143
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:33,356
holding it down so you're fucking good.

144
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,434
You don't even have the 10-second
bullshit anymore, right?

145
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:37,478
So you're just holding it
down, and you're like, fuckin',

146
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,101
"It's Rhodo, what up, like,
fuckin' run shit here,

147
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,818
"like, what do you guys
want on this Snapchat?"

148
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:43,851
Here's what's gonna happen.

149
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,314
80% of them are gonna be like,

150
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:46,824
"Give us free shit."

151
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:47,903
No shit, dick.

152
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:49,040
Yeah, exactly.

153
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,315
(laughter)

154
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:51,247
Which you can mix in.

155
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,035
By the way, I'm on a whole
kick at Wine Library now,

156
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:54,835
every Saturday we're just
giving away $10 worth

157
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:55,996
of gourmet food.

158
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,503
I'm like doing it, and like,
the ROI actually works,

159
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,429
so like, giving away free shit,
people like to shit on it,

160
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,507
it's kind of clever if
you've got something good.

161
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,597
'Cause the cost of entry is low,

162
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,931
but look, you know this.

163
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,183
People want entertainment.

164
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:12,818
And you're fucking entertaining
just on your fucking face.

165
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,052
(laughter)

166
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:14,885
You know?

167
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:15,802
- Thanks, brother.

168
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:16,635
- I mean it.

169
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,565
I believe you.

170
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,363
Remember when I talked
about, "Bet on your strengths

171
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,524
"and not your weaknesses?

172
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:25,984
Go fucking all Bill and
Ted's Excellent Adventure.

173
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:27,475
You know?

174
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:28,487
Go all, I mean it!

175
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:30,367
(applause)

176
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,620
I can taste it from this far away.

177
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,408
You'd be entertaining as fuck,

178
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:35,453
and it would bring people.

179
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:38,587
Make every fucking person
want to watch it for you and

180
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:41,792
fuckin' Larry the fuckin'
mop guy,'cause he's funny.

181
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,709
Like, create a fucking sitcom, bro.

182
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,958
- Thank you.

183
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,502
So, before I get to my second question-

184
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:49,335
- Yup.

185
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:50,557
- Would you mind if I took
that Snapchat right now?

186
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:51,390
- Yeah.

187
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,223
Let's do it.

188
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,725
- [Rhodo] I appreciate that.

189
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:55,223
(applause)

190
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:56,390
- Yeah, Rhodo.

191
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,726
- Alright, here we go.

192
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:01,976
- Go ahead bro.

193
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:05,440
- [Rhodo] What's up D.T. West Side?

194
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,690
(cheering)

195
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,743
I'm here with Gary V.

196
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:14,914
He's a huge motivational speaker.

197
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:16,829
- He never heard of me before today.

198
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,906
(laughter)

199
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:22,042
- [Rhodo] We're here and
we are curious to see

200
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:25,007
what you guys want to see
and we're curious to hear

201
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:28,084
what you guys want to
see on this Snapchat.

202
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:29,628
- Tell him!

203
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,211
Tell him what you fuckin' want!

204
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,051
Can we do that?

205
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,634
That's okay, right?

206
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:37,767
It's good, it's approved.

207
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,264
Approved from the top.

208
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:40,692
Approved from the top.

209
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,770
(cheering)

210
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,603
Yeah!

211
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:48,027
Thank you.

212
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,360
Thank you.

213
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,370
Thank you guys.

214
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,620
(cheering)

215
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:58,789
- [Fan] Thank you so much.

216
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,836
- Yeah, of course.

217
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:01,846
- [Interviewer] Where was
the first time that you ever

218
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:05,210
realized that you could
just really speak honest,

219
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,625
and you were like, "Oh, this
feels right, this feels good?"

220
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,715
- I think the most honest
place I've ever been

221
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:11,259
was in competition.

222
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,513
- [Fan] Great to see you.

223
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:13,346
- Thank you, brother.

224
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:14,463
What's your name?

225
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:15,296
- My name's Jamison.

226
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,129
- Jamison.

227
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:16,962
- Yeah.

228
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:17,795
Pleasure man.

229
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:18,628
Thanks for the love.

230
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:19,461
- Thank you!

231
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:20,294
- [Gary] Take care guys.

232
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:21,127
Bye, take care.

233
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:21,960
Thank you brother.

234
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,793
- Have a good day.

235
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:23,626
- Thank you.

236
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:24,459
Take care.

237
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:25,946
You know, the place where
I'm most honest was always

238
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,816
where I was competing.

239
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:31,286
Tennis, gym class hockey
was a very competitive thing

240
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:33,446
in my high school.

241
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:34,874
Backyard basketball, ping pong.

242
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:38,740
When business, when I
started to be in business,

243
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,375
I got very competitive.

244
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,664
I look at it as a sport,

245
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:43,997
so I go on tilt.

246
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,131
When I get competitive,

247
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,674
I go like a bull, like it comes red.

248
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,682
I guess when I started
really being out there as a

249
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:54,849
personality in my mid-30s,
the camera brought a level of,

250
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,889
I know somebody's
watching this in 39 years,

251
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,431
and I'm fascinated by that.

252
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:03,685
I don't know.

253
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:05,357
I think I'm trying to
discover the answer for you

254
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:06,402
and the audience.

255
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,818
I don't know.

256
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:11,023
I can tell you that I continue
to build momentum on it.

257
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,439
I don't know when I
first started doing it,

258
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,239
like going really there,

259
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,491
but I definitely do it more than ever,

260
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:17,617
'cause it's right.

261
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:18,697
The truth is undefeated.

262
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:19,614
Truth wins.

263
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:22,888
So, I've become comfortable in that truth,

264
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:24,223
even at my own peril.

265
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:27,497
I speak about my shortcomings a lot.

266
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:29,843
More than I used to.

267
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,876
Because if you're gonna embrace it,

268
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,082
you gotta embrace it fully.

269
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:35,415
(dramatic violin music)

270
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,728
Cancer's cancer.

271
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,539
That's why I always try to
be the best at what I do.

272
00:08:53,539 --> 00:00:00,000
'Cause I want nobody to
have leverage over me.
