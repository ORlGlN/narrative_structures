1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:02,763
- I've come to realize,
wow, I'm the human version

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:05,925
of my favorite thesis,
which is whoever is closest

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:07,820
to the consumer wins.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,153
(upbeat dramatic music)

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:16,907
The internet is where our lives will be.

6
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:18,544
There's a good chance a lot
of the youngsters in here

7
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:21,389
will literally sit in
a pod eight hours a day

8
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,920
and live their lives.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,965
It's real.

10
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:28,183
And so I think we need
to really wrap our heads

11
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:30,572
around what that means,
and so and I also think

12
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,412
we need to wrap our heads around how fast

13
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:34,197
I think this is actually gonna happen.

14
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:37,447
(groovy ambient music)

15
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:57,564
I think about Mariano Rivera,
he's a baseball pitcher,

16
00:00:57,564 --> 00:01:02,403
he's all time, and he's all
time and he had one pitch.

17
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:04,825
And I really think that's who I am,

18
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:06,834
I think I'm stunningly one dimensional,

19
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,259
but I'm so deep in this one thing

20
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:10,866
that it's gonna be able
to bring all of you value,

21
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:15,568
which is I'm really intuitive
about consumer attention

22
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,681
whether that's in a B to B environment,

23
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:19,144
whether that's in a B to C environment,

24
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:22,360
basically all I ever do
it comes natural to me,

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,682
it's my interest, it's
what I spend my time on,

26
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:26,748
it's actually how I see the world.

27
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:30,847
Like I actually see the
world through how do you make

28
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:33,830
the decisions that you
make, why do you make them?

29
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,884
To the jokes about politics,
to why he's wearing that shirt,

30
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:38,637
or why you're wearing your beanie,

31
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:41,145
like why we use to fashion to communicate,

32
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:44,152
you know, our facial hair,
like every single thing to me

33
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:46,880
is communication and it really matters

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,353
because this is probably the moment

35
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:52,186
that attention is being most disrupted

36
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:54,972
probably since the printing press.

37
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:57,041
What Guinness Beer Company did by creating

38
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,806
the Guinness Book of World Records,

39
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:00,580
they created the Guinness
Book of World Records

40
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,941
so people at pubs in the
early 1900s would talk

41
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,139
about silly things like who's the tallest,

42
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,821
reference the Guinness
Book of World Records

43
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:12,097
which would reinforce the brand Guinness

44
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:14,814
and make them order Guinness at a pub.

45
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:17,577
The reason you go to a three
star Michelin restaurant

46
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:21,547
or resort is because the Michelin
tire company 100 years ago

47
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:24,502
wanted people in France
and London to drive

48
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:28,003
outside of the main city
and use their gas stations

49
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:31,570
and use their tires up
so they started reviewing

50
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,969
restaurants in the countryside
under the Michelin guide

51
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:37,825
very positively to inspire the wealth

52
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,311
to leave for the weekend.

53
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:43,037
Media as advertising,
I think the old world

54
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:47,380
of Guinness and Michelin
is actually the new world.

55
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,219
If you don't live in a cell
phone mobile device world

56
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,338
in your mind and the apps on it,

57
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:55,907
50 percent of the time
spent on a mobile device

58
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:58,119
is spent on a social network.

59
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,801
The mobile device is
the most important thing

60
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:03,645
in our lives, and it grows every day.

61
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,747
And this is 50 percent
overall, it's not 50 percent

62
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:08,382
of 19 year olds, this is net 50.

63
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:11,935
If you are not advertising on and properly

64
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:15,743
on Facebook and Instagram
you're becoming irrelevant

65
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:17,542
by the second.

66
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:20,224
If you go to the private schools
in Greenwich, Connecticut,

67
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:22,999
when you get your birth
year, your license year,

68
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,559
and now what's interesting
is it's going younger,

69
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,875
your expectation is that
your parents don't buy you

70
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,162
a BMW or a Mercedes, your expectation

71
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:32,531
is that your parents
give you unlimited Uber.

72
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,404
The birthday present of
choice for a 16 year old girl

73
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:38,847
in Greenwich, Connecticut is
not a cherry red convertible,

74
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:41,099
it is unlimited Uber.

75
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,107
And the parents would rather have it

76
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:46,384
because it's the perception of safety.

77
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:49,447
I couldn't have sold a single
person on this 10 years ago.

78
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,977
10 years from today 14 year old girls

79
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,625
are gonna go into strangers'
cars on a nightly basis

80
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,328
and that's what the
parents want to happen.

81
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:00,221
Yeah, you could've never sold that.

82
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,775
I've come to realize,
wow, I'm the human version

83
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,841
of my favorite thesis which is,

84
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,361
whoever is closest to the consumer wins.

85
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,893
That's why I'm in a sense winning.

86
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:11,157
I think one of the most
fascinating things in the world is

87
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:13,433
the real celebrities are not
as famous as the influencers

88
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:16,208
anymore, and it's not
even close by the way.

89
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,077
A real celebrity is not as famous

90
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:21,653
as an influencer on
Instagram, they're just not.

91
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,462
They're just not, like you
can see on every metric

92
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:25,884
that you want.

93
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:27,963
Logan Paul sells way more merchandise

94
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:30,615
than any A list celebrity
and it's not even close.

95
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:33,527
Way more people watch Youtube vlogs

96
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:35,817
and follow Instagram celebrities.

97
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,407
I mean go look at the numbers.

98
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,938
Celebrities made a huge
mistake 'cause they were famous

99
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:41,744
and they were slow to Instagram,

100
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:43,236
they were embarrassed to go to Instagram

101
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:46,286
and have a small following
count so they never jumped in

102
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,379
and they just let all
the people get bigger

103
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,284
and bigger and bigger, it was ego.

104
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:54,271
Content that's bringing
people potentially value,

105
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:56,666
escapism, entertainment, information

106
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,673
is very different than buy my car,

107
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,395
buy my wine, buy my blouse.

108
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:02,113
It's just literally positioning.

109
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:05,770
Grey Goose at Wine Library
is 32 dollars a bottle,

110
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,216
feels one way.

111
00:05:07,216 --> 00:05:11,578
Grey Goose at Lava at a table
feels a totally different way

112
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,916
and is 500 bucks.

113
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,242
It's context.

114
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:15,929
Cardinalships are super interesting to me

115
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:20,805
'cause I'm fascinated by what
I call expiring employees,

116
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,928
meaning if there's somebody
sitting in a car dealership

117
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:26,238
waiting for a human being to come in

118
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,747
they could be doing something.

119
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:29,396
So for me what they could
be doing is searching

120
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:33,141
a 10 mile radius on
Twitter, somebody will Tweet

121
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:36,559
that they popped their tire
and they're on the side

122
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:40,205
of the road, in theory that salesperson

123
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,713
could jump into one of
your cars, drive over,

124
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,988
change the tire and drive them to work,

125
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:47,113
which then would create word of mouth

126
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,920
by maybe the local news
would pick up on it

127
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,570
and now you're building brand awareness.

128
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,799
There's so much smart shit you can do

129
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,037
once you make the switch.

130
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:59,158
Creative is the variable of success.

131
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,858
Once you make the switch
that this is the only world

132
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,471
now all of a sudden you do the homework,

133
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,944
now all of a sudden you
spend 15 hours reading

134
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:08,510
on Google how do I create a filter,

135
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,902
how do we run ads on Facebook,
how do you sell cars.

136
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:13,874
Like how do you sell
cars on Facebook, enter.

137
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,175
Do you know how much
information is there for free?

138
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,429
Unlimited.

139
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:20,679
(groovy ambient music)

140
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:28,005
Go to Spotify, maybe even
Apple Music right now

141
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:30,339
if my team can move fast before
we post this on the podcast,

142
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:34,707
open Spotify, search Monday
to Monday, T, O, Monday,

143
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:36,971
scroll all the way to
the bottom, playlists,

144
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,722
follow that playlist and get straight fire

145
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:41,789
every Monday morning.

- I've been doing phenomenal.
- Good.

164
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:17,395
- I've been working on my online presence

165
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,183
so far as Instagram.

166
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:21,568
I'm not sure if I'm doing
it right or whatever.

00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:36,565
- Yeah.

176
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:39,244
- But obviously you wanna
build your personal brand up.

177
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,904
Right?
- Yeah.

178
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:43,725
- And so ultimately to do
more books and more speaking

179
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,107
and make a living that way.

180
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:47,951
- Yeah, ultimately
that's what I want to do.

181
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:48,950
- I love it.

182
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,975
- Is write books and motivate
people and inspire them.

183
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,261
- Shane, help me understand, what do you,

184
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:56,200
when you said it was your side hustle now,

185
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,436
do you have a side job?

186
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,704
Do you have an actual job right now

187
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:00,118
and this is still your side hustle?

188
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:01,392
- Yeah.
- I figured.

189
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:03,502
- Yeah, I wash dishes.

190
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:05,174
- I remember, I remember still.

191
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:07,983
So how much time a day does that take up?

192
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:09,969
- A little over seven hours sometimes.

193
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:11,768
- And so how much time
are you able to work

194
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:14,032
on your brand and your side hustle?

195
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:15,716
- You know, for a couple hours before work

196
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:17,012
I sit there and you know?

197
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,081
- What are you doing?

198
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,998
- Replying, responding to people's,

199
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,167
people commenting and so forth online.

200
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,624
- On Facebook and Instagram, where?

201
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:28,607
- On Face, yeah.

202
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:31,530
- But you're not getting
too much engagement on,

203
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,806
you're not getting a lot of
comments on your posts, right?

204
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:34,967
- Right.

205
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,952
- So yeah, you don't, it's not taking up

206
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:38,890
a lot of time for you to comment back

207
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,771
because there's not a
lot coming in, right?

208
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:41,991
- Right.

209
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,092
- So then what are you,
are you seeking out

210
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,066
conversations then?

211
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,527
When you say in the morning
you're spending time.

212
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,630
- Oh well.

213
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,801
- Are you leaving comments?

214
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,447
- Actually I've been
spending a lot of time

215
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:58,970
watching your videos
and getting, you know?

216
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,820
- Motivated.

217
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,225
- Basically doing research.

218
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,196
- Understood, which is
okay, which is okay.

219
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:07,274
Have you started going
into other people's content

220
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:09,492
and becoming a bigger
part of the community?

221
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:12,417
I believe that if you leave your two cents

222
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,540
and let's call this the 18 cent strategy,

223
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,619
let's make it up right here on the spot.

224
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:21,217
I want you to start deploying
the 18 cent strategy.

225
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:25,384
You're gonna drop a $1.80
a day, two cents at a time,

226
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:32,101
nine top posts times 10
different hashtags every day

227
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,945
and that will massively
build up your audience.

228
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:38,556
You're gonna leave a $1.80 in karma,

229
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:42,473
a $1.80 in community, a
$1.80 in your thoughts.

230
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:44,906
You're not gonna spam.

231
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:45,739
- Yeah.

232
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:47,106
- I see people on my account all the time,

233
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:48,795
follow me, follow me,
you're not gonna spam.

234
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:49,628
- Yeah.

235
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:52,579
- You're gonna part of
the gratitude, thankful,

236
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,992
be present, choose happiness,
positivity community.

237
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:56,825
- Okay.

238
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:58,674
- Shane everybody wants to talk.

239
00:09:58,674 --> 00:09:59,507
- Yeah.

240
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:03,480
- The way to win is to
listen and then contribute.

241
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,174
Everybody wants to talk,
everybody wants to put a picture

242
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:08,020
of themselves like you
looking cool running.

243
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,853
- Yeah.

244
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:11,329
- But I looked at your social
and just like 99% of people

245
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:13,407
watching, nobody's listening yet.

246
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,450
That's okay, that's
not discouraging to me.

247
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,528
Nobody listened to me at first either.

248
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,152
Let me say it one more
time, for over a year

249
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:24,135
nobody watched my god
damn shows on Youtube.

250
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:27,585
The way to be discovered is to
either put our great content,

251
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,791
have one great piece of content, go viral,

252
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,498
and then everybody discovers you.

253
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:35,666
Or the way I like it, become
part of the community.

254
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,371
You will pick up three
to four followers a day

255
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,787
that are meaningful.

256
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:42,109
That means you'll get 100
meaningful people in a month.

257
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,071
That means you'll put a piece of content

258
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,393
and if one of 'em is special that's,

259
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:48,954
it's just amazing how it works.

260
00:10:48,954 --> 00:10:50,817
But this will keep you fresh.

261
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,373
You know what's also great about it?

262
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,950
The hidden great part of this,
you're gonna get exposure,

263
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,086
you're gonna get some followers,

264
00:10:57,086 --> 00:11:00,233
you're gonna contribute, and
be a great community member.

265
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,740
But you're also gonna learn
because you're gonna watch

266
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,637
and consume 90 pieces of content

267
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:09,091
that are doing well on Instagram,

268
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:13,230
which is then gonna inspire
and help you strategize

269
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,922
the content that you yourself

270
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:16,353
are gonna put out on Instagram.

271
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:19,462
That's a good use of three hours a day.

272
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:22,582
In the morning, during your lunch break,

273
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,706
while all the dishes are drying,

274
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:28,282
when you get home, tried
and true, every day,

275
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:31,536
gratitude, empathy, kindness,
striving, motivation,

276
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:34,273
motivational Monday,
you pick the hashtags,

277
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:38,696
they're unlimited, and
they all have a top nine.

278
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:40,496
Let's do one together.

279
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:43,247
And Shane, nothing trumps the work.

280
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,558
You can be here for a
whole week, a whole day,

281
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:47,311
you can spend your life with me.

282
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:48,971
What's that old adage, right?

283
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:51,746
Show a horse how to
drink the water, right?

284
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,265
Or show somebody how to fish.

285
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:56,087
Right, they never have the, help me here.

286
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:59,138
- [Audience Member] It's if
you show someone how to fish.

287
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:00,795
- They'll never have a day in life that.

288
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,606
- [Audience Member] I
literally did that yesterday,

289
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:04,508
and I was like what's
that fucking quote again?

290
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,324
- Bottom line is instead
of giving you some fish

291
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:07,612
to eat right now I'm gonna teach you

292
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:09,074
how to eat fish the rest of your life.

293
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:11,474
I want you to do that 89 more times today.

294
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:12,307
- Right on.

295
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,613
- I'm being dead serious.

296
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:14,446
- Yeah.

297
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:15,468
- I'm glad you're here man.

298
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,373
- Yeah, I'm glad, I'm glad.

299
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:17,946
- It was a really good moment for me.

300
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,131
- Yeah, thank you very much.

301
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:19,964
Can I get a selfie?

302
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,251
- 100 percent.

303
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,491
That's a good post for Instagram.

304
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,423
- Right on.

305
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,985
(groovy dramatic music)

306
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,714
- I need some coff.

307
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,815
(groovy ambient music)

308
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:32,894
So let me give you a piece of advice.

309
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:35,933
Gather as much attention as you can,

310
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:39,261
as much as you can, because
you're gonna trade on that

311
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,446
to your point.

312
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:43,046
No matter what comes out of
your guys' collective mouth,

313
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,521
we're gonna start a beverage business,

314
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:45,971
we're gonna start, we're
gonna create our own,

315
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,650
we're gonna create our own label,

316
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,430
we're gonna start a, we
want a Beats by Dre moment,

317
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,427
it's gonna be that
fucking red ass fly thing.

318
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:55,306
Like whatever the fuck
you guys are gonna say

319
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:58,536
all of it is gonna trade
on one currency, attention.

320
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,504
The fuck am I doing?

321
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:03,279
I'm just gathering so much attention

322
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,782
and then I get to deploy it.

323
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,218
My K Swiss collab outsold
Future and The Weekend.

324
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:09,995
That makes no fucking sense.

325
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:12,444
Like this much sense.

326
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:14,708
Because I'm more attention
than people realize

327
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,878
and my attention's deep,
those guys have more attention

328
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:20,444
than I do, but it's
scattered on other things

329
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:22,870
and there isn't that, there's
connection, that'd be unfair.

330
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,722
But like.

331
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:25,259
- Focused.
- That's right.

332
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,334
What I want for you and
anybody else in your position,

333
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:32,013
this young, this much talent,
this kind of collective crew,

334
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:34,177
you know to me it's like,
it's why I always thought

335
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:36,383
Drake was playing it right,
and here's what's smart

336
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,655
about what Drake did and I
had no idea if this is what

337
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:40,914
they thought, I just don't know.

338
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:43,236
But the volume of projects that he put out

339
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,964
speaks to my thesis
which is when you're hot

340
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:48,808
fucking like when you got the best hand

341
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:50,759
fucking keep playing it.

342
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,220
I think the other thing
that I'm obsessed with

343
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,531
is who you collaborate with.

344
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:58,073
Louis Vuitton and Under Armour and Reebok

345
00:13:58,073 --> 00:14:01,205
and everybody else, they're all
in deep fucking shit my man.

346
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:04,278
That game is over, I'm glad
your reaction, they're all dead.

347
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,560
- We were just talking
about that yesterday.

348
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,999
- Guys, guys, they're all dead.

349
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,393
Here's what that means.

350
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:11,181
Instead of worrying about that right now,

351
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:13,816
go deep as fuck into attention grabbing,

352
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:16,602
pop back out in 24
months, you'll get pieces

353
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,686
of equity in Nautica.

354
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:22,018
Fuck a deal, just a little
more patience right now

355
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:23,975
at the time that it's the hardest

356
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:26,842
because you've been fucking
eating shit and now you're here,

357
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:28,125
but you're here.

358
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,376
Do you know what I mean?

359
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:30,615
- I know what you're saying.

360
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:32,241
- And what's crazy is
right now is why everybody,

361
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,846
this is why most people don't win,

362
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:35,863
this is the time that you
go even more shit eating,

363
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:37,767
not the reverse.

364
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,043
And it's so counter
cultural, 'cause you guys

365
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:42,513
were all talking about this
day for fucking every day

366
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,582
for the last 2,000 days in a row,

367
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:47,554
and now you're here and
you think you're here,

368
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,913
and it's like no, no, no.

369
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:51,118
And that's what I did, I
fucking invested in Facebook,

370
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:54,857
Twitter, Uber, everything,
I was here, I did it.

371
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:57,040
And I decided to build
a client service agency,

372
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,511
go into clients and eat shit
in the prime of my career.

373
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:02,148
So I'm giving you advice I took

374
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:04,735
and now I'm really here,
and I'm still not really,

375
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:06,513
you know eventually like
the longer you can hold

376
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:08,202
your breath, you win.

377
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:10,552
I'll give some love, I'll
get some followers for you.

378
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,454
♪ Money all around me ♪

379
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,608
♪ I look like I'm the man ♪

380
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:16,479
♪ Yeah ♪

381
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,312
- Hi.

382
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:18,337
- I got a weird handshake so I'll do it,

383
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:19,170
let's do a normal one.

384
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,035
- That is my normal one.

385
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,128
(laughter)

386
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,245
- I like the normal one.

387
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:25,100
(groovy music)

388
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,023
- Long day of meetings
here in headquarters.

389
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:30,265
- I gotta tell you this
'cause this is my son,

390
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:33,327
he'll kill me if I don't write,
so I sent him this, okay?

391
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,074
He goes I watch all of his speeches,

392
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:36,520
what is he training on?

393
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,522
And I said how to fuck the competition

394
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,508
and what they've done on
social, blah, blah, blah.

395
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,284
And then he goes I love that guy,

396
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:44,304
please get a pic with him
and tell him I say thank you

397
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:46,508
for existing to fire me the fuck up.

398
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:47,509
- What's his name?

399
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:48,588
- His name is Christian.

400
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,008
So we have to do, we have to send him,

401
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:51,592
you have to send him like a little clip.

402
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:53,868
- We're going video first.

403
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:56,815
Christian, I got a serious
question Christian,

404
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,774
why is your paps here and you're not?

405
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,681
Where the fuck are you Christian?

406
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,527
See you soon.

407
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,214
- All right, thanks a lot.

408
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,510
- All right, let's sit down.

409
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,643
The question becomes, you know,

410
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:08,688
what are we talking about here?

411
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:12,136
There's a very big
difference between going out

412
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,531
to you know, Vegas for
the weekend to hook up

413
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:18,144
and go to Tao every night versus going out

414
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,314
to networking events or
even going out socially

415
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,579
as a proxy to the
networking that you need.

416
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,749
For example, booking
agents and the people,

417
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:31,083
like I know where people
that book talent go,

418
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,757
they're not where you and
your friends want to go.

419
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,464
They're two very different places.

420
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:38,289
They're very different
bars, the timing of when

421
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,092
they hang out are different.

422
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:43,170
If you're asking me should
I go out to, you know,

423
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,506
you know, you know, a club at
one o'clock in the morning,

424
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,032
I'd be like no, that's you actually,

425
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,830
if you, you know, that's you going out.

426
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,817
If you're asking me
should you go to The Grill

427
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:56,423
at six PM where you
could be getting a drink

428
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,759
just working on your phone
and the person next to you

429
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:03,365
is booking people for a
runway place for real.

430
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:05,441
Should you do that, yes.

431
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,117
There's a very clear difference
between work and play.

432
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:13,284
I'm going out to play but
maybe I'll run into business.

433
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,178
- [Audience Member] I don't
wanna play, like that's the.

434
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:19,852
- Respect, so don't,
but networking matters.

435
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:21,674
You know what's amazing
about the modern world?

436
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,821
This fucking thing.

437
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:24,526
You know, go into The Grill in 1984

438
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,519
and hoping to find a talent agent

439
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,686
or whatever the fuck is on
the play sucked because,

440
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:37,399
because you sat there
like a fucking jerk off

441
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:39,462
if nothing was happening.

442
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:42,123
You'd go to The Grill
in 1984, you'd sit down,

443
00:17:42,123 --> 00:17:43,485
and you'd have to like look around

444
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:45,029
and like people are thinking
you're trying to hit on them.

445
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,725
Like it would be convoluted.

446
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,980
The fact that you can go
there and just start working

447
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,632
on your phone while you have a cocktail,

448
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:54,537
and if it plays, it plays, but if not

449
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,650
you basically just had a two
hour meeting with yourself

450
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,038
on your work, you could've
done that at the coffee shop,

451
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:00,561
you could've done that laying in your bed,

452
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,380
you could've done that right here.

453
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,336
That's fucking incredible, that is how,

454
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:08,617
that's the subtleties that we
don't give this credit for.

455
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:09,450
Got it?

456
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,612
That's big time.

457
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:15,862
(mellow ambient music)

458
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:18,836
- You're Gary, right?

459
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:19,982
- I am.
- I'm Raz.

460
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:20,815
- Hi Raz.

461
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:22,145
- Introducing myself, I went to your,

462
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:24,693
your talk at the Synergy
Global Forum two weeks ago

463
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:25,967
and I know who you are, and it was like

464
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,143
the most amazing thing ever.

465
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:27,976
- Thank you.

466
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,112
- And now I follow you, my
whole family follows you.

467
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:29,945
- Thank you.

468
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,002
- And now I'm like oh that's.

469
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:32,288
- Thank you Raz.
- But I work at L'Oreal.

470
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:33,121
- Oh very cool.

471
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,025
- So I was like it was so
funny 'cause I was like

472
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,491
oh my gosh, Vayner's in my building.

473
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,324
- That's awesome.

474
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,470
- How didn't I know about this?

475
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,372
But you were amazing, like seriously.

476
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,433
- Thank you so much.
- Like super inspiring.

477
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:40,496
- Thank you so much, that's awesome.

478
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:41,459
- So I didn't mean to like get in.

479
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:42,772
- Thank you, no worries, no worries.

480
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:44,564
Thank you so much for saying hello Raz.

481
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:48,064
(uplifting ambient music)

482
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,386
We're in Madison Square Garden.

483
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:05,383
We're branching out Jamal Adams.

484

485
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,553
See ya.
