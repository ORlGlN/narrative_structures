1
00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:02,703
- By the way, can somebody do
a quick quant run on how much

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,484
of the vlog has been in the car?

3
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:06,161
♫ I was down on my luck lookin' at the top

4
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:07,639
♫ I was on meds they wanted me to flop

5
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,190
♫ My own friends and
family tellin' me to stop

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,336
♫ Going insane seeing every doctor

7
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:12,805
♫ I been drinking too
much, thinking too much

8
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,223
♫ Everybody tell me I was dreaming to much

9
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,623
♫ I remember when music
ain't never paid me two bucks

10
00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:17,432
♫ Life is a battle and battles too rough

11
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:19,209
♫ Doctors told me i should take my pills

12
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:20,780
♫ For a bit I couldn't even pay my bills

13
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,857
- You're going up?
- Going up. Gonna talk to

14
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:22,995
D. Rock right quick.

15
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:24,242
I'll see you man, take care.

16
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:27,980
Just got off call with one of the sharks,

17
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,147
and just living the dream.

18
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:33,861
I wanna start doing this
more often in the vlog,

19
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:36,491
which is addressing opportunities
for a little bit of a rant

20
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:40,580
or a thought or three
cents, better than two,

21
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,455
around the emails that I read.

22
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:45,791
On these long flights, I
read a lot of your emails.

23
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:46,834
I can't respond to all of them,

24
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:50,469
getting thousands and
thousands a week at this point.

25
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:53,609
But I read them and I gather
thoughts and I try to get back

26
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:56,990
to some of you and some of you
get the emojis and the hearts

27
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,995
and the thanks and the
XOs and I send them to

28
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:00,940
some people on my team and
blah blah blah blah blah.

29
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,357
Anyway, theme of this flight:

30
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:08,478
people are asking for help
because they're stuck.

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,815
So many of you are stuck
cause you're not happy

32
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:13,727
with what you're doing and
something emerged to me,

33
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:15,663
and let's do a cool edit here D. Rock,

34
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:17,721
let's put the words right here.

35
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:21,141
It's either patience or it's action.

36
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:24,352
Like indecisiveness, sitting on it,

37
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:27,265
not doing anything about
it, is just not an option.

38
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:31,534
You can't fix being fucking
upset if you just sit there,

39
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:34,257
complain, and ponder all day in your desk,

40
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:38,100
or in class, or in your room,
because mom, or the teacher,

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,970
or the boss isn't doing the right thing.

42
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,150
The answer to literally
190 emails that I just got

43
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,754
is one of two things: either you wait,

44
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:50,540
and you're patient about it
and you just hold your breath,

45
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,325
eat shit, and come out the other side,

46
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:53,893
and eventually do something about it,

47
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:56,424
or you quit, or you tell
them to go fuck themselves,

48
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:58,114
or you do something about it.

49
00:01:58,114 --> 00:01:58,947
You start.

50
00:01:58,947 --> 00:01:59,895
You start tonight.

51
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:00,998
You don't watch TV,

52
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:03,330
you don't hang out, you don't
sit in your room and ponder,

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,982
you don't watch nine million
different motivational videos,

54
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:06,973
you just do.

55
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:08,773
The answer to the question, my friends,

56
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:11,398
is patience, or action.

57
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,219
- There's only two people I followed

58
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,067
or watched through this process,

59
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:17,227
it was you and Casey Neistat
cause I'm all about...

60
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,058
We have the same type of thing, it's like,

61
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:21,242
inspire, motivate, grind, hustle.

62
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,075
That's all.

63
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,619
- Two peas in a pod.
- Exactly, so just to meet--

64
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,493
- I'm flattered, man.
- That's good enough for me.

65
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:29,124
- It's a collab, you
know, to be on the vlog,

66
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:31,078
and then you be on my vlog.
- 100%. I love that stuff.

67
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:32,291
- So that's it.

68
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,439
I mean, I was talking to Tyler and D. Rock

69
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,214
and they were like, "Yeah,
you got 5-10 minutes,"

70
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:38,492
and I was like, "Oh dude, I'll
see you, that's all I need."

71
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,992
- Gimme both cameras, D. Rock.

72
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:45,860
I've never done a double camera.

73
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,693
Am I good?

74
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:49,031
- Yeah, you're good.
- Casey, it's me, hey.

75
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:50,846
Real quick, we're gonna meet this man.

76
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,289
This special kid.

77
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,948
This dude's doing it right.

78
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,831
I just asked him, I really
wanted to do something for him,

79
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:57,380
he's like, "Just one thing. Casey."

80
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,760
I know I'm putting you out like that,

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,780
but I'm calling you out, Case.

82
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,410
I'll text you in a little
bit, let's make it happen.

83
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,678
Are you gonna come to New York?

84
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:07,719
- I'm down, I'm down to come to New York.

85
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,791
- Casey, I love you.

86
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,161
But what I think matters most,

87
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:13,160
you know, this is gonna be
good advice for both channels,

88
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,028
you can't over-manipulate just

89
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,801
for the success of the metrics.

90
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:21,420
Once you let the math take
over the art, you're dead.

91
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,006
Like the soul has to come first,
you have to be thoughtful,

92
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:26,260
you can't just throw it up
there and be like, "Ooh."

93
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,677
But if it ever trumps the soul, you lose.

94
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:33,474
- Well I mean, that's the
thing I've always been telling

95
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,578
my viewers and people,
is that you have to be

96
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:37,779
100% passionate with what you do,

97
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,508
cause there's nights
where you don't sleep,

98
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:42,662
where you go crazy, and the
only thing that keeps you going

99
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:43,966
is your love for it.

100
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,829
'Cause you know, it's the same thing.

101
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,599
- I believe it the most
man, but I believe in it.

102
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,774
I got lucky.

103
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:50,180
I hated school so much--

104
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,941
- Same here.
- That I know the reverse.

105
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:55,627
I know what it feels like.
Like, I'm so special with

106
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:57,141
hard work and passion now,

107
00:03:57,141 --> 00:04:00,444
I was super not special when
it wasn't the right zone,

108
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,367
and I just generally think
there's millions of people

109
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,334
sitting and watching this right now

110
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:07,155
that are all-time special.

111
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:10,155
Painters, cooks, teachers, you know.

112
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:15,365
Recording artists, painters,

113
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:19,124
business men and women,
or corporate executives,

114
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:22,139
who are trying to be entrepreneurs.

115
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,139
It's about the matching.

116
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:27,657
I genuinely think that every
single person that we think

117
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:30,150
as famous would have not
been famous and great if they

118
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,895
picked the wrong thing.
- Yeah.

119
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,556
- I just don't know if I think
Beyonce would be the greatest

120
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:38,175
WNBA player of all time.
- Yeah.

121
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,887
- I just don't think that Michael Jackson

122
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:43,314
would have been an all
time great litigator.

123
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:44,339
Or an all time great litigator

124
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,566
would have been a great artist.

125
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,653
- Dude.
- I'm so glad we met.

126
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,470
- Thank you so much man.
- My pleasure, good luck

127
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,884
with everything. Such a pleasure, 100%.

128
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:54,231
- Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.

129
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:55,157
- Real pleasure.

130
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,258
Nice to meet you as well.

131
00:04:57,258 --> 00:04:58,216
Ready to rock?

132
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:01,447
I'm gonna be promoting it 24/7/365.

133
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:05,327
It's gonna be like, the GaryVee brand.

134
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:09,294
It's gonna be the new
addition to the brand GaryVee.

135
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:12,221
It'll just be in my ethos,
and I'm gonna right hook,

136
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:13,388
buy my brand--

137
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,212
God you can really smell it.

138
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:18,108
- You can smell it, huh?
- Fuck.

139
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,062
- It's wild how you really can.

140
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:22,479
- That's a real fucking fire.

141
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:26,973
Just wanna send all my love,
sorry, I'm doing a vlog.

142
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,265
I just want to send all
my love to my wine friends

143
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:32,190
in California, especially
in Napa, Sonoma Valley,

144
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,872
it's like I'm over here,
where are we, in Palo Alto?

145
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:37,872
- Menlo Park.
- Menlo Park and just smell

146
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:40,662
the ashes, and that whiff
right there just made me think

147
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:43,426
of all my buddies and all those
nights I've slept up there,

148
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,111
so I just want to wish
everybody, I know a lot of

149
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,802
wine makers and individuals whose

150
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,675
homes are already gone, and warehouses.

151
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:51,991
My November wine of the month,
zinfandel, for Thanksgiving?

152
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:55,513
Was in a warehouse the
day before it burned down,

153
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:57,846
so just a lot of love and...

154
00:06:00,432 --> 00:06:01,928
if for any reason anybody

155
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,384
connected to or former wine
friends in that region are

156
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:07,257
watching my vlog right
now and I can be of help,

157
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:10,081
gary@vaynormedia, please let
me know if I can be of help.

158
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:13,119
Hey vlog, just had an
interesting meeting with a lot

159
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,183
of characters that maybe
you've seen before.

160
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:17,158
All have been with me for a bunch of time,

161
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:21,325
two of three of them have been
my assistants, one wasn't.

162
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:25,964
Anyway, a big Facebook
talk about to go down here

163
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:28,894
in Menlo Park, looking forward to it.

164
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:31,440
Good day so far. Productive.

165
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,357
Some pure wow meetings.

166
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:37,287
We're gonna bang out this talk with

167
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:41,991
some potential clients
probably, and shoot out to LA.

168
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,491
We're leaving you. Here we go.

169
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:48,073
- [Bob] You're sitting
across from a client.

170
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:51,315
A CEO, a CMO, the whole C-Suite,
and you're talking about

171
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:53,444
what your philosophy and beliefs are.

172
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:56,574
So you go in, and I think we
all know you're pretty bold,

173
00:06:56,574 --> 00:07:00,168
right, you're very honest,
what is the typical reaction

174
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:04,426
you get when you talk to a
Fortune 100 company C-Suite?

175
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:06,520
- It runs the gamut of, first of all,

176
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,185
it's 100% selfish on their side of it,

177
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:10,186
as it should be, we're
all selfish, we're humans,

178
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:12,124
so either they view me as something that

179
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:15,452
can be a benefit to them,
as a gateway to a better job

180
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:20,259
or a learning or a connection,
but when it comes to

181
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,259
the merit of what I'm talking about,

182
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,508
I think as a human, as Sally and Rick,

183
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,019
after about two or three hours,

184
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,929
I think they agree, or
they intuitively agree.

185
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:35,372
I think as executive in a
company, they have the politics

186
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,803
of the AOR or things of that nature.

187
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,052
I mean we have real life
stuff, we have people who

188
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:41,364
look me dead in the face and say,

189
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:42,765
"I'm desperate to do business with you,

190
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:44,165
but my CO's best friends
with Martin Sorrell,

191
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:47,230
and we can't have a non-WPP
agency in this building."

192
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,992
And I'm like, I
understand, because listen,

193
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:50,406
I get the benefit of somebody wanting

194
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:52,555
to take a selfie with me and
Vayner Media gets the business.

195
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,835
I understand how the world
works, it's all coming at

196
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:58,764
the detriment of the
brands, so what do I think?

197
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:01,697
I think the biggest COs
in the world trade on

198
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,293
when they're retiring and
what the stock prices are when

199
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:06,203
they retire so that they can liquidate,

200
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,293
and that the things that I require

201
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:10,761
or beg people to do takes investment.

202
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,877
When you do investment, your stock price

203
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:14,543
goes down in the short-term,

204
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:16,522
and that is not as interesting to do.

205
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:19,595
I think a lot of people aren't really sure

206
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:21,751
if I'm right or not, am I
completely full of shit or not,

207
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,039
like they're disconnected sometimes from--

208
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,914
I mean, directors of marketing

209
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:28,882
are disconnected from
the practitioner-ship.

210
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:31,689
The C-Suite is like, I
think they intuitively know,

211
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,339
and this is why this is the
tone of my conversation,

212
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,416
there's nothing I'm saying
here that not everybody knows,

213
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,592
just not the conversations we're having.

214
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:42,844
But it doesn't make it wrong.

215
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:45,129
And I think that's the thing
that I'm passionate about.

216
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:48,166
And by the way, I started
VaynerX, Vayner Media,

217
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,001
to buy businesses, like I'm
spending a 10 year process

218
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:55,168
of learning, but I believe
so much in the negative of

219
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,376
what we're actually doing
that I built an entire company

220
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:02,448
and I'm holding my breath for
a decade to buy the businesses

221
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,406
that are gonna be sold
for a penny on the dollar

222
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:05,924
once the carnage comes,

223
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:09,208
which I believe happens in
the next 10 to 15 years.

224
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,535
Like for me, it's super
extreme, like to me,

225
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,863
the reason I want to get
the clients that I want

226
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:16,747
is cause we do the stuff I believe in.

227
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:19,111
Sour Patch Kids became
the fastest growing candy

228
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,771
because I got them off TV
and went into Instagram

229
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:26,076
and Snapchat four years ago
where 12-15 year olds lived.

230
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,277
I'm not a genius, you all
know that's where they live.

231
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,288
Anything you wanna do
for somebody under 30,

232
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:33,787
how can you possibly do the
traditional above-the-line work?

233
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:35,904
Or the things that we accept in digital.

234
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:38,529
I'm more worried about
traditional digital a lot of times

235
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:39,964
than I am traditional.

236
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:41,257
There's a lot of things we do in digital

237
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:44,672
that is accepted on CPM value
that has no practicality,

238
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:47,734
no context, the creative has no context

239
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,161
to the platform that
it's being delivered on,

240
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:52,781
which gives us no chance
as true marketers,

241
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:56,282
and so to me it's just,
I didn't know all of this

242
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:58,434
seven years ago when
I started the company,

243
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,900
somewhere around two or
three years ago I'm like,

244
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,733
"Oh shit.

245
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,534
Okay. Right.

246
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,474
Nobody's incentivized

247
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:06,601
to do the right thing for the logo."

248
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:09,502
And so that's a big opportunity.

249
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:11,188
And that's what happens,

250
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:13,661
that's why IBM lets Microsoft happen,

251
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:15,387
that's why Microsoft lets Google happen.

252
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:19,832
That's just what happens,
and so I think over

253
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:21,899
the next 20 years the
Fortune 500 turns over

254
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,551
in an extreme way and I
think that there will be

255
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:27,482
a book written about the
five holding companies

256
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:29,428
pulling one of the great business heists

257
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,191
in modern day history
because I think they're

258
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:34,547
extracting the value out of
the biggest brands in the world

259
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:37,282
with the advice and strategies
that they're giving.

260
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:39,494
And honestly, I think good for them,

261
00:10:39,494 --> 00:10:42,181
I don't think it makes them
bad, this is capitalism,

262
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:43,874
they're doing what's
right for their business.

263
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:47,317
I'm flabbergasted that the
clients are letting it happen.

264
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:50,683
- We're gonna go to questions in a minute,

265
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,828
this is too fucking good.

266
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:54,326
- Just two now, we keep changing.

267
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:58,813
One thing that has emerged
for me when I speak,

268
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:00,603
by the way, can someone
do a quick quant run

269
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:03,352
on how much of the vlog has been in a car?

270
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:06,352
19.6% of DalyVee, 307 episodes.

271
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,531
89%. Get it man.

272
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:11,817
Anyway, this is really interesting.

273
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:13,550
Kind of had that rant the other day about

274
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,078
selling something you believe in.

275
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:18,520
It's really, I guess I'm
eating my own dog food.

276
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,912
Getting high on my own supply,

277
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,722
just absolutely doing
that every time on stage,

278
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:25,163
just will not waver no matter how

279
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:27,825
comfortable or uncomfortable
it is in the short term.

280
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:31,111
Being historically correct
and saying what I believe

281
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:34,953
is probably what's most
resonating with you guys, right?

282
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:38,399
At the end of the day, I feel
like there's a very distinct,

283
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,218
slight difference between me

284
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:43,125
and the majority of what's out there,

285
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,325
which is not being at the mercy of

286
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:48,352
this being my livelihood,

287
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:52,994
gives me the ability to
have a one-track mind,

288
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:55,313
which is to bring you guys
the most value possible

289
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,813
with no expectation in return.

290
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:01,753
That's what's happening on stage, man.

291
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,869
I just don't care if they become
Vayner Media clients or not

292
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,408
like everybody else does who talks.

293
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:07,098
I just don't give a fuck.

294
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:09,424
- [Cameraman] I know three and a half.

295
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,959
You were in screaming that
that billboard didn't work,

296
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,209
and commercial didn't work.

297
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:21,760
Why are you so much more confident
and good at what you are?

298
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,825
- I'm just getting closer to my time.

299
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:28,264
When I first find
something, voice, right now.

300
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,271
Wait until you see how
confident I look on voice

301
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:32,271
in DailyVee Episode 719.

302
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,003
Like, the part--

303
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:39,824
- [Cameraman] You play in the
market and then you wait for--

304
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:42,764
- When I'm early but not
too early, I'm like okay,

305
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:44,764
here we are, here it is,

306
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,423
but I know those early
days are like, "What?"

307
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:51,854
- [Cameraman] One thing I like about it...

308
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,785
What you were doing DailyVee
with Patrick, the voice guy--

309
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:59,952
- Dude, do you understand what
the guys, if you understood.

310
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:05,640
God if you watched DailyVee
2006, 7, 8, you'd shit.

311
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,127
You'd fucking shit.

312
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:09,049
No matter what you fucking
think of me right now,

313
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,891
if you saw the shit coming out of my mouth

314
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,001
eleven fucking years ago, that is straight

315
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,742
to the fucking point 100% on,

316
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:18,607
you still think it's fucking futuristic,

317
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,672
or you take it for granted
cause it's the only way

318
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:23,351
and don't even realize eleven
years ago people still debated

319
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,518
if social media was going to be a fad.

320
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,594
Alright, I have to go, I love you.

321
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:41,594
See ya. Bye.

322
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:50,431
Hello, Phil.
(laughter)

323
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:54,108
- Walking out of San Francisco
International Airport.

324
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:57,394
I have no business being here whatsoever,

325
00:13:57,394 --> 00:14:00,240
other than to do another
airport meeting with Gary.

326
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,665
I bought another refundable ticket

327
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,508
to meet him in the
airport, spent 15 minutes.

328
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:10,675
Make some big moves, got in
there by the skin of my teeth.

329
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,836
(rap music)

330
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,900
- We left Phil at the Facebook meeting.

331
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,362
He rushed here to the airport.

332
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:27,642
He's not even supposed to be here.

333
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:30,074
We had out meeting and we
accomplished many great things.

334
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:31,958
We'll look back at this film and be like,

335
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,192
"Shit, that's where we
made all of our money."

336
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:35,794
- Yeah. Some of our money.

337
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:37,657
- And Phil's very optimistic for the Jets

338
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:39,114
beating the Patriots this weekend.

339
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:42,649
I am a little less optimistic
but cautiously hopeful.

340
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,999
Phil's 100% confident the Jets will win

341
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,836
because we have chemistry.
- It matters.

342
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:50,169
(rap music)

343
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:06,994
- 8:41 here in LA. Makes a long day.

344
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:10,077
Question of the day is really simple.

345
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,244
What I wanna hear from
you guys on YouTube,

346
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:19,813
very simply, is what's
top of mind right now?

347
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:23,137
What's the white space
that you're trying to fill?

348
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:24,775
And more importantly,

349
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:26,633
if you're not trying
to fill a white space,

350
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,399
what did this question make you think of?

351
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,667
Answer it.

352
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,526
I'm going to look at every fucking answer.

353
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,859
(rap music)

354
00:15:46,090 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughter)
