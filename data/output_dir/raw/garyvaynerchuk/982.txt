00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,509
middle is and why it sucks glad this is

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,090
a great question you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the</font>

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,070
middle is the commodity work and

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,009
thinking that everybody else does

6
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,599
meaning it's what the markets doing

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,449

everybody's been doing for the last five

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">years it's it's commodity work you know</font>

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,320
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to</font>

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,939
break things you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a good job</font>

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,520
or back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clouds and dirt non middle if</font>

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,620

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,270

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,329
guys are just doing the work they're

19
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,489
like in the weeds they're not doing the

20
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,219
big holistic branding thinking

21
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,730
game-changing stuff they're just

22
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,550
executing but at a raw level I just find

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,969
there's not that many hardcore

24
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,980
practitioners and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> even less big</font>

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,859
