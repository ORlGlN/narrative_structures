00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,960
- How to turn 100 bucks into 1000?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,570
I'll tell you how to turn zero into 1000.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,250
Go to Craigslist, where's
my Craigslist video?

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,620
Turn off the music Avi.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,465
Honestly I think I just
eliminated for the first time--

6
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:12,720
(beeping)

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,280
I think I just eliminated
for the first time

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,900
in my career the excuse of no money.

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,700
We think a lot about
money and opportunity.

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,830
Let me tell you about an opportunity

11
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,240
that I can't get out of my head.

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,360
This is like a big day for me.

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,710
Literally for 30 years, I've had to like

14
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,860
pay under to that excuse.

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,693
It's over.

16
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:29,970
There's a website called craigslist.com,

17
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,500
under the sales section,

18
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,870
there's a free section underneath that.

19
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,060
Where people list shit
that they wanna get rid of.

20
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,010
Go take it, for free 'cause most people

21
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,120
just want you to pick it up

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,490
'cause it's bigger or what have you.

23
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,150
If you happen to actually
have like a truck

24
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,985
or like a bigger vehicle,

25
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:47,610
then you are really set.

26
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,210
Carry this shit on the bus.

27
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,623
If you're broke, grab this, go on the bus,

28
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:55,350
sit on the bus like this,
everybody's gonna look at you,

29
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,200
be like yeah, yeah, yeah, keep laughin',

30
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,100
come home, take a picture.

31
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,410
And then you list it on
Facebook Marketplace,

32
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,140
the arbitrage of the internet.

33
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,040
We see this in retail
where people buy things

34
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,210
and trying to post on Amazon.

35
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,630
15 bucks, somebody's like
yeah I'll take your table.

36
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,463
Ding dong.

37
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:12,260
Yo hello, here you go.

38
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,560
And you sell it.

39
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,700
And when I think about this, I can't,

40
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,790
I've been dreaming about this

41
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,550
for the last 72 hours by the way.

42
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,110
The much more humble version
when you've got nothing,

43
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,040
if you're just sitting
like, I need money like,

44
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,873
all those people that were like,

45
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:27,320
yo can somebody buy me Gary
Vee's book I can't afford it?

46
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,450
That means, you know, $17.

47
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,410
I think it's like $300 a week.

48
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,600
If you take your 6:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M.

49
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,900
Monday and Tuesday picking up shit

50
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,680
and then reposting it
on Facebook Marketplace

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,250
and then meeting people on Saturday

52
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,670
to come to your home and grab it.

53
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,237
And then somebody's gonna say but damn,

54
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,260
it's gonna take 40 minutes to go there,

55
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,450
40 minutes to take on the
bus, five minutes to post,

56
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,660
seven minutes, I'm like

57
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,270
but what are you doing
with your time anyway?

58
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,350
You're laying on the phone
going on people's accounts

59
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,450
who are fuckin' winning
saying this guy's bullshit.

60
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,890
'Cause that's what you're
doing with your time

61
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,760
when you're losing.

62
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,560
It's crazy to me that the
only thing that stops somebody

63
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,289
from winning is education
and the work ethic, right?

64
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,359
I understand that.

65
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,440
But education comes in
so many different forms.

66
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,560
Go to Craigslist, get free
shit from the free section,

67
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,090
take it and then put it on
Facebook Marketplace and sell it.

68
00:02:19,090 --> 00:00:00,000
Zero to 1000 Steve, zero to 1000.
