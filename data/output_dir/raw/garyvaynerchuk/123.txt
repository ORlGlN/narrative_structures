1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:02,212
All-time great traveler.

2
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,753
No fuck!

3
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,258
(laughter)

4
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:08,071
that maybe the best
moment in vlog history.

5
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:10,177
I'm talking shit.

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,996
- [Male Voice] Let's go to the counter.

7
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:16,413
(calm music)

8
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:52,202
Vlog, here we are, it is 9:06
in the morning, Wednesday.

9
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,052
We lost all Tuesday,

10
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:56,018
you and I?

11
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:59,269
Yeah, we lost all Tuesday,
we'll get back Thursday,

12
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,436
or Friday, we get Friday, or whatever.

13
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,983
Since the beginning of the
end of this ridiculous trip,

14
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:06,789
which is, in a last week
I've gone from New York,

15
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:10,974
to Oslo, to Copenhagen, to
Moscow, to LA, to Brisbane,

16
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:15,141
to Sydney, to Melbourne,
connect in Dubai, to New York.

17
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:17,802
It's a lot of fucking travel,

18
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:19,917
but a whole lot of accomplishments,

19
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,431
the Complex Episode,

20
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:22,575
did you watch the Complex?

21
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:23,932
Who did that, did Ralph or you?

22
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:24,948
It's really good, really good.

23
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:26,891
Hope you get to check out that episode.

24
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:29,334
Got a lot done, got a lot
of VaynerMedia meetings in,

25
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,662
a lot of culture hacking,
and some great speeches

26
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:34,674
and some great friends
in all these countries.

27
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:37,778
So here is the beginning of
the, what are we here for

28
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,181
twenty, forty--

29
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,171
- [Male Voice] 36 hours.

30
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,482
36 hours, three locations in Australia,

31
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:46,522
epic, epic effort, so I'm excited.

32
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:47,355
Show Zach.

33
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:52,149
That's Zach, he is attractive,
but he is being inappropriate

34
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:55,236
with scheduling me this hardcore.

35
00:01:55,236 --> 00:01:59,403
Zach, have you ever heard of
the marathon versus the sprint,

36
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:03,988
I mean, you gonna kill
the golden goose here.

37
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,451
Good to see you, man.

38
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:07,284
How are things?

39
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:08,383
You remember me, by chance?

40
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:09,282
Remind me.

41
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:12,205
Eighteen, twenty months ago,

42
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:13,038
you don't spose you remember me.

43
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:14,250
I'll remember if you tell me the story,

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,083
but faced with

45
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,496
Some months ago, Q & A,

46
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:19,298
San Diego, T&C conference,

47
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:20,592
I said you were super good-looking?

48
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:21,425
Yes.

49
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:22,843
Yeah, I remember. (laughs)

50
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,676
Toldja I'd remember.

51
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,343
Toldja I'd remember.

52
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:30,384
Bout to destroy Australian Faces.

53
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,329
Hey, it's Gary.

54
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,456
Call me back.

55
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:33,839
I just wanna discuss this position,

56
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,002
make sure everybody's aligned on it,

57
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:38,582
and talk it through.

58
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,545
You guys over communicate,

59
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:40,491
and I'll make a call on Monday.

60
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:41,324
Love you, give me a call.

61
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:42,324
See ya, bye.

62
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:48,899
From getting myself hyped for a pre speech

63
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:52,260
to addressing operational
issues at VaynerMedia,

64
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,540
this shit can go real fast back and forth.

65
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,845
Stuff can change up real quick.

66
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:58,712
By the way, real fun fact.

67
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,634
I adore pears.

68
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:03,642
I think pears are stunningly underrated.

69
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,475
Do you agree?

70
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,142
(pulsing music)

71
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,678
(male voice) What if everybody's scary, V?

72
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:18,104
Super excited to be hitting
the stage any second.

73
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,957
Bab, and on the ones and twos.

74
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,659
Uh, super interested.

75
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:25,069
Have no idea what I may be talking about.

76
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,388
That is just basically the way I roll.

77
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:31,746
You know, improv from
the beginning to the end,

78
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:32,688
every time,

79
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:35,007
and I hope you guys enjoy it.

80
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:35,840
See ya.

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,323
(announcer) Gary Vee

82
00:03:38,323 --> 00:03:40,990
(loud cheering)

83
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:47,125
I think that there's way too
many people in this audience

84
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,583
that are in the excuse business.

85
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,561
I've, and yeah,

86
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:53,280
it's tough, because

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,642
I'm empathetic.

88
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:56,033
There's always things.

89
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,590
You know, you could have two
parents that were drug addicts.

90
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,736
You could

91
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,022
have lost your parents in a car accident

92
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,009
when you were a kid.

93
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,711
You could have had your
money stolen to you

94
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,417
by a partner.

95
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,600
There's so many things
that happen in life.

96
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,598
I'm super empathetic to it.

97
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:11,830
The ultimate problem is, though

98
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,819
that the market,

99
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:14,652
the world,

100
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:15,717
doesn't care.

101
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:16,680
It's really interesting.

102
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,456
To me, life is pretty binary.

103
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,543
It's either black or white.

104
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:20,827
It's either yes or no.

105
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,835
And the one that matters to me the most

106
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,543
is you're either on the offense

107
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,633
in your life right now,

108
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,054
or you're on the defense.

109
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:29,152
You're either coming up
with reasons why not,

110
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,205
all this technology,

111
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,038
all this stuff,

112
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,678
why not?

113
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:33,678
Or, why yes?

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,675
All this technology,

115
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,529
all this stuff.

116
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:37,717
You're looking at things

117
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:38,970
and you're making a decision,

118
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,058
more importantly,

119
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:41,668
being a successful entrepreneur

120
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:42,828
is a skill set.

121
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:43,661
Right?

122
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,645
And, it's one that comes natural to some,

123
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:47,192
and others, not as much.

124
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,713
It's a fun thing to be right now,

125
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:49,659
and everybody wants to,

126
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,659
and the opportunity is very real.

127
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,003
I'm a great entrepreneur,

128
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:55,900
but I think I've even
better at consumer behavior

129
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,302
and psychology.

130
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:58,135
It's who I am.

131
00:04:58,135 --> 00:04:59,224
It's why a lot of you follow me,

132
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:00,513
because when you cut me down,

133
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,269
you see that I'm pushing positivity

134
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,134
and a whole lot of other
things that matter.

135
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:06,086
I'm trying to get people
to do it the right way.

136
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:06,919
Be patient.

137
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:07,752
Do the right thing.

138
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:09,198
Da da da da da.

139
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:10,108
My friends,

140
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:12,017
you need to get yourself in
the right place mentally,

141
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:13,992
and then you need to get yourself

142
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:15,131
in the right place mentally.

143
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,320
Because the thing that people

144
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,894
have not wrapped their head around

145
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:20,167
is that this takes a lot of work.

146
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,033
Like, a lot a lot.

147
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:22,682
Not a little something.

148
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:23,975
And if you aspire.

149
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:25,290
Let me just ground this.

150
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,515
If you think you're gonna
make a million dollars a year,

151
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,745
which is funny the way
people throw that out,

152
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,705
like everybody gets there.

153
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:34,354
Almost nobody gets there, right?

154
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:36,689
If you wanna make $500,000 a year,

155
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,201
which would put you in
the just the fortunate

156
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:41,046
top one percent of income getters

157
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:42,512
here in Australia,

158
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:45,010
if you wanna make $100,000 a year

159
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,756
and like doing it,

160
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,348
and it's on your terms,

161
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,020
and it's your life,

162
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,694
it takes a lot of work.

163
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:55,204
And it takes a lot of smart work.

164
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,408
The thing I talk a whole lot about

165
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:57,820
is hustle.

166
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,872
The thing I talk less about

167
00:05:58,872 --> 00:05:59,893
is being smart.

168
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,815
Because I don't think
that brings you any value.

169
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:02,814
So what I do is,

170
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:04,262
I try to come and speak,

171
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:05,095
or through my actions,

172
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:07,312
show you the smart things that I'm doing,

173
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:09,763
and then remind you that
it's still hard work.

174
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:11,202
The framework is simple.

175
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:12,161
This is simple.

176
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,308
You may have not allowed yourself

177
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,543
to have the honest
conversation with yourself

178
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,679
of how much hard work

179
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,934
and how much patience

180
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:20,728
it takes to be successful.

181
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:21,764
But it doesn't change the fact

182
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,411
that that's the case.

183
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:24,616
You've never met anybody

184
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:25,578
in your life

185
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:27,056
who hasn't worked their face off

186
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:27,944
for a long time

187
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:29,907
that's built something significant.

188
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,104
It may seem that it happened fast

189
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,559
cuz they're 27,

190
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,900
but maybe they've been
hustling since they were 13

191
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,943
in a different way

192
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,520
that gave them 14 years of experience

193
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,228
to be a winner in that game.

194
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,995
And so, please.

195
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:43,740
Please wrap your head around
what we're actually doing here

196
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,187
and more importantly,

197
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,931
if you were smart enough to be here today,

198
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,219
and I mean this,

199
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,772
the fact that you came here today

200
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:54,930
puts you so far ahead of everybody else

201
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,728
and I hate knowing,

202
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:57,561
for a fact,

203
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:00,534
that so many of you are
gonna give up your advantage

204
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,910
because you like hearing me say it,

205
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,990
and you like the way it feels,

206
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,943
but then you leave,

207
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:07,814
and you don't do anything about it.

208
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:08,647
So please,

209
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:09,738
do me a favor.

210
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:12,357
Go do something about this talk today.

211
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:13,357
I implore you.

212
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,903
It will change the course of your career.

213
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,018
Thank you.

214
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,268
(applause)

215
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:23,684
Nice and solid.

216
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:28,476
Put up vlog.

217
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:29,892
Bab and I

218
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:31,863
successful so far

219
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:34,363
Good stop on the way to Sidney

220
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:36,260
Good energy, good talks,

221
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,447
good stuff, good life.

222
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:41,030
(upbeat music)

223
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,108
I got one.

224
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,052
The Vayner part.

225
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:49,917
Output.

226
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:53,102
The production world at a lower cost.

227
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:54,694
All-time great traveler.

228
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:55,639
Oh, fuck.

229
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,664
(laughs)

230
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:59,157
That would be the best moment

231
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:00,727
in vlog history.

232
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:02,621
I'm talkin' shit.

233
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:04,454
Let's go to the caf.

234
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,699
Off to Sidney.

235
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:22,793
Love you.

236
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,626
Thank you very much.

237
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,299
You know, different cities,

238
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,757
same back of the seat.

239
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,007
Conversation, me and Bab,

240
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:32,394
now we're on our way to our city talk.

241
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:34,155
The weather is beautiful.

242
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,246
It's a beautiful city overall.

243
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:38,632
Your first Sidney trip, huh, Babs?

244
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,050
I'm happy for ya.

245
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,113
Hi, how are you?

246
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:44,947
I'm Emma.

247
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:47,030
Emma, nice to meet you.

248
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:52,256
Very nice. Is that what this is called?

249
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:55,059
We're gonna say it, right?

250
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,462
I can just imagine you
got coming this way?

251
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:57,310
Where were you this week?

252
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,278
Australia, you got Israel?

253
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:02,528
They all know how I roll.

254
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,817
Show you

255
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,147
Ha, ha, that's awesome.

256
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:10,516
I love that.

257
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,099
Yeah, I wanted to do something different.

258
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,389
Thank you.

259
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,595
I think I'm excited.

260
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:28,005
It's amazing to me,

261
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:30,672
There's a lot of famous people

262
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:35,182
and so many people speak so highly

263
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:37,718
of who you are backstage,

264
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:39,560
which is not always the case.

265
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,179
Thank you for saying that.

266
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,536
You're so uber cool backstage.

267
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:45,968
Thank you. Thank you.

268
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:46,851
I mean, there's not

269
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:49,711
I literally got done
just saying in Melbourne,

270
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:51,322
uh, in Brisbane,

271
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:54,724
that my entire focus is what
people say behind my back.

272
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:55,651
And to have you say that

273
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,424
Well, because, you know, we've all, I mean

274
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,338
Yeah

275
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:00,171
We've been here for 20 years,

276
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:01,004
Sure

277
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:01,877
and you get a real

278
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:02,982
And the one there is real different

279
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:03,920
I've heard

280
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,970
Can be, and you're someone
that you would have

281
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,803
around to your house,

282
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:09,636
to eat dinner with,

283
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:10,469
and just have a chat with

284
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,302
I appreciate ya saying that.

285
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:12,150
Thanks for saying that.

286
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,983
You're cool.

287
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,153
Zero ego, and

288
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:15,063
Thank you for saying that.

289
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:16,270
I love what you

290
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,340
Thank you.

291
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,978
Appreciate it.

292
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:21,424
I'm extremely optimistic

293
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:22,820
I'm extremely positive

294
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,790
what's going on,

295
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,280
and it's all because of the framework

296
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,634
of this vlog.

297
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:27,551
This thing.

298
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:32,038
How many of you do not have a cell phone?

299
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:34,124
Raise your hand.

300
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:35,527
Cool.

301
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:36,626
Zero, by the way,

302
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:38,078
For everybody in the front rows.

303
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,078
This thing is ridiculously powerful.

304
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:46,705
This thing is the remote
control of our society.

305
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:49,897
This thing has eliminated every excuse

306
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:51,590
outta your fuckin mouth.

307
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,480
Because, if you have to work nine to six

308
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,687
to pay the bills,

309
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,704
to pay your dues,

310
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:56,881
to pay your debts,

311
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,354
that is exactly right,

312
00:10:58,354 --> 00:10:59,353
and appropriate,

313
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:01,109
and everybody comes from
different starting points

314
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:04,403
and I have unbelievable empathy to that.

315
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,310
The exciting thing, though

316
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,479
is that our grandparents
didn't have this thing.

317
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,685
They hadda work nine to six,

318
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:11,692
nine to seven,

319
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,392
and then there was only so much upside

320
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:15,550
that they could create
for themselves long-term

321
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,526
from seven to two in the morning.

322
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:20,173
This thing has fundamentally
changed everything

323
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:22,442
and I just think we take it for granted.

324
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,351
I really wish everybody understood

325
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,700
the power that is literally sitting

326
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,453
in their hands right now.

327
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,973
This is literally a media creation

328
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:31,367
and distribution tool

329
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,260
that would have cost

330
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,826
tens of millions of dollars

331
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,758
if you understand distribution.

332
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:37,551
The technology probably cost $20,000,

333
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:39,540
you know, 25 years ago.

334
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,607
Cameras, this, that, fine.

335
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,804
The distribution?

336
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,460
You would have had to shoot a satellite

337
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,107
into space.

338
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,311
You would have had to
buy a printing press.

339
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:51,067
You would have had to buy trucks.

340
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,974
You would have done so much.

341
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,881
The fact that every person here

342
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,915
can literally turn this on themselves,

343
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:59,361
create content around something

344
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:00,748
they're interested in,

345
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:02,496
and then have platforms like

346
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:03,812
YouTube, and Facebook, and Instagram,

347
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:05,726
and Twitter, and LinkedIn,

348
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,069
distributed,

349
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,356
let me remind you,

350
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:09,273
at no cost,

351
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,546
is so batshit crazy

352
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:15,522
for all of us old fuckers in here

353
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:18,501
that I just wish people would
not take it for granted.

354
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:19,334
And so, my friends,

355
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:21,604
I come here tonight

356
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:23,631
to really try to pull up one move.

357
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:25,827
Can I actually take somebody,

358
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,615
even if they're a huge fan,

359
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,389
or if they've never heard of me before,

360
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,330
and tweak their perspective

361
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,205
on what's actually going on.

362
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:36,713
Can I convince one of you

363
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,459
that nobody gives a shit

364
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,340
about your headaches and problems,

365
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,914
and when you complain,

366
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:44,143
you're just taking minutes off the board

367
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:45,803
and energy off the board,

368
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:47,258
from doing something about it.

369
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:49,607
Literally, I am fascinated

370
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:52,937
by the inability to be held accountable.

371
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:54,296
I'm fascinated

372
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:56,024
that you actually are coming up

373
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:57,195
and spending energy

374
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,334
and trying to say why
you're not successful

375
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:02,157
because your older brother did some shit

376
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,554
in 1996.

377
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:04,727
(laughter)

378
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:05,560
And so,

379
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,642
self-awareness and humility

380
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:09,506
and empathy

381
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,494
and all these warm and fuzzy things

382
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:13,282
that grandma talks about

383
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:15,383
happen to be the biggest secrets

384
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:16,940
in the rough-and-tumble game

385
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,542
of business.

386
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:19,900
I highly recommend

387
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,364
you getting in touch

388
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,031
with those emotions.

389
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:25,229
Thank you.

390
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:28,562
(applause and cheering)

391
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:33,228
(male voice) Thank you!

392
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:37,952
Thanks, guys.

393
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,702
Thanks for havin' me.

394
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,050
I'll make a little content here.

395
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,802
I'll turn this on.

396
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:52,564
All right, now really
lose your fuckin' minds

397
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:53,948
Here we go!

398
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,174
Go!

399
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:58,007
(louder cheering)

400
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,262
Love you guys!

401
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,095
Thank you!

402
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:13,303
How are you? Thank you.

403
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:14,318
My pleasure.

404
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:15,151
Really good.

405
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:15,984
How are you?

406
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:17,651
Good, how are you?

407
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:22,625
You enjoy it?

408
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,458
Yes, I did.

409
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,154
Love everything you do, man.

410
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:26,000
It was great, Gary.

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,833
Thank you.

412
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,050
You shook your head on a certain point

413
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,946
early on.

414
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:29,779
Yeah.

415
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:31,795
Wonder if it was about crypto,

416
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:32,745
or something,

417
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:33,578
and I saw you, and I was like

418
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:34,682
he gets it.

419
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:35,798
Oh, it was my underpriced.

420
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:37,920
I said, everything's priced appropriately,

421
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,753
or over-priced,

422
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,586
and you shook your head,

423
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:40,731
it was like, he gets it.

424
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:41,981
Take care, man.

425
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:52,245
That was a good one.

426
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,383
Stop. Can we stop for a second?

427
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,914
Yeah, I'll hop on for a second.

428
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:04,900
Oh, look, Gary.

429
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,733
Yeah, what's up? What's up?

430
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,483
What's up? What's up?

431
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,974
How'd Gary get here?

432
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:11,866

You sure you got that?

436
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:15,729
Cuz I'm not sure.

437
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:16,742

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,612
Do you like the shout out?

441
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:24,695

Love you guys.

447
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:34,798
Doing the right thing is
always the right thing.

448
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:42,089
Yeah?

00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:43,719

00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,284
Um, big day.

452
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,673
Flew from

455
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,213

00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:58,076
Here, I'll take over, Bab

457
00:15:58,076 --> 00:15:59,756

Great day, got a lot done.

Big themes,

00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:04,958

Motherfuckers.

Clouds and dirt.

464
00:16:07,189 --> 00:00:00,000
(light music)
