1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:02,486
- [Male 1] How you do you
really experience something?

2
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:03,986
- By doing things.

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:10,744
Look, everybody is trying to mitigate risk

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,494
and hedge against vulnerabilities.

5
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:14,827
I run into them.

6
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:24,269
- Let me just stop so I can do another one

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,427
- I run right the fuck into them.

8
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,677
- Just in case.

9
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:33,454
- I run right the fuck into them.

10
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:36,621
(inspirational music)

11
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:57,041
7:06 AM, Singapore, there's
a morning show right?

12
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,094
- Yep.

13
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:01,011
- Morning show action here in Asia.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,166
Long trip huh?

15
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,090
- Long trip.

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,193
- You get some sleep?

17
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:06,081
- A little bit.

18
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:07,910
- Yeah, I got a little bit too, not a lot.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,077
Anyway, just riding along.

20
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,866
You know, being 12 hours ahead kinda sucks

21
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:19,165
because you wake up to 146 emails of fire.

22
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:22,994
So, just trying to catch up
and drink out of the fire hose.

23
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:25,809
It's like fire coming out
of the fire hose, not water.

24
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:27,726
That I could deal with.

25
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,423
- [Interviewer] What
does hustle mean to you?

26
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:34,090
Why is it important?

27
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,849
- For me, it's important
because I don't think

28
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:41,056
any of us in this room or
anybody reading this article

29
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:45,195
can physically change how smart they are.

30
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:48,591
I don't think we can make ourselves

31
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,658
more clever or more strategic,

32
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:55,029
but I do think that hard work is the most

33
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:59,420
controllable aspect of
entrepreneurship and business

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,423
that anybody can deploy,
and I find that fascinating.

35
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,744
Right, and I'm just willing to work

36
00:02:04,744 --> 00:02:06,643
until you guys feel satisfied.

37
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:09,125
I'm not worried about the
margin, you know what I mean?

38
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,686
Then, I would add one last thing.

39
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:15,109
I would argue, I'd rather
somebody continue to persevere

40
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:16,983
around something they love doing.

41
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:19,556
Like, if you love making ice cream sundaes

42
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,051
and you want to become
the number one expert

43
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,834
of ice cream sundaes with the hope of

44
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,936
opening ice cream sundae stores,

45
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:29,843
I weirdly would rather you
not all the way make it,

46
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:32,624
kind of live paycheck to paycheck,

47
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:35,541
but be so happy than go and do law,

48
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:39,153
be miserable and make a
little bit more money that

49
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:41,848
allows you to take a
vacation or have a fancy car.

50
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:43,592
So, it's a complex question.

51
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:45,846
Some can argue to me
that they are so insecure

52
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,903
that they need a Rolex and a BMW

53
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:50,025
and that's what scratches
the itch for them.

54
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,277
I'm okay with that.

55
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:54,977
To me, you making $87,000 a
year writing about esports

56
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:58,916
is more attractive than making
$210,000 as a consultant

57
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,300
in the way that I view life.

58
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,346
It's the most controllable
and I try to give advice

59
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:07,745
that is actually practical,
not makes me look cool.

60
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:09,978
So, that's why I love hustle.

61
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:13,228
I'm an unbelievable buyer of the modern

62
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:16,191
consumption patterns of the consumer

63
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,040
because I'm unemotional.

64
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,182
While many in this room
and many watching at home

65
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:25,085
are just trying to figure out what to do

66
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:28,541
in this environment, we
are now in the pre-dawn

67
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,868
of our attention being shifted to audio.

68
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:35,068
Whether in podcast form or very soon,

69
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:38,735
Alexa, Google, Apple
devices that become the

70
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,964
AI, ML voice interactions of our day.

71
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,611
Whatever obviously Tencent and Alibaba

72
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,191
do it in the Asian markets.

73
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,993
This is going to be the next frontier

74
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:52,448
of attention arbitrage.

75
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,966
So, I highly recommend that
you get far more disciplined

76
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,562
in your understanding on where your actual

77
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:03,263
customer's attention is
and not be lazy and say,

78
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:07,041
"Well my customer is older.
Well my customer is richer."

79
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,877
They're not on these platforms.

80
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:11,743
In that naivety will become great

81
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:14,443
detriment to your ambitions.

82
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:17,235
The nimbleness in my lack of romance

83
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,012
of what's working for me today

84
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:23,030
and the underlining work
ethic and humility that

85
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,289
I deploy against the next consumer trend.

86
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:29,365
I lack the audacity
that most of the people

87
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:32,465
in this room have about
how they want it to be

88
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:35,097
versus how it actually is.

89
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:36,825
I trade on that currency.

90
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:39,657
It's practical to take high risk between

91
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:43,012
20 and 30 now with the way
the internet is structured.

92
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:47,190
It is smarter to take high
risk entrepreneurial ventures

93
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,217
between 20 and 30 now than
to go into a corporation.

94
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:54,190
The main reason 20-30 year olds
still go into a corporation

95
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,275
is because of the scratch that they have.

96
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:01,442
The itch that they have to
scratch to appease their parents.

97
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:06,635
And that over indexes in Asia.

98
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:11,062
But, it's not practical.

99
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,724
Do you know how young you are at 30?

100
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,693
Do you know how much
opportunity there actually is?

101
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,713
Do you know how much you
can do if you're not willing

102
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:22,858
to live fancy and live humbly?

103
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:24,140
It's unbelievable.

104
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,131
Companies are in big trouble because

105
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:29,245
the feeding system of universities,

106
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,556
in America they're in
deep trouble because...

107
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:32,882
I don't know the Singapore market,

108
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:36,323
but in America there's an incredible heist

109
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:38,034
and fraud going on.

110
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:41,913
It's called debt to go to University.

111
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:42,988
There's nobody now at...

112
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:46,988
I get a thousand emails
a week, Dms on instagram

113
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,742
from 16-year olds that are like,

114
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,008
"I'm a straight A student,

115
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,949
my parents want me to go to college,

116
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:55,187
I want to be an entrepreneur."

117
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,502
Of course, because it's cool

118
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:58,313
and most people can't be, so I get it.

119
00:05:58,313 --> 00:05:59,868
But, follow along.

120
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:02,612
My parents are poor,
and they want me to go

121
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,850
to this university to make them feel good.

122
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,732
The amount of things that
people in this room have done

123
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:09,954
because of the insecurities of

124
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,826
their parents is stunning to me.

125
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:13,986
It's sad.

126
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,951
And, in America, it's compounded because

127
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,859
kids are taking on $250,000 in debt

128
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,907
with high interest rates and aren't

129
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:24,091
getting anything when they come out.

130
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,025
That won't last.

131
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,286
So, we're in...

132
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,474
Listen, how are you not
smart enough to realize

133
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,937
there's something called the internet?

134
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:35,285
It's finally hit some level of maturity

135
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:39,452
because now it's about 25,
20 years old consumer facing.

136
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:43,089
Do we not realize how big of a...

137
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,904
It's the single biggest thing

138
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,121
that has happened to the human race.

139
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:51,079
It's arbitraged out the physical world.

140
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,679
This is so much bigger than
I think we're quantifying.

141
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,511
I talk about the communication
and marketing aspects,

142
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,555
but everything you see around block chain,

143
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:02,047
and Trump, and Brexit, and China.

144
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,030
This is the preview.

145
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,758
We haven't even started.

146
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,008
Everything is up for grabs.

147
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:10,533
- It's all good. Let's do it.

148
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,357
- I love the show. Hello.

149
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:14,232
So, basically everyone here right now,

150
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:15,875
they're from the startup space.

151
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,869
Mostly FenCheck.

152
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,892
- Okay.

153
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:19,458
- Then, they've already
come with all their

154
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,882
questions prepared, so
just go your own style.

155
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:22,814
- Right into Q & A?

156
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:23,966
- Yeah, right into Q & A.

157
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:24,799
- I love it.

158
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,606
Did you always dream to be on DailyVee?

159
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:28,583
- Never, I didn't know
this was gonna happen.

160
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,416
- Now it happened.

161
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,249
- This is like a miracle for me.

162
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,800
- This is a huge miracle.

163
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,934
- [Audience Member] I
used to always think that

164
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,425
I'm an entrepreneur, but
you make me realize that

165
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:37,495
I am not entrepreneur but I am

166
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,233
someone who has entrepreneur tendencies.

167
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,066
- Yes.

168
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,623
- [Audience Member] So, I think
that's a big thing for me.

169
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:43,888
So, that comes to my question that.

170
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,694
I have big ambition, I think education

171
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:47,829
has the power to change lives.

172
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:52,625
For me, my childhood dream
to be a business owner

173
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,850
by age 40, I already accomplished it.

174
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,018
Right now, communicating what's next.

175
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:00,365
It's just about legacy over currency.

176
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:03,278
For me, I want to build a foundation,

177
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:06,385
build skills to give back to society.

178
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,553
One thing that I have is
that you talk about ambition

179
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:11,255
and the willingness, the hustle.

180
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,796
I have the ambition, but
the willingness, the hustle

181
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:16,220
for the ambition is lacking.

182
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,053
- Why?

183
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:23,287
- [Audience Member] I ask that
question to myself as well.

184
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,370
- What's the real answer?

185
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,837
- [Audience Member] I'll
say that it's my parents

186
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:30,127
in a small step, but I
think that's also bullshit.

187
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,994
I think the biggest thing is myself.

188
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:35,937
I wonder if maybe I'm scared
of success or failure.

189
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:39,020
Even though I'm comfortable, but then

190
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:43,056
I'm not sure whether I can do it really.

191
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,336
But at the same time, I
feel like I can do it.

192
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:48,771
- I think the biggest
thing that you have to...

193
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:51,266
I think both your answers are right.

194
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,684
I think once you get into a place where

195
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:57,851
your failures are just yours,
they get a lot less scary.

196
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,246
You answered the right thing.

197
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:04,169
Whether it's your parents or
somebody else in your life.

198
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,932
The biggest reason
people don't take risks,

199
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:10,277
is they worry about
other people's opinions.

200
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:12,866
I wish you guys could feel what I feel

201
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:14,984
in my heart and in my soul.

202
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:17,147
I do not care about a single person's

203
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:19,292
point of view about me.

204
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:23,087
While equally caring about
what you think about me.

205
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,505
It's a very interesting contradiction.

206
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:29,100
It's a subtlety, but
saying both your parents

207
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,459
and yourself, it's...

208
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,611
When I hear I'm scared to fail,
but I feel like I can do it,

209
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:38,954
you're just worrying about outside forces.

210
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:39,890
It's no different than the way,

211
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,388
like I love if my professor
is a 40, 50, 60 year old

212
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:46,181
when I was 25 would have shit on me

213
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:49,387
because I was excited about
sticking it to them later.

214
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:51,750
If I didn't, here's a big one.

215
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,792
I don't talk about this as much.

216
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,364
When I fail, I'm excited because it meant

217
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,364
that I deserved to fail.

218
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:05,360
I love the game so much
even at my own expense.

219
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:10,382
I can't be pumped about
the fruits of victory

220
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:14,859
without equally respecting
the agony of the defeat.

221
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm excited when I fail.

222
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,717
I'm like, "Okay, tough guy."

223
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:21,460
The sneaker, this is interesting to me.

224
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,577
Why did I do this deal?

225
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:24,026
It was win-win.

226
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:26,572
If it works, I get to run
around with the legacy

227
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:28,683
of being the first entrepreneur
with a signature sneaker

228
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,464
and then it's kinda cool.

229
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,679
Like, in 20 years entrepreneurs
are just like athletes

230
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,061
and musicians and have sneakers.

231
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:37,003
I can sit here in 20 years and be like,

232
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,469
"You know, the way I thought
about the first sneaker,"

233
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:39,476
You know, it's cool.

234
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:42,604
It's a legacy play of
being strategically right.

235
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:46,771
But if I fail, it's ammo for
my friends to make fun of me.

236
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:49,257
Like, "Remember when you

237
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,767
thought you were so cool tough guy?"

238
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:51,879
It's funny.

239
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,418
But, I have to have
that humility as much as

240
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:56,137
I have that confidence to
be able to do my thing.

241
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:57,885
You have to be okay with losing.

242
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:59,523
I have a different question for you.

243
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:03,539
Which is, I agree with
you that education has

244
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,538
the chance to change the world

245
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:06,882
because it's already happened.

246
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,975
Education changed the world.

247
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,786
My bigger question is,
I just want to make sure

248
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,327
that you're not overly
romantic of the format

249
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:15,957
of the delivery of the education.

250
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:18,180
So, I'm fascinated by everybody right now

251
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,488
in our current state being in technology.

252
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:22,704
Let me explain.

253
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:26,697
The fact that we in society
put a hand written note

254
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:30,280
on a pedestal as this
is some great gesture

255
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,645
versus when we text people.

256
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:36,920
It's fascinating to me
because we've put the medium

257
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,750
on a pedestal not the action.

258
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,404
So, you're telling me
if I write an incredible

259
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:46,736
six sentence empathetic
love letter to my mom

260
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:49,819
of my admiration of her in text form,

261
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,836
that for some reason is less powerful than

262
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,704
a hand-written note for that same delivery

263
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:59,957
just because we're anti-technology,
because we fear change?

264
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:01,841
I laugh at that.

265
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,657
That's how I think about education.

266
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,182
I do not believe in a lot
of ways that education

267
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,551
is being dispersed because it is in the

268
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:12,245
selfish financial
interest of the disperser.

269
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,162
So, one weird insight could be that

270
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:21,083
that's your unlock,
that you believe in it,

271
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:25,250
but subconsciously you know
that the format is bullshit.

272
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,312
- [Audience Member] Thank You.

273
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:28,193
- You're welcome.

274
00:12:28,193 --> 00:12:29,302
Right?

275
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,812
- Yeah, I appreciate that.

276
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:33,986
- Understand, yeah. Thank you.

277
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:34,955
How are you?

278
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,505
- Just wanted to thank
you for the feedback.

279
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,111
- Thank you, thank you.

280
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:40,740
Our J & J meeting right now?

281
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,569
Are we late?

282
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:44,081
I have a client that we have to go.

283
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,021
Guys, I'm so sorry, I
have a client meeting.

284
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:48,688
(crowd chatter)

285
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:52,797
- Thank you man, thank you for coming.

286
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:53,630
- Very interesting.

287
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,547
- Thank you for coming.

288
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,626
That's awesome man.

289
00:12:58,626 --> 00:12:59,978
- But I don't know how to do it right now

290
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:01,769
because I'm still studying and I'm like

291
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:02,994
trying to intern and trying to learn

292
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:04,373
entrepreneurship a little bit.

293
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:05,922
Trying to be more explore about this.

294
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:08,039
- Something around
something as unique as that,

295
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,988
it's gonna be about patience because

296
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,005
people aren't gonna see it.

297
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:12,003
It's gonna take time.

298
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:12,836
- Definitely.

299
00:13:12,836 --> 00:13:13,669
- You know what I mean?

300
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,600
- To me, you've been enforcing it.

301
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,894
- Content, content, content,
patience, patience, patience.

302
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:17,791
Execution.

303
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,638
- Just freakin start.

304
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:21,254
- Good?

305
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,662
- Alright, thank you so much Gary.

306
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:23,495
- You're welcome brother.

307
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:24,328
- See you in Indonesia.

308
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:25,578
- See you soon.

309
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,370
(calming music)

310
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:38,492
- Good, we had a good
meeting with a client.

311
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:39,983
Or, a potential client.

312
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,566
A client from a macro
level, big corporate client

313
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,052
that has an office here.

314
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:45,362
Kind of talked about our ambitions

315
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:48,420
and the southeast Asian market.

316
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,670
So, this is an awfully productive trip.

317
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,944
I also get awfully ambitious
when I'm in new territory.

318
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:59,167
I just want to transcribe
all of my content

319
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,912
into every language in the world.

320
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:04,731
I'm also thinking it's
12:57 and we've done

321
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:07,795
more than a full days worth
of work for most people.

322
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:10,378
We have another 14 hours to go.

323
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,066
- [Cameraman] Wanna get a little touch tap

324
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,233
right there, that was odd.

325
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:18,943
That was weird.

326
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,907
- I liked it, let's do it again.

327
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,577
- [Cameraman] Like E.T.

328
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:26,577
- Phone home baby. Phone home DRock.

329
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:28,497
- I want to say thanks.

330
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:29,330
- I appreciate it buddy.

331
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,591
- So, hopefully.

332
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:31,551
- Thank you so much.

333
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,643
- Something comes out of this trip.

334
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:36,729
- It's already been awesome man.

335
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:38,022
I'm not worried about the results.

336
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:40,825
I'm worried about the setup, you know.

337
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,811
Tomorrow, every single person can get

338
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:45,250
different product in the news feed.

339
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,850
Go into Facebook Search,

340
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,806
type in soccer and football,
like 400 pictures and videos

341
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,835
from soccer and watch
your news feed change.

342
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,188
Tomorrow, type in Chiang Kai-shek

343
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,743
and like everything and
watch your news feed change.

344
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:00,660
Tomorrow type in Beyonce.

345
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,088
Tomorrow type in pineapple

346
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:04,787
Tomorrow type in red watches,

347
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,545
and watch your news feed change.

348
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:08,930
Facebook's not manipulating you.

349
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,991
You're manipulating Facebook.

350
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:13,823
It's time to take ownership.

351
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:16,849
- You've also come to be known
as a serial entrepreneur.

352
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,037
You have invested in
a number of start ups.

353
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:21,095
So, how do you know if an idea works?

354
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:22,095
- You don't.

355
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,324
You don't. You make an intuitive call

356
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,657
on the jockey and the horse.

357
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,867
You gotta like the person,
you gotta like the idea.

358
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,913
Some things work out, some don't.

359
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:39,455
Venmo, I love the idea,
I love the operator.

360
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:42,117
They were good enough to
get it to a certain point,

361
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:43,736
but then they had to sell
because they couldn't

362
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,427
take it to the next level.

363
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:47,791
Now it's one of the most
valuable companies in the world,

364
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,124
but I didn't make any money.

365
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,141
- For you it's a gut feel?

366
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:56,592
- For everybody it's a gut feel.

367
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,509
Let me explain by that.

368
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,777
A lot of VCs invest on data
that is projected data.

369
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:08,620
That's called gut feel.

370
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,528
They wanna be fancy and
be in those tall buildings

371
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:15,231
and wear a suit and say
that they make decisions on

372
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:18,910
analytics, but if you're
making a decision on pure math,

373
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,717
you should be right 100% of the time.

374
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:25,269
So, what are these VCs guessing on?

375
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,436
Guessing, gut.

376
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,562
- Order over here.

377
00:16:32,562 --> 00:16:34,645
- You got it, no problem.

378
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:40,413
- Thank you Mr. Gary.

379
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:41,338
- You're welcome.

380
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:43,162
- Come take a picture with me, selfie.

381
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:44,329
- Let's do it.

382
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:48,908
Awesome. So nice to meet you.

383
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:49,741
- Pleasure.

384
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:50,574
- Thank you.

385
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:54,166
Here's why I'm really
really good at what I do.

386
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,386
90% of the media I consume in my life

387
00:16:57,386 --> 00:17:01,553
is reading people's comments
on content that I put out.

388
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,877
I basically spend my
life on consumer behavior

389
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:09,231
and reaction to content.

390
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,484
Talk to you soon.

391
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,409
- I'll wait.

392
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,077
- Okay, great. Yeah, no problem.

393
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:16,803
That was a lot of fun.

394
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,053
I like those kind of talks.

395
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,704
The internation squad,
I wanna give you guys

396
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:24,832
a huge shout out, big love.

397
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,478
I appreciate it, I'm flattered by it.

398
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:30,362
I don't really know what else to say.

399
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:31,964
What else we wanna tell 'em?

400
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:36,264
- Just keep hustling, keep
working hard, keep grinding.

401
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,845
Keep listening to everything
that Gary has to say.

402
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:42,607
- Don't listen to what
I say, watch what I do.

403
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:43,824
That's the key.

404
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:44,724
Anyway, sending my love.

405
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:46,798
Thank you guys in the
community for all of it.

406
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,454
See ya.

407
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:51,621
(inspirational music)

408
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,044
- Thank you sir.

409
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,655
- Of course, come on in.

410
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:02,766
- I have a couple of questions for you.

411
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:03,867
- Of course.

412
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,284
Hello, hello, hi.

413
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:08,619
Nice to meet you, Gary.

414
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,300
Hi, nice to meet you. How are you?

415
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,143
- I didn't get your name sorry.

416
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:13,800
- Gary.

417
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,494
(chattering)

418
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,383
Hello.

419
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:18,069
- Hi I'm Pearcy, Gary.

420
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,150
How are you?

421
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,438
- Hi, Gary?

422
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:23,305
- What an influencer, what you guys offer

423
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:25,968
is a total different context and a

424
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:28,860
total different affiliation for a brand.

425
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,171
So, do I think brands
should spend on Instagram?

426
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,213
I do.

427
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:35,188
Do I think they should
also spend on KOLs, I do.

428
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:39,188
Because the people that
follow her or him or her

429
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,799
have an affinity for that person.

430
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,205
I mean, there's always been
a reason why sponsorship

431
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:49,496
and endorsement and people
affiliation always works.

432
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:53,938
So, I don't think it's an either/or.

433
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:55,479
I think it's a both.

434
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:59,073
You also have to
understand that Facebook is

435
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:01,459
six months away from
making sure they make a

436
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:04,053
20% vig on everything everybody does,

437
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,138
which will then allow them to be very

438
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:07,326
comfortable with you making money

439
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:08,815
as long as they're making their tax.

440
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,965
I think what KOLs have to do is be more

441
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:13,137
thoughtful about how they promote.

442
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,234
It blows my mind that
people that are in position

443
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:18,318
to make millions of dollars
a year are willing to take

444
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:22,208
$40,000 from a detox tea
and give that all away.

445
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:26,015
- But at the same time,
you should just test right?

446
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:27,682
- I test everything.

447
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:31,067
First of all, and I think
you've all seen this,

448
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:34,067
creative is the variable of success.

449
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,209
You know, the better
you get at this craft,

450
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,942
at growth hacking, at
growing, best practices.

451
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:43,353
We all have done stuff
with best practices;

452
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:47,205
hashtags, titles on youtube,
first three seconds.

453
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:50,614
We've all done stuff and every day

454
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:53,019
over the years that you've been doing it,

455
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:54,924
whether a year or ten years,

456
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:57,093
you do something that you
didn't expect to happen

457
00:19:57,093 --> 00:20:00,078
because the creative was the variable.

458
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:03,649
The creative is gray, not black and white.

459
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:05,672
That's why testing is everything.

460
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,274
I basically think I'm in
full testing mode always.

461
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,157
I accept nothing.

462
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:14,050
I'm constantly innovating
everything I'm doing.

463
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,021
Don't forget, we're spending,
the media are spending

464
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:18,014
300 million dollars a
year on Facebook ads.

465
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:21,101
I'm look at real data, not just my own.

466
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:25,268
And, it's the creative, and
best practices, and continuity.

467
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,771
Then, it's just the things
that come native to you.

468
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,714
Like, collaborations, so important.

469
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,368
So many of you right now
should take a picture

470
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:39,002
with each other and post
across, like such a benefit.

471
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:41,669
It's just such light-weight ROI.

472
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:48,512
So, there's a lot, it's a heavy matrix.

473
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:49,880
And then, once you get into that place

474
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,969
where you're selling stuff.

475
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:53,176
How much value you have to give

476
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:56,418
in return to convert
properly when you ask.

477
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,197
There's all these variables.

478
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:00,966
I wrote a book called "Jab,
Jab, Jab, Right Hook".

479
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:04,271
It was about give, give,
give, and then ask.

480
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:06,035
That cadence of how much you're giving

481
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:08,725
versus you're asking in return is probably

482
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,740
the most philosophical importance of where

483
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,013
you'll probably go going forward.

484
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:17,509
When you become a personal brand,

485
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,676
when you mis-balance giving
versus asking, you are finished.

486
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,337
You're on the start of the process

487
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:26,208
of going in the other direction.

488
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:30,554
Because everybody's about
to be a personal brand.

489
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:31,892
- [Member Of Meeting]
Give before you take.

490
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,376
- Give as much as you can.

491
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,652
You know what my thesis is?

492
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:38,420
Guilt them into buying
because you give them so much.

493
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,713
I'm in full guilt mode.

494
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,017
I'm in full guilt strategy.

495
00:21:43,017 --> 00:21:45,267
(laughing)

496
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:48,602
- Gary, you always talk about getting

497
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:50,491
out of your comfort zone,
why it's so important.

498
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:51,324
- Yes, uh oh.

499
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:53,227
- We're in Singapore, so I wanna see if

500
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:55,010
we can get you out of yours.

501
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,154
Have you heard of durian?

502
00:21:56,154 --> 00:21:59,737
- Oh my god, I have
been dying to try this.

503
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:05,029
- Really?

504
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:07,679
- Yeah, so you see this in
all the extreme food stuff.

505
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,344
I am so curious what's about.

506
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:13,040
Guys, this is a big deal for me actually.

507
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,554
- First and foremost,
the smell, good, bad?

508
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:16,663
What do you think?

509
00:22:16,663 --> 00:22:17,762
- This is it?

510
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:19,037
- You know this is banned on the subway

511
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,365
- Oh, god this is good and bad.

512
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:22,652
It's super interesting.

513
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:25,116
- It's literally banned
because it's so strong.

514
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:26,526
So, we brought you some durian.

515
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:27,359
- Do you eat durian?

516
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,739
- I've never had it myself, so.

517
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:30,772
I've been afraid.

518
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:32,488
I've lived here a year and
a half and I've been afraid.

519
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:33,321
- Okay.

520
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:35,738
- Give it another smell.

521
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:36,864
- Man, it's real.

522
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:37,697
- Really?

523
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:38,530
- Yeah, but it's cool.

524
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,392
Alright, so what are we doing?

525
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,017
How much do you eat?

526
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:43,267
(laughing)

527
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,821
- You gotta go for more than that.

528
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:52,143
- I'm gonna be good with it.

529
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,239
- I think this is how much
you're supposed to eat.

530
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,717
- You eat that. You got it.

531
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:58,384
- Alright, then you.

532
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:03,677
- It's good.

533
00:23:03,677 --> 00:23:05,927
(laughing)

534
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:09,664
You weren't ready for it?

535
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:11,164
- I really wasn't.

536
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:13,671
- I kind of like it, but I was

537
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:16,132
obviously cautious with the volume.

538
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:17,475
I'm kind of okay with it.

539
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:19,492
- You gotta plunge Gary, you gotta plunge.

540
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:22,492
- I mean, it's some weird stuff man.

541
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:32,042
- Yeah, you did it man, congratulations.

542
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:35,271
- I'm good with it, but it smells.

543
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:36,167
It's wild stuff.

544
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,739
Are you pumped you at least now tried?

545
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,158
- Yeah, I'm pumped.

546
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:40,644
- Are you devastated
that you were defeated

547
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:43,656
and I was unbelievably remarkable with it?

548
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:44,576
- It's not a competition.

549
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:45,719
Who said it was a competition?

550
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,253
- My friend, everything is a competition.

551
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,386
- Alright, on that note congratulations.

552
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,554
- Thank you man, good to see you again.

553
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,485
- Great to catch up
with you, and well done.

554
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:52,402
- Bye guys.

555
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,574
(sad music)

556
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,942
♫ I hope you go

557
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:17,423
♫ I hope I see you

558
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:23,746
♫ Golden shores with lights
more radiant than the sun

559
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:32,819
♫ You say you won't

560
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:37,926
♫ You won't believe...

561
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:39,798
- If you go to my website right now,

562
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:42,741
it says that I day trade attention.

563
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:45,064
That's what I do, the end.

564
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:47,019
It's day trading attention.

565
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,073
It's so much more real
than people realize.

566
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:53,498
Wish, are you guys familiar
with Wish the shopping app?

567
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:56,215
Wish has gone from zero
to anywhere between

568
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:59,715
5-7 billion dollars on transactional sales

569
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,965
on their platform on
100% Facebook arbitrage.

570
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:08,310
- [Dinner Member] But
you can also quickly..

571
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,655
- They've already moved.

572
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:11,586
They know it's starting to mature

573
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:12,559
and if you look at what they're doing,

574
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,152
there's a logo on the Lakers jersey.

575
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:17,011
If you watched the
McGregor/Mayweather fight,

576
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:17,844
they did brand.

577
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:20,152
Now they're doing above,
now they're doing branding.

578
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,709
They did sales conversion.

579
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:23,121
Now they're moving to branding

580
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,330
as it's maturing, but it's
still grossly under-priced.

581
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,875
KOLs, I would tell you
KOLs and influencers is

582
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,497
the great misunderstood market place

583
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,365
right now for any business including

584
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:38,282
very boring B to B sass businesses.

585
00:25:39,428 --> 00:25:42,761
It's just attention that's under-priced.

586
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:47,025
- [Dinner Member] Content based.

587
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:49,377
- Always, it's the variable of success.

588
00:25:49,377 --> 00:25:51,752
Once you figure out where the
attention is under-priced.

589
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,557
Google was great for analytical people

590
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:55,168
because it was blue letters,

591
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:56,623
and it was intent based.

592
00:25:56,623 --> 00:26:00,207
Facebook is television and so
you have to be dramatically

593
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,940
more creative to arbitrage Facebook,

594
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,541
which is why a lot of analytical
people have struggled.

595
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,672
And, then all the big brands.

596
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:09,013
I always point to you, because Unilever.

597
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:11,205
I apologize, but this is who I work with.

598
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:13,991
All the big brands, they're in television.

599
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,125
All the quant-based
marketers are struggling

600
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,894
with the creative variable,
and you have this dichotomy.

601
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:20,782
That's why Facebook is still so vibrant

602
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,372
for under-priced opportunity.

603
00:26:23,372 --> 00:26:25,613
- [Dinner Member] Because
there's the other issue of

604
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:29,780
ephemeral versus very permanent
entrance attention span

605
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,886
and actually there's
certain digital properties

606
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:38,303
that are grabbing the
permanent attention span space,

607
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:41,258
but there's a lot on the ephemeral side.

608
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:44,458
There's very different business
models associated with that.

609
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,727
- Yeah, and I think people are
too hypercritical ephemeral

610
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:50,597
because ephemeral is like how
the world actually worked.

611
00:26:50,597 --> 00:26:51,920
I agree.

612
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,320
- [Dinner Member] The way you
scan it is different though.

613
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,743
- 100%, but you know what's ironic?

614
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:59,058
Obviously Snapchat had it's
real moment with ephemeral.

615
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:00,798
That's far more similar to the way

616
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:02,902
everything has been done prior.

617
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:04,310
Television's ephemeral.

618
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,686
Magazine's ephemeral.

619
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:06,963
Direct mail's ephemeral.

620
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:08,133
- Just slower.

621
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:09,550
- It's ephemeral.

622
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:15,311
Tonight's ephemeral, like 100%.

623
00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:18,386
♫ It's gonna go

624
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,089
♫ In the blink of an eye

625
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:24,422
♫ And I just wanna know

626
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,485
♫ You'll be there by my side

627
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:32,245
♫ And it can feel so cold

628
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:35,912
♫ But I'm holding onto hope

629
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:41,643
♫ That one day your
heart will make it home

630
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:46,635
♫ It's gonna go

631
00:27:47,514 --> 00:27:50,220
♫ In the blink of an eye

632
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,328
♫ And I just wanna know

633
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:56,045
♫ You'll be there

634
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:58,045
(cheering)

635
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:00,678
♫ And it can feel so cold

636
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,793
♫ But I'm holding on

637
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:07,702
- I just wanna thank everybody
for coming out tonight.

638
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:09,532
I'm sure there's a lot of
other things you could be doing

639
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:11,644
and I'm very flattered.

640
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:14,365
I'm glad I got to say hello
to everybody real quick.

641
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:15,553
I'm looking forward to...

642
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,128
Jesus, that's a big beer.

643
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,977
(laughing)

644
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,504
I'm excited to talk to a bunch of you.

645
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:23,209
I've had an incredible two full days,

646
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:25,027
very full days, thank you Rysa

647
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:29,194
for packing my schedule
for 18 fuckin hours a day.

648
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:33,202
DRock and I are going to be
very happy to leave in an hour

649
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:37,852
so we can finally get to
the airport and go to sleep.

650
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:39,940
I've really enjoyed it.

651
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,536
Maybe you've heard, we have some serious

652
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:43,800
ambitions of opening an office here.

653
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,967
So, I have a funny feeling,
I'll be seeing you guys around.

654
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,736
Thank you so much for the hospitality.

655
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:53,221
I think the entrepreneurial spirit,

656
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:56,891
the class, the grit,
it' been very fruitful.

657
00:28:56,891 --> 00:28:57,972
I've really enjoyed it.

658
00:28:57,972 --> 00:28:59,943
I'm really looking forward to saying hello

659
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:02,185
and getting to know some
of you guys tonight.

660
00:29:02,185 --> 00:29:04,144
If not fully tonight, I'm
sure hopefully in the future.

661
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:06,308
So, I wish you guys
nothing but good health

662
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:08,764
and all good stuff, and I
hope you have a nice night.

663
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:10,034
Thanks for coming out.

664
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:14,389
The only mentor I've ever
had is you guys; the market.

665
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:15,906
The market is my mentor.

666
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:17,702
The market is my religion.

667
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:21,785
The consumer has been my
guide from a little kid.

668
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,714
Lemonade, like it's crazy.

669
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:26,547
Now that I've learned...

670
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,503
You know how you're starting
to get even in your 20's,

671
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:32,023
you're starting to
understand yourself better.

672
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:34,379
When I think back to what I did as a kid,

673
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:35,746
how consumer centric.

674
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:39,227
Baseball card shows, sports memorabilia.

675
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:42,331
I would do something, now
I'm like, "Oh my god."

676
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:45,200
Everybody would set up their table.

677
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,078
Before the mall or the
convention center would open,

678
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,092
you set up your table, your booth.

679
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:51,697
I didn't.

680
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:53,282
I would never set up.

681
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:56,966
I would walk the entire floor; context.

682
00:29:56,966 --> 00:29:58,402
Who's pricing what?

683
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:00,462
What do people have on their tables?

684
00:30:00,462 --> 00:30:02,120
Is it football cards,
is it baseball cards?

685
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,962
Is there a certain player that's hot?

686
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:06,302
Then, I would wait for the first hour and

687
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:10,105
watch what people did at those tables.

688
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:12,022
Then I would go set up.

689
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:15,184
It's funny, I talk so much.

690
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:16,815
Sit down, talk.

691
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,815
But I'm listening a lot.

692
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,219
So, my mentor is the game; the market.

693
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,466
Thank you so much, thank you.

694
00:30:33,577 --> 00:30:35,370
We're going to my hotel,
right to get bags?

695
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,487
- [Cameraman] Yeah.

696
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,404
- Hey guys, it's 11:06.

697
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:41,548
DRock, I have no idea how you're planning

698
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,099
on editing this episode,
but you better fuckin show

699
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:46,924
the fact that I've been fucking talking

700
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:48,454
and taking questions and answers for

701
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:51,918
the last fucking 14 straight hours.

702
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:54,411
I will punch you in the
nose if you don't show it.

703
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:58,120
This was a real fucking grinder Singapore.

704
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,203
♫ One day your heart

705
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:07,099
♫ Will make it home

706
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,668
♫ Will make it home

707
00:31:23,202 --> 00:31:26,731
- Alright guys, it's your
favorite moment of every vlog.

708
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:29,031
This time I really need it.

709
00:31:29,031 --> 00:31:32,645
Do you know about the greatest
action hero of all time?

710
00:31:32,645 --> 00:31:34,601
- I have no idea.

711
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,375
- You're looking at one of
the great transformations

712
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:40,377
when I go from a mere mortal man

713
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:43,720
to the great superhero of our generation.

714
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,887
This is when I turn into airport Gary.

715
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,661
I have music, there's
music playing right now.

716
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:51,672
Oh yeah, there's music.

717
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:53,976
Now I am rejuvenated and unstoppable.

718
00:31:53,976 --> 00:31:56,059
- [Woman] That's amazing.

719
00:32:01,804 --> 00:00:00,000
(applause)
