1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:04,917
- [Announcer] Get up on
your feet, Gary Vaynerchuk.

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:09,166
(cheering and applause)

3
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:16,250
- [Man] Thank you,
you changed my life.

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,458
- [Man 2] I love you, Gary.

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,708
- Love you back, thank you.

6
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:26,875
Thank you.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,250
(cheering)

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,959
- [Woman] Love you, Gary.
(cheering and applause)

9
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,333
- Thank you, Vancouver.
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:41,000
Thank you, let's do this.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,959
I mean look, we could
stay here all day and do that,

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,667
but I want to bring some value.

13
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,792
Yeah, so listen I think we're
doing a pretty cool format.

14
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,375
We're gonna go 20-20-20.

15
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,875
I'm gonna yap here a little bit,

16
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,250
then we're gonna do a
quick little fireside.

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,083
Then we'll do some
questions with you guys.

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you for the love.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,792
I think that that
moment in itself is something

20
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,458
that I think
everybody should think about.

21
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,625
A funny thing happens
when you do the right thing.

22
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,041
A funny thing
happens when you over-deliver

23
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,125
to the others
and try to take less.

24
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,166
A funny thing happens
when you deploy patience

25
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,166
and run a marathon.

26
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,834
A funny thing happens
and what happens is you start

27
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,208
building equity,
you start building legacy,

28
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,959
you start building leverage.

29
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,125
That reaction I appreciate
and I know and have seen it

30
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,208
for others.

31
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,458
But I know the
reason I get that reaction

32
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:34,291
and it's not because of my
skill set on a sporting field

33
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,708
or how I sing.

34
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,125
It comes from the
fact that I'm desperately,

35
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,750
and I mean desperately
trying to figure out how

36
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,166
to bring value to you.

37
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,542
I've been thinking about
it a lot which is like hey,

38
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,625
why am I playing this patient?

39
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,667
Why am I not looking
for anything in return?

40
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,750
Why do I like it better
if I give you a whole bunch

41
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,500
and you never give me anything?

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,458
And I mean that.

43
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,959
And by the way I'm not
this great human being.

44
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,375
It's not that I'm the
nicest guy in the world.

45
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,625
There's something behind it.

46
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,375
I'm a businessman, I have
my own goals and ambitions.

47
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,917
So I've been really
trying to reverse engineer like

48
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:10,542
why is this my state?

49
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:13,250
What makes me
different in this way?

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,834
And the other
people that I see do it,

51
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,125
why do they do it?

52
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,166
I think it comes
up to this, my friends.

53
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,000
I think first and foremost,
and this is so important

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,583
for so many of you to
hear and I've been saying it

55
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,125
a bunch and I know there's by
the way a lot of engagement

56
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,208
on social so I know a lot
of you have context on me.

57
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,458
I spend the first
13, 14 years of my career

58
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,542
building a business and
not worrying about building

59
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:39,917
a personal brand and not
having a social media account.

60
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:41,333
I was building
an actual business.

61
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,500
I think the real reason I give
away my content for free,

62
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,542
I engage with all of you.
I answer, I give love.

63
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,542
I think the biggest reason
I do that is 'cause I don't

64
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:54,834
need your help or
money to accomplish my goals.

65
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:58,041
I have enough talent to
build businesses that are not

66
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,166
predicated on turning
admiration or attention

67
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,583
into short-term dollars.

68
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,208
I think this is very important
because if this conference

69
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,166
is positioned as
how do we build things

70
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,792
and have great impact,
it starts with only two things.

71
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,750
There's only two things.

72
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,083
Listen, my whole
talk given the framework

73
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,333
that they've created for
this conference is actually

74
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,417
very simple.
I was thinking about it,

75
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:21,250
I'm like okay
let's make it contextual.

76
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,917
Let's talk about
something slightly different.

77
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:26,458
It's actually very easy if
you're sitting in this audience

78
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,667
to achieve the ambition of the
context of this conference,

79
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,959
which is to do things
that are also then good

80
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,208
for humanity.
It's actually very, very simple.

81
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,708
It's two things.

82
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:39,583
It's intent and this
is a big one and we don't

83
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,500
talk about it enough
in our business world,

84
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,500
entrepreneurship,
tech, solopreneur, intent.

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,166
Like what are
you actually up to?

86
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,625
What are you
actually trying to do?

87
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,750
Is your intent to
actually build a great business

88
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,333
and give back to the world?

89
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,834
Or is your intent to disguise

90
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,500
that you want to make money

91
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,125
by saying that every
time somebody buys one

92
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:08,291
of your granola bars you donate
a granola bar to the hungry?

93
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,959
And I'm glad that eight
of you laughed over there

94
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,583
because I'm going
to tell you something.

95
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,125
As somebody who was
there and saw Blake early on

96
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,875
when he formed
that TOMS shoes model

97
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,667
and as somebody who's an
angel investor in 2013 and '14

98
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,959
and looking at
every single company,

99
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,208
I saw an ungodly amount
of 23-year-olds claiming to me

100
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,750
that because they're
Millennials, this was the best,

101
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,083
this was my favorite pitch.

102
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,750
Because they were
Millennials they cared

103
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,291
about the world more
and so they both wanted

104
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,000
to make money but also they
cared more about the world

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,792
than Gen X,
which was really cute.

106
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,208
Then I would look
at their business model

107
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,500
and whatever the fuck
they were selling that they

108
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,959
were then donating one
to somebody that was so

109
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,750
fucking needy, right?

110
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,625
And literally, if you pressed
them on why it was going

111
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,583
to this country, if
you even asked one question

112
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,250
why it was going
to this country,

113
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,500
you pretty much ended up

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,792
realizing they just
threw a fucking dart at a map.

115
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,792
(audience laughter)

116
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:07,333
Then I just want to remind
everybody I'm a businessman.

117
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,458
I understand that
I put out content,

118
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,333
but I'm a businessman.

119
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,834
So it wasn't very difficult
for me to look at the P&amp;L

120
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,333
and the projections to
realize that they were selling

121
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,625
this granola bar, or umbrella,
or sneaker for twice

122
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,166
the price that it needed
to be so they could afford

123
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,625
to actually give the sneaker.

124
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,542
So what you were doing
actually was your intent

125
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:29,750
was to look like a good person

126
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,708
but still make as much money.

127
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,875
Every dollar that you
would have if you didn't

128
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,583
have the bullshit model that
you were donating something.

129
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,959
So what you were were
completely full of fucking shit.

130
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,291
(audience cheers and applause)

131
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,500
And I have great news.

132
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,083
I searched a lot of
accounts on my long-ass flight

133
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,875
to Vancouver last night of
people using hashtags here.

134
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,959
These are wonderful
people that are in the audience

135
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,250
using the hashtag and they're
going to change the world

136
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,250
and bring to humanity.

137
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,250
And some of you
are full of shit.

138
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,792
(audience laughter)

139
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,959
So if we're going
to accomplish something

140
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,750
from this conference
these two days of inspiration

141
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,208
and good stuff,

142
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,500
if you're gonna
actually accomplish something

143
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,125
when you walk out there and
go back to your normal lives,

144
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:21,000
I promise you step one
of the idea really good part

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,834
of the strategy needs
to be your actual intent.

146
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,708
I want to remind
everybody that it is very okay

147
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:31,291
to be selfish and build
something and do it in parallel.

148
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,583
You don't need to disguise
your ambitions and wants

149
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,959
and needs with horseshit
that you're going to donate

150
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,708
to the rain-fucking-forest.

151
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,208
(audience laughter)

152
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,542
You don't have to do that.

153
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,250
You're capable of
both, and I am that.

154
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,083
I live it.

155
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,333
I tell you from,
I always talk about stuff

156
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,208
that's real to me.

157
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,625
I am an assassin, killer,

158
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,792
ninja, selfish winner

159
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:57,625
in business and I can
separate that from who I am.

160
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,000
I want to remind everybody
my favorite all-time thing

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,083
of doing good is when somebody
called me out on Twitter

162
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,750
for not donating to
things or doing GoFundMe's

163
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,792
on social media.
That I was a bad guy.

164
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:11,208
And I literally DM'ed
this person and met him

165
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:15,166
at Starbucks where I
stopped in between that meeting.

166
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,333
This is back in 2011.

167
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:21,500
I stopped at my accountant's,
picked up my tax,

168
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,250
yeah picked up my tax returns.

169
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,375
You like this story,
this is a good one.

170
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,458
This is my favorite but I don't
tell this story very often.

171
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,083
But it's good under
the context of this.

172
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,083
He said, "GaryVee, why don't
you donate and do good causes?

173
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,041
"You're just selfish, you
just care about yourself.

174
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,250
"Why don't you do things like
your friends on social media?"

175
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,333
And he mentioned some
social media influencers.

176
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,417
I DM'ed him, I said, "Hey fuck
face, meet me at Starbucks."

177
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,500
(audience laughter)

178
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,583
I went to my accountant's,
I picked up my tax returns,

179
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,834
I showed up to the Starbucks.

180
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:50,625
He walked in, he shit
that I was actually there.

181
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,959
And then I showed
him my tax return.

182
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,000
Then I said to him,
"Young man here's the difference

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,583
"between you and I.

184
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,542
"You're still of the age where
people trick you easily,

185
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:05,542
"where people use
social media to PR themselves

186
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:08,625
"and are using causes
to build themselves up

187
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,375
"that they're good people,
and you're confused.

188
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,458
"When you do good you
stay quiet about that shit."

189
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,542
I showed ...

190
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,041
(audience applause and cheers)

191
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,041
You guys know me,
you guys know me.

192
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,625
I'm very comfortable to be
loud and proud of my vanity

193
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,583
and my kind of
like accomplishments.

194
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,834
And I self-promote.

195
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,207
But the things that I'm
most proud of you don't know

196
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:36,750
jack shit about, you don't.

197
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,375
So I showed him my
tax return which you know,

198
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,542
shows your donations
and how you actually roll.

199
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,207
And he was like,
"I'm so confused."

200
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,500
And I said, "You're confused
because you don't understand

201
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
"what's actually happening."

202
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,959
That's the point
of this intent talk.

203
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,250
Nobody in here is tricking
the one percent of winners

204
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,291
with their bullshit.

205
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,500
So if you want to
actually accomplish the thesis

206
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
of this conference,
you need to make sure

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,875
that your intent is pure.

208
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,083
Your intent, the
way you make your money,

209
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,333
the way you make your money
is something you're proud of.

210
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,542
That you're not bottom
feeding, and most of all

211
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:16,375
if you're going to do
good for the world, just do it.

212
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:20,083
Don't use it as your PR engine
to make money on the side.

213
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,750
Intent.
(audience cheering and applause)

214
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,792
It's true, and
I'm sure you've sniffed it out.

215
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:31,583
Number two, the only
other way to do this whole thing

216
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,458
is my favorite part.

217
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,208
The doing the work.

218
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:41,291
You know, before you
can help the elephants

219
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:46,125
and before you're
going to help carrots,

220
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,291
you actually have to
be in a position to help.

221
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,875
The way you do
that is create the means

222
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,208
and the infrastructure to help.

223
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,792
Whether that is a
voice and an audience,

224
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,333
whether that's
the financial means,

225
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,250
whether that's the
relationships, everybody here,

226
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,333
and when I say everybody here
I don't mean this conference,

227
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,458
I mean the whole fucking game.

228
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,750
99% of people are so
quick to get to this thing

229
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,125
that they don't
lay a foundation down.

230
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,583
You gotta
actually build a business

231
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,208
that gives you that air cover.

232
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,667
I wanna remind everybody
here, and it's really fun

233
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,542
because I always love
when the mix of the crowd

234
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:22,417
is 18 and 88.
(audience laughter)

235
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:25,500
Because if you're under
26 years old, you've not,

236
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,792
27 years old, you've not lived
through a tough economy yet.

237
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,792
It's been all upswing
since you've been in the game.

238
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:34,708
Just has, 2008, '09,
like call it what it is,

239
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,333
in 2010 it was
already on it's way up.

240
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,417
Simple as that.

241
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,917
So you're looking
in seven, eight years,

242
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,166
really means you're actually 30

243
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,166
and you haven't really played.

244
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,500
I look around and I see
people more my age and older.

245
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,166
We've been through
some shit, couple of cycles.

246
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,667
We know what happens.

247
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,125
Do you know how excited I am
for the world to collapse soon

248
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,667
so I can get rid of so
many of you fake fuckers.

249
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,667
(audience cheering)

250
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,917
Do you know how pumped I am?

251
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,750
I dream at night, last night
I fell asleep at two o'clock

252
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,458
and I go, one day that
kid's gonna have to change

253
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:14,625
his profile from
influencer to bank teller.

254
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,917
(audience laughter)

255
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,917
Can't fucking wait.

256
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:24,834
So, intent,
don't be full of shit

257
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,333
cause you're tricking
the 90% that don't matter

258
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,250
and you're losing
equity with the 10% that do.

259
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,208
Number two, do.

260
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,875
You gotta work, you feel super
inspired from this weekend,

261
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,667
you can't wait, what
happens next Thursday?

262
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,583
What happens next month?

263
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,291
You have to actually work a lot.

264
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,792
You know zero people,
zero people

265
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,417
that have built something big

266
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,875
that haven't put in a
ridiculous amount of work,

267
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,083
and the bigger it is
the more they worked.

268
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,375
So many of you have your mouth
way ahead of your actions.

269
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,500
Really, you're
gonna own an island

270
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,291
and you fucking go
to Cochella, fuck you.

271
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,125
(audience laughter)

272
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,917
Cause it's the truth.

273
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,959
It's the truth and
the reason you say that

274
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,000
is cause you, like me,
have been through

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,208
a couple of these cycles.
We know exactly what

276
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,708
we're living through. 
All of my 48-year-old

277
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,125
executive employees
were trillionaires in 2000

278
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,625
cause of the internet
and the stock market prices.

279
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,333
You know how many
people here, have a startup,

280
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,333
raised money, and have not
had one month in their lives

281
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,834
where they were profitable?

282
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,500
Let me remind all of you
startups that have raised money,

283
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,583
it doesn't take a hero
to lose money each month.

284
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,834
And there's a problem, and
I'm coming with you with this,

285
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,625
and this is positive fire.
I'm not razzing you,

286
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,166
I'm trying to give you love
because I know what's happening,

287
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,458
I live in that world.

288
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,917
VC money is clamping up.

289
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:54,125
VC money is clamping up, so I'm
sitting here and telling you

290
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,583
to do, if you are not making
money yet with your business

291
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,583
figure out why.

292
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,583
Change your model.

293
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,208
Cut your overhead.

294
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,083
Shit's coming.

295
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,917
Practicality is my religion.

296
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,750
Practicality is my religion.

297
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,208
That's why I push
patience on so many of you,

298
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,917
'cause it's practical.
It is a marathon.

299
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,708
Unless you die
it's gonna be long.

300
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,458
So why are you running so fast,
why do you need it so bad?

301
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,875
Let me tell you
what really sucks.

302
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,542
It really sucks when
you bought a $20,000 watch

303
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,083
and shit hits the fan
and you can't sell that

304
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,125
piece of jewelry for
$4,000 'cause everybody's

305
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,917
trying to get a job.

306
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,000
And so everybody
is not investing.

307
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,166
Let me tell, and by the way,
I eat my own dog food.

308
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:46,208
From 20 to 30 I built a
business to $45 million a year

309
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,500
business kicking real profit,
and I was paying myself

310
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,625
$47,000 a year living
in a one bedroom apartment

311
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,291
and driving a Jeep Grand
Cherokee, which was nice,

312
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,375
but it wasn't a fucking Beamer.

313
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,166
And I did that cause I was

314
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,667
investing in the 
business for a foundation.

315
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,000
And everybody's
trying to make a buck

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,667
and they're pulling it out.

317
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,542
You're making money and
you're buying nice suits.

318
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:12,625
Stupid, short term, insecurity.

319
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,500
(laughs)

320
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,792
(audience applause)

321
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:20,166
People getting
naked in the front row.

322
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:25,000
But I mean it, but I mean it.

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,375
Right, like there's that
meme, you know it's funny,

324
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,834
it makes me smile and I hope
people are getting something

325
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,458
out of it. There's that
meme from Jay Z on Instagram,

326
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,125
right, like two pictures of
him, one with a ton of jewelry

327
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,041
and then one now
with just a black t-shirt,

328
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,458
and it shows one, he was
like worth a million dollars,

329
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,834
and now, but
really, that's just real.

330
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,500
And the thing that I
don't like, and I've been

331
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
bringing it up here and I'm
gonna bring it up again is,

332
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,333
people are fronting for
people that aren't going

333
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,208
to be the impact on them.

334
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:54,333
I met with a kid for 20
minutes today, loved him,

335
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,000
he's got it, but he's
doing, but, thank you,

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,208
but he doesn't, but
he's doing something

337
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,125
that's gonna hurt him.

338
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,375
And I told him, I said,
"Look, you're doing something

339
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:07,375
"that is not going to win.
I would eliminate you

340
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,959
"from consideration
to do business with

341
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,000
"based on this behavior other
than I don't think I'm shit

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,333
"and I shouldn't be judging
people, but most of the majority

343
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,708
"of my contemporaries
are doing that."

344
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,708
I'm just confused by the
behavior of the current system

345
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:25,208
because so much of it facade,
so much of it is short term,

346
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:29,667
so much of it is fake, and I
don't know, I just know how

347
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,125
I got here today.

348
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,959
I know how
I got the luxury

349
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,166
and the enormous,

350
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,041
enormous feeling of admiration,

351
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,959
and it came from tried and true.

352
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,417
And it comes from
tried and true for everybody.

353
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,250
And what we do is
we sit around and look

354
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,750
at the .000001%

355
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,166
of a
guy that creates Instagram,

356
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,333
or a guy that creates
Facebook, or Elon Musk,

357
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,500
and we start mapping
towards these anomalies,

358
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,208
yet 99.99999% of people
that have been successful,

359
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:09,291
it took them 20, 30, 40 years,
tried and true, hard work,

360
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,959
and so I try to impose on
you here today, my friends,

361
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,583
through sheer will trying to
force it down your throat,

362
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,500
that first and foremost
your intent needs to be pure.

363
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,959
If you wanna
build a good business

364
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,834
and you wanna
give back to the world,

365
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:25,500
then that's what
you actually have to do.

366
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,708
You know, you're
not gonna trick, right,

367
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,000
and then, you know,
I don't know, I'm just,

368
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,041
I'm just very, very,
very passionate about this

369
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,083
because

370
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,458
you're living
through the greatest era

371
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,583
that human beings
have ever lived through,

372
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,583
and I am not confused to
the macro political issues

373
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,166
that we're living through.
And I understand all

374
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,041
the scenarios that we're
living through across the globe.

375
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,917
It's just that humans
have never had it better.

376
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,917
Like your life is better

377
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:56,000
than your great,
great-grandparents.

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,834
There's a lot of shit going
on with political presence

379
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,208
and things of that nature,
yet it's still better

380
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:05,083
than if the Black Plague was
running through us right now.

381
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,875
Like, we are so fortunate,
the fact that you're even

382
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:12,000
at this conference puts you at
this, such a small percentage

383
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,333
of people in the world,
we have 7.4 billion people

384
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:19,665
in this world, and you have
it so good. I am so grateful.

385
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:24,540
I am so grateful, right, I am
so aware of what's actually

386
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,582
happening here, and
I don't mean for me.

387
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,125
I mean for all of you.

388
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,458
And so, I can't wrap
my head around wasting

389
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,000
the one at-bat we have,
unless somebody here

390
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,166
has got some real interesting
data, we don't come back.

391
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,000
And you know what,
I'm super fucking pumped

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,166
that I ended up
being a human being.

393
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:49,417
It's much more fun
than being an elephant.

394
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:53,250
And so if you take into
account the ridiculousness

395
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,417
and the utter
quadruple miracle that it is

396
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,875
that you're even
sitting here in a human

397
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,083
and have all this opportunity
that you were a human

398
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,625
during this era, and
you're not willing to deploy

399
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,583
the patience, and the work
ethic, and the tried and true

400
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,458
that it takes to live,
you know how many people here

401
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,834
want to be a millionaire?

402
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,375
Do you know how rare that is?

403
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,166
Have you run the math?

404
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:20,166
You have this enormous audacity,
you have this enormous

405
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,250
audacity, yet you're
not putting in the work

406
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,333
to get you there
because you think

407
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,667
somehow you've been tricked

408
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,250
by yourself or somebody else

409
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,959
that there's some system,

410
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,125
that there's
some fucking shortcut.

411
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,458
There's no fucking shortcut.

412
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,417
You've gotta put in the work.

413
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,834
Lots of it.

414
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:44,500
And that comes at the
expense of golfing all the time,

415
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,250
and that comes at
the expense of going

416
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,917
to every god damn event.

417
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,500
And it definitely
comes at the expense

418
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,959
of watching one
more motivational video,

419
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:57,041
and three more books, and
seven more pod, you have to do.

420
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,834
Doing is the game.

421
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,834
(audience applause)

422
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,250
The remote control of society.

423
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,750
If you sit in this
room and you do not know

424
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,542
how to make written words,
audio sounds, or videos

425
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:19,542
for this device,
on the 7 to 10 platforms

426
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,166
that dominate it,

427
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,834
Facebook, YouTube,
Instagram, Snapchat,

428
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:28,041
then you are
invisible to society.

429
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,417
I'm gonna say it one more time.

430
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:33,417
You know, the
first 80% of this rant

431
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:36,291
felt really good for
the 50-year-old plus.

432
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,125
The next two minutes
are not gonna feel so good.

433
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,708
(audience laughter)

434
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,625
If you live in the world today

435
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:51,083
and you do not, at scale,
produce written words,

436
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,834
audio sounds or videos for
this device,

437
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:59,458
you do not exist,

438
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,959
and you need to wrap
your head around that.

439
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:05,875
So, the theme of this, in
actuality, is the following.

440
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,458
The answer is self-awareness.

441
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,000
Know who you are,
know what you do,

442
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,250
and then tell it in the way

443
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,792
that comes most natural to you.

444
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,542
If you're a writer, great.

445
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,083
Start posting on Medium,

446
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,417
I've got a great
little recommendation

447
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,583
that a lot of people
aren't talking about.

448
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,792
If you like to write,

449
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,667
write long posts on
Facebook and Instagram.

450
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,250
Get in a company picture,

451
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,125
and write a long-ass blog post.

452
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,000
How many people here are
writing a blog right now?

453
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,583
Raise your hands high.

454
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,458
Tomorrow, write on Facebook,

455
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,250
in addition to, or
move your blog to Facebook.

456
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,875
It will change your world.

457
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,041
Tomorrow.

458
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,875
Audio, how many
people here have a podcast?

459
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:48,917
Raise your hands.

460
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,041
Couple.

461
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,250
If you don't like to write,

462
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,291
and listen, even
though I've written four

463
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,375
New York Times
bestselling books,

464
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,792
I can't write for shit.

465
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,000
If any of you've
gotten an email from me,

466
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,625
can't put two
sentences together.

467
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,792
God bless ghost writers,
I love you Stephanie Land.

468
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,208
But I can talk.

469
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,500
And so, if you
don't want to be on video,

470
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,458
'cause your conscious
of that, but you can talk,

471
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,250
and you're not a good writer,
you need to start a podcast,

472
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,542
and you need to put
your content on SoundCloud

473
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,375
and Spotify tomorrow.

474
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,750
And, if you've
got the gift for gab

475
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,291
and charisma, and
you like the camera,

476
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,291
and it lights you
up like it does for me,

477
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,959
then you need to
make videos tomorrow

478
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:29,000
on YouTube and
Facebook and Instagram.

479
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,083
Tomorrow.

480
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,708
If you do not
communicate that intent,

481
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,458
and then when I say go do,

482
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,959
you've gotta build
a business or content,

483
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,083
but it needs to live in here.

484
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,500
There is no other world,

485
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,166
and it is the
modern version of this.

486
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,250
Affiliate marketing and
search and all these things,

487
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,250
they don't play
the same way on this,

488
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,083
and there's nothing else.

489
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,375
I don't even have
a computer any more.

490
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,959
I've lived the last 18 months
of my life with only this.

491
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:59,041
I look at laptops
like what is that?

492
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,500
The world is shifting
faster than it ever has before,

493
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,250
but the way to
win is as old at time.

494
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,708
Do the right thing,

495
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,708
and put in the fuckin' work.

496
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,917
Thank you.

497
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,291
(audience applause)

498
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,959
- Oh, we're gonna go
right up to the front.

499
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,208
- I want to get real close.

500
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,208
- All right.

501
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,542
Shit, look at this.
Thank you.

502
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:32,834
- You're welcome. 
- Thank you, brother.

503
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,250
- How incredible is this guy?

504
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,250
(audience cheers) 
Holy fuck.

505
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,792
- I'm only incredible
because I'm saying the thing

506
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:46,041
that so many of you think, but
you do things to cover it up.

507
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,959
You know your
buddy's full of shit.

508
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,583
I just tell my buddy,
you're full of shit,

509
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,792
and then they have
a decision to make,

510
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,834
and so many of those
buddies are like you know what?

511
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:58,166
I am, and I can deploy
this charisma and gift for gab

512
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,125
if I just swallow it
for three or four years,

513
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,875
I can actually be big,
bigger than I would have been

514
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,083
by selling this
short-term bullshit,

515
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,417
and feel good about myself.

516
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,291
I'm not doing this
'cause this makes me feel good

517
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,333
and I'm like ah, ha.

518
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,250
I'm doing this 'cause
I want you to feel good.

519
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,458
I feel good.

520
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,458
(audience laughter)

521
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,708
- All right, so when I was
in New York and we connected,

522
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,542
you talked about, you
know, business man Gary

523
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,500
and then like Batman Gary.
- Right.

524
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,250
- Right, and I absolutely
loved this idea, this concept.

525
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,834
So, just for a second I want
to talk to business man Gary.

526
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,208
When you're looking at
investing in a company,

527
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,125
like investing in a
business that's up and coming,

528
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,792
what are some of the key
things that you look for?

529
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:40,917
What's like really important?

530
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,625
- Only two things
I give a shit about.

531
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,708
One, do I believe
in your thesis?

532
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,333
If you walk in and
say I'm building a website

533
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,542
that really
does well on a laptop

534
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:56,667
and sells ice cream in Alaska,

535
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,458
I'm like oh, that's
a shit thesis, I'm out.

536
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,208
Right?

537
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,500
So, I have to
believe in your thesis.

538
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,750
I believe that meditation
over the next decade

539
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,291
is gonna be the big
consumer space, right?

540
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,041
I feel like, thanks Mom.

541
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,083
(audience laughter)

542
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,542
But what you and I know

543
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:19,333
is that physical health
has been a 30, 40 year trend,

544
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,583
it is time to talk
about the mental part.

545
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,750
It's the whole game,
it's all I've got.

546
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,083
By the way, if you
dissect me, I'm so basic.

547
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,208
It's just EQ, it's
just very basic things,

548
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:34,583
it's self-esteem,
it's insecurity, right?

549
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,083
It's very simple,
what I actually talk about.

550
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,750
I update it by the
current state of the world,

551
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,667
but the thesis is
as simple as it gets.

552
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:45,375
So, what you and I know is that

553
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,792
I believe every
single person here

554
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:49,959
will be spending
meaningful money on meditation,

555
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,750
whether going to meditation
studios, 'cause it's trendy.

556
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,250
Whether getting
an app so they sleep.

557
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,959
But it's gonna be great.
I'm really excited.

558
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,000
I really, I'm
excited to be like 70, 80

559
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,417
and see the full cycle of it,

560
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,792
'cause it's gonna help so many,

561
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,333
so many people here would

562
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:07,333
benefit from
mental games, right?

563
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,917
So if you come in
and have a meditation,

564
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:12,333
if you came in and said I want
to start the clothing brand,

565
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,625
like, remember Tap Out for UFC?

566
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,875
I want to start the clothing
brand for the meditation space,

567
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,792
which seems ridiculous,

568
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:21,917
'cause the meditation space
in itself isn't fully baked,

569
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,250
and you want to be the clothing,

570
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,542
which has nothing to do with it,

571
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:26,000
you know, what is it
gonna be, a headband?

572
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,250
I'd still be interested,

573
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,834
(audience laughter)

574
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:32,917
I'd be interested, because
I believe it's gonna happen.

575
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:35,542
Then comma, and
equally as important,

576
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:37,708
probably slightly
more important to me,

577
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:40,041
is do I believe in her?

578
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,834
Can she do it?

579
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:44,083
Can she, when shit is tough,

580
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,750
thirteen months in
and money's bleeding,

581
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,667
and she has to
fire her best friend,

582
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,959
and she's not doing
well, and it's lonely,

583
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:54,041
and she knows that her parents
told her to go to Harvard,

584
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,417
but she did this, and
now she's on the brink,

585
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:59,333
does she have the
stomach to get through it?

586
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,208
The biggest issue
right now, in 2017,

587
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,375
is entrepreneurship
has become so popular

588
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:06,375
that characters
like me take selfies

589
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,875
that everybody thinks
they have to be one,

590
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,750
but it takes a
certain kind of makeup,

591
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,750
and everybody's about to
get punched in the mouth,

592
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,250
and most of them are gonna fold

593
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,792
like a bunch of fuckin' losers.

594
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,792
- All right,
that's some real talk.

595
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,583
That's some real talk,
we'll take it.

596
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,959
- So when I invest,
I'm like okay.

597
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,792
If she walked in

598
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,250
and I believed in the
meditation app she's building,

599
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,667
and I really liked her,
I would say okay,

600
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,417
shit's gonna hit the fan,

601
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,250
probably before
meditation gets big,

602
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,000
but there's something
about her that makes me think

603
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,417
that when that
shit hits the fan,

604
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:39,417
she's gonna turn it
into a cupcake company

605
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:40,834
and we're still
gonna make money.

606
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,291
That's what I'm looking for.

607
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,875
I'll fuckin'
sell hot dogs tomorrow

608
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:47,667
if nobody wants to
buy social media content.

609
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,166
I'm just telling
you guys the truth,

610
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,250
that's what I would, I mean,

611
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,083
better than
going out of business.

612
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,083
Love it when people are like

613
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:56,792
we're gonna go out of business.

614
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,041
I'm like, you're a
bullshit entrepreneur.

615
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,375
Like, you didn't
even try for a second.

616
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:04,917
The second adversity came you
folded like a cheap chair.

617
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,291
Loser.
(audience laughter)

618
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,959
- So let's talk about that.

619
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,667
Let's talk about
adversity, 'cause I think,

620
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,125
I think this is something that--
- I love it.

621
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,166
- All entrepreneurs
can relate to.

622
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,625
And I mean, yeah, so how
do you deal with adversity?

623
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:17,792
'Cause it's gonna happen.
- Happily.

624
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:20,917
- Yeah. (laughs)

625
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:22,375
Just the one word answer.

626
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,625
I love it.

627
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,708
- Definitely not complain.

628
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:27,000
I love when people compain,

629
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
like somebody walked in
my office the other day,

630
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,667
she's raised $100 million,

631
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:31,917
her company's huge.

632
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:32,875
She sits and complains.

633
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,500
I'm like, my friend.

634
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,667
I'm like, you've 
raised $100 million,

635
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:42,125
you've paid yourself a nice
salary for the last six years,

636
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,708
you've lived on your own terms,

637
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,792
you've been on the
cover of magazines,

638
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,708
I'm struggling to
cry for you right now.

639
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:52,125
Like, you made
your bed, lay in it.

640
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:56,083
So, I deal with
adversity happily.

641
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:01,041
I know exactly what to do.

642
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,375
Meaning, you cut your expenses

643
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,875
and you maximize your profits.

644
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,333
And if you were smart,
you knew it was coming

645
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,625
and you're not too over bloated
in one way or the other.

646
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:13,458
I'm definitely not at the
reliance of somebody else.

647
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:18,041
So, no VC's, or I've never
raised money for my businesses.

648
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,000
I make money,

649
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,417
I don't give pieces
away of my company for money.

650
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:26,250
Thank you.
(audience applause)

651
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,625
And so, I don't know,
I just like it.

652
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,166
I think battle
scars are attractive.

653
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:36,458
- Like it. In terms of
like building Batman

654
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,125
building this like personal,
building this like

655
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,250
personal brand that
you have that you put out,

656
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,875
which is why a lot, you know,
a lot of us are here today.

657
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:46,417
I'm curious, you talk
about document don't create.

658
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:47,208
- Yes

659
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,291
- How important is it to
have something to create on?

660
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,792
Because I think,
what you talk about is

661
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,458
you talk about a
lot of these Millennials

662
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,000
and a lot of these
younger people who are trying to

663
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,291
take the selfies and
build an online profile,

664
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,917
but they don't have
something to actually document.

665
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,667
So what does that
look like in your business?

666
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,125
- By the way, it's
not just Millennials,

667
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,083
there's plenty of 
40, 50-, 60-, 70-,

668
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:08,125
80-year-old non-executors, too.

669
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,875
The reason I came up
with document over create

670
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,250
is for people that don't
have something big already.

671
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,917
Like you should
document your journey.

672
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,375
The first
episode should be like,

673
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,375
"Hey, it's me, Rick."

674
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,625
(audience laughter)

675
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:26,375
Yeah, so, I kinda realized last
night that I'm full of shit.

676
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:30,625
And, you know, my t-shirt
company isn't fucking Nike.

677
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:34,041
You know, and so I'm just
gonna talk about my journey.

678
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:38,500
And I'm gonna go to the gas
station and fill up my car.

679
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,875
I mean like you...
(audience laughter)

680
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:45,375
I think the only thing
that really sells is truth.

681
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,000
And people always
email me when I say that

682
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,083
they're like look at
this guy they were a scumbag

683
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:52,708
I'm like yes, that
person eventually goes to jail.

684
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,500
People are just
looking, I don't,

685
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
dude I'm struggling out here.

686
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,125
I'm not joking,
I'm struggling out here.

687
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:03,208
Like, really we're at a place
now where kids think it's cool

688
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,542
if somebody goes and
takes money out of a bank

689
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:09,583
and puts it on their fucking
bed, and takes a picture of it?

690
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,208
Like what the fuck
is the matter with you?

691
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,291
(audience laughter)

692
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,125
It's gonna be bad and
it's gonna be fucking good.

693
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,875
(audience laughter)

694
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,542
- Alright, so I wanna
back the train up a little bit

695
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,000
because meditation
is something that

696
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,583
I think is really
important, that mindfulness

697
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,583
in the workspace
as entrepreneurs.

698
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,708
We had Moment out here
which is like a tech company

699
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,875
here in Vancouver
that represents

700
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,834
meditation and
meditation in the workplace.

701
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,375
And I think it's
really important.

702
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,125
How do you integrate
that with your employees

703
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,792
and with your team, I'm really
curious as to like how do you

704
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:44,000
build that within like
the corporate infrastructure?

705
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,625
- Meditation?
- Just mindfulness in general,

706
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,917
or if you haven't done it yet,

707
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:53,208
do you see it becoming a part
of all work environments?

708
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,291
- I'm a funny entrepreneur.

709
00:30:55,291 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm a bigger fan of
capitalism than communism.

710
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,166
And so, I tend to like really
let my people do their thing.

711
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:07,417
You know, I don't
like doing things,

712
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,792
you know, I think of myself
as the federal government,

713
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,417
and I think of my business
leaders as like the states

714
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,208
using the
American system, right?

715
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:19,083
So I don't actually manage,
push down a lot of things

716
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,625
into my company
because you know,

717
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,208
I think companies get
very politically correct

718
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,625
and of the moment.
I don't wanna like,

719
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:30,834
now everybody has to meditate,
I've meditated once.

720
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:33,125
Because I
invested in the company.

721
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,542
(audience laughter)

722
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,458
And I fucking hated it.

723
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:42,625
Doesn't mean that I
don't think it's gonna be huge.

724
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:46,208
You know, I just
don't wanna do it!

725
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,625
(audience laughter)

726
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:53,166
So, that's the truth
like, listen I feel good

727
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,500
like maybe if my mental status
changes, maybe I'll be like,

728
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,959
oh maybe that can
help, I don't know

729
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:00,834
right now, I'm actually
scared to meditate, bro.

730
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,667
I'm so happy I'm like,
that meditation shit

731
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,000
better not fuck me up.

732
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,083
(audience laughter)

733
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,625
I think companies

734
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,875
do politically correct
things and look stupid.

735
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:12,959
I love when big
companies thought

736
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:17,125
by putting a foosball table
and giving free cereal out

737
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,125
that that made them like Google.

738
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,667
I'm not a big fan of tactics,
I'm a big fan of religion.

739
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:28,625
Here's my religion: I give
a shit about my employees.

740
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:32,041
(audience applause)

741
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't need to give them a
foosball table, I don't know,

742
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,208
if Rick wants to go on
vacation eight times a year,

743
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,959
we have unlimited
vacation policy, unlimited.

744
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,625
Now, if you take
eight weeks of vacation,

745
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,458
and you're not dismantling it

746
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,166
the rest of the year,
you're fired.

747
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,542
But, unlimited.

748
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:52,417
I don't think Millennials
like work-life balance.

749
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,083
I have nothing but
22-year-olds who are like

750
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,166
"I want more money, dick,"
I'm like okay.

751
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,583
(audience laughter)

752
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:02,750
I'm like work, you know, like
you know I love, you know like

753
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,375
so I think people impose too
much stuff, it's all tactics.

754
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,125
It's what I talked
about with you guys.

755
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,625
The majority of people here
that are solving the world

756
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:13,625
are in tactics not religion.
They don't mean it.

757
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,166
They're posturing,
companies do that.

758
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,875
They come up with happy
hours and foosball tables,

759
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:22,375
and free cereal to make
pretend they give a shit.

760
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,750
So, I talk about
my truths, you know

761
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,708
we'll bring in somebody
maybe speak about meditation

762
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,208
but they can or can't
I don't judge on that.

763
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:32,333
I wanna reverse engineer
every person one by one.

764
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,625
I'm not imposing
my will on them.

765
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,583
Kid walked in the
other day he goes,

766
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,125
"Gary, I'm gonna be the
CEO of this company."

767
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,333
I'm like, bro, good
now here's the problem,

768
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,875
you've already
wasted too much time.

769
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,250
So, you know, whatever.

770
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,333
(audience laughter)

771
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,708
Like you're not gonna
be the CEO of this company

772
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:56,375
when you took 4.3 weeks vacation
last year, and you're 23.

773
00:33:56,375 --> 00:34:00,667
You need to work 19
hours a day and learn.

774
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:01,708
- Yep, it's amazing.

775
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,834
- Here's what's fun
- Okay, keep going

776
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,041
- You know what's fun about it?

777
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:10,750
It doesn't matter
what I'm saying up here.

778
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,542
Like, all I'm repeating
is what the market's doing.

779
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,667
Right, this isn't my opinion,

780
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,542
It doesn't matter that
I'm saying it in a funny way,

781
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:20,125
sitting a funny way.

782
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,917
This is what the
market does, I'm just saying

783
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:25,792
it's not me, this is
what the market does.

784
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,125
Like, that's what
people don't understand

785
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,542
I have no opinions, I'm
just observing the market

786
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,542
and just reiterating it.

787
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,958
That's why it's fun,
I don't take it personal,

788
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:40,875
like, I don't care for the three
people that are gonna tweet

789
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,792
here, after this conference,
tons of good

790
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:44,667
and there'll be
three people like

791
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,625
I don't like Gary
his ego's too much.

792
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,750
I'm like I don't care
'cause they're gonna be right

793
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,333
or I'm gonna be right.
Maybe they're right.

794
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:54,708
Maybe my ego's too much and my
head will explode next week.

795
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,125
(audience laughter)

796
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,917
I have a funny
feeling I'm gonna fucking win.

797
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:01,750
(audience cheers)

798
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:05,667
And by the way

799
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,792
(audience laughter)

800
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,125
We all have it, right?
Like we all still have

801
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,500
our chips and fun,
I'm really enjoying this

802
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,000
Planet of the Apps thing.

803
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,333
Re/code wrote an article that
said, Planet of the Apps coming

804
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,083
with Gwyneth Paltrow,

805
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,625
celebrity mentors 
Gwyneth Paltrow

806
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:28,083
Will.i.am, Jessica Alba,

807
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,375
and others.

808
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,875
(audience laughter)

809
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,917
And I was so pumped.

810
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:37,875
Like, I love adversity,
My man, nobody in this room

811
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:41,333
you could be tied with me,
but nobody in here loves more,

812
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:45,708
losing, adversity, difficulty.
I'm a wartime general.

813
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:49,625
I hate this peacetime,
these good times, meh.

814
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:54,375
This shit that's
about to come, carnage.

815
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:58,125
Oh God, I'm ready,
I'm so ready man.

816
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:01,625
- Because you've built your
business out of that adversity.

817
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,125
- Guys, do you know what I did?

818
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,375
Do I have to
remind the eight of you

819
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,667
that knew me seven years ago?

820
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:08,000
I was at the height, I was
one of the 50 most followed

821
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,917
people on Twitter when
there was no other networks.

822
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,542
I had just invested in
Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr,

823
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,750
I was the guy, I was
hanging out with Mark Zuckerberg

824
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,250
every week that
he was in New York,

825
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,375
I had all the
relationships, I was this

826
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,875
genius predictor of
where the world's going,

827
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,875
and I started an agency.

828
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:27,250
This is not my words,
these are my actions!

829
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,041
Who gives a shit what I'm
saying, watch what I'm doing.

830
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,208
At the height of
my career to be fancy,

831
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,291
I went and decided
to do client services

832
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,375
and eat shit and have clients.

833
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,667
'Cause I wanted to built a
marketing machine for the future

834
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,625
I decided, let
me take a step back

835
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,125
and build something
for ten years, eat shit

836
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:47,500
make lots less money,
have lots less fun

837
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,583
not cash in on all
these great things I did,

838
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:53,959
let me build a foundation
for, you know, 50 to 90.

839
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,959
So, like, I don't know,
like I know I talk a lot

840
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:02,792
but I promise you, I'm doing
way more than I'm talking.

841
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:05,667
- How do you, it's interesting
'cause watching your journey

842
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:09,625
it's almost like
you have this cognition

843
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,166
of what's coming.

844
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,208
How have you developed that?

845
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,667
'Cause I think
that for a lot of us

846
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,083
it's challenging
to see what's coming.

847
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,083
How do you cultivate that?
I think it's so important

848
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,250
it's such an important skill.

849
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,000
- I got a good
answer for you, I lack ego.

850
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,792
Let me explain what I mean
by that, I know that's funny.

851
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,667
(audience laughter)

852
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,083
But I'll tell you
how it happened.

853
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,583
And what I mean by that.

854
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:32,458
I was one of the first top 50
followed people on twitter.

855
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,500
Ego, kept a lot of those
people staying on twitter

856
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,667
when other things emerged.

857
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,917
They didn't want
Instagram to happen.

858
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:42,208
Do you know how
many people in here loved

859
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:45,583
affiliate marketing
web 2002?

860
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:48,708
Ego kept them
out of social media.

861
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,125
Ego, do you understand?

862
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:54,917
I know that I ain't shit.

863
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:57,667
That the market is
the king and the queen

864
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,375
and I respond to it.

865
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,000
So the reason
I'm good like that,

866
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,166
is when new shit emerges

867
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,875
and then I go taste,
and I make judgment calls.

868
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,208
One thing a lot of you know is

869
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:08,000
I talk about
consumer VR being farther away

870
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,959
than a lot of people think, Why?

871
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,875
Because two and a half
years ago I jumped into VR,

872
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,125
when I tasted it's
beginning, and I used it,

873
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,625
and then I watched it and
now I'm using my experience.

874
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,875
Which is what I love
about 40-,50-,60-,70-,

875
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,875
80-year olds, we've seen it.

876
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,625
You haven't 27-year-old Pat,
you haven't seen it yet.

877
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,875
You will, so I saw it
and I'm like wait a minute

878
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,542
this is internet
1990 the technology's here

879
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,291
but the consumer behavior's not.

880
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:34,708
There's not a person
in this audience that

881
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,291
knows somebody that
spends two hours a day

882
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,458
consistently living in VR.

883
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,000
So, you know, that to me
is what's really exciting.

884
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,750
Other than people
that are in the industry.

885
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,708
And so, you know,
normal people don't.

886
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,166
And so we're still
a further way away.

887
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,917
And so I taste things and
then I make judgment calls

888
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:55,875
And that's why, and it
comes from lack of ego.

889
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,208
It doesn't matter that
you won the last thing,

890
00:38:58,208 --> 00:38:59,208
there's a new thing here.

891
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,125
Didn't matter that I won email,

892
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:03,917
email wasn't gonna
stay at 90% open rates.

893
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:05,917
It didn't matter
than I won Google AdWords.

894
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:08,125
Google AdWords weren't gonna
stay at five cents a click

895
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,875
and be the only thing.

896
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:13,625
And so I just lack, I just don't
read my own press clippings

897
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,583
I just think I'm as
good as my last at-bat.

898
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:18,166
I think I'm super fancy now

899
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,125
and that if I make
seven bad decisions

900
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,458
nobody's gonna
give a fuck and say

901
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:22,917
I told you so he was a huckster.

902
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:27,750
By the way,

903
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,250
that's how the market does it.

904
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,041
- I'm curious, I wanna shift
gears a little bit.

905
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,083
You're talking
about virtual reality.

906
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:38,041
I'm a huge nerd with AI--
- Okay.

907
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,333
- and I'm curious
how you think AI,

908
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,625
we already have A&amp;I here,

909
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,792
how do you think
AI is going to shape

910
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:47,208
and shift technology in our
communities and everything?

911
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,291
- It's real.

912
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,250
I call it third and half base.

913
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,667
Anything that AI
and machines can do

914
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:55,083
to get us to third and
a half base will be done,

915
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,708
and then we're
gonna take it home.

916
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,917
Anything that's being
done now by humans

917
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:02,708
that computers can
do will be eaten up,

918
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,000
and let me just
remind all of you.

919
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,875
That's a lot.

920
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,959
Driving cars and
all sorts of shit

921
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,542
that we didn't
think about 10 years ago,

922
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,125
so I'm a big fan.

923
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,041
Every single
customer service job

924
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,583
that is in the
business of emailing back

925
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,375
customer service
answers is out of business.

926
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,458
Over the next
three, seven, nine,

927
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,583
12 years, I'm a huge fan.

928
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:28,083
I'm also very
fascinated by voice.

929
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,917
I'm obsessed with
Alexa and Google Home.

930
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:35,083
Listen, we care
about time and convenience

931
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,708
and that's it.

932
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:39,250
That's it.

933
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,000
If I can just be
brushing my teeth,

934
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,208
remember something,

935
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,750
it's quicker for me to say,

936
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,625
"Hey Google
Home," or "Hey Alexa,

937
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:46,792
"Remind me to buy tomatoes,"

938
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,750
than to grab my
phone and type it.

939
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,291
Just faster. Speed.

940
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,000
Speed wins everything.

941
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,250
Speed wins everything,

942
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,625
speed is absolutely

943
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,166
one of my two or
three religions in business.

944
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,333
Speed. Fast.

945
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,500
Everybody's too precious,

946
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,041
you're overthinking
your content.

947
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,667
You're overthinking
your decisions.

948
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,375
You're better off doing 16
times of being right three times

949
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,375
than not doing anything at all.

950
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,542
You're pondering.

951
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,917
You lack the confidence

952
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:13,458
because you're
worried about what people say.

953
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,750
I like losing.

954
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,708
That's why this is all so easy.

955
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,208
I don't give a
fuck if you said I lost.

956
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:21,458
- [Man] Woo!
- It's true.

957
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:22,959
It's an important thing, bro.

958
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:23,708
- [Man] Fuck yeah!

959
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:26,375
- I love your beard.
- [Man] Thanks.

960
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,959
- Beard dude there is
reacting to the right thing,

961
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:33,333
and I'll tell you why.

962
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,375
By not worrying about
what other people think,

963
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,834
it allows you to do things.

964
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:38,583
By doing things, you either win

965
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,917
or you learn from your loss,

966
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,875
and it creates speed.

967
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,417
It's the absolute
mental difference

968
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:46,375
between the people
that are executing winning

969
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:47,542
versus the people that aren't.

970
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:49,000
It's the fear of others.

971
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,542
I don't want to lose,

972
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,041
but I'm definitely
more disappointed

973
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:56,500
than your opinion in
your blog post about my loss.

974
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,583
- I got one last
question for you.

975
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,417
- Cool.

976
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:04,500
- When we chatted last,

977
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,834
you said that your daughter

978
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:07,834
has the edge.

979
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:09,250
She's got the
entrepreneurial spark.

980
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,458
- No, she has
charisma and storytelling.

981
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,917
I don't know if she has
the entrepreneurial spark.

982
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:17,917
Maybe her environment
of being rich as fuck

983
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:20,333
is not gonna let her be that.
(audience laughter)

984
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,750
I'm serious.

985
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,041
By the way,

986
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,291
look, she may
look at what Daddy did

987
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,792
and she's gonna look at that
mountain and say, "Fuck that,

988
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:33,417
"I'm gonna give
all his money away

989
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,625
"to people less privileged,"

990
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,458
and I will support
the shit out of that.

991
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,959
I don't want her to be me,

992
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,125
I want her to be her

993
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,208
and whatever she does,

994
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,667
I'm behind her
one billion percent.

995
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,792
(audience applause)

996
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,667
And I can tell you,

997
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,458
and I'm happy 'cause
she's gonna watch this

998
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,542
one day when she's doing it.

999
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:52,000
She will win because she's got

1000
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,250
the empathy and the charisma,

1001
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,208
so whether she's
raising funds for the needy

1002
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,458
or she's trying to
climb Daddy's mountain

1003
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,542
and say, "Fuck you, Daddy,
I'm doing it bigger."

1004
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:03,917
She will win 'cause she's got it

1005
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,208
and it's gonna be cool to see.

1006
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,583
It'll be a fun experiment.

1007
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,875
Maybe I was me
because I had nothing

1008
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,041
and when I wanted toys,

1009
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,458
we didn't have
the money for that,

1010
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,166
so I had to go sell,

1011
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:16,000
shoveling people's
snow and lemonade,

1012
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
and that's what did it.

1013
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,458
Maybe 'cause she has everything

1014
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,125
and has already
done things in her life

1015
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,125
that I didn't do
until three years ago

1016
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,708
and she had to be on
that private plane with me

1017
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,667
'cause we had to go
and things like that.

1018
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,083
Maybe she won't
have that hunger.

1019
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,125
What she'll have,

1020
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,625
I have gratitude and empathy.

1021
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,000
Maybe she's gonna have guilt

1022
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,917
that she had it so crazy good,

1023
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:36,792
and that
manifests in giving back.

1024
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:37,959
I don't mind.

1025
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:42,208
If she wants to
paint with tomatoes, great.

1026
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:45,208
I just want her to be
fully pure in what loves,

1027
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,208
the way I am.

1028
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,750
Then, it has a
funny way working out

1029
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,667
'cause I'm gonna remind
everybody one more time.

1030
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:52,708
Being an entrepreneur
was not cool

1031
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,917
when I was growing up.

1032
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:58,500
It was just the
only thing I knew.

1033
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,333
- Amazing.

1034
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,542
Well, we're gonna open it up

1035
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:01,667
to Q&amp;A.
- Let's do it.

1036
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:02,542
- I'm gonna jet out the stage.

1037
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:03,500
I'm gonna leave them for you.

1038
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,708
I'm just gonna remind everybody

1039
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,959
that there are
1,350 people in here

1040
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,458
that wanna ask questions,

1041
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:10,041
so try and keep
your questions brief

1042
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,291
because there's a
shit ton of people

1043
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:12,250
that wanna ask questions.

1044
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,125
We're gonna have mic runners.

1045
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,291
I'm gonna leave
the stage with you,

1046
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,125
with these monsters,

1047
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,500
so good luck.
- Let's clap it up.

1048
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,667
- Thank you.
(audience applause)

1049
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,041
- [Gary] I'm not in
control of the questions,

1050
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:28,875
people with the mics are.

1051
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,333
Let's do it, who's got it?

1052
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,834
Go ahead, grab
someone. You're in.

1053
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:35,166
I'm not picking.

1054
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:38,708
- [Man 2] I got a question,

1055
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:39,750
but before I go into it,

1056
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,708
I just wanna take a minute
and pay tribute to you, Gary,

1057
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:44,708
because I think that
10 to 50 years from now,

1058
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:45,959
you're gonna go down in history

1059
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,625
as one of the greatest
entrepreneurs in the world

1060
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,875
like Walt Disney, Thomas Edison.

1061
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,542
Give it up for Gary.

1062
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,417
- I really think you're right.

1063
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:57,667
(audience laughter)

1064
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:00,041
No ego.

1065
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,291
- [Man 2] My question is,

1066
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:04,333
I run a video marketing company,

1067
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,750
and in a lot of your keynotes,

1068
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,125
I watch all
your keynotes online,

1069
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:11,291
you talk about the importance
of redefining an industry.

1070
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,333
What would you recommend

1071
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,083
for someone like
me in that industry

1072
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,834
as a way that
we can redefine it?

1073
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:20,458
- Do you wanna redefine it?

1074
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:22,959
- [Man 2] Yes.
- Why?

1075
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:26,166
- [Man 2] Because it's boring.

1076
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,500
- I think that there's
a couple things here.

1077
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,750
Redefining it is fun
for a lot of reasons,

1078
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,166
mainly because you have the
audacity to have legacy, right?

1079
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,125
That's fun.

1080
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:41,333
It tends to make long-term
money versus short-term money

1081
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,375
'cause if you're right,

1082
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,875
the video trends
are obvious, right?

1083
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,417
There's 360, it's out there.

1084
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,375
It hasn't clicked the
way people thought it would,

1085
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,625
but it's still
got a long way to go.

1086
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,959
All the action is
gonna be in VR in 20 years.

1087
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,041
You're young.

1088
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:57,166
I would commit my
whole world to VR video,

1089
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,708
wait 'til it becomes a reality,

1090
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:02,250
eat the shit over the
next seven to 12 years

1091
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,291
because it's not gonna be there

1092
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,500
and you're gonna be selling it,

1093
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,708
but nobody's gonna want it.

1094
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:06,792
Do whatever you have to do,

1095
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:09,708
sell hotdogs and
cupcakes to get there.

1096
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,125
Then when the market's there,

1097
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,708
you were a pioneer.

1098
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:16,250
Guys, nobody wanted social media

1099
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,583
when I was talking about it.

1100
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:22,500
I just knew it was gonna happen

1101
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,750
and I was willing to eat shit
for a decade to get there,

1102
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,041
so that's what I would do.

1103
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,500
Cool.

1104
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,417
Who's next? How
many mics are there?

1105
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:31,542
Go ahead.

1106
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,834
Is there one in the middle?

1107
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,834
Why don't you go to the middle?

1108
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:38,375
Two? Got it, okay.

1109
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,208
Hey.

1110
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:40,542
- [Man 3] Hi, how are you?
- Super.

1111
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:42,125
- [Man 3] Hi,
how's it going, Gary?

1112
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,834
Thanks for the keynote,
great information as always.

1113
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:45,834
- Thank you.

1114
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:47,333
- [Man 3] I watched
your Hamburg keynote,

1115
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,458
which was just about a week ago,

1116
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:50,708
and you talked about,

1117
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,083
much like what
you're saying today,

1118
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:54,208
how we've been
through a cruel period

1119
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,417
for the past
seven or eight years,

1120
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:57,208
and it's gonna come,
the time's gonna come.

1121
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:59,291
- I've been talking
about this for six months now

1122
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,041
because I feel it.

1123
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:03,041
By the way, it still
could be two years away.

1124
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,417
It just doesn't feel
like it's gonna 10 years away.

1125
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,667
- [Man 3] Exactly, and
I'm totally on board with that.

1126
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:09,250
My question is,

1127
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,000
for a motivational,
inspiration blog

1128
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,166
which is what I have right now,

1129
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,834
which is my startup,

1130
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,125
we have an ever-growing
social media presence.

1131
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,291
We're past that infancy stage

1132
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,917
and we're
starting to really grow,

1133
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:24,458
and we doubled down on
social media marketing.

1134
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,667
We're putting out
Facebook ads at scale,

1135
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:27,834
Instagram, same thing.

1136
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:28,917
We're putting
out stories, content

1137
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:30,917
and I've been doing it all day.

1138
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:33,166
My question is, for
someone that has doubled down

1139
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,625
on social media marketing,

1140
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,083
when that time comes,

1141
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:39,875
whether it's today,
tomorrow, two years,

1142
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:42,625
given the landscape
of the market right now,

1143
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:46,083
how would you prepare in
terms of a contingency plan?

1144
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,708
- I would do more
social media marketing

1145
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,250
when shit hits the fan.

1146
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,000
- [Man 3] Awesome.
- Because that's what

1147
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,291
you learned from the
first internet bubble.

1148
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,291
Everybody saw
the internet bubble,

1149
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:56,458
but it crashed

1150
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,417
and then people walked
away from the internet,

1151
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,750
but consumers
still were using it.

1152
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,792
Just 'cause the stock
market's gonna collapse

1153
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:04,542
and then everybody's
gonna react to that

1154
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:06,458
and the economic
meltdown will happen,

1155
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:09,333
doesn't mean people stop
using Instagram and Facebook.

1156
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,375
The real question is,
are you making money

1157
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,917
and can you afford to
operate during a shit time?

1158
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:17,291
Because let me
promise you what goes away

1159
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:18,625
when shit time comes.

1160
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:19,583
Shout-outs.

1161
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:23,708
Coconut companies disappear,

1162
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:24,875
so they don't
have money to give you

1163
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:28,583
the fit person $1,000
to post on your Instagram,

1164
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,500
so the money goes away.

1165
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,166
Can you make money
when the money goes away?

1166
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,417
'Cause there's still money,

1167
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:39,458
it's just left
for the A-players.

1168
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,750
- [Man 3] Cool, awesome.

1169
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,875
Thanks, I agree
with that so much

1170
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,125
and you just totally reaffirmed

1171
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:44,458
social media marketing for me,

1172
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,917
so thank you.
- You got it, bro.

1173
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:48,792
Yo.
- [Man 4] Yo, hey, hey.

1174
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,875
So you've alluded
to a healthy body and

1175
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,625
a healthy mind, but
you've also said that

1176
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:55,125
you were open to
PED use, for, you know,

1177
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,041
performance enhancing.

1178
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,834
Have you ever used nootropics?
I wonder if you are

1179
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:01,000
on any of that kind of stuff
to get through those long

1180
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,083
18 hour days?

1181
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,625
- Right, I have no
idea what you just said.

1182
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:04,792
(audience laughter)

1183
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:05,875
- [Man 4] Well, you were
on Joe Rogan

1184
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:06,500
and you mentioned--

1185
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,625
- Oh, so that I know,
and Joe Rogan,

1186
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:10,291
I don't know what
nootronics is, so I've never
used.

1187
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:12,542
- [Man 4]
Nootropics, modafinil,
perazitam,

1188
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:15,250
any of the things the bullet
proof guy talks about taking,

1189
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,917
to get through those long days.

1190
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:18,500
- No, so, real
quick just hold the mic,

1191
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,875
because I want to jam on this.

1192
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,875
So, it's really funny,
how many people here are first

1193
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,291
generation immigrants? 
Raise your hands.

1194
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:26,625
So, I don't know if you
guys have these same things,

1195
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:29,875
I grew up in a Russian
family where, if you had

1196
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:32,917
a fever, you had to go to sleep.

1197
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:35,333
Like, that was
the answer to fix it.

1198
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:37,667
So, it's really funny.

1199
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:39,708
My parents, or wife, or
sister, if they were here

1200
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,959
right now, they'd be laughing.

1201
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:43,834
I actually get knocked
out if I take a single

1202
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:45,792
Tylenol. 
- [Man 4] Okay.

1203
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:48,000
- So, what I was saying
to Rogan is I'm fascinated

1204
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,917
in that all, as I've gotten,
now that I'm in the gym

1205
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:55,208
all the time, I'm fascinated
that in 50 year,

1206
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,667
or 20 years, people will say
that steroids wasn't as bad as

1207
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,333
it was positioned, right?

1208
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:03,000
The way marijuana or
alcohol, but I'm undereducated.

1209
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,250
I've never, I don't
even take supplements.

1210
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,834
Because, I always
think the people selling it

1211
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,834
don't fully know.
And I'm like, fuck it,

1212
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:13,333
like I'm not taking it.
So, I haven't.

1213
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:17,583
I don't know if
that's right or wrong.

1214
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:20,583
- [Man 4] It's a dirty secret of

1215
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:23,583
Silicon Valley that
they all use Piracetam.

1216
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:26,375
- Well, you know what's
really interesting about that?

1217
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:28,834
In these comments on
all these videos I put up,

1218
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:31,667
everyone's like,
this guy's on coke, right?

1219
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:32,583
(audience laughter)

1220
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:33,792
- [Man 4] No,
I'm not saying you are,

1221
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:35,083
I just wanted to know
what your thoughts are.

1222
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,583
- No, my thoughts are,
I don't really judge people

1223
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,166
for doing shit, right?

1224
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,917
I don't think that's my place.

1225
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,375
I don't do anything,

1226
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,959
but I don't know
if that's right or wrong.

1227
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,792
- [Man 4] Do you know
anyone who does it?

1228
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:49,125
Have you been
around it in that world?

1229
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,083
(audience laughter)
Not coke.

1230
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:53,166
- Oh, I know a lot
of people that do coke.

1231
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,041
(audience laughter)

1232
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,458
I know way more people that
do coke than do steroids, bro.

1233
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:03,417
I don't,
listen I think, listen.

1234
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:06,041
Bro, we're living in
a school system that is

1235
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,625
pushing medicine
down kids throats.

1236
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,750
Of course they're
gonna be 23 and do shit.

1237
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,041
They were taught
that they were too "ADD"

1238
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:15,000
and had to go on
fucking medicine, because big

1239
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,750
pharma figured out their way in.

1240
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,375
Fuck that.

1241
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,458
I aint taking
shit ever mother fucker.

1242
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,500
(audience laughter and applause)

1243
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,667
And so, you have
parents that lack self esteem

1244
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,333
'cause they worry
about what the other parents

1245
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,708
say about their kids
that get D's and F's,

1246
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,708
and they put their
fucking kids on medicine,

1247
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,458
you fucking loser parents.

1248
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,834
(audience applause)

1249
00:51:37,834 --> 00:51:39,834
One man's point of view.

1250
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:44,208
I gotta go with the
mic, where's the mics?

1251
00:51:45,834 --> 00:51:47,500
Somebody talk with a mic.

1252
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,208
Mics, you gotta make
decisions here, let's go.

1253
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,208
- [Woman] Hi.
- Hi.

1254
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,041
- [Woman] Hi, Gary I love you.
- I love you, too.

1255
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:54,875
- [Woman] What is one
thing that you

1256
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:58,417
believe to be true that
most people think is crazy?

1257
00:51:58,417 --> 00:51:59,917
- Oh, that's a good question.

1258
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,625
What do... One more time?

1259
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:03,041
- [Woman] What's one thing
that you believe to

1260
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:07,250
be true that most
people think is crazy?

1261
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,166
- Most of it.

1262
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,291
That's a really good question.

1263
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:13,250
You know, usually can
answer these pretty quickly,

1264
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,542
I don't know, I think that,

1265
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:19,041
so I think the
truth is undefeated.

1266
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:22,000
Like, I actually believe that
it all works out in the end.

1267
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,917
I think people are
very cynical

1268
00:52:23,917 --> 00:52:26,417
and think that a lot of people
get away with things.

1269
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:28,375
But, I think that
people don't understand, like,

1270
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,458
the macro of things.

1271
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,291
They might've gotten
away with the way you judge,

1272
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:33,917
which is they
made a million bucks.

1273
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,458
But, I know they
don't sleep at night,

1274
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,291
and their lives suck.

1275
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:41,250
So, I would say that
I blindly am optimistic,

1276
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,083
and I believe that
the market is the market,

1277
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,792
and the truth is the
truth, and so I believe

1278
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:47,583
in that and
I think most people don't.

1279
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:50,208
(audience applause)

1280
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:55,792
Questions?

1281
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,291
Mics, only, where are the mics?

1282
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:02,542
- [Allie] Hi Gary. 
- Hi,

1283
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:04,208
- [Allie] Down here,
straight ahead.

1284
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:04,917
Straight ahead.

1285
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:05,750
- I see you now.

1286
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,125
- [Allie] Okay, 
hi Gary I Allie Davis,

1287
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,500
lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1288
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,708
- [Allie] I wanted
to speak to you

1289
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:10,792
particularly
about family business.

1290
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:11,500
- Okay.

1291
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,333
- [Allie] We've got
an interesting

1292
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:15,250
and unconventional
dynamic evolving.

1293
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:15,875
- Okay.

1294
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,041
- [Allie]
I'm the 50-year-old,

1295
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,458
and I've only just
gotten into digital.

1296
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,333
- Yes.

1297
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:21,417
- [Allie] We took our son,
who's 13 out of

1298
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:24,250
school because...
- 1,3? Thirteen?

1299
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,375
- [Allie] 13.
- Keep going.

1300
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,542
- [Allie] We took him
out of school 'cause

1301
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:28,667
we don't believe in the system,
and we're educating in

1302
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:30,000
alternative ways.
- Okay.

1303
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,250
- [Allie] He's starting
to get involved in

1304
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,208
the business doing the
digital stuff, which this

1305
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:35,125
50-year-old struggles with.

1306
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:35,917
- Yes.

1307
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:37,875
- [Allie] Now, so,
he's interested in it,

1308
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,250
he's getting involved,
he's only 13.

1309
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,166
So, we've got this
unconventional family business

1310
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:42,708
thing evolving with
a 13-year-old, and a

1311
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:45,667
50-year-old, and what's
most important to me is

1312
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:47,208
my family.
- Of course.

1313
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:50,291
- [Allie] So for you,
who's been involved

1314
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:52,333
in a family business,
for many years, what's the

1315
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,708
most important thing
for me to know and do,

1316
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:58,625
as a parent of a 13-year-old,
who's already wanted to be

1317
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,125
involved in business?

1318
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,708
- That's a great question,
thank you for asking it.

1319
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:02,625
Hold the mic for a second
'cause there might

1320
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:03,750
be a follow up.

1321
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,667
So, I got involved in
my dad's business in a very

1322
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:08,834
serious way at 14,
probably not as serious as this

1323
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:11,208
sounds, because I only
worked every weekend and

1324
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:13,375
summer vacation,
there's a chance he could be

1325
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,834
involved day-to-day.
- [Allie] He is.

1326
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:19,000
- There's one thing my dad
and I did, that in hindsight

1327
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,333
I can't believe most
family businesses don't,

1328
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:27,250
my dad and I loved each
other more than the business

1329
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,750
by one quarter of a
thousandth of an inch.

1330
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,000
(audience laughter)

1331
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:38,333
So, your answer's very simple,

1332
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:41,542
no matter what, no
matter how big it gets,

1333
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:45,875
you just need to
actually back up your words,

1334
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:49,291
if you actually just
love your family more,

1335
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:51,667
then it should be very easy.

1336
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,667
- [Allie] It will be easy,
because you're right,

1337
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:56,959
I'm dedicated to my business,
but I'm devoted to my family,

1338
00:54:56,959 --> 00:54:58,291
they'll always have the edge.

1339
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:00,792
- Now, I'll say
this and I love this,

1340
00:55:00,792 --> 00:55:03,458
it gets hard,
because what happens is

1341
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,166
people don't realize,
it's not about the money

1342
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,375
after a while.

1343
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:08,500
It's about respect.

1344
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,458
And that gets blurred.

1345
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:13,041
Like, me and my dad,
both sort of stunningly

1346
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:15,041
don't give a shit about money.

1347
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:19,375
But, respect, and
honor, and who did it,

1348
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:22,208
those things can get blended
and that's where it gets hard.

1349
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:24,125
So, keep an eye out for
that, because that bleeds

1350
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:27,667
more into family,
'cause people think it's a

1351
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,000
money thing/family thing,
it's not,

1352
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,083
the money's completely
not the factor.

1353
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:32,417
It's the way you guys interact.

1354
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:34,083
And by the way, your
relationship with your

1355
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:37,291
son, will never be the
same, you know that right?

1356
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:38,000
- [Allie] Yeah.

1357
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,542
- When you go into
business with somebody,

1358
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:40,792
it changes everything forever.

1359
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:42,875
You'll have a
different relationship.

1360
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,542
And by the way,
my dad and my brother,

1361
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,375
both my partners
in my two businesses,

1362
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:48,834
we have
phenomenal relationships,

1363
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:50,750
and I would never
do anything different.

1364
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,166
But, it is different.

1365
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:53,834
And it's gonna change.

1366
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:55,333
And, so you need to
be prepared for that.

1367
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,417
- [Allie] Thank you,
and I see it

1368
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:57,583
changing already,
and him being the leader,

1369
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:59,542
because he looks
over my shoulder when I'm

1370
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:02,000
watching some of your
videos, and this whole

1371
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,166
digital thing, 'cause
I'm from a conventional

1372
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,792
business background,
has been quite scary for me.

1373
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:09,041
And, one day he looked
over my shoulder while I was

1374
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:11,083
diddling about, oh
god, (mic cuts out)

1375
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,708
and he says,
Gary Vaynerchuk would say,

1376
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:14,834
just fucking do it.

1377
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:17,083
(audience laughter)

1378
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:21,834
- I love it.

1379
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:22,708
Amazing.

1380
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:24,834
Next question, yep.

1381
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:25,834
- [Elijah] Hey Gary.
- Hey.

1382
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,917
- [Elijah] My name
is Elijah, I too, ate shit.

1383
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,000
So, we've got that in common.
- I love it.

1384
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,834
- I read a story about you
when you were young.

1385
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:37,750
One of the first, kind of,
engagements you had

1386
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,583
with Ricky Henderson.
(Gary laughs)

1387
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,500
And, how you kind of
described it as you changed from

1388
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,333
being a fan to being a fanatic.

1389
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:46,291
- Yes.

1390
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:47,583
- [Elijah] I wondered
if you could

1391
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:49,083
kind of describe that,
as well as like,

1392
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,917
what does it translate
on a day-to-day basis,

1393
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:53,834
with what you're doing today?
- Got it.

1394
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:55,291
So, you've got me
completely pegged.

1395
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,166
It's one of the signature
moments of my career.

1396
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:59,583
I went to my first
baseball game in 1985,

1397
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,583
Ricky Henderson was an
outfielder for the Yankees,

1398
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:03,625
he was coming off the
field and he winks at me.

1399
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:07,375
Now, important part,
the crowd's big,

1400
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:10,375
like watch this, 40 people
think I just winked at them.

1401
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:11,542
(audience laughter)

1402
00:57:11,542 --> 00:57:13,625
So, I'm hoping he winked at me,

1403
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:14,917
but, I'm not completely sure.

1404
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:19,000
Here's what happened, basically,
for the next seven years,

1405
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,583
I bought all his baseball
cards, it was the t-shirt that

1406
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:26,208
I bought. I talked about him,
I became his biggest advocate.

1407
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:28,792
In the same way as me
growing up listening to

1408
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:31,333
Richard Pryor, and
Chris Rock, and Eddy Murphy,

1409
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:34,750
has clearly affected the
way I communicate on stage,

1410
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,667
(audience laughter)

1411
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:39,542
I do believe that somewhere,
and when I wrote that article,

1412
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,083
that you're referring to,
it was when I realized,

1413
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,542
holy shit, the way
I'm treating social media,

1414
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:46,250
is probably because ...

1415
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,959
All I'm trying to do at
this point, besides operate,

1416
00:57:48,959 --> 00:57:51,375
when I do the GaryVee thing,
I'm trying to figure out

1417
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,917
why I did it, how I got there,
and then I'm trying

1418
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:56,166
to tell you, so you
can do it too, right?

1419
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,000
So, I'm really
getting in myself, really.

1420
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,708
Like, I'm starting to
hit up high school friends,

1421
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:02,917
junior high friends,
grammar school friends, lately,

1422
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,208
on social and try to ask them
if they remember anything.

1423
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:07,208
Like, I'm really trying
to bring out more stuff.

1424
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:08,667
You don't need to hear
the same shit over and over.

1425
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:09,959
I'm trying to bring value.

1426
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:13,417
Yeah, there's a big reason
I'm liking everybody's comments,

1427
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:15,542
and replying and
DM'ing you randomly.

1428
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:17,750
I think it's impactful.
I think it feels nice,

1429
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:20,500
if Randy "The Macho
Man" Savage in 1992,

1430
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,083
liked one of my tweets I would
have lost my fucking mind.

1431
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,041
- [Elijah] Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1432
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:26,875
- [Elijah] A follow up to that,

1433
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,667
or just expanding on that,

1434
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,375
what did, I know you
described it, I don't know if

1435
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:33,125
there's a difference in Canada,
what's the greatest

1436
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,708
arbitrage in social media
today, and I'll let you go.

1437
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:36,625
- Oh, it's the same in Canada.

1438
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,166
Facebook ads,
Instagram influencers,

1439
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,792
there's nothing close.

1440
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:41,041
You should spend
all your money on it,

1441
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:45,917
if you're marketing, to
anybody under the age of 65.

1442
00:58:45,917 --> 00:58:50,959
Like 50 to 80-year-old Canada
data on Facebook is crushing.

1443
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:53,250
Like, you can reach
most 72-year-old Canadians,

1444
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,458
on Facebook.

1445
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:55,917
At the cheapest price.

1446
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:56,959
It's not that you're
going to reach all of them.

1447
00:58:56,959 --> 00:58:58,750
Not all of them
are on there, but if you

1448
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,041
actually want to get to
the most, at the best price,

1449
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,959
it's called Facebook.

1450
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,291
- Cool, who do we have?

1451
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:09,291
Awesome, let's do it.

1452
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:10,583
- [Man 5] Yo, what's good homie?

1453
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,500
So my question is,
how do you know when

1454
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,834
your ego's in the
way of things your doing?

1455
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:19,917
- I'm not sure, like
for every individual person.

1456
00:59:19,917 --> 00:59:22,208
I would say that,

1457
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:25,875
I would say that if
you're allowing your ego

1458
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:27,125
to get ahead of
your humility and

1459
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:29,875
self-awareness it's
clearly going to be in the way.

1460
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,792
I think you need to pull
very hard from both sides.

1461
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:34,708
They both matter tremendously.

1462
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,708
And it's just, you
can't believe how truthful

1463
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,583
it feels in my heart and stomach

1464
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:41,667
when I say, I aint shit.

1465
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:43,166
And I agree with
the kid that says

1466
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,083
I'm gonna be one of the greats.

1467
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:46,667
I just believe in
both of them, I just do.

1468
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:47,708
I just do.

1469
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,417
I also think that if
you're one of the great

1470
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:51,041
entrepreneurs of
a generation doesn't

1471
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:52,417
necessarily mean
you're so special.

1472
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:54,792
It means you were
good at that craft.

1473
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:57,792
What I'm trying to do
is be a little bit special.

1474
00:59:57,792 --> 01:00:00,125
Nobody goes to
somebody's funeral 'cause

1475
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:02,542
they made $40 billion.

1476
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:03,500
They go to the funeral because

1477
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,959
that person did
something that made them

1478
01:00:04,959 --> 01:00:07,291
feel like they should
have went to the funeral.

1479
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:09,041
So I'm trying to do both.

1480
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:12,083
And so I would say,

1481
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:15,208
that ego gets
ahead of a lot of people.

1482
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:19,708
But I think it's really hard
to analyze that from afar.

1483
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:21,333
Here's what I would say,

1484
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:23,375
if you aren't 100% happy,

1485
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:27,583
something's wrong so
start auditing everything.

1486
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,583
Cool.

1487
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:33,875
Yo.

1488
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:36,375
- [Man 6] Hey Gary, first of all

1489
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,375
I just wanted to say,
when I first heard you,

1490
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,291
man, I thought you
were a snake oil salesman.

1491
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,125
- I get it.

1492
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,417
- [Man 6] And I'm so glad

1493
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:44,166
I didn't give up on listening
to you because you're...

1494
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:45,500
- Why didn't you?

1495
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,417
- [Man 6] You know it
was when you

1496
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:49,500
started talking from
the heart that really it,

1497
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,000
something about
it touched me and

1498
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,333
I just really appreciated
what you were saying.

1499
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:54,834
- So wait in the
same video, you're like

1500
01:00:54,834 --> 01:00:57,875
fuck this guy he's a snake oil
salesman and wait a minute.

1501
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:58,792
- [Man 6] You know what?

1502
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:00,542
The first video
I stopped watching and

1503
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:02,875
then somebody
I know posted a link and

1504
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,166
I followed that one through and

1505
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,667
loved what you
said on that one and

1506
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,458
since then I've just
gone down the rabbit hole.

1507
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,000
- Let me talk
about that for a second.

1508
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,708
- [Man 6] Yeah.

1509
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,125
- That's what
I mean by the truth.

1510
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,458
It doesn't hurt me
if people think that

1511
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:14,000
because I know
my personality and

1512
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,834
it makes sense to me why
somebody would think that.

1513
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:19,291
It also doesn't
bother me because

1514
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:21,708
I know how it's gonna end up.

1515
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,333
Go ahead.
- [Man 6] I'm not even sure

1516
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,542
why I started
that way other than

1517
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:28,375
just to tell you how much
I appreciate what you're doing.

1518
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,708
- I appreciate it man.

1519
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:32,250
- [Man 6] I'm working on
an idea right now.

1520
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,667
- Actually watch this,
how many people

1521
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:37,291
in this audience
started off not liking me?

1522
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:39,041
(cheering)

1523
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:42,125
Stand up, I want
everybody to see it.

1524
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:44,375
(audience laughter)

1525
01:01:46,792 --> 01:01:48,959
Let me tell you what that is.

1526
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:52,333
That is either very quick
consumption where they just

1527
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,333
caught one sound
bite where I was being

1528
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:57,542
my ego self, and/or,
they didn't want

1529
01:01:57,542 --> 01:02:01,375
to face their truth
and I was suffocating them.

1530
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:02,959
Go ahead.

1531
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:04,500
- [Man 6] So I guess I'm asking

1532
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,542
you this question cause I know

1533
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,125
you get a lot of
ideas come your way.

1534
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:09,417
- By the way I'm never doing
that again, that fucking hurt.

1535
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:10,250
- [Man 6] Yeah sorry, buddy.

1536
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,917
(audience laughter)
- It still hurts.

1537
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:12,959
- [Man 6] I didn't mean
to hurt you.

1538
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:15,041
- Still hurts, Jesus.

1539
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,708
- [Man 6] Everybody in here
loves you now though.

1540
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,417
- I get it.
Go ahead.

1541
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:19,750
- [Man 6] All right so,
I'm looking

1542
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,375
for a way to
use fitness tracking

1543
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:24,000
to create monetary
opportunities for people.

1544
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,834
- Okay.

1545
01:02:24,834 --> 01:02:25,875
- [Man 6] Like to raise money

1546
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,166
with your running, your walking,

1547
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,458
your cycling though pledging.

1548
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:30,250
- Interesting.
- [Man 6] I'm just curious if

1549
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,500
you've seen anything
come across your desk

1550
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,542
like that or if you've?

1551
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:33,458
- Sure.

1552
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,333
I've seen a ton of
things that are, do this action

1553
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,708
and that action
will create the funding.

1554
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:40,917
- [Man 6] Right, I'm looking for
the unknown unknown.

1555
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:43,500
Like what should I be
looking at to figure out

1556
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,834
where I need to
go with this thing?

1557
01:02:44,834 --> 01:02:47,542
Like I'm pretty
early in my hustle on this.

1558
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:49,834
- First and foremost
you should get very serious

1559
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:51,959
about B-to-B not B-to-C.
- [Man 6] All right.

1560
01:02:51,959 --> 01:02:54,500
- So big companies like
to support shit like that

1561
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,208
'cause it makes them look good.

1562
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:57,083
- [Man 6] Yeah.
- Right?

1563
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:59,041
Most people don't give a fuck.

1564
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,125
Right?
- [Man 6] Yeah.

1565
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:03,333
- Like I mean, but
there's one place I would look.

1566
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:05,250
Go reverse engineer
and study everything

1567
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,959
about what Charity: Water did

1568
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:10,166
when they did donate
your birthday, right?

1569
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,291
They found something
there technology-wise

1570
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:14,333
and theme-wise, right?

1571
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,542
So I would say two things,
case study on

1572
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,667
Charity: Water
donating your birthday.

1573
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,500
Know everything about the
psychology of why that worked.

1574
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,667
And number two
realize that the only way

1575
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,542
you're gonna get
past the first inning

1576
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:28,291
is get corporations to
subsidize the donations,

1577
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,917
'cause most people won't do it.

1578
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:30,875
- [Man 6] Right on,
thanks a lot Gary.

1579
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:32,208
- Cool, you got it.

1580
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,667
Hey.

1581
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:35,792
(audience applause)
Can I go late?

1582
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:37,333
Can I go late?

1583
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:39,041
(audience cheering)

1584
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:40,208
I can go late a little bit.

1585
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:41,542
Yeah? Yeah, cool.

1586
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,542
Hey.
- [Laura] Hello.

1587
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:46,458
- Hello, hey.

1588
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,959
- [Laura] What's up?
- All good.

1589
01:03:47,959 --> 01:03:49,125
- [Laura] Okay,
I'm gonna come up closer

1590
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,166
just cause I want to
speak to you face-to-face.

1591
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:52,792
- Okay.

1592
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:54,166
- [Laura] First of all
I gotta say

1593
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,166
this feels like
being at a wax museum

1594
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,250
when you see those
famous people in person.

1595
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,708
Yeah, except you're much
better looking in person.

1596
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:01,875
- Thank you.

1597
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:04,333
I thought you
were calling me waxy.

1598
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,750
(audience laughter)

1599
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,708
Okay.
- [Laura] My name is Laura.

1600
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:09,208
Just to give you a
little bit of context

1601
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:13,041
before I ask my
question, what really resonated

1602
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:14,875
with me a lot about your life

1603
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:16,708
is that I'm a first
generation immigrant.

1604
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:18,125
And when you said
that you couldn't afford

1605
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:21,083
a Jets jersey
and that's your dream

1606
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,583
to own New York Jets.

1607
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,417
For example,
myself, I never owned

1608
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:28,125
a single brand name
handbag in my life.

1609
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,792
- Right.
- [Laura] Up until last year

1610
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:31,333
when I got to manage

1611
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:33,959
the number one top
volume handbags floor

1612
01:04:33,959 --> 01:04:36,458
in one of the top department
stores in North America.

1613
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:37,625
- That's awesome.

1614
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:40,000
- [Laura] So from there,
currently aside

1615
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,375
from managing the handbags
floor at a department store,

1616
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:44,375
because we are a public
company I can't share that.

1617
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:50,208
When I get off my work I
work for the VR Association

1618
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:53,000
'cause you touch a
lot on virtual reality.

1619
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,875
So I spend about
15 to 20 hours a week

1620
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:58,792
unpaid marketing work,
doing marketing work

1621
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:01,542
for VR Association and
I just recently got a job,

1622
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:03,959
another job, my third job,
at a VR company.

1623
01:05:03,959 --> 01:05:07,250
And I kind of 
want to see, my job,

1624
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,834
my goal is

1625
01:05:09,834 --> 01:05:14,375
to connect retail
experiences with virtual reality

1626
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:18,333
and for you before,
within your lifetime

1627
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,625
for myself to
come up with a solution

1628
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,458
that you don't
have to go into a store--

1629
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:25,208
- Okay.
- [Laura] To shop for clothing,

1630
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:28,458
and my question for you is,

1631
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:31,208
so I come from a family
background, as an immigrant,

1632
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:35,583
where it's been
tough financially.

1633
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,834
And I'm at a place
where I'm making my own money

1634
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,875
but my parents
have a lot of debt.

1635
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:43,125
So for me to start my
own business my family

1636
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:44,542
thinks that it's very selfish.

1637
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,834
- Okay
- [Laura] I get it.

1638
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:48,625
I went through the
traditional route where

1639
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:51,542
I went to a credible
post secondary school.

1640
01:05:51,542 --> 01:05:55,041
I paid, well my
parents paid $25,000 a year

1641
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:57,041
on top of my
brothers tuition, which was

1642
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,959
another $30,000 a year.

1643
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,834
That's reality.

1644
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,041
- So what's the punchline?

1645
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:04,208
- [Laura] I'm just saying,

1646
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:07,375
is it selfish for me,
for example...

1647
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:10,041
- Do your parents want you to
get a job and pay them back?

1648
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,750
Let me understand
what you're saying.

1649
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,708
- [Laura] I'm just thinking,

1650
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,083
I take that as my
own burden as well and

1651
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:17,667
do you think that
that's something that

1652
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:20,250
my parents should deal with?

1653
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,875
- [Gary] Well did you guys
discuss it before it happened?

1654
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:25,542
- No, but it's just.

1655
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:27,834
- Are you asking me if you
should pay your parents back?

1656
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:28,917
- [Laura] Yeah.
- Yes.

1657
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:30,417
- [Laura] Well in the
long run yes,

1658
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:33,125
but it's just.
- Yes.

1659
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:36,083
But if you decide to take,
do I think you should

1660
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,917
get a job and
pay them off slowly

1661
01:06:37,917 --> 01:06:39,834
while the
interest compounds versus

1662
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:41,875
taking the risk to
build something big?

1663
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:43,125
- Well in terms of short run,

1664
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,083
for example my
mom works right now.

1665
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,792
She's like 55 years old,
57 years old.

1666
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:49,708
She makes $10 an
hour and every now and

1667
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:51,542
then I'm trying to
make my own money and

1668
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:53,792
trying to build money
to start my own business.

1669
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:56,083
Where every now
and then she'll ask me,

1670
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:57,750
hey can you
pitch in for my rent?

1671
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,667
And I've been paying
for her rent and it's hard.

1672
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:01,750
- Look, I'm not here to
give people family advice

1673
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,125
'cause it's hard.
- [Laura] Right.

1674
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:06,500
- I think you need to,
so we can move on here,

1675
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,708
I think you need to
answer one question.

1676
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,667
What's gonna make you
feel good about yourself?

1677
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:11,875
That's what you should do.

1678
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:15,583
If it feels better, to me this
should not be very difficult.

1679
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,667
You should pick and
choose different moments

1680
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:20,041
when you feel like you
want to pitch in on rent,

1681
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:21,083
pitch in on rent.

1682
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:22,375
When you feel
like, fuck that I want

1683
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,250
to save so I can
do my thing, do that.

1684
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,041
- [Laura] Okay.
- Awesome.

1685
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,291
- [Laura] I just have
one more question.

1686
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:29,917
- No way, not with
that fucking long question.

1687
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:32,583
(audience laughter)

1688
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:33,583
Hey.

1689
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,291
- [Simsai] Hey Gary,
Simsai here.

1690
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:37,208
I just want to say that
unlike half the room here

1691
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:38,917
I fell in love
with you when I read

1692
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:40,000
Crush It! many years ago.

1693
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,250
- Thank you.
- [Simsai] Totally connected.

1694
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,500
Before I ask my
question I want to thank you

1695
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,917
for liking my Bret Hart
comment on YouTube

1696
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:47,083
at 2 A.M. yesterday. 
(Gary laughs)

1697
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,708
My question is, you always
talk about the long game.

1698
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:51,834
- Yes.

1699
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,667
- [Simsai] And it's 
worked for me.

1700
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:54,500
- Go figure.

1701
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,458
- [Simsai] I did 11 years of

1702
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:57,959
paycheck to paycheck
and my 12th year

1703
01:07:57,959 --> 01:07:59,917
I became a great success.

1704
01:07:59,917 --> 01:08:00,750
- Good.

1705
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,959
- [Simsai] Unfortunately, 
a lot of my clients,

1706
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:05,583
family and friends
in the same space

1707
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,208
are struggling and
they have the same hopes

1708
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,792
and dreams that I do.
- Okay

1709
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,208
- [Simsai] And many of us, a lot

1710
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,583
are talking about
depression and suicide earlier.

1711
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:13,500
- Yes.

1712
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,959
- [Simsai] And
I struggled with it.

1713
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:16,000
It almost cost me my marriage.

1714
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,875
- Yes.
- [Simsai] And what can you tell

1715
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:22,917
to others because you are the
influencer of influencers,

1716
01:08:22,917 --> 01:08:24,207
what would you say to this room?

1717
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:25,582
Because I have a
lot of friends here

1718
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:28,457
who struggle with it or
have struggled in the past.

1719
01:08:28,457 --> 01:08:31,917
- Listen man, everybody's
struggling with something.

1720
01:08:31,917 --> 01:08:34,332
My mom loves to tell
the story about her dad,

1721
01:08:34,332 --> 01:08:36,082
who I met but
I don't remember because

1722
01:08:36,082 --> 01:08:38,000
he died when I was
like two and a half.

1723
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,917
That he'd,
basically the Russian term

1724
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:42,667
would say like
everybody's got their problems

1725
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:43,875
in their rooster hen.

1726
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:46,250
Like basically
everybody's got shit.

1727
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,332
What I would say is this,

1728
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:50,625
you know this is
the reason I don't like

1729
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:52,417
fake entrepreneurship.

1730
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:54,417
Because I think it
leads to people feeling down

1731
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:56,834
on themselves in a game
that they were forced into

1732
01:08:56,834 --> 01:09:00,000
by the narrative when
they weren't cut out for it.

1733
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,917
So what I would say
is like, most people

1734
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:04,875
get depressed
because they're worried

1735
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:08,332
about external
factors not internal factors.

1736
01:09:08,332 --> 01:09:10,750
And I don't know a
lot about psychiatry and

1737
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,707
all that stuff but
people need an outlet

1738
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:15,457
to get their poison
out of their stomach.

1739
01:09:15,457 --> 01:09:17,834
So the only tangible thing
I feel comfortable saying is,

1740
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:20,875
if you're struggling,
you need to communicate

1741
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,125
that to somebody
who isn't one of your

1742
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,834
three closest
family members 'cause you're

1743
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:26,625
just putting
your baggage on them.

1744
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:28,125
That I believe in.

1745
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:31,250
And so they need
to find that outlet.

1746
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,792
- [Simsai] All right, thank you.
- You got it.

1747
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:36,332
(audience applause)

1748
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:38,332
- We staying here,
where we going?

1749
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:41,917
Thanks brother,
nice shirt by the way.

1750
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:43,959
Purewow's a
company I invested in.

1751
01:09:43,959 --> 01:09:45,500
I'm giving Ryan a shout-out.

1752
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,667
He's very happy
right now watching this.

1753
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,332
- [Woman 2] Hi Gary.
- Hey.

1754
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:50,875
- [Woman 2] So you
said earlier that the truth

1755
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:52,041
is what sells.

1756
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:52,917
- Yes.

1757
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:55,083
- [Woman 2] My question is,
is there such thing

1758
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:56,667
as being too honest?

1759
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:58,750
- No.
- [Woman 2] Okay well.

1760
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,750
(audience laughter)

1761
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,583
- [Woman 2] I know you
don't like hypotheticals.

1762
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:03,333
- Is it a hypothetical
or are you disguising?

1763
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,708
- [Woman 2] So I'm going to go.

1764
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,917
I have a background and
I've been an entrepreneur

1765
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:07,834
since I was 19.

1766
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:09,333
I've worked for
myself since I was 19.

1767
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:10,083
- Okay.

1768
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:12,834
But my background is in the
adult entertainment industry.

1769
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:13,667
- In the what?

1770
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:14,625
- [Woman 2] Adult entertainment.

1771
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:15,708
- Adult, porn?

1772
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:16,667
- [Woman 2] No.

1773
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:18,875
- I'm sorry,
adult entertainment.

1774
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,166
- [Woman 2] Dancing 
and escorting.

1775
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,000
- Respect.

1776
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,458
- [Woman 2] And then I
now own an online virtual

1777
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:25,083
assistant service
to high-end escorts

1778
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:28,542
where we do, or
basically female CEOs

1779
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:31,250
as I communicate with them.
- Okay.

1780
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,083
- [Woman 2] But my concern
is I'm making the transition

1781
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:36,417
into a more public,
I have an alias there

1782
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:37,834
and my real name,

1783
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:39,542
blah-blah-blah,
everything's legit.

1784
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:41,333
My concern is you know
you say the truth sells.

1785
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,875
I'm concerned about
being really honest.

1786
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,625
But what happens
when I work with clients?

1787
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:46,708
I'm transitioning into coaching.

1788
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:47,417
- Okay.

1789
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:49,000
- [Woman 2] Working
with women and people.

1790
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,750
When I share my story
they have breakthroughs.

1791
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,792
But my question is
more in social media.

1792
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,875
Where is the agreement
reality in the marketplace

1793
01:10:57,875 --> 01:11:00,959
and the trend for
that type of truth?

1794
01:11:00,959 --> 01:11:04,208
Yeah so look,
I think that it's crazy.

1795
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:07,083
There are people that
will judge you and that won't.

1796
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:08,917
I just think you just
got to roll with your truth.

1797
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:10,959
It would be insane,
if you were pitching me

1798
01:11:10,959 --> 01:11:12,917
a business right now,
that wouldn't even run

1799
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:15,458
through my mind as a negative.

1800
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:16,834
And somebody sitting
next to me would think

1801
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:18,333
that's the worse thing
that they've ever heard

1802
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,291
and never want to talk to you.

1803
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,333
You're going to have to
play out and let the chips

1804
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:23,208
fall where they are, right?

1805
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:25,917
Meaning you don't
even need that on your head

1806
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:28,583
and on your chest worrying
about people finding out.

1807
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,458
It's just better for you to own
it than to let somebody else

1808
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,500
own it above you.

1809
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,542
(audience applause)

1810
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:35,291
- [Woman 2] Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1811
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:40,208
Let's do it.

1812
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:41,834
You're about to, I think.

1813
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:44,542
- [Braxton] Okay, Braxton.
- Braxton.

1814
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:47,667
- [Braxton] Yeah, so
I'm starting an energy drink

1815
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:51,291
with a strong
point of differentiation.

1816
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:54,333
I'm just sort of, it's
got a dilemma if I should

1817
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:58,041
develop the brand as
itself or if it should have

1818
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,917
a strong personality
behind it, like with your brand,

1819
01:11:59,917 --> 01:12:00,750
for example.

1820
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,750
You're inextricable
from your brand.

1821
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,417
Not least of which
your name is in it.

1822
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:09,083
But when I think of your brand,
VaynerMedia, I think of you.

1823
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:10,083
Right?
- I'm listening.

1824
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:12,959
- [Braxton] Same with
Steve Jobs with Apple.

1825
01:12:12,959 --> 01:12:15,792
Whereas if you've got
like Google you don't think

1826
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:18,041
of Larry Page or Sergei Brin.

1827
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:19,792
I'm curious if
you have a preference?

1828
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,208
- Notice how both work.

1829
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:22,959
- [Braxton] Yeah, but I'm
wondering if you would think

1830
01:12:22,959 --> 01:12:25,834
that one or the other
would be better if it was

1831
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:28,333
different than how it
is and what your general

1832
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:29,959
explication on that would be.

1833
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:34,083
- Nope, so both work.

1834
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,333
Both have worked forever.

1835
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:37,417
There's plenty
of quadrillionaires

1836
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:39,542
that you've never
heard of and you don't

1837
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:41,000
associate them with.

1838
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,208
I think your bigger
dilemma is you're going

1839
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:44,041
into the beverage industry.

1840
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,708
(audience laughter)

1841
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:50,417
I'm not, meaning you
know how hard that is, right?

1842
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:51,834
- [Braxton] I
will I guess, yeah.

1843
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:54,250
- Well let me
give you a preview.

1844
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,834
You're going up
against the biggest companies

1845
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:58,542
in the world who basically
have the best model down

1846
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:03,166
which is they pressure
any retailer when any drink

1847
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:06,375
gets any leverage
to kick them out

1848
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:09,000
or then they don't
subsidize the trade dollars.

1849
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,625
They've basically, it's really
one of the most gangster

1850
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,250
businesses in the world.

1851
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,291
- [Braxton] I see
with like Richard Branson,

1852
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:16,917
they did that
with his Virgin Cola.

1853
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:19,542
- Yeah, and I feel like he
had a better start than you.

1854
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:22,291
(audience laughter)

1855
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:23,542
- [Braxton] It's possible.

1856
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:26,542
- But you know what's
awesome about the market?

1857
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:28,250
You might be that one,

1858
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,834
but I think before
you worry about

1859
01:13:30,834 --> 01:13:34,000
should I build my personal
brand and coinciding with that,

1860
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,375
you need to realize
you're going into a gunfight

1861
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:38,667
with a pebble.

1862
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,417
- [Braxton] I'll aim well.

1863
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,834
- And that's right, so you
should be spending zero time

1864
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:48,125
on that which clearly has
been historically played out

1865
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:50,583
that both work,
and you should do you.

1866
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:51,583
And you need to
figure out how you're going

1867
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:54,250
to distribute and make
this product profitably

1868
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,834
in a world where you're going
up against very difficult

1869
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,583
political infrastructure.

1870
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:02,458
- [Braxton] Cool, thanks.

1871
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:05,208
(audince applause)

1872
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,458
- [Mary] Hello Gary.
- Hello.

1873
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:09,875
- [Mary] Hello, I'm Mary,
I'm really glad to meet you

1874
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:12,333
and I'm really
nervous right now.

1875
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,750
- Don't worry,
I'm super far away.

1876
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,583
(audience laughter)

1877
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,792
- [Mary] Now that
they're all looking at me.

1878
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:19,417
I'm a marketing consultant

1879
01:14:19,417 --> 01:14:23,250
and I help clothing stores.

1880
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,166
- Okay.

1881
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:26,834
- [Mary] So clothing retailers
and I'm going to ask

1882
01:14:26,834 --> 01:14:30,500
a selfish question.
- They normally are.

1883
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,417
- [Mary] Do you have
any ideas or tactics on how

1884
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:37,083
I could reach them
and give them value?

1885
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:41,500
- So reach them and give
them value so they hire you?

1886
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,417
- [Mary] Eventually yeah.

1887
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:45,834
- Do you know the names of the
people that would hire you?

1888
01:14:45,834 --> 01:14:46,542
- [Mary] Yeah.

1889
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:49,250
- Great, so I would follow
them on every social network.

1890
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,959
Figure out what they care
about outside of their job

1891
01:14:51,959 --> 01:14:53,875
and then I would talk to
them on social networks

1892
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:55,667
around their interests,
not their job.

1893
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:57,125
Don't talk to me
about social media,

1894
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,458
talk to me about
the Jets and Bret Hart

1895
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,417
and you'll get to me quicker.

1896
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:02,625
- [Mary] All right,
thank you very much.

1897
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:03,417
- You're welcome.

1898
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:05,917
(audience applause)

1899
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:08,458
By the way, that tactic I just
said, everybody should do.

1900
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:10,000
Anybody that you're trying
to sell to you need to follow

1901
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,125
on every single platform.

1902
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:17,583
Know who they are, and then
exploit that to get their money.

1903
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:22,125
- [Beard Dude] Hey Gary.
- Hey man.

1904
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,000
- [Beard Dude] Beard Dude.

1905
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,542
- Beard Dude, I'm
glad you came out.

1906
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:28,917
- [Beard Dude] Thanks,
so my question is the reason

1907
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:32,291
I love you is because
you talk about eating shit.

1908
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:33,125
- Yes.

1909
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,041
- [Beard Dude] And it's
the hardest thing to do.

1910
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:36,792
- That's why so few people win.

1911
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:39,500
- [Beard Dude] Exactly,
and you talk about the joy,

1912
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,792
you love failing.

1913
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:44,959
You love losing and that's a
mentality that's so important.

1914
01:15:44,959 --> 01:15:46,917
So I was wondering if
you could just spend a little

1915
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,875
more time talking to
us about what it takes

1916
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:54,000
to re-engineer our neural
relationship to pain and losing?

1917
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:58,166
- I don't know,
I think that's a really

1918
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:00,333
interesting question.
I don't know how to create that.

1919
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:03,625
I don't know why
any time I watch a sport

1920
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,291
that I root for the
underdog, every time.

1921
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:08,500
I make fun of all
my friends who are fans

1922
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,291
of the best teams
because I'm like really?

1923
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:12,125
You need to jump on a

1924
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,375
bandwagon to feel
better about yourself?

1925
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:16,834
Like, you're really
wrapping your self-esteem up

1926
01:16:16,834 --> 01:16:18,125
into a team that
you didn't care about

1927
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,166
but they just won and
you bought their t-shirt?

1928
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:21,792
You're the ultimate loser.

1929
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:24,708
So I don't know why I do that.

1930
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:25,667
I don't know how that happened.

1931
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,333
I do believe some
of that is upbringing.

1932
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,458
I do think that's the
underdog entrepreneur,

1933
01:16:29,458 --> 01:16:30,542
immigrant thing.

1934
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:32,083
I do think that's there.

1935
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,750
I definitely am not
the person that knows how

1936
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:37,333
to engineer that, but I
do think that I'm adding

1937
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:39,000
to the conversation.

1938
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,959
There's not a lot of
people out there right now

1939
01:16:40,959 --> 01:16:42,291
that look like me
that are talking about

1940
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:43,583
the love of losing.

1941
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:46,208
Then if you capture
admiration maybe then

1942
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:47,375
they think that's good.

1943
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:50,166
I'm very driven by
Steve Jobs' narrative.

1944
01:16:50,166 --> 01:16:51,083
I just want everybody to know.

1945
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,834
Him becoming the famous
person of Silicon Valley

1946
01:16:52,834 --> 01:16:55,458
when I was really
deeply in it and the narrative

1947
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:57,417
that he was
tough on his employees

1948
01:16:57,417 --> 01:16:58,959
and treated them like shit.

1949
01:16:58,959 --> 01:17:02,458
I watched smart, nice kids
start treating their employees

1950
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:05,417
like shit because they
looked up to Steve Jobs

1951
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:07,500
and they thought that
was the right thing to do.

1952
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,708
The reason I'm talking
about all these true things

1953
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,583
is I hope there's a
15-year-old girl that's looking

1954
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:14,375
up to me on the
internet right now

1955
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,834
and she tries to treat people
better because she thinks

1956
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:18,875
I'm cool and that's my system.

1957
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:21,417
(audience applause)

1958
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,041
So I don't know how to do it,

1959
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:24,417
but if I'm actually
going to be influential

1960
01:17:24,417 --> 01:17:26,500
and if I have a big
responsibility with all the

1961
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,792
attention that I have right now,
I think just in the fact

1962
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:31,583
that I'm talking about
it has already impacted

1963
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,625
others to think about it.

1964
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:38,959
Thanks man.

1965
01:17:38,959 --> 01:17:41,208
- You're kicking me off, huh?
Can I get one more in?

1966
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,333
- One more.
- Alright, cool.

1967
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,291
(audience laughter)

1968
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,291
- [Man 7] Hi, I'm--

1969
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:45,792
- You know I'm going to
get more than one, right?

1970
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:46,625
(audience laughter)

1971
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:47,708
- [Man 7]
(laughing) I was able to.

1972
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:49,166
I am very thankful to
be able to speak with you

1973
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,291
and thank you for being here.

1974
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,542
I got this ticket because, 
I'm going to ask you a

1975
01:17:53,542 --> 01:17:55,250
question that in a sec,
but I have to thank you

1976
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,083
because two years ago,
I was paralyzed

1977
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:58,792
and I couldn't walk.

1978
01:17:58,792 --> 01:17:59,625
(Gary sighs)

1979
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:01,000
I am actually still
walking with a brace.

1980
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,041
(audience applause)

1981
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,208
No, it's (laughing)...

1982
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:05,750
(audience cheering)

1983
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:09,125
I've been training martial
arts for 21 years of my life

1984
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:12,333
and to have lost everything
and my ability to walk.

1985
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,375
Man, there was three
people who helped me, my family,

1986
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:18,542
close friends
and your videos, man.

1987
01:18:18,542 --> 01:18:19,875
(audience cheering)

1988
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:20,708
- Thank you, man.

1989
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:24,083
- [Man 7] Yeah, fuck.

1990
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:27,792
And (clears throart) it
was a video actually you were

1991
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:30,875
talking about, you know, what
are you 20, 30-years-old,

1992
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,375
like what are you going to do
with the rest of your life?

1993
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:33,792
You still have
time, do something

1994
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,417
and honestly, it
was so motivating.

1995
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:36,583
So thank you man.

1996
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:37,417
- Thank you man,
means a lot to me.

1997
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:39,458
- [Man 7] Thank you,
my question is,

1998
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:42,792
is now I started a
company for self-defense

1999
01:18:42,792 --> 01:18:44,917
because there was a
lot of sexual assaults

2000
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:46,959
that was happening in
and around UBC and SFU

2001
01:18:46,959 --> 01:18:48,250
and I was tired

2002
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,083
of people being a
victim like I was, I guess.

2003
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:50,917
- Sure.

2004
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:52,291
- [Man 7] And I wanted to
do something about it.

2005
01:18:52,291 --> 01:18:54,792
So, I made this
self-defense company

2006
01:18:54,792 --> 01:18:57,875
and I have a great deal of
students and one of things,

2007
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,500
one of the challenges
that I face all of the time

2008
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,959
with some of these
students is anxiety

2009
01:19:01,959 --> 01:19:03,458
and how I can help them--

2010
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:04,291
- Yeah.

2011
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:07,000
- [Man 7] See that
they are, you know,

2012
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,041
they can do more than they think

2013
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:10,333
and that they're
stronger than they know.

2014
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:14,542
How would you, hiring
someone who is new, say,

2015
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:15,792
and you see that
they have this talent

2016
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,125
and potential, how
would you articulate

2017
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,125
or explain to them--

2018
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:21,333
- You know how I'd do it.
I'm doing it.

2019
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,542
I'd put pressure
on the true answers.

2020
01:19:23,542 --> 01:19:27,291
I'd ask them why, did
their mom fuck them up?

2021
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:30,417
I'm being serious.

2022
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:34,708
Insecurity is the seed
that creates all these issues.

2023
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:35,542
- [Man 7] Absolutely.

2024
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:36,708
- And so I'm trying
to figure out why

2025
01:19:36,708 --> 01:19:38,333
they didn't build self esteem,

2026
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:39,625
who didn't build self esteem.

2027
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,417
And the reason I bring
up mom, is like, Jesus,

2028
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:43,083
it's such a big
percentage of it.

2029
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:45,834
Mom or dad, is like 80% of it.

2030
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:47,875
It's just, you
know, I do this a lot.

2031
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:50,625
Listen, my dad, listen,
I don't talk a lot about this,

2032
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:51,458
that's what happened to my dad.

2033
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,250
My dad, I am so
impressed by him.

2034
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:55,875
The way my grandmother
parented my dad,

2035
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:58,750
it's unacceptable. That's the
only word I can think of

2036
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,041
and not only that,
they did it and then,

2037
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:02,333
you know I have a lot
of empathy for my grandma.

2038
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:07,000
They did it in the worst place
in the world, Soviet Russia.

2039
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:11,583
So, I'm fascinated by it
because I had the reverse.

2040
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:15,166
I'm so perfectly parented by
my mother, I'm unstoppable.

2041
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:18,750
So, I look at that and
I'm like, how, like, I feel,

2042
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,834
I,

2043
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:22,625
I feel guilty that I'm
so emotionally grounded

2044
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:25,208
and strong, that's
why I'm giving it to you.

2045
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:27,417
What do you
thinks happening up here?

2046
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:29,792
I feel guilty that I have
it so good mentally.

2047
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:32,708
There's nothing anybody
can do to my mental state.

2048
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,125
It's insane.

2049
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:36,500
I am so weird, guys.

2050
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,625
(audience laughter)

2051
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,875
Nothing hits, it's like I'm numb

2052
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:43,583
and so I go right to the core.

2053
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:44,917
I do it when I see it sometimes.

2054
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:47,458
I'm like, hey,
you are unbelievable

2055
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:49,959
and you think
you're shit, that's bad.

2056
01:20:49,959 --> 01:20:51,500
We need to talk about this,

2057
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,375
tell me everything
about your childhood.

2058
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:55,667
(laughs) Like, you
know, and I just go there

2059
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:58,208
and you know sometimes
you get a little break,

2060
01:20:58,208 --> 01:21:00,959
but what's really fun is
they start thinking about it

2061
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:02,500
and it changes behavior.

2062
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,166
I get an email
every day that says

2063
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:05,708
that they disconnected
from somebody

2064
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:09,083
in their inner circle
and for the last six months,

2065
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,708
they're breathing for the
first time in their lives.

2066
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:15,208
It is not easy to
break up with your brother.

2067
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:17,792
It is not easy to
break up with your spouse.

2068
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:20,166
It is not easy to
break up with your father,

2069
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:22,792
but that's
actually the binary move,

2070
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:25,166
if they're the
poison of your life.

2071
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:27,208
And we don't talk
about that, none of us,

2072
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:29,500
but it's the truth
and we all know it.

2073
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,792
So, A, if that's your
reality, you need to think,

2074
01:21:33,792 --> 01:21:36,333
'cause guess what you have
one life and you don't want

2075
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:38,792
to be 73 when
your parent passes away

2076
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:40,875
and finally start breathing.

2077
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:43,542
B, if that is not your life,

2078
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:44,750
you need to drive home right now

2079
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:47,583
and kiss your
parents in the face.

2080
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,333
So that's what I do.

2081
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:51,208
(audience cheering)

2082
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:52,041
- [Man 7] Thank you, man.

2083
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:54,333
Thank you, man, thank you.

2084
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:56,250
- Thank you, man.

2085
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,667
- Alright.
- Alright, one more.

2086
01:21:57,667 --> 01:21:58,708
- I got to rope you off.
- One more, one more.

2087
01:21:58,708 --> 01:21:59,708
- I got to rope you off, man.
- One more, one more.

2088
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:00,792
- I got to rope you off.
- No, no, no, no, don't.

2089
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:03,083
- I got to rope you off.
- No, no.

2090
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:04,166
- I got to rope you off.
- Okay, fine.

2091
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:05,208
- These people got to go.
- Thank you.

2092
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:06,542
- They got to go, give
him a round of applause.

2093
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,792
Stand up, stand up.

2094
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:10,458
(audience applause)
Stand up.

2095
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,750
- Thank you

2096
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:14,750
(audience cheering)

2097
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:17,708
- Thank you

2098
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:24,875
- Got the selfies,
oh my god, the selfies.

2099
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:25,875
Holy smokes.

2100
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:28,375
It's like the bomb rush.

2101
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:32,583
Okay, hold on, hold on, before
like sheer chaos ensues.

2102
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:35,583
Before sheer chaos, oh my god.

2103
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,875
We got something for you though.

2104
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:40,000
- [Gary] Thank you.
Boom, there we go.

2105
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
- [Gary] Alright.

2106
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,333
- We're going to have
time, don't worry, don't worry.

2107
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,250
- Bye guys.

2108
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,250
- Alright, I got
something for you.

2109
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:45,917
- Okay.

2110
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:49,667
- I got something
for you, hold on.

2111
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:50,834
Remember those nice
kicks that you liked?

2112
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:52,250
- Ew, these are fucking fly.

2113
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:54,250
- So that's from 604,
I know how much you love kicks.

2114
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,375
- Yes.

2115
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:57,542
- From 604, a local company.

2116
01:22:57,542 --> 01:22:58,375
- Amazing.

2117
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,208
- Got them done up for you,

2118
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,291
a limited edition
from a local artist.

2119
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:01,250
- Fucking rad, thanks so much.

2120
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,000
- Awesome, thanks brother.
Thank you.

2121
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,125
- Thank you guys
for your attention.
