1
00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:02,661
- So we're trying to do a meetup.

2
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:04,198
'Cause I have to be at Mall of America

3
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:05,341
so I figured I'd be like, hey,

4
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:07,293
I can meet you there real quick.

5
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,366
I didn't want to disrupt it in any way.

6
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:12,253
But it seems like security
is not excited about it

7
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:13,782
or something, I don't
know the details yet.

8
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:15,020
You got to

9
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,687
move it to the IHOP.

10
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:18,478
What do you think?

11
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:20,395
Don't slip, don't slip!

12
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:29,077
Q&A

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,143
Q&A

14
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:34,284
(crowd cheers)

15
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,117
Yep.

16
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,892
First, first I just wanna thank
you guys for all coming out.

17
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:37,870
It's very flattering, I'm sure you have

18
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,988
plenty other things to do.

19
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:40,916
So,

20
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,053
alright.

21
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:43,132
(crowd laughs, crosstalk)

22
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:44,716
Shhh, shhh, shhhh.

23
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:45,549
Go ahead.

24
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,382
- [Male] Alright, so

25
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:47,441
- Oh, I'm sorry, wait,

26
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:48,404
let me get this photo real quick,

27
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:49,237
yeah of course.

28
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:50,070
- [Man] Thank you so much, dude,

29
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,903
we love you so much.

30
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:52,406
- [Gary V] These are some young-ass kids,

31
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:56,376
you know we gotta go.
(crowd laughs)

32
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:58,496
- [Man] I'm mad I didn't bring mine.

33
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:00,366
- [Female] Yeah he almost
named him after him.

34
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,523
(crowd exclaims, laughs)

35
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:03,404
- [Man] The middle name Vayner

36
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:05,251
She's like, let's call it after your dad

37
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,716
and I'm like, ah, dad, Gary,

38
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:07,549
I'm like.

39
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:08,382
- I was close, right?

40
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:09,215
I was close.

41
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:10,048
The next one?

42
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:10,881
The next one.

43
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,097
Is there gonna be three?

44
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:12,930
- Yeah.

45
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,763
- Yeah, dude, get me in there.

46
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:14,723
(crowd laughs)

47
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:16,345
Alright, thank you.

48
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:17,384
Alright, go ahead, my man.

49
00:01:17,384 --> 00:01:18,217
Where'd you go?

50
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:19,050
Yes.

51
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,883
- [Man] Yeah, so

52
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:21,523
I'd been working in tech startups

53
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:22,680
for the past three years

54
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,513
as a designer.
- Okay.

55
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:27,467
- But kind of my achilles heel
is that I didn't learn code.

56
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:28,300
- [Gary] Okay.

57
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,133
- [Man] And that's why I got laid off

58
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:30,076
from my first startup.

59
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:31,376
- But I don't think
that's an achilles heel,

60
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:33,861
that's just, you were in one specific job

61
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,444
where that was a need.

62
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:36,627
Like for example,

63
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:38,443
at Vayner, we are

64
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:39,948
putting more scrutiny on people that

65
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:40,896
are double bubbling,

66
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:43,214
'cause we want people deep as they can be.

67
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,904
- [Man] So I mean, kind
of a two sided question,

68
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:48,253
what are your thoughts on the unicorns of

69
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:50,193
designing UX and

70
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,893
- I think UX really fuckin' matters,

71
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:54,021
it just really matters.

72
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:54,940
It will almost matter

73
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,076
The number one thing I think about now

74
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,668
is the UX of the voice apps

75
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:02,708
because it hasn't been established.

76
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,324
Like, we don't know how to communicate

77
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,583
with Alexa and Google Home.

78
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,583
Somebody's gonna create the audio UX

79
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,740
of the next world

80
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,892
the same way there was
UX designers for the web,

81
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:14,444
in the same way that I
used to design my dad's

82
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:15,516
liquor store.

83
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:18,476
This IHOP needs to be UX'ed.

84
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:19,909
Right?

85
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,309
It can be maximized, or
it could be more spaced,

86
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,791
could be more dollars, it
could make more revenue,

87
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,141
if it was perfect.

88
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,309
So, UX

89
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:29,269
user experience is everything.

90
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,445
- [Man] Yeah, so I mean

91
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:32,261
the follow up for that is,

92
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:33,509
working for the startup

93
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,149
we closed our 10 million A,

94
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:36,400
we're trying to ramp up revenue

95
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,351
- [Gary V] Go ahead, go, go go.

96
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,413
- [Man] And so, for me as a UX signer,

97
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:42,269
do you think going deeper
and trying more things

98
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:43,528
outside of the office

99
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:46,045
- I think you should never dictate

100
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:48,477
your long-term life's vision,

101
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:51,397
predicated on the current
place you're working at.

102
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,389
That I can promise you.

103
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,630
- [Man] Okay, yeah, that's helpful.

104
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,182
- Cool, go ahead my man.

105
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:56,310
- [Man] I wanted to ask you

106
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,310
for the past

107
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,269
if you could go back in the past,

108
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,421
what would you change?

109
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,254
- Nothing.

110
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:04,318
Dude you have to understand, bro

111
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,709
and I got part of your question,

112
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:06,869
a lot of people ask me this.

113
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:07,781
People still,

114
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,910
you hear people talk but
people haven't grasped

115
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,965
I only talk about shit I know,

116
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:13,997
even this book Crushing It

117
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:16,389
I only wrote it, not 'cause I was in need

118
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:19,029
I never wanted to write
the follow-up to Crush It.

119
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,301
It's only because the last 18 months,

120
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,774
I've quadrupled down on the
things that I believed in,

121
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:24,607
and the result,

122
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,558
if I did this meet up 22 months ago,

123
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,702
this room would be a tenth of the size.

124
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:29,535
It just would.

125
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:32,685
The fact of the matter is that

126
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:34,164
I wouldn't change anything because

127
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:35,396
first of all, I'm too happy

128
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:36,788
so I wouldn't want to
fuck with that, right?

129
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:40,468
And second of all, I just
really believe in my thesis.

130
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:42,517
I think everybody here under 30

131
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:46,184
is rushing to do stuff
to close insecurities

132
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:49,509
and vulnerabilities and
it's making them do things

133
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:52,045
that they're gonna regret long-term.

134
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,197
And I just didn't!

135
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:54,030
I just,

136
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,861
you know what it feels
like to be 27 years old

137
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,718
and see your college friends

138
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,133
and them making jokes
that you work in your

139
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,245
dad's liquor store.

140
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:04,182
Like, I just was able to be in my own head

141
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,445
and not care about what
anybody else thought.

142
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,166
And that would be my
biggest piece of advice,

143
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,773
because I genuinely believe all of you are

144
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:10,733
in a rush for that.

145
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,053
I don't think you care about a BMW

146
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,854
or a Rolex or

147
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,132
spending a lot of money on a vacation,

148
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,156
for any other reason
because of the psychological

149
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,900
aspects of how that positions you

150
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:23,530
to other people.

151
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,202
I really believe that.

152
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:27,152
And so, I just think people

153
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:29,098
the young man, I don't know if he's here,

154
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:30,202
who's like, I'm killing it,

155
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,176
I want to start teaching other people.

156
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:32,343
He's so young.

157
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,768
Anybody could do well at Wall
Street the last six years.

158
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:36,664
Everybody.

159
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,376
If you've lost money on Wall Street

160
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,578
in the last seven years,

161
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:42,436
you should literally retire

162
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:43,459
and call it a day.

163
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,332
Just, leave.

164
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,381
'Cause it's impossible not to make money.

165
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:47,214
Right?

166
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:48,339
And so, I think people are caught.

167
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,220
I'm saying it over and
over, I know a lot of you

168
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,479
pay attention.

169
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,941
If you're under 32, you are completely

170
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:55,375
misreading the situation.

171
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,732
The college debt crisis is coming.

172
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,315
This economy will crash.

173
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:02,405
And everybody's behaving like

174
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,683
10 million raising

175
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:07,819
if you don't make money,
you're vulnerable.

176
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,547
And so I just think
people are misplaying it.

177
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:12,248
I'm very concerned about
the lack of patience.

178
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,207
People come up, they put up the five

179
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:15,928
they were like, yeah Gary I love patience.

180
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:16,871
Then I look,

181
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:19,631
they aren't deploying patience.

182
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,324
Way too much debating in
your 19 year old head.

183
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:23,232
You know?

184
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:25,103
Eat shit for 10 fuckin' years,

185
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,753
work for somebody that's smart for free,

186
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:27,911
make minimum wage,

187
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,943
live with seven homies in
a one bedroom apartment,

188
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:31,951
that's the best way you'll
enjoy the rest of your life.

189
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,751
That's the furthest thing
from people's minds.

190
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,632
Everybody's gonna Crush It

191
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:37,273
and start a business and fucking kill it.

192
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:38,935
Everybody's so fucking great.

193
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:40,272
99 percent of these people in this room

194
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,265
have no shot of building a business

195
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,944
that is long term successful

196
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,960
unless they go super long tail

197
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,460
and super patient.

198
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,450
Yo.

199
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,129
- [Man] My name is Prophet.

200
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:53,363
- That's already a bad start.

201
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:55,953
(crowd laughs)

202
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:57,008
- [Prophet] That's
literally my birth name.

203
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:58,314
- Respect.

204
00:05:58,314 --> 00:05:59,147
Go ahead.

205
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:00,112
- [Prophet] I work at
an agency and I'm on the

206
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:01,192
side, so I

207
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:02,496
- On the account side?

208
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,632
- [Prophet] On the account side, exactly.

209
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:06,728
And I'd love any kind
of tips that you have

210
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:07,680
maybe on

211
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,513
- You can't, yeah

212
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:10,256
- [Prophet] Politics
or client relationships

213
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:12,336
- I got a lot, first and foremost,

214
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,392
the number one thing I tell
all my client service people

215
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:17,232
is you can only control
what you can control.

216
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:19,296
Most of my client people
are so ideological

217
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,001
about their clients.

218
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:23,251
100 percent of VaynerMedia's clients

219
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:26,817
don't even 50 percent of
what I want them to do.

220
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,352
Let me just say this very clear,

221
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:31,296
100 percent of VanynerMedia's
clients aren't even

222
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:33,168
50 percent doing behavior
I want them to do

223
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,997
to make their business bigger.

224
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,403
And I'm Gary Vee!

225
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:38,355
(crowd laughs)

226
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:39,902
You know?

227
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,706
You know, so

228
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:43,601
I think you need to be
historically correct,

229
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:44,904
so I think the other
mistake that people make is

230
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,281
the other way, which is
you pander to the client.

231
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:49,689
And you're saying the things that you know

232
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:50,522
they want to hear

233
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,632
you need to be historically correct.

234
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:53,768
You know, if you believe in something,

235
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:54,904
you have to die on that sword

236
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:57,402
because it feels really
bad when that plays out

237
00:06:57,402 --> 00:06:58,874
but you never said anything

238
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:00,849
because you knew the client did want it.

239
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:01,921
And then they're blaming you for it,

240
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,154
and you're like, fuck I always knew it.

241
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:04,659
That's a way worse L

242
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:07,386
than dying on your own sword.

243
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,129
And just recognizing that

244
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,257
you can't control shit.

245
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:12,235
Today it's going great,

246
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:14,249
and now that person rotates
or leaves the company

247
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,465
and your new person sucks,

248
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:18,601
I don't dwell on the shit I can't control.

249
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,569
I wanted to eat shit for a decade

250
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,033
and build this Vayner
machine so that I could

251
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,396
buy businesses.

252
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,570
So I won't fire the clients,

253
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,833
because I have a mission
in a 50 year macro,

254
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,276
I eat shit every fuckin' day,

255
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:31,977
I dislike being at the
mercy of other people

256
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:34,025
but I know what I'm doing
in a four year window,

257
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:35,169
and so that's why I'm choosing.

258
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,609
So since I made that decision,

259
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:37,761
I hate when people are like,

260
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,849
I hate this shit.

261
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,041
I'm like, then quit!

262
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,137
And go fuckin' do something else!

263
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:46,593
You're in fucking control,
you're in America.

264
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:47,426
Cool.

265
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:48,259
- Gary.
- Yep.

266
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,609
- Follow up to that, kinda
in the same industry,

267
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:52,705
I work in consulting in a dying industry,

268
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:53,625
credit unions.

269
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,458
- Okay.

270
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,291
- Old school mindset.

271
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,897
- I know it.
- They do not change.

272
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:58,577
And I preach to their pain points,

273
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,417
I manage and I build indirect lending,

274
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,201
which I want to talk to
you about your auto thing.

275
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,034
- Okay.

276
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:03,897
- The auto 2020.

277
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:05,401
- Agent 2021?
- Agent 2021.

278
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,234
- Yep.

279
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:07,169
- I want to email you that.

280
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,458
- Okay, fine.

281
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,545
- I work in that industry.

282
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:12,163
I consult credit unions
to work for that industry.

283
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:12,996
- Yep.

284
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:13,829
- They won't dive in.

285
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:14,662
- Okay.

286
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:15,495
- And they're failing!

287
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,328
That's their bread and butter.

288
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,161
But they won't do it, and we watch

289
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,054
within the last five years
they've gone from over

290
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:20,797
40 thousand credit unions in the nation

291
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:22,175
to under 8 thousand today.

292
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:23,008
- Yeah I'm super aware.

293
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:23,841
- It keeps shrinking, so

294
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,477
I talk to their pain points,

295
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:27,979
I show them the numbers
and they just shut the door

296
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,405
and say, no, we've got it on our own.

297
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,108
How do you get past that ego?

298
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,559
I'm trying to see them.
- You don't.

299
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,392
You don't.

300
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:36,832
I never try to sell to
people who are unsellable.

301
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,409
I just don't try to convince anybody.

302
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,452
If I have a meeting,

303
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,760
at a diner with some pancakes

304
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,695
and meet the guy,

305
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,919
I tell him my piece, he says no,

306
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,359
I'm like, cool, Mazel tov, see ya.

307
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,650
Just like the film

308
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,969
that dude made, like I
don't care what Goren does

309
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:50,968
I don't care what any of you do.

310
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:53,836
Like, it would be much
better if you did it,

311
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,276
and it worked and you
email me in four years

312
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:56,764
and I'd feel really nice

313
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:58,378
and your life is better, it's good.

314
00:08:58,378 --> 00:09:01,002
But at the end of the
day, I can't control you!

315
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,669
I can't control you.

316
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,796
I love this new kick
where, as you guys know,

317
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,300
I'm like, stop watching me, right?

318
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,181
So, people think it's
cool to email me and say

319
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,154
I've stopped watching
you, I've unsubscribed.

320
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,226
But then their
(crowd laughs)

321
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:16,113
No no no, let me, let
me get to the punchline.

322
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:17,616
But then I watched it
'cause I was curious.

323
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:19,786
I was pumped about that at first,

324
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:21,424
until I caught something in a stream once

325
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:22,944
which put me down a rabbit hole,

326
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:24,848
now I look at their behavior,

327
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:25,880
so literally, literally

328
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,728
this is how I think
people are misplaying it.

329
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:30,792
They're watching my stuff,

330
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:31,688
I'm proud about my stuff,

331
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:32,776
I think it works.

332
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:35,176
They see a piece of content
where I get on this tangent

333
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,672
that I'm desperate for you guys to do.

334
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,416
I'm so desperate for
you actually to execute,

335
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,536
that I get to the extreme where
once in every four months,

336
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:43,632
I'll look to the camera and be like,

337
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:45,512
stop fucking watching me!

338
00:09:45,512 --> 00:09:46,776
Just do!

339
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:49,066
So, I've watched all the
people that are saying that.

340
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:49,928
So they stop watching me,

341
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,744
and then they go watch worse shit!

342
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:54,312
(crowd laughs)

343
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:56,721
Everyone's just like checking boxes.

344
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,744
Oh, Gary V told me to stop watching.

345
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:01,784
To go do, I've unsubscribed
from his YouTube.

346
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:04,954
Just a bunch of fuckin' keyboard warriors.

347
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:08,560
Everybody's real fuckin' fancy
on their Instagram photo,

348
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,208
and their profile,

349
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,328
and what you say on Twitter

350
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:13,424
but nobody's fucking doing it!

351
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,760
Like it's super easy for me
to look in your face and say,

352
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,576
eat shit for 10 years, 'cause I did it!

353
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,032
I lived in New Jersey,

354
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:22,076
I didn't go out in New York
City in my entire 20's!

355
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:23,810
That's just fuckin' facts!

356
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,730
That's hard for a 20 year old dude.

357
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,990
But I was on a mission.

358
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,602
And by the way, not all of you should

359
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:30,730
most of you should not be
on the mission that I'm on.

360
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,946
Which means you can go out,

361
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:32,963
and you can do things.

362
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:34,794
But everybody's talkin' shit.

363
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:36,266
Lot of fuckin' talk.

364
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,306
Lots of fuckin' talk.

365
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:41,010
And fuckin', I'm telling you, it's

366
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,154
there's a bunch of fuckin'
fakers in this room right now.

367
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:44,987
- [Man] Hi Gary.

368
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:45,820
- Yep.

369
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,786
- [Man] So you always talk about how

370
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,085
firing is more important than hiring?

371
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:48,918
- Yep.

372
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,186
- [Man] How do you

373
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:53,035
'cause when you put out a job request or

374
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,139
applications, how do you determine

375
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:58,858
who out of those applications
that you decide to hire,

376
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,580
I understand if they fail,
you caught them right away,

377
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,050
but what's some advice
for the hiring process?

378
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,451
- For me, I talk to people
and I go on my intuition.

379
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:11,122
- [Man] How do you play through the lies?

380
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,916
Because a lot of people
lie and say that they're

381
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,931
doing things that they're not.

382
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:16,148
- I trust my intuition.

383
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,234
Sometimes it's right and
sometimes it's wrong.

384
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:19,139
That's why

385
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,754
you're being too slow.

386
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:23,394
You're not listening to

387
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:25,666
If you're debating that
or struggling with that,

388
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,666
then you haven't actually
consumed the message.

389
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,667
Usually it's your own
ego that's stopping you.

390
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,810
You don't wanna make the wrong call,

391
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,026
you don't want somebody to trick you.

392
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,404
I love you guys tricking me, I don't care.

393
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:38,237
Trick me.

394
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:40,336
I'm in control.

395
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:41,890
If you're in control,

396
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,723
you know?

397
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:45,778
So, you're letting your
ego get in the way.

398
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:47,691
- [Man] Alright, so just
make the gut instinct.

399
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,778
- Make the gut instinct and then, fuckin',

400
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,756
(snaps fingers)

401
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,260
Hiring's tough.

402
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,842
Which is why firing is not.

403
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:57,130
Hiring, you don't know.

404
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,106
Firing, you know Baban sucks.

405
00:11:59,106 --> 00:11:59,939
You know?

406
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:01,122
(crowd laughs)

407
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:03,829
- [Man] I was waitin' for it.

408
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:04,662
- [Man] Thank you Gary.

409
00:12:04,662 --> 00:12:05,495
- Who's back there?

410
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:06,328
Let's go, go ahead, sir.

411
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,458
- [Man] I have the card
I gave you is for my

412
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,531
dark matter platform website

413
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,655
on one website platform.

414
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:15,638
Completely bootstrapped
from the ground up,

415
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:17,223
and we are getting
clients coming over to us

416
00:12:17,223 --> 00:12:18,056
from

417
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:18,902
because it's easier to use.

418
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,070
It provides better stuff.

419
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,582
Our problem now is,

420
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:24,222
we still work side jobs.

421
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:26,818
This has been our side
thing and we're in this role

422
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:28,599
where we're debating,

423
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,510
do we look for investment?

424
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,830
Or we just go all in on
getting our sales up?

425
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,096
And I'm just curious,

426
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,107
at a startup in that phase

427
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:39,462
- All of the advices work,
if you get the right money,

428
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:40,382
that's great.

429
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:41,582
It speeds it up.

430
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:44,430
I love going slower, because
then you're in full control.

431
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,238
People don't understand,
when they take in money,

432
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:47,934
they've lost control.

433
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,630
- [Man] Right, my concern is,

434
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,214
we might be missing a window.

435
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:53,214
- Everybody thinks that.

436
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,543
What window?

437
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:59,066
WordPress and Squarespace
are way fuckin' ahead of you.

438
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,754
- [Man] Well, actually, we have a pretty

439
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:01,690
- I don't give a fuck.

440
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,523
They're way ahead of you.

441
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:04,231
(crowd laughs)

442
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,877
Right?

443
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:09,189
You're not closing a window,
you're finding a carve out.

444
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,453
- [Man] Yep.

445
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:11,286
- Do you understand?

446
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:12,119
- [Man] Yep.

447
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:12,952
- Everybody thinks,

448
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:13,785
everybody's sitting here with a

449
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:18,070
Literally besides, I'm
gonna help you buy the Jets,

450
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,383
the quickest way to get me to actually

451
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,598
not hear anything and turn
you into Charlie Brown,

452
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:24,189
is when you say, I've got such a big idea

453
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:25,150
I'm gonna patent it.

454
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,597
I'm literally literally
onto the next thing.

455
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:31,586
Like, literally, yeah yeah yeah, next!

456
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,195
I don't think you're

457
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:36,779
gonna lose a window, I
think you're carving out

458
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,946
A true window is innovating,
not in a feature set,

459
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:43,382
but innovating.

460
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,430
When you're feature setting, or slight

461
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,487
If you're a platform that
helps people have a website,

462
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:50,966
you're not losing a window,

463
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:54,915
you have a feature coming that
is giving you some carve out.

464
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:56,632
Features, as everybody has learned,

465
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:59,648
are easily replicatable if one chooses to.

466
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,688
So I think you're overthinking the window,

467
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,152
which then will help you be more patient,

468
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,304
will then get you to the right place.

469
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,137
Got it?

470
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:06,970
- Got it.
- Everybody thinks they're

471
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,803
sitting on something.

472
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,216
Nobody's sitting on something.

473
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,305
Nobody who decided to come to see me

474
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:14,305
is sitting on something.

475
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:17,343
It's just

476
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,343
You understand?

477
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:19,176
- Yep.

478
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:20,190
- I'm not sitting on something.

479
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,357
I'm just executing ahead.

480
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:25,821
I'm just executing so fast,
'cause I don't overthink

481
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,453
a lot of these things that
you guys are talking about.

482
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,278
Which lets me go fast.

483
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,534
People are slow because
they're in their heads.

484
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:35,329
So I don't think you're
sitting on a window.

485
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:36,557
I think you're sitting on a feature

486
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:38,422
and you probably have some talent.

487
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:41,342
And so, I would just keep
putting brick by brick.

488
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:43,686
What is making you not jump all in?

489
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:47,749
Usually not crazy results
in a short period of time

490
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:50,103
which means you're looking for,

491
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,869
you're not looking for marriages,

492
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:53,349
you're looking for hookups.

493
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:55,670
That's why you haven't figured it out.

494
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,334
Everybody thinks

495
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,726
everybody is on stuck

496
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:00,710
you know what, this is a
great two themes in a row.

497
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,885
Everybody's stuck on the idea of it.

498
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:03,718
Guys,

499
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,317
it's not the idea of it.

500
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,590
Ways wasn't a new innovation.

501
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,647
Instagram wasn't a new innovation.

502
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,126
Spotify wasn't a new,

503
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:18,959
guys,

504
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,845
it's like, it's execution.

505
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:24,613
So, usually people are bouncing
around their businesses,

506
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:25,510
'cause they think they're
gonna come up with an idea,

507
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,614
it's gonna launch and
fuckin' nirvana's gonna come.

508
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:30,095
You know?

509
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:30,949
It's just not.

510
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:33,157
It's fuckin' execution.

511
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,973
Nothing I've ever done in
my life is some new thing.

512
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:38,991
I've just done it better, harder, longer

513
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,908
it's just in the edges.

514
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:45,030
Elon Musk is not in this room right now.

515
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,917
You understand?

516
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,577
So you're bouncing around
'cause you're not getting

517
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:49,062
the traction that you're looking for

518
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:52,758
because you're probably
judging way too fast.

519
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:54,709
VaynerMedia sucked shit
the first two years.

520
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,349
Me and AJ had a long
debate about selling it for

521
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:58,421
a million dollars to Buddy Media,

522
00:15:58,421 --> 00:15:59,504
29 months in.

523
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:05,686
Yeah, I mean everybody thinks like

524
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,445
Guys, most people are
not actual entrepreneurs.

525
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,677
We are as a collective universe right now

526
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:15,231
being tricked that we are.

527
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:17,191
Just keep that in mind.

528
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:18,382
My man.

529
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:20,742
- [Man] Yo Gary.
- What's up, bro?

530
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:23,279
- [Man] If you were graduating in 2018,

531
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,270
from college.

532
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,103
- Yeah.

533
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:27,672
Yeah.

534
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:29,616
- [Man] What direction do
you think you would go?

535
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:31,192
- For me if I was graduating today,

536
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:32,923
I think the best advice
I'm giving to that person

537
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:36,152
is to work for the person
they want to be for free.

538
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:37,544
Tell me what industry you love,

539
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:39,928
let's write down the 15 people
that fuckin' dominate it

540
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:41,144
right now.

541
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:43,306
And dominate it not like
they were legends in it,

542
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,832
and maybe they're fallin' off,

543
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:46,576
like who are the real players,

544
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:50,346
and figure out how to fuckin'
work for them for free.

545
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:51,986
Which is hard when you have debt.

546
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:54,104
Which is hard when you wanna
prove yourself to the world.

547
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,584
Which is hard, you know,

548
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,072
but it is the move.

549
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:58,032
It is the move.

550
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,099
I'm really happy about
this one because I've been

551
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,008
on this kick for a long time.

552
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:03,936
I'm so positive I'm going
to be historically correct

553
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:04,977
about this,

554
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:05,810
I'm positive.

555
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,088
I think when the college debt crisis

556
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,271
takes down our country,

557
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:11,015
the same thing will happen to colleges

558
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:11,983
that happened to banks.

559
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:13,511
We're gonna blame the colleges,

560
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:14,992
not the kids in here
who are borrowing money

561
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,252
even though they have debt.

562
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,704
- [Man] Well my payment's
only $700 a month.

563
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,856
- Okay.

564
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:19,689
(crowd laughs)

565
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:21,496
- And I'm not even doing
what I went to school for.

566
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:22,344
It's a joke, you're right.

567
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:23,232
- Oh it's

568
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,848
by the way, it's not even bad.

569
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:27,992
The worst part is that

570
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:30,713
people are being lent money with the debt.

571
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,097
It's not the debt.

572
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:33,200
If you didn't have any options,

573
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,520
your parents aren't gonna
pay for your school,

574
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,016
you were of an age where

575
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,208
all of us, including you youngsters are

576
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,400
still of an age where
college is the right move.

577
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,233
Right?

578
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:46,078
It's not that, it's that

579
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:49,132
26 year olds right now with
$400 thousand dollars in debt

580
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:51,982
are getting lent $500 thousand dollars

581
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:54,286
to buy a BMW and an apartment.

582
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:57,933
And they have no shot of
ever making that work!

583
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:58,973
It's just gonna happen again!

584
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:01,077
We're like minutes away.

585
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:02,340
Just think about your life,

586
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,892
over the next seven years
very carefully financially.

587
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:06,941
Very carefully 'cause I think the extremes

588
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:10,284
have a potential to be extremely hardcore.

589
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,406
And you're gonna get
tricked, with fruitfulness

590
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:13,700
that's built on fuckin',

591
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,283
so I would work for
somebody for free, man.

592
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,279
Yeah, but the thematics,

593
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,751
you've got the thematics right.

594
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,983
There's real marketplaces and

595
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:28,223
there's artificial marketplaces.

596
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,543
Right?

597
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:30,479
You know.

598
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,396
It's crazy.

599
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,162
Go ahead.

600
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:33,995
- [Woman] I have a question.

601
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:35,162
So, my grandma

602
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:37,163
has a shoe store.

603
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:38,707
She's 80, I'm fourth generation,

604
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,699
I want to help run the business.

605
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:41,550
- The shoe store.

606
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,003
- [Woman] Yeah, it's already
mouth to mouth customer

607
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:47,100
like people come from 80 miles around

608
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,899
a lot of people know who it is.

609
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:50,412
I want to update it and

610
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,052
their website is shit, to be honest.

611
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:54,435
- Yeah, if your family
business is not doing

612
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:59,083
50 percent of its business
online direct to consumer

613
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,483
in 36 to 48 months,

614
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:01,517
you're gonna be in real trouble.

615
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,900
- [Woman] What would you
suggest, what platform?

616
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,203
- Shopify.

617
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,036
- [Woman] Shopify,

618
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:05,869
okay.

619
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:06,779
Comfort based

620
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,227
- Shopi-fuckin'-fy.

621
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,013
- [Woman] Comfort meets style.

622
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,501
- Shopify.

623
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:14,308
Shopify, Instagram, Facebook, go.

624
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:15,315
- [Woman] What do you
think about Pinterest?

625
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:16,885
- I like Pinterest but I think

626
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:18,316
I like Pinterest.

627
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:21,292
But I like Pinterest as like, I like it.

628
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,539
I fuckin' adore Instagram and Facebook.

629
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,717
- [Woman] I was thinking Instagram.

630
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:29,030
- [Man] Hey Gary
- Yeah the guy in the back,

631
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,863
with the glasses, yep.

632
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:32,005
- [Man] Would you go for
something that you like doing,

633
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,659
or something that makes you more money?

634
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:35,492
- Like.

635
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:37,673
- Okay.

636
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:40,561
(crowd laughs)

637
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,016
- Here's why, especially
as young as you are.

638
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,664
A lot of people liked playing
video games 20 years ago,

639
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,434
but they became lawyers.

640
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:49,336
They wished, I mean, great ones,

641
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:51,056
they wished they stayed
playing video games,

642
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,096
'cause they'd be the Tony
Hawk of Esports today.

643
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:55,304
You always have to,

644
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:58,720
as young as you are, you
have to bet 15 more years

645
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,656
on like, and hope that
that turns into more.

646
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:02,632
You know what I mean?

647
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:03,465
- [Man] Yeah.

648
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:05,904
- Again, I got it really good,

649
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,024
because

650
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,346
what I was doing in being an entrepreneur,

651
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:10,673
during when I was doing it,

652
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:12,681
was frowned upon.

653
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,472
Who's over 40 here?

654
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:15,305
Right?

655
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:16,138
So we know.

656
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:18,288
There was no entrepreneurship.

657
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:19,483
I got D's and F's.

658
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,672
Which meant I had no shot at
being successful in my life,

659
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:23,226
that is fundamentally how it was.

660
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:24,059
You can't

661
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,520
you gotta understand if you're under 25,

662
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,673
under 30 that's hard
for you to understand.

663
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:29,200
There was no internet.

664
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,648
No internet.

665
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:32,148
Let's start there.

666
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,960
There was no fuckin' internet!

667
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,393
Right?

668
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:37,226
And so,

669
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,120
it was fuckin' school to job or

670
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,037
we have not

671
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,336
What we have not done is understood

672
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:45,793
what the internet is yet.

673
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:47,001
That's what this book is about.

674
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,850
That's what coming out
of my mouth right now.

675
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,872
It's real early.

676
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:52,881
I think the NBA is gonna
go out of business.

677
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:54,923
And I think it's the number one sport.

678
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,296
It's got the best situation,

679
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,336
I just think the players
have all the leverage.

680
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:00,128
I just think the next generation of LeBron

681
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,994
and Carmelo and Durants are
gonna look at each other

682
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,970
and be like, fuck it!

683
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,746
Let's just own the teams ourselves

684
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,154
I'll be captain.

685
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,442
I'll get

686
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:11,116
let's get a billion
dollars per from a brand

687
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:12,914
to pay for the stadiums and all that shit.

688
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:15,604
We'll make a deal with
Facebook for people to watch.

689
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:16,684
It's over!

690
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:18,184
The middle's over.

691
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:21,971
My ability to compete
with your family business

692
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:24,291
and my ability to compete
with my own family business,

693
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,282
selling wine direct to consumer or shoes,

694
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:29,979
I could buy shoes as
comfortable as they are,

695
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:31,898
and I'm sure with that
many years of tradition,

696
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:33,394
there's such great relationships.

697
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:35,026
But money talks.

698
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:35,859
And so,

699
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:38,562
it's just over.

700
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:41,729
It's so much bigger than people think.

701
00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:44,330
I'll get you both.

702
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,163
I'll get these two and I'll go.

703
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:45,996
What?

704
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:46,829
- [Man] Best Super Bowl ad this year,

705
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:48,217
are you going to be the number one ad?

706
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:49,249
- We produced two ads.

707
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:51,841
We have no ads that we created.

708
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:52,674
We're still,

709
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:54,785
Vayner's still at a place
where we're the second

710
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:56,097
creative team.

711
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:58,953
There's still the
television creative team.

712
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:01,025
And we're not trying to
necessarily jockey for that,

713
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:02,513
because we think

714
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:04,193
for example, is this right, Tyler?

715
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:07,953
That Comcast's Olympic thing, right?

716
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,472
We're getting there.

717
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:11,361
But there'll probably be two or three more

718
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:12,649
Super Bowls before it's like,

719
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,809
these are our spots.

720
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,001
You know?

721
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,906
My man.

722
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:18,433
- [Man] So I had a question
about the music industry.

723
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,266
- Yes.

724
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:20,099
- [Man] I'm a music producer,

725
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,773
I want to know what you think
the future revenue streams

726
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:23,817
are for musicians,

727
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,465
just 'cause that's being
flipped on its side.

728
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:26,313
- Yep.

729
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:28,241
- [Man] I want to just embrace it,

730
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:29,809
but I'm just trying to figure out

731
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,121
what's the best business plan long term

732
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:36,018
for musicians where media
is just being commoditized.

733
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:37,825
- It's supply and demand, brother.

734
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:39,233
It's not just

735
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,949
I don't feel bad for
musicians, the same way

736
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:44,913
I don't feel bad for a
fourth generation shoe store.

737
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:47,066
It's supply and demand,
the cat's out of the bag.

738
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,409
You're not gonna make the same economics.

739
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,581
You have to build your brand so you can

740
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:51,906
make money other ways.

741
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,164
Too much music.

742
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:53,997
Too many producers.

743
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,471
- [Man] Yeah I get that,
there's no scarcity.

744
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:56,812
So

745
00:22:56,812 --> 00:23:00,380
obviously, even you think
that it's a part of culture.

746
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,396
- No it's the most fuckin'
important part of culture.

747
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:04,653
Music's top five, in life.

748
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:06,711
But that has nothing to do

749
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:08,436
don't get confusion of

750
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:10,438
separating what it means creatively

751
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:12,278
and what it means from
a business standpoint.

752
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:13,893
- [Man] Sure, that's where I'm lost.

753
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,829
- Yeah well I'll tell you,

754
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:15,662
I'm gonna find you.

755
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:16,495
Here it is, ready?

756
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,328
- [Man] Yeah.

757
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:18,564
- You're not gonna make
money the same way,

758
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,085
because streaming is only
gonna get bigger, not smaller.

759
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:22,501
Then, something else will come along.

760
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,812
The number one thing you should do is,

761
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:27,484
you need to fuck technology
before it fucks you.

762
00:23:27,484 --> 00:23:28,317
Right?

763
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:29,812
So you need to use
Instagram and Facebook and

764
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:31,908
these platforms to build up your brand

765
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:33,549
so people want to fuck with you.

766
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,588
24 Hours and Metro
Boomin and Sonny Digital,

767
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:37,930
they're not struggling.

768
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,582
And Richie Souf is not gonna struggle

769
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:41,932
'cause he's growing in his platform.

770
00:23:41,932 --> 00:23:43,684
You need to build your
fuckin' personal brand.

771
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:45,870
It's the only thing you control.

772
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,093
- [Man] So personal brand is the

773
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,219
business plan for
musicians, you're saying.

774
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,308
- Personal brand is the
leverage point that you can

775
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:52,196
then put

776
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,845
my business plan did not include a

777
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,621
dollar sneaker deal.

778
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:56,459
- [Man] Sure.

779
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:57,292
- My business deal

780
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:00,309
had a strategy of have the attention

781
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,404
and then decide what to do with it.

782
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:03,237
- [Man] Okay.

783
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:07,287
Part of the brands is what
you're saying, after that

784
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:08,332
- You're thinking about
it too technically.

785
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:09,460
Let's take a step back.

786
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,663
Build a fuckin' brand.

787
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:11,496
- [Man] Then doors open.

788
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:12,460
- Every one of them.

789
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,076
Then, people will want to pay you more to

790
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:14,909
produce their shit.

791
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:16,268
Then a brand wants to reach out to you for

792
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,309
you to produce something.

793
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:18,142
Got it?

794
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:18,975
- [Man] Got it.

795
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:19,996
- It's agnostic.

796
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:23,284
The only leverage we're
playing for right now

797
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:24,940
is attention.

798
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,204
This is share of attention.

799
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:28,733
I don't think I compete with Tony Robbins

800
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,350
or Elon Musk or Richard Branson.

801
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,812
I think I compete with fuckin'

802
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:37,371
21 Savage and fuckin' Karl-Anthony Towns.

803
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:38,971
Anybody who can have attention

804
00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:40,405
is my fuckin' competition.

805
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:42,783
That book, you fuckin' driving,

806
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:45,241
you sleeping is my fucking competition.

807
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:48,007
Attention is the fucking game.

808
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:49,176
Cool, see ya.

809
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:50,282
(crowd cheers)

810
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,177
Meet each other, there's more shit there.

811
00:24:52,177 --> 00:24:53,010
Take care.

812
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,843
Bye, thank you.

813
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:55,657
- [Crowd Members] Thank you, Gary.

814
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:56,745
- [Man] Advice for a
college grad that wants to

815
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,245
- [Gary] Do I look

816
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:01,823
- [Man] Advice for a
college grad that wants

817
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:02,953
- Bye guys, thank you so much.

818
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:05,279
- [Man] Thanks for answering my question.

819
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,112
- Of course, man.

820
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:07,257
I like your thought process, man.

821
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,890
Work for somebody for free.

822
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,685
I'm telling you right now.

823
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:11,905
Listen to me.

824
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:14,111
Getting closest to the sun
is where all the leverage is.

825
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:16,087
People don't understand.

826
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:18,215
These two fuckin' guys

827
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,960
are so much further ahead of every

828
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,439
his whole career is already made!

829
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,543
How long have you worked for me?

830
00:25:22,543 --> 00:25:23,376
- [Man] Two years.

831
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:24,432
- If he wants to work
for Steven Spielberg,

832
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:25,959
it's set!

833
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,355
People don't get it!

834
00:25:27,355 --> 00:25:28,289
Get as close to the

835
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,922
People are gonna pay me
$200 thousand dollars a year

836
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:31,555
to work for me in five years.

837
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:33,883
That's what's gonna happen
when people understand.

838
00:25:33,883 --> 00:25:37,460
Right now, the biggest
steal of all time is to

839
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,749
fuckin' get Mark Cuban's coffee.

840
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,797
To get P Diddy's shoes cleaned.

841
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:43,129
Once you get into the vortex,

842
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:43,962
if you're smart,

843
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:45,015
I could tell you're smart.

844
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:47,661
If you suck, then people get in.

845
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:49,140
And then they get out.

846
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,701
But if you're good, and you
can get closest to the sun,

847
00:25:51,701 --> 00:00:00,000
it's over!
