1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,899
so twitter is down and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it kind of brought</font>

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,980
up a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've been thinking about</font>

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,710
quite a bit lately which is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,219
are underrated and human interaction is

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,740
underrated and the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so</font>

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,710
much greater than most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think and</font>

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,539
that's fascinating to me it's

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,010
fascinating<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't know</font>

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,390
what to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now because they can't</font>

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,439
communicate on Twitter and they're

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,570
jumping the friend feed and Facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,820
other things of that nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what I</font>

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,679
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you about is global</font>

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,390
business I think it's a massive

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,450
underrated thing to not be communicating

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,280
when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> face to face</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I see a</font>

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,590
decline in it and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,450
interesting to me because don't forget

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,309
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make every business</font>

21
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,850
decision are people not the robots not

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,550
yet and so there's a lot in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,129
the fact of the matter is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

24
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not allocating at least one to two</font>

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours a day to do breakfast lunch dinner</font>

26
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,620
drinks with people that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,510
business with then you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaving a</font>

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,180
massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity absolutely even go</font>

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,920
as far as saying this is grossly

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,640
negligent to not allocate 90 minutes a

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,280
day for human interaction business it's

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that is massively successful</font>

33
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,080
for me now I can be full of crab and

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,180
wrong and that probably is very possible

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,520
but I've seen so much success and

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
actually knowing somebody so when you

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,409
pick a ping on aim or admo where you

38
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook wall that or whatever you're</font>

39
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,119
going to do in the future hologram<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,710
when you close your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes yo Pete what's</font>

41
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,450
up you know whenever you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do</font>

42
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,130
it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come down to Pete</font>

43
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to come down to</font>

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,070
somebody that you know better<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

45
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,049
you actually spent some physical time a

46
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,509
little hug a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit handshake that</font>

47
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,299
stuff is the difference maker it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

48
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,700
almost funny that it's not what you know

49
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,860
to you know is probably even greater

50
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">than ever it's not what you know it's</font>

51
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">not who you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

52
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,380
it's how much time you actually spend

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,969
face-to-face with who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know give that</font>

54
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,710
some thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into your</font>

55
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">repertoire add it to the way you do</font>

56
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,820
business and let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in three months</font>

57
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,128
