1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:03,577
- Not giving a shit about
anybody else's opinion

2
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:05,905
is the secret sauce, right.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,368
Like, if you really ask me
to deconstruct why I think

4
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:13,632
I'm gonna win I'm empathetic
about other people's opinions.

5
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:17,244
I respect other people's
opinions and I really do.

6
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:19,867
I'm a listener for all my talking.

7
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,478
At the end of the day I just don't think

8
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:24,128
it's practical to live my
life by somebody else's

9
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:25,045
North Star.

10
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,944
(gentle music)

11
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,831
What's up, blog?

12
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:55,998
Super excited now for this talk
here in Gothenburg, Sweden.

13
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,162
One of the great things
about traveling the world is

14
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:02,915
maybe going to that city
or two or three that isn't

15
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:06,998
Stockholm or in Germany,
Berlin, going to second,

16
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:11,360
third, fourth city is kind of
no different than when people

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,638
come into the U.S. and do go to a Chicago

18
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:16,971
or a San Francisco or a Boston or Miami.

19
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:20,706
And so, I love that part, great audience,

20
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,570
gorgeous setup in there.

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,973
Hopefully, Baban will get
some contacts and we'll go

22
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:26,973
give it our best at bat.

23
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,800
(crowd clapping)

24
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:33,806
- [Narrator] Gary crushed
the keynote, as usual,

25
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:35,727
but this question from the
Q and A really got him.

26
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:37,185
- I can answer this.

27
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:38,018
You don't have to go any further.

28
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,929
This is very classic.

29
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:43,778
You know, and being an immigrant
I understand it deeply.

30
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:46,463
So many of us love our parents very much.

31
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:48,946
Very common in tight
knit families immigrants,

32
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:52,027
southeast Asia, Italy,
you know, eastern Europe.

33
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:54,360
A lot of cliche talk, India.

34
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:59,572
Let me tell every young
person in here and everybody

35
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:00,739
who's watching

36
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:05,138
why I tell them the very harsh advice

37
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,989
of going against their
parents in their 20's.

38
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:11,322
If you appease your parents in your 20's

39
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:15,923
to live the life they want
you to, you will not have

40
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:18,655
a relationship with your
parents in your 40's, 50's,

41
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:19,822
60's and 70's.

42
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,644
It's just the long game.

43
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:28,611
There is nothing worse than
resenting your parents.

44
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:32,935
And so, the upfront friction
of fighting in your 20's

45
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,556
and not becoming a doctor or lawyer.

46
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:36,555
Let's give this man a mic.

47
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:38,404
The upfront friction

48
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:41,316
of not becoming a doctor
or a lawyer or professor

49
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:43,504
in your 20's to make your parents happy

50
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:44,938
because they grew up in a different game

51
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:48,954
at a different time, I think is far more

52
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:52,787
a better play because
regret and resentfulness

53
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,097
is super scary and very ugly.

54
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:01,847
And, I think it's the
worst of the two evils.

55
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:07,397
- So, that's pretty much
what I've been doing.

56
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:10,814
So, when I was 18 I break from with them.

57
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,089
I really don't want it
to be like this specific,

58
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:21,310
but I know a lot are going
through the same situation

59
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,218
and now I'm 23 years old.

60
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:27,423
The first two years of
breaking apart from my mother

61
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:31,590
was getting like a normal
job and then is when my dream

62
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:37,209
as photographer, so I did
full-time at a daycare center

63
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:42,068
and then evenings, weekends
I would do with photography

64
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:45,013
and then I was like, after
that I was full-time.

65
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:46,607
So, I've been with them
for three years now.

66
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:49,212
But, I have no relationship
with my mother.

67
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:52,795
Just the same as Hassan
was speaking about.

68
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,544
He said,

69
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,958
so for southeast Asian
parents, it's all about,

70
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,791
the kids are property.

71
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,311
- Brother, I understand.

72
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:09,703
I was born in the Soviet Russia.

73
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:14,650
Your kids are the by product
of you and how you look

74
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,800
to the other parents.

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,379
You're a product.

76
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:21,059
- You said two things that was like, yeah

77
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:24,787
and I was like, what you
wanna do who you love.

78
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:26,194
- Dude, let me ask you a question.

79
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:30,035
Whose fault do you think it
is that you and your mother

80
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,202
don't have a relationship?

81
00:04:33,244 --> 00:04:36,157
- I mean, I wanna say her.

82
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:37,800
- Me, too.

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,633
- It's her.

84
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,300
- I agree, I get it.

85
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,467
- Back up 'cause I'm working in Sweden.

86
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,914
I'm basically in between
the Swedish culture

87
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:49,247
and the Sri Lankan, so like.

88
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:54,422
- Let's play out the, guys,
life is about choices.

89
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:56,823
There's no, this is binary.

90
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,091
You either did that

91
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,198
and took the risk and the hope

92
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:03,337
that if you were successful
'cause you believed in yourself,

93
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:07,067
to be able to make that
leap, you believed, right.

94
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,794
And, you had no choice.

95
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:10,534
You believed and hoped that you'd be able

96
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:14,930
to backtrack into a relationship
after you achieved, right?

97
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,430
That's the practical thing.

98
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,663
The alternative would be
that you'd be sittin',

99
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,746
you would be fundamentally
more unhappy right now

100
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:26,490
and that's with not having a relationship

101
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,510
with your mother.

102
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,943
Theoretically, it sucks on paper.

103
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:32,738
Everybody who loves their mother, I mean,

104
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:34,178
my mother's my idol.

105
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:36,099
Everybody who loves their
mother right now and hears

106
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:39,227
you don't have a
relationship goes, that sucks

107
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:41,143
unless they've lived a
life where they lived

108
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,939
by their parents' terms and realized

109
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,872
the cancer that was
running through their head

110
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:48,955
and their heart every day
of their lives forever.

111
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,794
Man, I would just go on the offense

112
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:55,063
to try and have a
relationship with your mother.

113
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,534
Suffocate her.

114
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,328
(crowd laughing)

115
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:00,674
I don't mean physically.

116
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:03,885
Like, it takes two to tango,
to have a relationship.

117
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,795
You could smother her.

118
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:06,798
You could email her.

119
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:07,949
You could send her videos.

120
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,492
You could send her gifts.

121
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:10,473
You could show up at her job.

122
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:11,306
You could.

123
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:16,429
- You say that my success
would be the breakout point.

124
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:22,532
But, it's just like, I
thought that would be now,

125
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:25,115
because I'm doing it full-time.

126
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,762
- When's the last time you talked to her?

127
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:29,595
- A year ago.

128
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,246
- And, what was the conversation?

129
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:33,756
- It was basically her,

130
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:35,218
she doesn't get what she's doing.

131
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:36,536
That's the thing.

132
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:37,369
- No shit.

133
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,788
Do you have siblings?

134
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:44,621
- Half siblings, but
they're not, as I grew up

135
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:48,883
like can't accept with my mother.

136
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,715
- Understood.

137
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,231
I would suffocate her.

138
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,712
I'm being serious.

139
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,483
Do you desperately want the relationship?

140
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,549
- Yeah.

141
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,466
- So, then act like it.

142
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:01,515
Stop fuckin' pondering in your head

143
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,765
and just go fuckin' attack.

144
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,133
- I would like to thank
you for sharing this

145
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:11,133
because I think many
people share the situation.

146
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,866
- I know, I know, I
know, I know you're doing

147
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,434
the right thing 'cause we're one minute

148
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:22,549
and 15 seconds over,
however I'm asking for two

149
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:24,582
or three more minutes
on this because this is

150
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:25,906
pretty important shit.

151
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:26,739
Is that cool?

152
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,822
Can I get two minutes?

153
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,655
Is that all right?

154
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:29,488
- Sure, unless you wanna.

155
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:31,571
- Brother, suffocate her.

156
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:35,453
In the same way,

157
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:38,295
don't listen, don't be the
reverse of who you were at 18.

158
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:42,131
At 18 you made a binary
decision, high risk, high reward,

159
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:43,562
that you were gonna go do this.

160
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,821
Either, you have to ask
yourself if you want

161
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:47,154
the relationship

162
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,754
because you've already
shown me that you have

163
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:54,377
the ability to make the
tough decision, you did it.

164
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:55,995
You have to ask yourself,
and you don't, you shouldn't

165
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:59,091
give a fuck about this
audience or me or anybody else,

166
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:02,065
you need to be in your own head.

167
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,780
I think it's appropriate to not.

168
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,411
- I was thinking because like.

169
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:08,176
- You want that negativity in your life?

170
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:11,853
It's your ma, of course,
of course, brother

171
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:12,686
and it should.

172
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:15,637
And by the way, that's
awesome and it should,

173
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:17,787
but if you want it,

174
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:20,015
if you've decided through
that one relationship

175
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:23,630
that you want the
relationship, act like it.

176
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,797
Suffocate her.

177
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,810
Just like, when she's
walking down the street

178
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,060
come out of the alley and be like, boo.

179
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:34,217
Act like it.

180
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,266
Thank you.

181
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,947
(gentle music)

182
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,443
- Thank you, sir.

183
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,968
- You're welcome, sir, take care.

184
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:55,968
We gotta go.

185
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:01,902
You missed a good part.

186
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:03,393
There's audio to it.

187
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:04,617
It happened, the camera was down.

188
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:07,317
The guy asked me about
Tesla and I was talking

189
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:08,559
about,

190
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,988
- [Questioner] Where would
you rank Tesla in your,

191
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,605
long term or short term?

192
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,677
- I don't know that business well enough.

193
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:17,510
- [Questioner] All right.

194
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,787
- Now, I believe in Elan the most.

195
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,620
But, I understand media and retail

196
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,790
and what would Amazon do.

197
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,058
I just don't understand transportation.

198
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:32,425
Now theoretically, in my
binary, bet on the jockey

199
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,275
not the horse, Elan everyday.

200
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,699
- [Questioner] Yeah, well
he's doing it I think.

201
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:40,136
- I think so, I think so, too.

202
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:43,526
Whereas, what I was
saying up there, I know.

203
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:44,601
You understand?

204
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:45,434
It's a difference.

205
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,661
That's such an interesting,
blog, that's such

206
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:49,317
an interesting distinction

207
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:52,652
like, I talk about what I know.

208
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:56,835
Cryptocurrency, I'm tryin'
to think of other things,

209
00:09:56,835 --> 00:10:01,123
even machine learning,
VR, AR, my thoughts.

210
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:03,235
I'm in the, I think.

211
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,332
You guys are in full-time, I think.

212
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:09,166
The people that win are in the, I know.

213
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:09,999
I know.

214
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,123
This stuff,

215
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:16,633
content, under price
attention, this moment, I know.

216
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,642
That's a big fuckin'
fundamental difference

217
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:20,524
between thinking and knowing.

218
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:23,596
And, acting on your knowing full,

219
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:25,838
at being thoughtful about your thinking

220
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:28,899
and being cautious to learn to know,

221
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:31,150
that is a big difference
between winning and losing.

222
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,288
So many people, so many of you are all in,

223
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:34,788
on what you think.

224
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:37,105
That's somethin' you have to think about.

225
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:39,176
I'm about to do a Jim Rome's podcast.

226
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:42,505
Jim Rome, a legend in
the sports announcing,

227
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:45,694
sports commentating industry.

228
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:47,494
I'm really excited about it actually.

229
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:49,832
I've done his radio
show, went pretty viral.

230
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:51,146
We've had dinner.

231
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:53,396
I'm just a fan of his vibe.

232
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:56,707
So, I'm excited about this.

233
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:57,864
See what happens.

234
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:59,132
Should be some highlights here.

235
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:02,076
Like, worked, in a store,
retail, every Saturday

236
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:03,251
is the biggest day of the week.

237
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:07,418
Like, gave up my social
life, my 20's dude alpha DNA,

238
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,514
left it on the table.

239
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:12,638
Went into my early 30's, now married

240
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:16,805
and still making 40, 70, 80,
90 thousand dollars a year

241
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:21,928
solid, but building
something of that wealth

242
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:25,327
and then leaving at 34
with no money on paper.

243
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:28,379
I can't go buy a better home
because I have no equity

244
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,452
in anything.

245
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm, by all standards, not worth anything.

246
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,726
And then during that
whole time of building

247
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:38,035
this big business for my
dad, having all my friends

248
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:41,238
and acquaintances and
my friends' parents say

249
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:42,698
things like, oh, what's Gary?

250
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:44,550
You know, asking my good
friends from high school

251
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,513
when they were 26, what's
Gary Vaynerchuk up to?

252
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:50,951
Oh, he works at his dad's liquor store.

253
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:53,534
Like, like, you know, right now

254
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,117
in a world where A-list
celebrities are reaching

255
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:59,623
out to me, super smart and cool
and historically successful

256
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:01,744
people like you are
fascinated by me, like,

257
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:03,362
it's all easy now.

258
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:06,028
I'm in the shit eating business, Jim.

259
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:07,980
I'm in the shit eating business right now.

260
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,459
Jim, do you know how many people right now

261
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:13,409
listening to this are like,
ah, like right this second?

262
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,707
Your audience which you know, I'm one of,

263
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:19,127
but because of the certain
thing I've just said

264
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:22,921
or who the hell knows,
because of the mentality

265
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:25,254
of them looking for excuses.

266
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:30,445
It's a constant game of eating
shit with more attention

267
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:34,278
I'm getting called out
on ludicrous shit like,

268
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:35,990
you know how it is.

269
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,916
I mean, it just, it's
just part of the process.

270
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,826
Anybody who's listening
right now, if you have

271
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,461
real ambitions, if you really wanna win,

272
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:48,849
the great thing to learn
is how to eat shit, aka,

273
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:51,551
get used to people criticizing, understand

274
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,999
that people default into cynicism.

275
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,033
90% of people are unhappy
and they wanna drag you down

276
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,436
and you shouldn't be mad at them.

277
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,542
They're not trolls.

278
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:04,831
You know, everybody who shits
on me I have empathy for

279
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,825
because if they have energy to shit on me

280
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:09,309
they're in such a bad place for themselves

281
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:11,807
that they want somebody
else to be there with them.

282
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,850
So, I'm not mad at people at
Twitter saying that I suck

283
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,371
or I'm fulla shit, or daddy put me on.

284
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:18,999
I feel bad for them.

285
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:19,895
I'm excited now.

286
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:22,995
Just gave a great podcast to Jim Rome.

287
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:26,284
I definitely am gonna blast
that out to all of you.

288
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:27,625
Baban loved it.

289
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,752
We also just made a little reference

290
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,926
to what my financial
situation was when I left

291
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:36,377
why my brain, I think for
a lot of you it's something

292
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:39,813
that's left out of the story
and we'll be clarifying that.

293
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:42,285
But, with all that fun,

294
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:46,626
that's all very secondary
to my favorite moment

295
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,581
of every episode.

296
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:51,467
Oh shit, I fuckin' left my hoodie.

297
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,626
I'm sad now.

298
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:53,833
I like that hoodie.

299
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,106
The hoodie that I was a twin with you.

300
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:59,219
Anyway, no dwelling about the hoodie.

301
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:01,904
Excuse me, the beanie
because what's amazing

302
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:04,709
about Airport Gary is
when you're the greatest

303
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:08,993
super hero on earth you've
always got a backup beanie.

304
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:13,662
Yeah, you know, Batman's got
multiple things in that belt.

305
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:15,349
Airport Gary,

306
00:14:15,349 --> 00:14:18,577
the greatest super hero on earth,

307
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:20,580
he is not set back by
the beanie being left

308
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,240
in the hotel room because he slept with it

309
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,366
because he was cold in the bed.

310
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:25,616
He has a backup

311
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:30,647
and he is almost officially
ready to dominate,

312
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,178
domination time.

313
00:14:36,624 --> 00:00:00,000
(gentle music)
