1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,993
- What are you doing?

2
00:00:00,993 --> 00:00:02,070
- Why you leavin' him hangin', man?

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,903
- Dude, he's just like,

4
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:03,914
this is great for the vlog and I'm like,

5
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:05,532
if I have to wake up in like an hour.

6
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:06,410
Fuck me!

7
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,636
Get me out of here, what?!

8
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:10,303
(hip hop music)

9
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:19,110
You know I'm starting my 101's

10
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,988
but I also realized I'm like,

11
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,490
what I'm trying to
accomplish may actually work

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,330
in smaller formats.

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,470
I did one two days ago,

14
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,310
went really really really well.

15
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,215
And I had a meeting

16
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,750
so basically, literally, every

17
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,810
if anything happens with a cancellation,

18
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,063
I'm gonna try to do like shotgun,

19
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:35,896
you know,

20
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:38,650
I need to accomplish
people really realizing

21
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,430
how deep I am in the business, right?

22
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,263
So I think

23
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:43,070
I think one thing I'm
spending a lot of time on is

24
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,670
thinking about how good I
am at documenting content,

25
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,210
and what that creates, right?

26
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,260
So for me,

27
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,230
I'm spending anywhere
between 12 and 14 hours

28
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,830
a day on VaynerMedia.

29
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,530
But if you're an employee,

30
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,100
and the only thing I can show in that

31
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,030
in my day is my public
keynote or my public interview

32
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,050
that I do, it becomes propaganda

33
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,680
almost too much in the other direction.

34
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,840
So I want to really just figure out

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,810
how to get people to
start communicating to me

36
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,093
for real, because I think

37
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:14,200
the biggest misconception that I'm sure of

38
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,250
that I'm gonna spend almost all my time on

39
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,083
is the following.

40
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,410
I think about life as alternatives.

41
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,243
Right?

42
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:23,120
To me, everything is,
what's the alternative?

43
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,810
I'm not really ideological or

44
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:29,630
and I'm not very like

45
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,830
making pretend.

46
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,740
And so I think that

47
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,470
I have enormous heart and excitement about

48
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,230
what this place's intent is,

49
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,900
because I really, really,
really think that's

50
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,820
the most important thing.

51
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,580
And then I think about
what stems from my intent,

52
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,200
all the way down to execution.

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,021
And it's remarkable to me

54
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:51,480
how many things I think are broken.

55
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,440
Like, an enormous amount.

56
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,170
But that comes with scale, and comes with

57
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,140
the reality of the business.

58
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,370
The question becomes,

59
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,120
how do you get that proper?

60
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,270
To me, I feel comfortable,

61
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,240
as you can even tell in here

62
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,769
and I'll even answer anything,

63
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:07,660
it's funny how comfortable,
even at the mercy of

64
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,500
not having deep
relationships with all of you

65
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,066
knowing what you're gonna
say when you go out there,

66
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,640
and knowing how fast rumors can spread,

67
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,430
I'm still far more comfortable

68
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,350
sitting in this room, talking to you

69
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,360
for an hour about stuff

70
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,610
than I would be sending
a company-wide email

71
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,700
where tone is always 100 percent,

72
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,020
that's why we do so many videos.

73
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,050
I'm so scared to send company-wide emails,

74
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,747
'cause an adjective or two or just

75
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:30,980
literally humans filter based on their

76
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,291
own internal feelings, right?

77
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,410
You literally just, you know.

78
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,030
So,

79
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,350
there's just a lot of
great stuff going on,

80
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm very confident,

81
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,210
and I feel like I've never
had a better grasp on

82
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,060
the things that are on super fire,

83
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,390
the things that are an annoyance,

84
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,570
the things that are

85
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,491
but for me,

86
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:51,540
I just want to get into
the hotline business.

87
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,373
Right?

88
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,720
What I keep thinking about every day is

89
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,627
I need to create a hotline which is

90
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:58,091
the biggest vulnerability for me when I

91
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,950
engage at scale, is I don't know

92
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,680
where you are between boy that cries wolf

93
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,373
and I'm quitting tomorrow.

94
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:09,880
That has been my unbelievable fascination

95
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,820
over the last seven years

96
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,210
'cause everybody
communicates so differently.

97
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,270
And we're doing a lot, and I'm doing a lot

98
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,539
to try to have a sense

99
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,632
but even on a one-to-one level,

100
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,630
there's things that I haven't been able to

101
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,900
totally figure out.

102
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,270
So, I guess the biggest
thing I'd like you to

103
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,920
leave here with, whether
you've been here for

104
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,579
three weeks, or whether
you've been here for

105
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,390
almost six years is

106
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,750
I've basically made an
interesting commitment

107
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,910
to myself somewhere
halfway through last year

108
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,743
which is

109
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:39,950
I don't want anybody to leave this place

110
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,150
without going through me.

111
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,010
Here's why.

112
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,350
I'll get you a better job outside of here

113
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,420
than you'll get for yourself.

114
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,230
And that would make me feel awesome

115
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,110
because I'm so grateful
for you ever working here

116
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,060
in the first place.

117
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,540
And so, to that extreme,

118
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,180
I think we can really create something,

119
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,470
'cause I've really just watched the people

120
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,300
that have voluntarily left the company

121
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,270
over the last six months,

122
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,747
like, this is what I do on my vacations,

123
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:06,280
I went through it and
I was like, fuck, man.

124
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:11,230
Seven of these temp people I
have a whole lot of heart for,

125
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,520
some I just didn't get to know

126
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,270
or sometimes people come in
before I get to meet them,

127
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,684
you know, life, right?

128
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:16,580
But,

129
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,630
that is the intent of our organization.

130
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,980
That's what we're gonna build out.

131
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,790
To me, the happiness meter in this company

132
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,623
is very simple.

133
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:25,760
The closer you are to
me, the happier you are

134
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,820
at this company.

135
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,340
It's just very basic.

136
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,060
Because those people just know

137
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,893
they're just

138
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:32,350
they're not drinking the kool-aid,

139
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,780
they just see the details.

140
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:37,800
Are we still number three?

141
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,633
Hey bro!

142
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:39,466
- [Man] Yeeaahh.

143
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,299
- [Man] So we're releasing pod sessions,

144
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:41,913
audio and video on Friday.

145
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:43,129
But we want to drive back to

146
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,060
the podcast to Monday,

147
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,770
also introducing Monday's podcast which is

148
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,681
going to be the fireside chat with Ryan

149
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,730
- But also want to jump in before this and

150
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,880
make sure you checked out Friday's.

151
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,170
I know how the weekends can get.

152
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,900
Friday's pod sessions number two,

153
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,750
these pod sessions are straight fire,

154
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,210
I'm very excited about it.

155
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,340
So if you're just joining
me for the first time ever,

156
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,890
or you didn't get a chance to listen to

157
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,341
Friday's pod sessions, go
back and check that out.

158
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,310
Enjoy the show.

159
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,280
- This is just us, technically on beta.

160
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,725
So I want to make sure I can

161
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,040
- Vlog!

162
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,869
VaynerBeta, literally the
greatest use of your money.

163
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:17,702
(bell ding)
(laughs)

164
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:18,870
- 100 percent.
- It's actually true.

165
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,162
You know what's super crazy?

166
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:21,826
- 100 percent.
- 4D's is amazing

167
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:23,900
but the audience in the vlog,

168
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,170
the number one thing that they should do,

169
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,090
they all want to work,

170
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,870
I get a million emails every day.

171
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,282
We have a company, we have a division,

172
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:31,280
it's VaynerBeta.

173
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,113
It's for

174
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:33,990
how low can they get in for?

175
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,950
- We've got some entry level products,

176
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,810
like marketing automation, user flows,

177
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,900
we've got

178
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,602
mini-campaigns that we do

179
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:42,890
- They're very basic.

180
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,922
- 20, 25K

181
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:45,755
- I fuckin' knew it.

182
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:46,627
- But you'll get real,

183
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:48,690
real tangible results.

184
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,500
Not having to sign up for us for six

185
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,860
- Alright enough of the commercial.

186
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,002
Vlog, VaynerBeta.

187
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:53,995
(laughs)

188
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,070
Alright, what's going on.

189
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,020
Gabe, you see this?

190
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,730
And I'm doing a pop up in L.A.

191
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,813
(laughs)

192
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,754
(modern hip hop music)

193
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,620
When you get traded, you get traded.

194
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,250
Thank you, brother.

195
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,680
That's exactly right,
I'm just looking for the

196
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,300
the email or the text or
the DM four years later,

197
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,600
saying, that quote got me or

198
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,650
that talk changed my trajectory.

199
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,593
Thank you.

200
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,060
Just had a three hour meeting

201
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,400
on a private plane

202
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,030
with my chief client officer.

203
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,340
She's running back to the airport,

204
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,832
flying back.

205
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,323
Life's gotten weird.

206
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:15,156
(laughs)

207
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:16,680
Really really

208
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,692
Hello hello!

209
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:19,020
- Gary, what's up, man?

210
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,853
- How are you?

211
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:20,686
- Chris Powers.

212
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:21,519
- Chris, such a pleasure.

213
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,540
Thank you so much for
being a part of this.

214
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,420
I don't take this lightly,

215
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,540
it's the first time I'm trying it,

216
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,660
with kind of like the conference people,

217
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,210
and this is gonna be a lot of fun.

218
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,490
I already was laughing, I'm like

219
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,810
I've been trying to think
about how to market this,

220
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,020
because there's no way
in hell I'm gonna stay

221
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,150
for just the limit allocated.

222
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,180
You know?

223
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,200
The organizers, my people, my agent

224
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,850
they're like, alright two
hours you can bounce that

225
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,683
I'm like,

226
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:47,810
but I can stay three hours, right?

227
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,643
And they're like, yeah.

228
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,980
So like, I'm excited, this
is a real fun format for me.

229
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,580
The 4D's thing that we've been doing

230
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,413
has been a lot of fun,

231
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:55,460
but I'm only in there for like an hour and

232
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,810
having a smaller group and I think

233
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,690
tonight's gonna be a lot of fun.

234
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,523
- [Man] It's so funny.

235
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:01,200
Like, I grew up idolizing Kobe.

236
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,033
- [Gary V] Yes.

237
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,370
- [Man] You're equal as
far as who I idolize.

238
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,400
If I was here with Kobe right now

239
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,700
I would be freaking out.

240
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,790
I feel like you do such a good job,

241
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,930
this is not kissing your ass,

242
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,527
I'll probably never see you
again the rest of my life.

243
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:11,360
(laughs)

244
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,193
- I hope we do.

245
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:13,230
- I hope so as well.

246
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,000
You do such a good job at connecting to me

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,710
and I feel like each one of us think this.

248
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,240
I thought I had a personal
connection with you

249
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,410
but I definitely don't.

250
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,243
And it's fine.

251
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:22,300
- You know what it's called?

252
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,430
It's called paying attention.

253
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,740
- How you're just real.

254
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,573
You're just real.

255
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,960
- Well yeah.
- I don't feel

256
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,919
like I'm in front of you right now.

257
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,150
And I mean that in

258
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,500
- Like I'm still on screen?

259
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,232
- Let's put it this way

260
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,065
- I get,

261
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:34,920
dude

262
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,580
you'll love this.

263
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,190
When I have dinner with a Jets player,

264
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,840
who isn't even a big player,

265
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,990
I feel the same exact way.

266
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,250
It's like whatever you're into, right?

267
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,850
It's super cool.

268
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,380
- It's the way you connect

269
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,213
let's put it this way.

270
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,951
When I watch you on TV, I
feel like I'm in front of you.

271
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,780
I don't want to trivialize what this is

272
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,613
- Listen

273
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,850
you're paying me a nice compliment

274
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,683
I appreciate it.

275
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:54,930
- When I watch you on YouTube, I feel like

276
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,710
that's a much smarter version of

277
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,543
- I gotta tell you man,

278
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,340
intent is a big fucker.

279
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,403
My big

280
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:04,040
I'm trying to really understand intent.

281
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,175
Because I know that

282
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:08,010
do you know how unbeatable I feel?

283
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,000
I will make a lot of mistakes but, fuck!

284
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,180
I have zero negative intent, friction.

285
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,930
It's all just friction.

286
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,870
It's why voice, it's
why I will push you guys

287
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,150
all for voice,

288
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,560
you can reach more veterans through voice

289
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,230
over the next five years
than anything else.

290
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,700
You gotta win now, build,

291
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,110
'cause it's friction.

292
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,960
Like I bought something
today in my shower!

293
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,320
I have Alexa now in my bathroom,

294
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,360
'cause it's like literally the only

295
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,877
outside my bed, my bathroom's
the only place I'm in and

296
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm never in my own home.

297
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,380
I literally thought of
something and I open the door

298
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,330
I'm like, Alexa.

299
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,200
I think that

300
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,760
I think that this is a
super interesting time

301
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,300
and I think that there's
so much opportunity,

302
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,140
so much underpriced and
overpriced attention

303
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,191
and executing is just like

304
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:59,640
unbelievably important.

305
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,663
- [Female] Hey!

306
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:04,496
- [Gary V] Hey.

307
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:05,329
- [Female] How are you?

308
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:06,421
- [Gary V] Good, how are you?
- Great, come on in!

309
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:07,710
- Thank you so much!

310
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,925
Good to see you, thanks for coming!

311
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,078
- [Gary V] Good to see you, of course.

312
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:10,911
- Yeah.

313
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:11,744
- 'Sup man!

314
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:12,585
- [Gary V] What's up, brother?

315
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,418
- Thanks for coming!
- Happy to be here,

316
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:14,251
how are you?

317
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:15,084
- Good, good, welcome!
- Good to see you

318
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:15,917
- Nice to meet you.

319
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:16,789
- This is awesome!

320
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:17,845
I love it!

321
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:18,678
- What's up, Gary?

322
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:19,511
- What's up, man?

323
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:20,344
How are you?

324
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:22,050
Such a pleasure, good to see you brother.

325
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,883
- [Female] Come on in,
we're live already, so

326
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,080
do you want a water or anything?

327
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,230
- [Gary V] Water would be amazing.

328
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,760
- We have some special guest here today.

329
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,931
It is, my wife, Alexa

330
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,470
(laughs)

331
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,440
And

332
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,360
(drumroll tapping on desk)

333
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,910
last but not least we have
Gary Vee in the house!

334
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,270
Welcome to Coral Sword, my man!

335
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,600
- Dude, welcome!

336
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,728
- Thank you thank you thank you!

337
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:41,590
- Yes!

338
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,930
- For me, I want legacy.

339
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,250
I want all these people with their handles

340
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,560
to think I'm great, to come to my funeral,

341
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,450
to thank me on email one day,

342
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,090
to hang out with me in VR in 17 years.

343
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,380
Because I brought them some value.

344
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,170
I come on here tonight, it's late,

345
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,640
I've had a long fuckin' day,

346
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,630
we obviously ran late for
the thing that I was doing.

347
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,080
First of all, thank you for waiting.

348
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,550
I apologize to anybody
who I was making wait.

349
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,450
But this was like,

350
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,300
Baban's like, get outta here,

351
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,330
we gotta go to the next thing.

352
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,710
And the whole time, I'm like,

353
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,543
I'm gonna come on

354
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,040
and then I come on and the lights are on,

355
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,110
and the only thing that's
running through my mind is

356
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,100
fuck, I better say something that brings

357
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,500
some kid some value in St. Louis

358
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,860
who actually hears it
a different way from me

359
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,160
for the first time,

360
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,450
and goes out and actually
does something about it.

361
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,450
I feel responsible.

362
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,220
I'm thankful for the attention,

363
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,540
and I want to bring value.

364
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,373
- Wow.

365
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,206
- Yeah.

366
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:32,067
- Wow.

367
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,070
Now if you really heard what he just said,

368
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,040
there's a very powerful
secret in what you just said.

369
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,560
You care about what you're giving,

370
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,860
you have an intention to benefit,

371
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,330
to look for win-win.

372
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,032
It's so deep and it rings so true to me.

373
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:48,210
I want to tell you, just because

374
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,090
'cause we came in a
whirlwind and we rushed you

375
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,030
on the stage and thank you so much.

376
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,760
Like, you're a warrior for doing that.

377
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,160
You just were like, give me a LaCroix,

378
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,320
(laughs)
put the lights on,

379
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,820
put the chat on, let's go.

380
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,030
Like, beast mode.

381
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,470
And I know you've had a long day

382
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,830
and you didn't have to come here.

383
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,848
But I want to also tell you that

384
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,410
I read, I'm a searcher

385
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,150
and I agree with you a thousand percent,

386
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,983
it doesn't matter

387
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:09,350
I call it infinite patience.

388
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,300
I am gonna be infinitely patient

389
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,970
when I lose, I just got better.

390
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,930
I love that you're firing me up right now

391
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,810
but you wrote one thing
that I will never forget.

392
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,010
And it was, it was about

393
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,262
I'm tired of people saying
'thank God it's Friday'.

394
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:23,630
- If you live for the weekends,

395
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,580
your shit is broken.

396
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,990
And people get upset with me,

397
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,446
like, no Gary, I want to
spend time with my family,

398
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,050
it's not all about working

399
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,190
and I'm like, no no you don't understand.

400
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,540
- I love this.

401
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,370
- If you literally start
your week being sad,

402
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,854
and it gets progressively better,

403
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:39,350
you have a problem.

404
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,815
We spend way too much time in our lives

405
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:44,760
doing our jobs.

406
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,830
I lived that life.

407
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,663
You have to understand,

408
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:49,390
I'm speaking from a
place of understanding.

409
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,860
I lived K through 12 in that life.

410
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,580
I lived, I'm a huge football fan.

411
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,480
The fall, school started,

412
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,950
and I was devastated after
the Jets game was over,

413
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,690
I would come from a huge high,

414
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,870
that Sunday, 'cause I
was pumped for the Jets

415
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,810
to this complete depression,

416
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,870
because I knew that Monday

417
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,900
I mean, I lived for snow days

418
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,733
for like a decade.

419
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,566
(laughs)

420
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,220
Like for a decade, the only
thing I gave a fuck about

421
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,765
was, please, can a nor-easter come through

422
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:17,334
and eliminate school?

423
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,030
(laughs)

424
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,863
- Right?

425
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:20,854
- I hated school
- I used to think

426
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:21,760
the same thing.

427
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,593
- Right?

428
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,426
- Snow days were awesome.

429
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:24,650
I mean, at school you're forced into.

430
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,483
- Yeah.

431
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:26,620
- But now, I don't.

432
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,250
And I'm like, my God,

433
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,930
do people really have jobs
the way I lived school?

434
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,678
Oh my God, most people do.

435
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,511
- Yeah.

436
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:34,344
- And that's

437
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,177
by the way, random thought,

438
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:36,595
breaking news, I'm
starting a Twitch channel.

439
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,078
- Yes!
- Wooo, yes!

440
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,013
- Are you kidding me?!

441
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:40,864
- Yeeeesss!
- Where can I find you?!

442
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,880
- I've been thinking about
this for like two years now,

443
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,713
maybe even three,

444
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:45,822
like Justin hit me up like fuckin'

445
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:47,824
I've been thinking about this
for like three or four years.

446
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,540
But here's what I have to do.

447
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,630
This is such

448
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,463
you know why I haven't done it?

449
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,933
I've done plenty of
Twitch stuff and hung out.

450
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,810
This is such a good set up,

451
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,760
I'm like, wait a minute,

452
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,742
why don't I turn my whole
office into a Twitch

453
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:58,575
- Why not?

454
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:00,232
I know who can build it.

455
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:01,065
- Who?

456
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:01,898
- We have someone.

457
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:02,731
- We have the master.

458
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:03,564
- We have it,

459
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:04,397
we'll give you his number.
- Is his name Rick?

460
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:05,230
- No.
- No.

461
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,063
- Sally?
- No.

462
00:14:06,063 --> 00:14:06,896
- Sean?
- No.

463
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,110
- Sean Mendes has been
playing the same song

464
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,150
for three years in a row,

465
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,753
and I think it's weird.

466
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:11,977
Can we talk about this?

467
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:12,810
- Who the hell is Sean?

468
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,643
What are you talkin' about?

469
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:14,660
- He's this great, by the way,

470
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,670
he's a really good kid,

471
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,550
from what everything I know

472
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,890
but he's been playing the same song

473
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,887
for three years, and it freaks me out.

474
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:23,210
Three fucking new years in a row,

475
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,550
Sean Mendes is on one of
the mainstream channels,

476
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,868
singing that fuckin' song.

477
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:27,701
- Yeah.

478
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,610
- Do you know what I'm talking about?

479
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,443
- I don't know who this guy is.

480
00:14:29,443 --> 00:14:30,276
- Baban,

481
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:32,437
can you guys fuckin' help
me get the chat, chat

482
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:33,880
can you guys agree with me?

483
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,713
Chat,

484
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:35,700
can you help me in this?

485
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,597
- Do you guys know who he is?

486
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:37,605
- His intro song?

487
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:38,438
- No he's like

488
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:40,760
Sean Mendes is like a
fuckin' huge fuckin' kid

489
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,010
he's like a good looking kid.

490
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,285
He's a singer, he's like nice boy

491
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,460
but he plays the fuckin' song.

492
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,901
And I'm like, I feel like
I'm living in Bizarro World

493
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:50,910
because he's like SNL,
and fuckin' New Years Eve,

494
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,400
and I'm like, didn't
he play that last year,

495
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,080
and that's fine, 'cause you
know how mainstream media

496
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,160
is weird and they're onto
shit that's been around

497
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,090
for a year.

498
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,087
But he's been doing it for three years.

499
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:00,920
- [Female] Same thing.

500
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,870
- You agree, right?

501
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,703
I'm right, right?

502
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:03,536
- I guess if it's working.

503
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,369
- [Female] Stiches.

504
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,202
- Stitches!

505
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:06,035
Fuckin' Stitches!

506
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,330
Temporary's right.

507
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,163
Temporary Jerry.

508
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:11,030
So this guy's short, annoying,
has terrible taste in musing,

509
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,780
we're all really gonna make millions.

510
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,970
See this is the part

511
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,050
that I like the most.

512
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,900
- I love this guy.

513
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,010
- No no really, I like Temporary Jerry

514
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,690
don't ban him, 'cause
I saw you ban somebody.

515
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,660
I love him.

516
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,440
Because this is the part
that I love the most, right?

517
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,474
For me, it's

518
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:29,900
this is why I think I'd be a
good baseball player, right?

519
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,860
Because in baseball, if you're
out seven out of 10 times,

520
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,914
you're fucking rolling.

521
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:34,747
Right?

522
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:35,580
- Hall of Famer.

523
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,443
- That's right.

524
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:39,710
It's weird to me that that excites me

525
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,490
so much

526
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,410
- When people doubt you?
- I love it.

527
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,900
I love it.
- I feed off of that too.

528
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,630
- You do, right?
- I feed off it so hard,

529
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,490
you tell me I can't
- I really needed

530
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,323
to hear that message

531
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,156
- You did, right?

532
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,030
- I needed that message tonight.

533
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,310
- See you just helped another person.

534
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,143
- Yeah, thank you.

535
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:52,976
- Look
- You came out here

536
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:53,809
and you helped me.

537
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:54,642
- Listen, you have a different dynamic.

538
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,060
We have our dynamics,

539
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,893
and what have you.

540
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,450
Put ourselves out there, we're out there.

541
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,110
Pretty girls have a whole 'nother layer.

542
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,943
- Yeah.
- Whole different.

543
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:03,010
- Whole different.

544
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,210
But it's still the same game,

545
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,470
which is you're either
inside your own head

546
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,859
or you're not.

547
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:08,740
Right?

548
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,390
That feeds me,

549
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,730
as much as somebody who says

550
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm the best or I'm the G.O.A.T.

551
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,153
And all that.

552
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:17,360
They all feed me weirdly the same way.

553
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,680
And I like it and I really
am trying to figure out

554
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,330
how to teach kids that.

555
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,230
Because there's a lot of
kids who aren't putting out

556
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,320
great content, aren't enjoying themselves,

557
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,470
aren't living.

558
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,112
Because they can't deal
with temporary Jerry55

559
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:32,910
saying that you're short,
you're ugly, you're fat,

560
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,500
you're stupid, you suck, fuck you.

561
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,780
And I'm trying to figure out

562
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,390
why do I hear that and say
two things which is like,

563
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,240
fuck,

564
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,460
I feel bad for temporary Jerry, like why

565
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,760
he must be in pain and I'd
like to become his friend

566
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,640
and make him awesome.

567
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,854
And two, fuck you, temporary Jerry,

568
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:49,330
motherfucker.

569
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,290
I'm gonna stick it in your fuckin' mouth

570
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,730
and I can't wait to meet you one day,

571
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,630
temporary fuckin' Jerry
and you're gonna be like,

572
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,680
yo I'm temporary Jerry I'm sorry.

573
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,262
- I love you Jerry.
- I like it!

574
00:16:58,262 --> 00:16:59,340
- You know?

575
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,173
- Yeah.

576
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:01,006
I'm reading his stuff,

577
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:02,539
what does this have to
do with the fact that

578
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,390
- I think it's about time
to wrap this up though

579
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,223
but we want to

580
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:06,319
- It's true, I'm supposed
to leave like a fuckin'

581
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,309
hour ago, why am I even here, Baban?

582
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,500
Get me the fuck out of here, bro!

583
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,333
What are you doing?

584
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,354
- Why are you leavin' him hangin' man?

585
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:13,186
- Dude, he's just like,

586
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,109
this is great for the vlog,

587
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,942
and I'm like,

588
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:16,170
I have to wake up in like an hour.

589
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,002
Fuck me!

590
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,149
Get me out of here, what?!

591
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,983
- Last thing,

592
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:21,440
let's hear about your book!

593
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,660
- It's really good.

594
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,900
Guys, you guys are smart.

595
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,930
Don't buy it, go steal
it off of Bit Torrent

596
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,480
and read it, and fuckin'
figure out how great it is,

597
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,430
because this is the greatest era to

598
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,280
talk about shit you love

599
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,340
and that's what I'd like you to do.

600
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,850
I'd really like you to read it.

601
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,400
Library, Bit Torrent, don't buy it,

602
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,233
I don't need it.

603
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,760
I just really need you to understand

604
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,260
what's actually fucking happening.

605
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,830
And what's actually happening is

606
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,210
the middleman is going away,

607
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,700
there are no gatekeepers.

608
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,210
It is you and the audience.

609
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,960
You need to talk about what you love,

610
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,910
'cause everything else
is too hard of work.

611
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,130
And if you're talented enough

612
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,710
and what you love is interesting enough,

613
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,578
you'll make between $1 a year and

614
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:56,571
fuckin' $40 million.

615
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:57,994
The fuckin' end.

616
00:17:57,994 --> 00:00:00,000
