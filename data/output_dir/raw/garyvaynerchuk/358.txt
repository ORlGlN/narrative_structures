'cause America will love it.

- You go by Nate or Nathan?
- No, Nathan.

00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:08,583

tell the vlog your name.

5
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,458
You go first.

11
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:29,383
Saba, I've been telling you.

("Sound Of The Gun" by Gallo)

13
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:26,417
This is nice and cozy.

14
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:28,959
The private plane is
gonna seduce me eventually.

15
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,652
I don't want to succumb.

16
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:32,545
I don't want to.

going to the Cowboys,

Jerry Jones, 
leadership off-site.

19
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:07,133
Should make a lot of you happy,

20
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,543
a lot of you mad.

I like him 'cause we
both hate the Giants.

23

Awesome, my friend.

25
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:41,681
Good, how are you?

26
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:43,161
Delaney Folley's around.

27

- [Man] Yeah, she 
is at the big house.

28

If you just follow 
this road on down,

29
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:47,906
you'll see the big house.

30
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,020
- [Gary] Thank you very much.

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,681
Got to go down to the big house.

32
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,983
Oh, that.

33
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,732
That makes a lot more sense.

34
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:59,264
Do more of like
vlog style today.

35
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,248
- [DRock] Okay.
- Do you know what I mean?

36
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,047
- [DRock] Yeah.

37
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,188
- More than like a
business video. You know?

38
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:02,922
- [DRock] Yeah.

39
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:05,186
- I mean obviously
we have to keep that.

40
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,083
- [DRock] Yeah, yeah.

41
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,736
- [Man 2] So have
you had a crazy week?

42
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:10,111
Have you've been
all over the place?

43
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:11,792
- Where were we Monday?

44
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,792
- [DRock] We were in L.A.

45
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,125
- Oh right, yeah. 
So, I was in L.A.

46
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,138
Had to do a red
eye which sucked.

47
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:17,875
It's been good, just busy.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,347
- You know? I think
only two or three weeks

49
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:23,083
a year do I get all
five days in New York.

50
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,115
- Right.
- So, it's pretty normal.

51
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:27,045
- Yeah.
- [Gary] Hell yeah.

52
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:29,250
Sure, I'm a big fan of that.

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,125
But you said a
very important part.

54
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,041
You said a five minute meeting.

55
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,041
(group laughter)

56
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,917
And it sounded like it
was something important

57
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:39,000
because what I'm not
scare of that, I love that.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,228
What I'm scared of is the
millions of one hour meetings

59
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:43,625
that could've been 17 minutes

60
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,500
that weren't
actually that important.

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,291
And they creep up.

62
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,708
And we're in
client services, right?

63
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,708
That's what we do for a living.

64
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,834
So that's all we
do for a living.

65
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,104
We don't go
practice on the field,

66
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:53,958
we don't go play.

67
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,117
That's what we do.

68
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:58,123
We have meetings, we strategize 
and then we produce stuff

69
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,860
to make something happen.

70
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,708
And so the amount of
ego on the creative side.

71
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,343
I mean, how many times opinion,

72
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,019
that wasn't blue enough.

73
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,602
The star's not big enough.

74
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:11,542
Right?
(group laughter)

75
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,240
- [Man 3] That
was good right there.

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
- It's unbelievable how I,

77
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,975
I only like this.

78
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:22,744
You know, this is the best.

79
00:04:22,744 --> 00:04:25,040
So, this is all I do. I do five
minute meetings with everybody

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,893
that works for me.
Duh-duh-duh-duh.

81
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,411
But when I think about somebody

82
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:32,109
I use technology as
the gateway drug to enable

83
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:33,992
the face to face to
be far more powerful.

84
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:36,875
If you literally are
just leaving the ranch,

85
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,802
you got to fly back,
you're prepping for draft.

86
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:41,097
You might think about something
about one of your guys,

87
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,407
if you lived the way I lived

88
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,435
you'd go into
Instagram DM them and say,

89
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,830
"Hey Rick, I'm
thinking about you.

90
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,720
"I'm excited about, 
Week 13 last week,

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,078
"you caught my
eye on something."

92
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:51,801
That changes, that
means the world to him

93
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,770
in his environment and then 
when you sit down with him

94
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,742
the first day of camp, 
you're already on

95
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:58,364
third and a half base, my man.

96
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,782
You're defining your
personal point of view on how

97
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:04,846
communication should
be done, in my opinion.

98
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,083
Right? Go read the
articles about why the

99
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,750
television was gonna be
destroying our society.

100
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,850
Why the telephone was
gonna destroy our society

101
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,723
'cause we were
gonna stop writing notes.

102
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:16,813
Your grandpappy's not thrilled

103
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:18,582
with the way 
that you interacted.

104
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:20,222
You should've went
over to the guy next door

105
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:22,861
and shake his hand and
talk to him, not call him.

106
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:25,640
We've always judged the
next generation's version

107
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,284
of how they communicate.

108
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,843
They're communicating more.

109
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,638
People think their
kids are less social,

110
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:31,619
they're more social.

111
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:33,470
Every indicator shows that.

112
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,107
What happened if you
were in a school that

113
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:36,847
you go bullied and
it wasn't nice and

114
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:39,069
you had no friends but
now you can go on Twitch

115
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:41,078
and play video games with the
people that have your interest.

116
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:44,740
You have an outlet. Can't
take the good with the bad.

117
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,914
And that's only, don't forget,

118
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,273
you're the judge and
the jury of that opinion.

119
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:50,447
I can tell you
'cause I'm spending

120
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:51,597
a lot of time with these kids,

121
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:53,834
they're closer to each
other 'cause of these things

122
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,273
because during the off-season

123
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,495
when they're in
different places.

124
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:59,657
I just unbelievably am

125
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:01,047
non-romantic about how

126
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:04,957
you and I grow up in
locker rooms versus how they do

127
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:07,106
because I'm just a
big believer that humans

128
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:09,145
are the greatest
animal of all time and

129
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,840
we adjust to our realities

130
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,568
and yeah, I just don't see it.

131
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:15,951
I think we're not
leveling it up enough

132
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,979
when we have this conversation

133
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,073
and, by the way, I'm a big shot
because I'm looking at big data.

134
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:24,473
I'm only sitting here
peacocking 'cause I'm seeing

135
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:27,526
the actual manifestation 
in a lot of places.

136
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,880
Efficiencies in warehouses,

137
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,398
I think you get a good vibe,

138
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:33,387
I run my business
like being a coach,

139
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:36,549
I love this stuff.
So, yeah, I think look,

140
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:39,272
I get it. Especially when 
you actually played and

141
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:41,112
you lived that version of it.

142
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:42,565
I'm empathetic to that.

143
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:45,258
I just think that, I think we'll
be pleasantly surprised.

144
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:47,987
- [DRock] What was a fun
takeaway from that whole thing?

145
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,277
For the vlog?

146
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:54,444
- You know, I think the...

147
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:56,551
First of all, it was
clearly a strong organization.

148
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:58,361
Makes sense.

149
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,458
Jerry's one of the strongest, 
most powerful owners

150
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,303
and super successful in business

151
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:05,628
and all that good jazz and 
so that didn't surprise me.

152
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:07,697
It's what I expected. 
Good people.

153
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:10,382
What I expected.

154
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,137
Only one fun takeaway,

155
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:15,583
it'll be fun to
play that, you know?

156
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,711
In the owner's
meeting in 30 years.

157
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,445
That's real cool, huh?

Bye bye.

Bye bye, take
care of yourself.

- Safe journey.

- [Gary] Alright, good.

Hello.

165
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,458
DRock, why are 
you so fancy now?

166

- I'm not.

got some cool Nikes.

169

You got super fancy.

170
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,542
You sold out bro.

171
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,583
- You're right, I did sell out.

- [DRock] Gary,
why are you so fancy?

174
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:16,912
- 'Cause I'm fancy, that's why.
(DRock laughs)

175

You can only hold off
the inevitable for so long.

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,291
- [DRock] I mean
you're gonna make it

177
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,750
all meeting the
entire time, you know that?

178
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,250
- No, listen, I mean, 
I'm not unaware

179
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,542
so many of you are like Gary,
why don't you go private more,

180
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:32,034
it saves time, I get it.

181
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:33,916
I get it, you know,
and especially when you go

182
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:34,917
to places like this.

183
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,625
Like if I'm going
to L.A., like, whatever.

184
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,291
But, like, when you're
going Springfield, Missouri

185
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,457
and you might
have to connect, or.

186
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,708
You have to make it
as efficient as possible.

187
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,961
Yeah, one brick at a time.

188
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,767
Not gonna own the New York Jets
and not have a private jet.

189
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,542
(DRock laughs)

190
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,583
I'm gonna drive to
the Cincinnati game.

191
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,166
- [DRock] Well, you know
like you said, you didn't

192
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,959
realize what comes along.

193
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,125
- Did not realize, yeah.

194
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,750
I still think that, for being
so smart, the fact that

195
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,542
I went from point A of
being a kid, a 20-year-old kid,

196
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:15,208
to owning the Jets, but
didn't realize private jets

197
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:19,333
and court side Knicks seats
were gonna happen in-between

198
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,083
that was a little naive.

199
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:27,189
Well, there's no
wifi, which sucks, so.

200
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,333
This is the
funniest part about me.

201
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,060
I use paper for my
fantasy baseball league.

202
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,542
Which everybody
makes fun of me for.

203
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,458
Which I make fun of myself for,
but I have a very hardcore,

204
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,603
like, system of how 
I draft and it's an auction.

205
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,291
And we did a DailyVee
last year in auction,

206
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,834
but we didn't explain it.

207
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,708
It was early,
people hated the episode.

208
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,708
I loved it, can't
wait to look back at it.

209
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,333
But we're really gonna bring
it this weekend for you guys.

210
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,236
It's gonna be an epic episode.

211
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,008
And some of the things that
happened here will manifest

212
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:11,834
themselves on
Sunday and I'm prepared

213
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:14,291
to win the whole league.

214
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,542
That's the best part.

215
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:17,893
- [DRock] Do you
consider yourself

216
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,904
romantic on using paper?

217
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:24,834
- No, I think
that's a good question.

218
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,834
It's not that I'm
romantic about it.

219
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:34,625
It's that speed is what
I value over everything.

220
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,875
You think I want to
stand here in a vlog

221
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,208
and be like, I use paper.

222
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,750
I care about speed even over
my own reputation and brand.

223
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,291
I'm faster than
typing and going to

224
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,166
I don't use Excel, Google Docs.

225
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,834
That's not how I roll.

226
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,896
So all those spread sheets that
you'll see everybody working

227
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:54,583
with going back and forth.

228
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,190
I think I'm going to
process faster

229
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,250
in this maneuver.

230
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,542
Like, I know how I want it
organized to make the decisions

231
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:06,208
because once you go
into auction, you know,

232
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:10,375
I don't need a shortstop, 
I have Correra locked in.

233
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:13,542
But I'm gonna need
a middle infielder.

234
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,667
And, like, I know how to
visually make this for myself.

235
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:19,417
And I don't know, I've just
never been somebody who natively

236
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,750
worked well in Excel sheets.

237
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:26,959
I'm ready.

238
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,000
("Next Move" by Rowlan)

239
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:53,245
Biggest thing for me it's just

240
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,065
like the stuff 
I talk about business.

241
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,278
As I collect the data,

242
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,278
it's more about fixing
the well, not the sink.

243
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:03,945
I'm thinking about
my overall strategy,

244
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:05,959
factoring in what Staats

245
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,162
and Zhang, Bobby
Glennen are gonna do.

246
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,291
And those are the
people that have a chance,

247
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,333
choice a little bit.

248
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,721
And then factoring in
what people don't have a chance

249
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:23,708
are gonna do to set
themselves up for 2018.

250
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:28,096
AJ, Brandon, Little Lou,

251
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:29,874
the four headed monster of Nate,

252
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,728
Tyler, Anthony Latino,

253
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:35,546
and CFO, Alan,

254
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,291
DeRosa's gonna do dumb shit.

255
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,542
Marcus is in the 
Office of the CEO.

256
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:46,302
He's one of the
smartest guys I know and

257
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:49,119
I disrespect him tremendously 
in fantasy baseball.

258
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:52,250
It's as if his brain works for
everything that's important

259
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,125
and not for those
things that are not important.

260
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,210
It's going to be
an awesome weekend.

261
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,626
You like that?

262
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:43,021
I hope everybody's
killing their Thursday

263
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:46,834
DRock and I just
went to Missouri and back.

264
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:50,000
Only 4:20 in New York, we've
already been to Missouri, DRock.

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,667
("Next Move" by Rowlan)

266
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,875
Alright, what's up Facebook?

267
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,863
As you guys know I don't use
my normal Facebook account

268
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:11,794
because I use my fan page page.

269
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:14,834
But, what's up, actually, 
I'd love to get some feedback.

270
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,397
I'm curious, who
actually sees this?

271
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,375
Leave a comment
please, I need to know.

272
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,875
I'm not even sure
who's seeing this.

273
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,875
My god, I'm seeing him
tonight for the wine event.

274
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,208
- [DRock] Really?

275
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,708
- Yeah. Nine years ago,
today, can you believe that?

276
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,917
- [DRock] No who is it?

277
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,148
Guy from Comcast.

278
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:36,500
How nuts is that?
- [DRock] That's awesome.

279
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,125
I haven't seen him
in like a long time.

280
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,570
God, I'm really
glad I did this studying.

281
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,208
I gotta admit, I didn't 
know a lot of people.

282
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,542
There's a lot, I'm like, 
who, who, who, who?

283
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,000
You know what's funny to read,
I've never read it before,

284
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,208
just never have the time, the
recap of the fantasy baseball

285
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,834
USA Today's leagues,
like who won and what?

286
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,583
Their traffic's really funny.

287
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,083
Now, but wait a minute, you're
scheduled seven to eight.

288
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,583
For the one hour interview 
at DRock Saturday night.

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,250
Come with me.

290
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,425
Now I'm just
doing shit on the spot

291
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:34,333
because it can be like four
months later and be like, right?

292
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,625
I've been doing that a lot more.

293
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,834
Can we find a 45 minute or
hour window either next week

294
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:43,792
or early next week
to jam with the (inaudible).

295
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,375
- [Man] Thanks man, 
appreciate it.

296
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,125
- What are you 22, 23?

297
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,208
- [Man] 29, I'm making 
us a little bit older.

298
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,248
- [Man 2] His beard is 22.
- Yeah that, his beard is 18.

299
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:13,781
- [Gary] This is
literally why our company

300
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,291
is going to go out of business.

301
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,875
You know I'm
pissed about meetings,

302
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,458
and every time 
I go into a meeting,

303
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,208
the first 17 minutes 
is this horse shit.

304
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,375
(group laughter)

305
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,291
- We just started.
- It's 5:34.

306
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,125
- [Gary] Right 4 minutes 
in already, horse shit.

307
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,750
Colin, sorry about the other
day. I'll see you next week.

308
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,085
- Okay.
- [Gary] Zhang!

309
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:34,291
The wifi was broken
on his private plane,

310
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,166
but I brought
paper just in case.

311
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,083
I did some real studying.

312
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:38,917
- [David] Paper research, wow.

313
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,250
- [Gary] I mean 
I have all the data.

314
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,603
- [David] This year you
have to do a lot more work

315
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,396
'cause you have so many
minor league draft picks

316
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:45,290
that are gonna
follow up the next year.

317
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,161
That was the one
thing I was curious about

318
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:49,432
'cause you never really
do the minor league draft.

319
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:53,444
- [Gary] Yeah, you're right.

320
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:55,708
Yes, I'm doing homework there.

321
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,542
I have five
picks now, not seven.

322
00:16:57,542 --> 00:17:02,415
But, no, but, 
no I have to really win.

323
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:04,125
This is my year. 
(group laughter)

324
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:08,250
No, no, this is my... 
(indistinct chatter)

325
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:11,083
I've given up, to his point,

326
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,083
I've given up two full
years to try to win this year.

327
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:19,092
Two years ago, two years ago,

328
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:21,501
I said I was going to
rebuild for two straight years

329
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:23,674
because it's so competitive

330
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:26,750
and it's 20 teams
that you kind of have to

331
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,132
I almost think. You have to make
three year commitments.

332
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,151
You're playing
it real interesting.

333
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:34,667
Your's is really interesting.

334
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:35,660
- [David] I'm playing 
for next year.

335
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,829
- [Gary] Are you?
- [David] Yeah.

336
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,274
- [Gary] That makes 
me upset actually.

337
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,373
(group laughter)

338
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:40,341
Is that true?
- [David] Yeah.

339
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:41,463
- [Gary] Fuck, that's not good.

340
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:42,583
Is that true?
- [David] Yeah.

341
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,727
- [Gary] Well, he
has eight draft picks.

342
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:47,458
And your five keepers were,

343
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,493
you know what's funny?

344
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:51,237
Honestly, I'm upset
because I thought you

345
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,852
were playing for this year and

346
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:54,390
didn't feel
great about your five.

347
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,732
Now, they could
all work out great,

348
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,423
but I didn't
feel great about them.

349
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:58,483
- [David] I'm
playing for next year.

350
00:17:58,483 --> 00:17:59,692
Wait until my
minor league draft.

351
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,941
My minor league
board is so set right now.

352
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:03,429
That's the only
thing I could study for.

353
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,120
- [Gary] So you're like really
got young kids on there.

354
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,893
Like the best 17-year-old.
- [David] Yeah.

355
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:11,435
- [Gary] Or whatever, right?
- [David] Yeah, exactly.

356
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,758
- [Gary] Fuck.

357
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,875
You're not
playing for this year.

358
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,002
- I play for every year.

359
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:16,715
- [Gary] But that's 
why you never win.

360
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:17,742
- [Marc] And you have?

361
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:19,815
- Melis, can you tell your boss

362
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:22,083
that he should not go
for it in fantasy this year

363
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,041
and he should try to
build for the future?

364
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,559
- [Marc] You're just lucky I
know there is fantasy this year.

365
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,458
- [Melissa] Why are
you trying to go for it?

366
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,258
- [Marc] Thank you, good job.

367
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:32,295
Give her a raise.
- [Gary] A raise, promotion.

368
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:34,577
You now work for her, Marc.

369
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,258
- [Melissa] Can I get an office?
- [Gary] Yep!

370
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,792
Let's interrupt
this scene for a second.

371
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,458
You're gonna
show me in my office,

372
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,568
hopefully that's there.

373
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:47,991
- [DRock] Yeah,
yeah that is there.

374
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,233
- [Gary] You're
gonna go back to it.

375
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,375
You're gonna circle it.

376
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,000
You're going to
back to me saying,

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,834
Tyler, say you're sorry.

378
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:56,542
Hey Tyler, say you
sorry to thrift shop hustler.

379
00:18:56,542 --> 00:19:00,625
- Hey Evilos, I'm so terribly
sorry I forgot to tag you

380
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,083
on the last episode.

381
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,127
We got to put
these things out quick

382
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:04,792
and sometimes
things just slip through.

383
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,333
I hope you're doing really well.

384
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,875
Amazing work, I won't
slip up next time. Peace.

385
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,665
And then we'll move on.
- [DRock] I love it.

386
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:14,539
("Next Move" by Rowlan)

387
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:41,322
- [Gary] Hey, what's going on?

388
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,600
What are you working on?

389
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,777
- [Iris] Your announcement.
- [Gary] Ah.

390
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:49,176
- [Iris] I'm really excited.
- [Gary] It's good, right?

391
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:50,598
- [Iris] Yeah.

392
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:53,039
- Yeah, it's gonna
have to be hardcore.

393
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,789
Nice pants.

394
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:57,711
Marcus, how's your
studying been going?

395
00:19:57,711 --> 00:20:01,208
- [Marcus] It was really
good like three weeks ago,

396
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,311
right after surgery
and now it's in shambles.

397
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:04,755
- [Gary] Perfect. 
(DRock laughs)

398
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:07,861
I've been sending
Marcus extra work.

399
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:10,345
I'm joking but we
have our fantasy draft.

400
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,438
The other night I
was like, you know what?

401
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:13,437
I bet you he's studying.

402
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:15,637
Marcus, immediately first 
thing tomorrow morning,

403
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:18,403
I need this 400 page deck.

404
00:20:18,403 --> 00:20:19,609
Claude is the only person who's

405
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,583
ever had a full
DailyVee about her

406
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,542
and look at her pants. 
Show the pants.

407
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,617
- [DRock] I know,
they're rad pants.

408
00:20:24,617 --> 00:20:28,009
Alan, have you been
studying for the fantasy draft?

409
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,667
- [Alan] Don't
need to, my friend.

410
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:30,875
(Claude laughs)

411
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,166
- You ever hear
walking into a buzzsaw?

412
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:33,834
(DRock laughs)

413
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,667
That's what Alan's about,
I can't wait for his face.

414
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,111
- I really put in some time.
- [Gary] You have?

415
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:39,959
(group laughter)

416
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,671
Alright, let's do this. 
Sorry Matt, Juliet,

417
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:44,125
I'm just getting very excited
for the draft on Sunday.

418
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,834
Let's do this.

419
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,020
("Next Move" by Rowlan)

420
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,185
Yeah, I felt like you forced it.

421
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,645
It wasn't there
the first year or two,

422
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:04,227
and I feel like
you forced it on this,

423
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:06,781
I'm not a pure New Yorker, just
want to remind everybody

424
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:08,001
I'm from a
different place slightly.

425
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,393
- [Nate] Don't say 
y'all in Arizona either.

426
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,250
- [Gary] Well then 
it's very fake.

427
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,435
- [Nate] It's 'cause my 
parents are from Texas.

428
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:13,491
My family's from Texas.

429
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,036
- [Gary] Here's the bottom line,

430
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:18,101
you know what's
funny about his laugh?

431
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,792
That was the first time he
actually bought into my thesis.

432
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,667
(Gary laughs)
That's what that was.

433
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,010
- [Marcus] (inaudible) 
but the emotion

434
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,085
behind it was interesting.

435
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,834
- [Gary] It was absolutely not
there for two years, three years

436
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,250
in New York and
then out of nowhere

437
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,250
you threw it in, somewhere

438
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,708
around the time 
Mickey was about to...

439
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,978
Yeah, yeah. That's right.

440
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:41,696
You just really
aren't a good guy.

441
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:42,777
It's as simple as that.

442
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:43,792
He never said it once for the

443
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:45,766
first three years 
he was around me.

444
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:48,853
- [Nate] I don't think you can
say that with 100% confidence.

445
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,236
- [Gary] You know what's funny,

446
00:21:50,236 --> 00:21:52,217
I know you very well. 
You know I'm right.

447
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:55,449
- [Nate] I don't think you, 
I've for sure said "y'all."

448
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:57,078
- [Gary] Somewhere
around the time Mickey was

449
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,233
heading to Chatt,
just so you know,

450
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,975
somewhere around the
time that Mickey was starting

451
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:03,683
to make his transition and he
started saying it more often

452
00:22:03,683 --> 00:22:06,020
'cause he was trying
to get back into practice,

453
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,772
Nate slipped one in and
tried to see what happened.

454
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:11,754
And I didn't call him out on it
'cause I remember thinking

455
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:14,264
he was maybe making a joke
'cause we could've stopped it

456
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:17,398
right then and there but nope.
- [Claude] But nope.

457
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:19,923
- [Gary] By the way, he's
still not consistent with it.

458
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,107
- [Nate] By the way, "y'all" is
much better than "you guys."

459
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,976
- [Marcus] Y'ins. Do that.

460
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,928
- [Gary] I say "y'all." 
(group laughter)

461
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:29,945
So much talent at Vayner.

462
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:32,935
Vinny's singing?

463
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:36,053
Corey what to you think?
- It's cool.

464
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:37,519
- [Gary] So was
that thumbs up, bro.

465
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,959
That was awesome. (laughs)

466
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:47,506
(DRock laughs)

467
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:49,807
- [David A] You like art?
- I love art.

468
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,375
When it's in sneaker form.

469
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,771
- Hey, I'm glad you could come.

470
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,744
- [Gary] I'm glad I made it.

471
00:22:53,744 --> 00:22:54,655
- One of those 
is actually for you.

472
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:56,321
She gonna surprise it to you.

473
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:58,120
- [Gary] Why'd
you ruin her surprise?

474
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,903
- I know.
- [Gary] What a bad guy!

475
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:02,077
- Sorry!
- [Gary] What a bad guy.

476
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,308
How are you? Hi.

477
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:09,186
Hey, hey, how are you?

478
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,800
How are you?

479
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:17,625
Yeah, I feel like if you
look deep into the blue...

480
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,625
Look at Lock, that's really good.

481
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:24,999
Do this again for my vlog

482
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,496
'cause America will love it.

483
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:29,871
- You go by Nate or Nathan?
- No, Nathan.

484
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:32,750
- [Gary] I want you to
tell the vlog your name.

485
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,500
You go first.
- Nathan Scherotter.

486
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,442
- Nathan Schoeffler.

487
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:36,272
- [Gary] One more time.

488
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:38,185
- Nathan Scherotter.
- Nathan Schoeffler.

489
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:39,190
- [Gary] One more time.

490
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,412
(group laughter)
Please just one more time.

491
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:42,625
- Nathan Scherotter.
- Nathan Schoeffler.

492
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:46,857
- [Gary] Okay, and now
for my Instagram story.

493
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,277

(DRock laughs)

497
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,708
Let's go.

498
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:06,697
Hey.

499
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,200
I love this.

500
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:16,121
How about
getting the whole scene?

501
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,763
Yeah, Vin!

502
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:21,488
- Oh, hey Gary.
- [Gary] Hey Vin.

503
00:24:21,488 --> 00:24:22,854
- Thank you for coming.
- [Gary] Good.

504
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:25,627
- [Vinny] Good to see ya.
- Great to see you, Vin.

505
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:26,328
- [Tyler] Do we want--

506
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:28,584
- [Gary] Just get as much in 
the background as possible.

507
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:30,569
Thanks guys.
- Thank you.

508
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,706
- [Gary] Or Bone
Thugs 'N Harmony.

509
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,602
Should give back to the 
company a little bit, don't I?

510
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:42,916
It's given you so much.

511
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,458
So here's...

512
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,750
Oh so that's huge, great, so
here's what I would go with.

513
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,875
I would go with, the
current state of CMOs are

514
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,490
architects but
not practitioners,

515
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,458
I was groomed at
a place like that.

516
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,250
I know you guys have
some context for that,

517
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,750
but let me tell you the things
that I would have needed.

518
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,333
I think you really
have to play to, you know,

519
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,792
I know that you guys haven't
worked with Vayner or Gary,

520
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:16,250
the one thing
that he's good at is,

521
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,708
even though he's in outer
space, all the way up there,

522
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,208
he still knows, he knows,

523
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:23,667
he knows the little details
of hashtags and this and that,

524
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,375
and that's the future of CMOs

525
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,834
and that's how I'm being built.

526
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,333
To be able to do
a Super Bowl spot,

527
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,333
or a single post
on musical.ly that are

528
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,458
both effective
for the dollar amount.

529
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,291
Heading to a dinner
that I put together.

530
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:40,291
Random wine dinner with some
clients and friends and leaders

531
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,750
and so, should be a lot of fun.

532
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,667
Looking to do more of that to,

533
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,166
as my world gets bigger.

534
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,750
Instead of being
one of the guests,

535
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,250
maybe being the
host of these dinners

536
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,667
and helping people
collide into each other

537
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,625
and maybe do some stuff,

538
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,959
so should be fun.

539
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,875
Looking forward
to that, gonna be

540
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,542
there in a minute.

541
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,291
Got back from Missouri, 
fun day, it's like

542
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,750
it's almost like
living three lives, right?

543
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,708
Like, you know,
seems like yesterday

544
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:06,625
that I was in front of
the Cowboys' leadership.

545
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:09,542
Got back, worked
on some re-org stuff,

546
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,375
got a lot going on at Vayner,

547
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,667
bunch of stuff
going on at Vayner.

548
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,208
Just offense, offense, offense,

549
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,417
just never settle,
never settle, never settle.

550
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,583
Enjoying that.

551
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,166
That was the majority of that.

552
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,166
Anything else I did there?
- [DRock] Art show.

553
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,417
Oh, I stopped by the art show.

554
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,875
It was great to see
Vayner culture doing it's thing,

555
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,792
just love them
loving each other.

556
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,458
That's probably the
best thing I can say,

557
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,792
and then just

558
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,041
having a conversation with
somebody and just talking about

559
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,166
architect and
plumbing, you know.

560
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,041
Literally what I said,
it's real, like, right?

561
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:41,208
Like, are you
capable of planning

562
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,291
the media and
distribution of the Super Bowl

563
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,500
and the support
around it, campaign?

564
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,792
That's a $20 million campaign,

565
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,208
and are you capable to
post something on musical.ly

566
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,333
with a picture that
might cost $700

567
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,208
and understand
every little nuance

568
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,875
that you can put
in there, much like

569
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,792
The #AskGaryVee Show 
that you just saw

570
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,625
about the nuances of
titles and thumbnails,

571
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:01,542
or all the things that
we do on a daily basis.

572
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,125
I really genuinely believe that,

573
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,500
that's why I use the
architect and the mason, right?

574
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,750
Person designs a home, 
but can he actually,

575
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,417
you know, put the brick and
the cement on it and place it?

576
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:11,375
Like, are you that good?

577
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,083
Are you
strategic and executional?

578
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,000
Can you go way up in the
clouds and be in the dirt?

579
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,417
It is a life philosophy,

580
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,875
it is definitely a
marketing execution philosophy,

581
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,375
it is why I'm winning.

582
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,417
It's, you know,

583
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:25,458
it's ego, it's humility, right?

584
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:28,741
It's micro-fast, it's macro-slow.

585
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:33,000
It's Super Bowl, it's a
single post on Instagram.

586
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,834
Pulling from
opposite directions.

587
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,252
That's where the magic is.

588
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:42,458
- [DRock] Clouds and dirt.
- Clouds and dirt mother fucker.

589
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,667
[Gary Voiceover] I full 
believe, I am bought in

590
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,291
that there's an ROI here.

591
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,917
I don't need the reports. 
I don't need Nielson's,

592
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,333
I don't need seven years later.

593
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,625
If you need the
life where you were

594
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,166
gonna do something 
nice for somebody

595
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,500
just based on
what they were gonna

596
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,166
do nice for you
in return right then,

597
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,917
that wouldn't be a cool world.

598
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,458
But the truth is
the best relationships

599
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,583
are the ones where
you give them something

600
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,750
and then you start
forming a relationship

601
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,542
that then may
benefit you somewhere

602
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,750
along the line in the future.

603
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,750
Got it?

604
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,083
Awesome sauce!

605
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,083
Adam Howser,

606
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,792
one of the best
operators in the business.

607
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,500
- [Man 2] Howser's in the
kitchen fuckin' makin' it.

608
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,208
That was made by Adam.

609
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,875
You look buff.

610
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,291
- Not bad, right?

611
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,333
- Dude, I have
something crazy to show you.

612
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,834
- Yeah, what you got?

613
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,834
- This literally pops up

614
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,625
in my Facebook today.

615
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,125
- Aaah!

616
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,041
Dude.

617
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:48,033
- [Gary] Nine years ago today.
(group laughter)

618
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,268
How sick is that?

619
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:50,708
- It was meant to be.

620
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,667
- [DRock] Is that 
the craziest thing?

621
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:52,542
- That's meant to be.

622
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:53,750
Oh, that's awesome.

623
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,750
I was lookin' for
my wristband, man.

624
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,083
- Kim, why don't
you start us off.

625
00:28:59,083 --> 00:28:59,917
- Sure.

626
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:03,333
- Who you are and
a little, a fun fact.

627
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,667
A New York Jets fact please.

628
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,667
- No.

629
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:06,702
I have zero.
- [Gary] I know.

630
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:08,208
She's a Bills fan.

631
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,677
- Bills beat the Jets
and knocked them out of

632
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:12,166
the Playoffs.

633
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,767
- Two years ago.
That's a long time ago.

634
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,083
- Stories, like I--

635
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,834
- [Gary] Your daughter's
the coolest person I know,

636
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:17,750
and I haven't met her yet.

637
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,291
But just from your stories.

638
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,208
- It's true, it is true.

639
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,250
- [Gary] Including, 
I was at a meeting

640
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,500
with Sue the
other day on a call,

641
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I was talking
about an up and coming

642
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,291
hip hop artist named Logic, and,

643
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,750
I said it so fast,
but this is how Sue rolls.

644
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,208
Literally, by the
time I hung up the phone,

645
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,291
I had a text back
from her, which was

646
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,458
a screenshot of a
text that she sent

647
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,166
to her daughter
during the call, she's like,

648
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,708
"Do you know who Logic is?"

649
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:42,458
And she was like,
"Mom! He's the best,

650
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,667
"that's why I'm going to
like Jingleball or whatever."

651
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,173
- Gov Ball.
- Gov Ball, right.

652
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:46,333
- Oh my god!

653
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,834
- How old is she?

654
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:50,625
- Seventeen.

655
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,917
- Lifelong Jets fan.

656
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,625
- [Gary] Guys, I
have a real fun fact.

657
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,959
This is straight truth.

658
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,917
VaynerMedia exists
because of this guy,

659
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:00,959
and I'm not kidding.

660
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,986
This is real.
I forgot it actually,

661
00:30:02,986 --> 00:30:04,166
and when I saw him at South-By,

662
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,041
we were having a meeting and I,

663
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,500
it triggered
and I told it to the

664
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,625
eight or nine people there.

665
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,583
When I was in a transition and

666
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,417
started really realizing 
the world was moving

667
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:17,875
and AJ was four or five
months away from graduating

668
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,774
college, we were still
debating what we were gonna do.

669
00:30:20,774 --> 00:30:23,625
And the finalists were,

670
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,792
actually this guy probably 
fucked me up a little bit,

671
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,375
let me explain why.

672
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,417
The finalists were,

673
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,333
the finalists were

674
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,500
a site that basically
would've probably been

675
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,166
Groupon or Living
Social, very similar,

676
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:42,959
or we were gonna go
very hard into fantasy sports

677
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,667
and build out the
fantasy sports world.

678
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:47,291
And this is, you know, 
ten years ago, right?

679
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:51,250
But, I got an email
from him and his crew

680
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,750
at ABC ESPN Disney,
like, where were you?

681
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,792
What was it?
- Disney.

682
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:56,625
It was Disney.

683
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,542
- [Adam] Yeah, it was Disney.

684
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:59,291
And we, they said come in,

685
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,667
and do like a day or a
couple hours or consulting.

686
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,291
And this is when I first started
getting paid for speaking.

687
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,792
And I was like, wait a minute,
I should charge for this.

688
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:09,750
And they were like,
"How much do you want?"

689
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,917
And I was like,

690
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:14,417
"$5,000 the hour!"

691
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:17,500
And they were like,
"Okay, great, send the invoice."

692
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,166
- [Adam] I think Bernie laughed.

693
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,561
- Yeah.
- [Adam] Bernie first laughed.

694
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:23,041
- Laughed, yeah,
that's exactly right.

695
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:25,208
So I came, I came in, we hung,

696
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,750
Bernie who I
still talk to, Rohan,

697
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,667
like, great crew
of guys and gals.

698
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,083
I left, I go downstairs, 
I call AJ.

699
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,333
This is just straight
up what happened, I go,

700
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:38,166
"Hey, maybe we should
start a consulting agency firm."

701
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,625
That's literally what happened.

702
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,542
It's crazy.

("Demons" by Rowlan)

704
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,125
- We're on this big
ship and we're gonna turn,

705
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,708
we'll have partners that'll
turn us in the right direction.

706
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,542
My analogy has
completely shifted.

707
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,125
Now it's like,
we built this field,

708
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,917
we built this game,
let's call it football.

709
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,041
- [Gary] I like football.

710
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,041
- We have our uniforms, 
we have our outfits,

711
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,375
we have really cute outfits.

712
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,583
We have a ball, they
came up with the rules,

713
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,083
we have the
Super Bowl like every year.

714
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,959
One day we wake up
and we get to the field

715
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,959
and it's a whole new
thing, it's basketball.

716
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:03,000
And we, our
quarterbacks can't dunk.

717
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,000
So that rate of change, that's
a very different scenario

718
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,417
than just the evolution, 
of turning the ship.

719
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:10,417
- [Gary] And 
I will say something,

720
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,959
who's lucky enough to
play in different fields.

721
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:14,792
What's happening on the
consumer products level has a

722
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,339
- [Man 3] CT is different.
- Very different.

723
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:17,333
- Their technology--

724
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,208
- [Gary] And you guys
have done some very smart stuff

725
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,750
that has put you in
a very good position.

726
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,208
This world, you have
channel conflict coming,

727
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,375
DTCs coming, last mile's getting

728
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,083
very close to getting solved,

729
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,834
brands are getting commoditized.

730
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,917
Let's remember one
thing that is amazing.

731
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:36,500
What I am completely 
blown away by,

732
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,792
actually I'd love
to ask this question.

733
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:42,125
I am stunned how few
people actually run a business.

734
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,458
One of the things that's
really running through my mind

735
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,083
as I'm starting to
really play with tycoon, yeah.

736
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,875
- [Man 3] We were
just talking about that.

737
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:49,708
- Is that right?

738
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:52,417
Like I'm getting goosebumps
'cause when I say to myself,

739
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,583
how many people
are actually running

740
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:56,625
(censored)?

741
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:59,708
Like you can start
getting into like, seven.

742
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:01,500
Like, you can start,

743
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,834
and so what happens is,

744
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,458
I have this
huge analogy of like,

745
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:07,458
companies are
based on the players.

746
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:11,250
The Lakers are really good when
Magic and Shaq are playing.

747
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,250
And they're really
bad when they're not.

748
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,308
And so for me, one of the things

749
00:34:15,308 --> 00:34:17,833
that I'm really
fascinated by is,

750
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:20,041
these two I have a
ton of confidence in

751
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,947
because I know
the persons or person

752
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:25,207
that is actually running shit.

753
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:28,500
And I think
everything stems from that,

754
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,512
and it all trickles down,

755
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:32,958
and that's just
the straight truth.
