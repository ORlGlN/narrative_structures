1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- What's up, what's up?

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:01,952
Alright, let's see what's going on.

3
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:05,020
You know, Rowlan just gave you some love.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,425
Meanwhile, he puts
DRock's name in the song.

5
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,448
"Babin" rhymes with a lot of stuff!

6
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:10,643
"Stabbin'"...

7
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,207
We gotta hit up 21 Savage.

8
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:14,411
♫ I said I'm D. Rock with the lyrics

9
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,566
♫ I shoot everything walking

10
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:17,006
♫ I'm all precision, bad decisions

11
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:18,526
♫ Taught the language I'm talking

12
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:19,502
♫ I'm chalking white lines

13
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:21,445
♫ For the labels who said
I'll never turn heads

14
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:22,932
♫ The type of dudes I leave on seen

15
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:24,890
♫ Cause they once left me on read

16
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,473
(slow piano musical intro)

17
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,935
(upbeat hip hop music)

18
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:41,018
(laughs)

19
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:07,900
- So I just posted...

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,978
First of all, what's up?

21
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:11,251
Wednesday morning...

22
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:16,064
Happy New Year to all my
Jewish friends out there.

23
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:18,797
Wednesday morning, just landed, 11:41.

24
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:20,933
Got a ton of sleep, you
probably saw the little

25
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:24,562
grainy video that I made on the flight.

26
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:27,447
Couldn't sleep last night. (clears throat)

27
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:28,864
Did a lot of work in the hotel room,

28
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:31,714
so mainly slept on this flight.

29
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:33,813
Pretty uneventful...

30
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:36,763
Pretty uneventful flight,
just got some Z's in.

31
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,172
I have like 7 to 13
substantial business fires,

32
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,685
which rarely happens,
maybe 7 nights a year...

33
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,547
Effect me enough that I need
to address it right away.

34
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:47,942
I couldn't, aka sleep,
and one of the reasons

35
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,749
I sleep so well is 'cause
I only focus on positivity.

36
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:52,461
I don't let my head go,
and it was interesting...

37
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:55,211
As I wasn't able to sleep
and then jumped into work,

38
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,501
I'm like, "Oh shit, this is what happens

39
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,400
to everybody around everything."

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,315
And no wonder nobody fucking sleeps.

41
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:01,859
(laughs) Everybody's staying up at night.

42
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:03,183
I'm telling you...

43
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,493
And by the way, the reason I'm
already in a good mood just

44
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,814
you know, 12 hours later,
or 24 hours later, is...

45
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:10,233
Positivity always wins.

46
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,816
Like, I'm obsessed.

47
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:15,100
Why do I start this episode
or end this episode,

48
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,219
however you're doing it, with this rant?

49
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,830
It's because I really think
mindset is everything,

50
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,854
and so you've gotta really decide...

51
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:24,370
Are you gonna be positive about things,

52
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,275
or negative about things?

53
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:28,875
Am I thrilled that I have the
ability to do things about it

54
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,699
to make what I'm worried about better?

55
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,191
Or am I crippled by
"Shit, there's like these

56
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,681
seven things I need to fix tomorrow?"

57
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:37,024
I always choose positivity.

58
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,407
I look at other people around me,

59
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,717
it's not just about me, that are winning.

60
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:41,127
They choose positivity.

61
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,245
I look at the people around
me that are not winning,

62
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:45,220
that are not progressing,
that are not advancing.

63
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,712
They're choosing negativity.

64
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:48,487
It's stunningly binary.

65
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:50,297
It's stunningly black and white.

66
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,214
It's stunningly A or B.

67
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,645
This is really up to you, and really...

68
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:57,567
To be very honest, to be
very frank, I think the

69
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,673
biggest impact I'm having
as I read all the emails

70
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:02,484
'cause I read a lot of
them last night, as well,

71
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:05,564
is shifting that mindset and
getting people into that,

72
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:07,836
and making them understand
that they're in charge of that

73
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:10,965
and hacking and trying to
pour out the negativity...

74
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,235
Dump a negativity, add a positivity,

75
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,165
dump a negativity, add a positivity,

76
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,951
dump a negativity, add a positivity.

77
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,092
I'm a positivity to your world.

78
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:23,906
That's what I'm pushing, that's my agenda,

79
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:25,556
and that's why I think
you're feeling the effects.

80
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:27,238
And I think you need to find more of that

81
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:28,805
in your partner, in your loved one,

82
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,411
in your business partner,
in your audience.

83
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,331
So many people get 49
comments, 48 are phenomenal,

84
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,077
one's like, "You're a piece of shit,"

85
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:39,795
and they spend 80% of their
time on that one comment.

86
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,456
Please choose positivity.

87
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,789
Fuck negativity.

88
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:52,801
Instagram, good morning.

89
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,977
Good morning, good morning.

90
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:56,911
Hello, everybody.

91
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,356
I had a few minutes, here.

92
00:03:58,356 --> 00:04:01,867
Caught up on work, so I
figured I'd say "What's up."

93
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,394
60 Second Club, good to see you.

94
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,365
Also, while I've got a thousand of you...

95
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:08,417
October 9th, Columbus Day...

96
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,633
Actually, vlog, for you guys
as well, let's do this double.

97
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:15,433
October 9th, Columbus Day,
charity wine event in New Jersey.

98
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:18,765
Get your Ubers Connecticut,
New York, and Pennsylvania.

99
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:22,431
Get your party buses
if you've got friends.

100
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:24,304
Unbelievable day. I'll put
a link here in YouTube.

101
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:26,901
For everybody here, go to winelibrary.com.

102
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:30,118
Right on the top, it's the top
banner on mobile and desktop.

103
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:31,511
The Super Tasting.

104
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,234
All the proceeds goes to the
Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

105
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:35,656
Obviously means a lot to me and my dad

106
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:38,112
'cause AJ has Crohn's Disease.

107
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,406
I will be there.

108
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:40,871
A lot of people have
been trying to figure out

109
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,427
how to get a selfie or hang out with me.

110
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:45,091
This is $100 way, and with the $100

111
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:47,229
you get to taste 700 wines.

112
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:48,361
It's a ridiculous night.

113
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:49,380
Babin, you're coming?

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,288
- [Tyler] Yeah, I get off at (inaudible)

115
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:51,155
- Everybody's coming, kinda, right?

116
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:52,287
- I think so.
- From Team Gary?

117
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,225
- It's phenomenal, remarkable.

118
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,978
I really, really, really, really
want you there, Instagram.

119
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:59,305
Appreciate all the hearts
that are coming right now.

120
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:01,214
The Super Tasting, make sure you're there.

121
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:03,357
It's going to be lit.

122
00:05:03,357 --> 00:05:06,078
Just wanna take two last seconds
before I sign off right now

123
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:07,619
'cause I just got a text that

124
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,806
I have to address back at the office...

125
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:12,521
This community means
the fucking world to me.

126
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,635
Your likes and comments are my oxygen.

127
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:19,210
If you're not subscribed
to the vlog, get on it.

128
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,736
We're really crushing Daily Vee,

129
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:24,384
and please keep tagging your
friends on the comments.

130
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:27,106
All this new awareness
just keeps feeding me.

131
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:28,921
(makes gobbling sounds)

132
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:31,188
I don't need your money,
I need your stuff.

133
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:33,480
I just appreciate your attention,

134
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,901
the admiration, and your time.

135
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,402
Means the absolute world to me.

136
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:39,493
(kissing sounds)

137
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:40,326
(photo shudder sounds)

138
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:43,743
(reflective piano music)

139
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:46,804
And I'm just completely refocused

140
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,304
and focused on that right now.

141
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,411
Period.

142
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:53,491
It's already over.

143
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,324
It's already over.

144
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,507
It's already over the, like, initial push

145
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,005
of, like, being one of those brands.

146
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:00,021
Now it's gonna be who's best,

147
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,917
and that plays out over
the next 24 months.

148
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,983
And to be very frank with you, Ryan,

149
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:07,733
I'm so obsessed with audio
and being a player in that.

150
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,842
Like, there's a lot of things
running through my mind.

151
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:11,531
I'm just really looking at finances.

152
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:14,492
What I can afford, how can I do it?

153
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,663
Listen, I wanna get
together with you ASAP,

154
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:18,596
and like, give you my full braindom.

155
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:19,429
You're gonna be fired up.

156
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:22,039
We're gonna be fucking
crushing, but it's gonna be...

157
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,475
Like, I need to do all the things that

158
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:25,170
I need to do over the next six, three...

159
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,962
Four to six months to
feel good about offense.

160
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:29,251
Make sense?

161
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:30,501
Just got done with a quick call

162
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:33,668
with Ryan Harwood, CEO of PureWow.com.

163
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:37,564
Very amazing modern-day media company,

164
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,981
publisher in the female demo.

165
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,060
Enjoying working with him.

166
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,137
Great dude, we're about to
hit our one year in January.

167
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:48,057
Very focused on Vayner
X, not just VaynerMedia.

168
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:49,647
The publishing world is super exciting.

169
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:53,064
(reflective piano music)

170
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:58,846
(inaudible mumbling)

171
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:06,099
(calm hip hop music)

172
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,787
I'm just gonna read a quick YouTube,

173
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:12,318
and let me leave you with
this little YouTube comment.

174
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:13,686
Make sure you're commenting, crew.

175
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:15,208
Wanna get you guys on the show.

176
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,063
291 just got put up a little bit ago.

177
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,598
Let's see...

178
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:20,979
Let's see what's going on.

179
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,470
Ah, first comment, "I just turned 29.

180
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,243
This whole 'close your eyes
until 29' is incredible.

181
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:28,259
Super excited about it."

182
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,826
"Just turned 25, young as fuck."

183
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:32,284
Yes you are, Matt Loberstein.

184
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:35,261
"But geeze, the kid who asked
me for advice is, like, 16.

185
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,981
The fact that you're thinking
about entrepreneurship

186
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,306
at that age is so incredible."

187
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:39,889
"Daily Vee is the reason
I started my own channel.

188
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,268
Thanks, Gary."

189
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:42,599
I'm going through a
really interesting time.

190
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,201
You know, it's Jewish New Year now.

191
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:45,682
Reset.

192
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,769
Some of us are able to reset twice a year

193
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,037
(laughs) with New Year's.

194
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:50,448
Actually all of us, with our different

195
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:51,548
religions and things of that nature.

196
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:53,440
Anyway, nonetheless... (claps)

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,552
I'm becoming unbelievable critically...

198
00:07:55,552 --> 00:08:00,026
Unbelievably critical and
auditing myself on a daily micro,

199
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:02,596
but I'm very passive and all
bought into myself at a macro.

200
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:05,090
This continues to be my theme, right?

201
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,167
Micro speed, macro patience.

202
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,164
I just...

203
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:11,817
If I could do anything right
now, in this whole 29, 21...

204
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:14,005
All these themes that I'm telling you.

205
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:17,588
Too many of you are
judging yourself daily,

206
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:21,161
and that's coming at the expense of

207
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,055
being patient at a high level.

208
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:24,485
Excuse me, too many of you are...

209
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:26,511
I'm sorry, start that again
and keep it this way, Babin,

210
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,205
'cause I like the stream of thought.

211
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,481
Too many of you are being passive daily,

212
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:32,423
but judging yourselves by the years.

213
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,787
I'm the reverse.

214
00:08:33,787 --> 00:08:36,283
I'm judging myself every
minute, here, right now.

215
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,611
Like, I just let that phone call go by,

216
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:38,639
and I'm like "What did I just miss?"

217
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,491
Like, every second, hyper.

218
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:43,119
But I'm patient at the
macro, which makes me happy.

219
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,073
That's kind of, like...

220
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:46,912
I'm trying to really get this out of me.

221
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:49,791
Like, daily daily daily speed,

222
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,491
yearly yearly yearly patience.

223
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,460
There's something here,
my friends, that is at

224
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,901
the core of my success that
I'm trying to pass to you.

225
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:59,524
And in this shortened episode,
I'm just gonna leave you

226
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:03,166
with that unbelievable
passionate push one more time.

227
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,401
I know this is probably gonna
be a series of three rants,

228
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,047
please fucking figure this out.

229
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,040
There's something here.

230
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,123
(calm hip hop music)

231
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:21,016
"Babin" rhymes with a lot of stuff!

232
00:09:21,016 --> 00:00:00,000
"Stabbin'"...
