1
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,834
(audience applause and cheers)

2
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:06,834
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,133
- Thank you, thank you.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,367
Schmarvard.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,867
Good afternoon San Diego.

6
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,200
(audience cheers)

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,767
So I have a new book coming
out called AskGaryVee mainly

8
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,367
because the truth is,

9
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,667
I really don't even
want to speak right now.

10
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,567
I just want to go
directly into Q & A

11
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:39,967
because I can pontificate

12
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:42,400
my theses all day long on stage

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,934
and have for a long time
in my career at this point.

14
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:47,100
But the truth is, I think
it's far more interesting

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,100
to actually start
answering practical questions

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,533
that a lot of people
here are trying to deal with.

17
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,367
So I'm going to
spiel a little bit

18
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:56,166
but I'm going to go
into Q & A for quite a bit.

19
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,900
I asked for a
little bit more time.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,233
So hopefully some
of you can push back

21
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,400
your dinner reservations

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,300
'cause I wanna
kinda sit on that chair

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,566
and answer your questions.

24
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,367
Another quick request,
I know you're probably filming

25
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,433
but is there any way to turn
down the lights a little bit

26
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,867
and turn up the room
lights so I can see faces?

27
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:13,600
And if not I totally get
that if you guys can't do it,

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,967
but that'd be awesome.

29
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:17,500
So what do I want to talk about?

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,333
Look I think that there's a lot
of things we can talk about.

31
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:25,066
Number one I think
that I like social media.

32
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:26,900
Or how many of you are familiar

33
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,900
that over the
last three to six weeks

34
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,500
I've become a 14-year old girl,

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,266
and am completely obsessed
with Snapchat by show of hands?

36
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:35,667
(audience chuckling)

37
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,834
Cool, actually raise 'em
higher I just wanna get a sense.

38
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,700
So first thank you
all for paying attention,

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,333
second of all, what a lot
of you are probably trying

40
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,800
to figure out is,

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,400
where do I sit on Snapchat,
why has it become so fierce?

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,300
My life and my career and
the reason I think I can buy

43
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,367
the New York Jets is
predicated on one core talent.

44
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:00,266
I actually think that
I suck shit at 99% of things

45
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:02,934
but there's one thing
that I do extremely well

46
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:06,667
that luckily for me
ends up making me successful

47
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,166
which is I've got a
good sense of what you're

48
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,166
gonna do before you
think you're gonna do it.

49
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,533
Right, so, my first
success happened in 1996.

50
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,000
In 1996 when 
I launched WineLibrary.com,

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,567
I launched one 
of the first e-commerce

52
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,500
wine businesses in America.

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
You know, there's
a lot of youngsters.

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,266
As a matter of fact, how
many people by show of hands,

55
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,900
I know you're getting
tired later in the day

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,433
but don't bullshit
me, just give it to me.

57
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:34,300
How many by show of hands
remember the world pre-internet?

58
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,166
Raise your hands.

59
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,367
Nice, so there's some
old fuckers in here like me.

60
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,166
(audience laughter)

61
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:45,433
So if you went back there,
if you guys remember,

62
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,667
what I remember,
literally people told me that

63
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,367
the internet was
a fad, literally.

64
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,700
Like, this wasn't going to last

65
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,800
and what is this

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,934
and literally the
first time I ever pitched

67
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:59,133
WineLibrary.com, the
first person that asked me

68
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:02,100
how I was going to deliver wine
through the internet thought

69
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,233
that I was going to
take a bottle of wine

70
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:06,667
and put it in a wire
and it was going to show up

71
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,367
at somebody's house.

72
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,367
So like, this is
where we were kids,

73
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:12,767
back in '96, people were
trying to figure it out.

74
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,800
What I knew was that
people were going to buy wine.

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,333
How many people here
have done wine online?

76
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,767
How many people here have
done e-mail marketing

77
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,500
in their careers?
Raise your hands.

78
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Great, in 1997 
I had a

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
800,000, excuse me,

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,533
in 1997 I had a 200,000
person e-mail newsletter,

81
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:38,333
for WineLibrary.com
that had 91.2% open rates

82
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,266
and 67% click through.

83
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,600
By the way, not 'cause
I'm so fucking special.

84
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,533
It's because nobody fucking
did e-mail marketing in 1997

85
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,100
and we hadn't, we hadn't
ruined e-mail yet.

86
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,200
Like e-mail was fucking pure,

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,900
guys people loved
fucking e-mail in 1997.

88
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,433
(audience laughter)

89
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,100
We read every fucking word.

90
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,834
It was good and then
we fucking came along

91
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:07,033
and ruined that shit

92
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,900
and basically all
I'm doing right now is

93
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,266
systematically figuring
out how to ruin Snapchat.

94
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,633
And when I say ...

95
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:17,300
(audience laughter and applause)

96
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,600
Fuck I really
want these lights down

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,867
because your faces are legit,

98
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:25,166
that's why I'm
doing this, sorry.

99
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,533
When I say ruin, I mean,
what I really believe,

100
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,767
more than anything,
this whole spiel of branding

101
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:33,767
versus DR,
conversion versus that.

102
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,066
Yeah, I'm really fascinated.

103
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,433
I wish I could
talk to every one of you

104
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,433
because you're
anywhere from 100 and zero

105
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:41,033
to the reverse of 100 and zero.

106
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:45,800
For example my
clients Toyota, Pepsi, Dove,

107
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,934
you know the
biggest brands in the world

108
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,333
that drive my business right?

109
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,967
Our clients have to pay

110
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,633
$60,000 to $70,000
a month for us

111
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,400
to do their social media right?

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
But they're biggest brands,

113
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,633
we're not
looking for local stores,

114
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,133
you know these are
companies that are paying me

115
00:04:58,133 --> 00:04:59,367
a $100,000,
 $200,000 dollars a month.

116
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,967
Not only for
strategy and account work

117
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,233
but the producing of the
content, the paid strategy.

118
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,667
Real fucking work,
things that they do on TV

119
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,066
and other places.

120
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:11,033
They go on the spectrum of
branding extremely far, right?

121
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:13,200
They think it's all branding,
they don't even know

122
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,100
if they're converting.

123
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,166
My Mountain Dew
client doesn't know

124
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,667
if their TV spot
during the Super Bowl

125
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,400
or that picture on
Instagram is really

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,367
selling all the way through

127
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:24,000
'cause they don't control 7-11

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,867
or Albertsons, they
don't have the full funnel.

129
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,033
A lot of us here do
have the full funnel,

130
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:30,500
whether we're e-com or
we do our own business.

131
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,166
So what happens with us AKA

132
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,533
the companies
that I used to talk to,

133
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,934
back in the early
days of the internet,

134
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,066
only seven or eight years ago,

135
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,967
LivingSocial, Zynga, Groupon.

136
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,000
I would talk to
them a lot about,

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,166
you're getting way
too addicted to just math.

138
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,500
Because you're
playing on conversion

139
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
but you're not thinking
about lifetime value or brand

140
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,533
and then as so many
of you have probably

141
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,300
felt already in your careers.

142
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,433
If you're just winning
the first result on Google

143
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:58,834
or Google Adwords, guys,
in 90, the day Google Adwords,

144
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,033
just to tell you
where I come from

145
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,367
and a lot of it's funny.

146
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,633
I know I'm bouncing
a little bit here.

147
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:06,533
As I go in hardcore in social
and nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

148
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,300
I would be negative
towards Google Adwords

149
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,633
and e-mail marketing and banner

150
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:13,266
because all my digital
contemporaries were living that

151
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,900
and they would bust my chops
and I would explain to them

152
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,600
it's only 'cause
your catching me in 2012.

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,233
In 2001 and two and three,
the only thing I did talk about

154
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:25,467
was digital 1.0, e-mail, e-comm,

155
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,600
landing page optimization.

156
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Guys I was doing
banner ads in 1996

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,667
that were getting 13% click
throughs on certain wine sites.

158
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,133
Right, so, like, 
numbers that are just not real.

159
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,500
Numbers that you
could never replicate,

160
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,166
I owned the word
wine on Google Adwords,

161
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,934
the day it came out
for nine and a half months

162
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,333
at five cents a click
before anybody bid me up.

163
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,867
(audience laughter)

164
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,867
Right it's like, laughable now

165
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,467
because it's a fuck
load of years later.

166
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:54,133
But at the time people didn't
even know what Google was.

167
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:55,633
I started my YouTube wine show

168
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:58,033
which is really what
brought me to this world.

169
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,400
Less than a year
after YouTube came out,

170
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,500
when I would tell
people that I was doing it,

171
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,834
people didn't
know what YouTube was.

172
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:04,367
There wasn't a
single video on YouTube

173
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,400
when I started Wine Library TV

174
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,567
that had a million views.

175
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,667
For the first year and a
half I did Wine library TV,

176
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,400
nobody fucking watched, right?

177
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,834
And so, I guess what
I'm thinking about is

178
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,667
what's the difference
between my behavior

179
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:21,033
and the majority of
the room's behavior?

180
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,400
What is it about
the way I operate

181
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,867
that allows me
to hold my breath,

182
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,033
let's call it, what it is.

183
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:30,734
Like, hold my breath
for two to three years

184
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,667
and allow the
market to come to me?

185
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,934
When I started
VaynerMedia in 2009,

186
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,266
when I went to Campbell's

187
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:39,200
and the NHL and Pepsi
to take them as clients,

188
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,066
to pitch them, literally 
in the room I would say,

189
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,266
look Campbell's,
you need a Facebook fan page.

190
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,033
Literally, I just need you guys

191
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,734
to wrap your head around this.

192
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,734
They didn't know what it was.

193
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,000
They didn't even
know what Facebook was,

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
like literally thank God!

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,834
One person was like,

196
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:56,033
I think that's that
shit my kid's on in college.

197
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,734
(audience laughter)

198
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:02,100
And so what I'm
fascinated by is mapping

199
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,333
every person in this room

200
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,367
of how much do they
care about brand versus DR.

201
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:08,800
I have friends and
homies who make lots of money.

202
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,066
Million, two million,
thee million dollars a year

203
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,934
and they're all DR.
It's all math.

204
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:15,066
It's just quant
arbitrage, right?

205
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,800
Whether it's
landing page optimization,

206
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
Google Adwords, Facebook ads,

207
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,900
whatever it is of the moment,

208
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,000
they're driving to a place,

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,500
they're converting
 and away they go.

210
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,633
Passive income in some
people's minds not in others.

211
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:26,433
It is what it is.

212
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,166
It's a marketplace
and it changes.

213
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,200
The word wine was five
cents a click at one point.

214
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,133
Then it becomes
four dollars a click.

215
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,232
It's just marketplace dynamics.

216
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:35,699
I've been yelling my
fucking ass off for four years

217
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,166
about Facebook ads.

218
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,000
And a lot of
people in this room,

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,600
'cause I've been
watching Twitter stream,

220
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,332
two, three years ago
didn't believe in it.

221
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:42,632
Because it wasn't converting

222
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,533
as well as
Google Adwords for them.

223
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,567
And thus it wasn't something 
they paid attention to.

224
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,166
And now they've just
finally figured it out.

225
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,800
The problem is all those CPMs

226
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,734
and all that
attention is more expensive

227
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,066
than it was four years ago.

228
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,333
And so the debate
that we should have

229
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,633
in this room understanding
the makeup of this room

230
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:03,567
from my point of
view is what's the timing?

231
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:08,233
And more importantly, what
are you trying to accomplish?

232
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:12,700
So for me, the world breaks
down into sales and marketing.

233
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,600
They're one and the same.
I was thinking about 

234
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
schmarketing but 
I'm working on it.

235
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,100
(audience laughter)

236
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,700
I believe in my heart

237
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,567
mainly because I
searched the hashtag

238
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:26,100
and clicked a lot of your
profiles on my flight here

239
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,400
and was getting
prepped for this talk

240
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,066
that the far majority of this
room is in the sales business.

241
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:33,367
They're trying to
convert a certain thing,

242
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,333
to drive certain revenue,
and they're trying to achieve

243
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,367
certain short-term
monies for their careers.

244
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:39,934
I think a much
smaller percentage

245
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,867
is in the
marketing business where

246
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:44,900
at this point,
whether it's my personal brand

247
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,200
or my wine business,

248
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,667
my wine business has
done a lot of things wrong

249
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,767
for the last seven
years without me involved,

250
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:53,000
but the brand
was so goddamn strong

251
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,300
that they've basically done
everything wrong for seven years

252
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,600
and yet the business was strong

253
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,400
'cause it's winning on brand.

254
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,867
Right, when we talk and make
fun of things that suck,

255
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,033
they're winning on brand.

256
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,600
You can be wrong
for a very long time

257
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,333
and have your
actions be really wrong

258
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,233
once you become a brand,

259
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,200
but you have to have brand,

260
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,433
real brand
strategies and thoughts.

261
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:16,400
For example, as
people in our space

262
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,266
over the next 12 to 24 months

263
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,700
start talking
more about Snapchat,

264
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,633
there's a disproportionate
amount of people

265
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,867
in this fucking room that
are gonna think it's stupid

266
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,600
and not believe in it
because there's no functionality

267
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,667
to quantify the
direct ROI in a transaction

268
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,600
when you're
marketing on Snapchat.

269
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,734
It's the reason so many of
you missed the Instagram boat

270
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,266
as a major play for you

271
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,567
because each post
didn't have a link out

272
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,033
and because you
couldn't track the conversion

273
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,767
or make your sale
or do those things,

274
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,233
you didn't value it.

275
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,800
The value curve of a transaction

276
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,867
versus the lifetime
branding of something

277
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,100
is the disconnect
and the opportunity.

278
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,033
Period.

279
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,400
That's the arbitrage.

280
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,734
Now, it goes horrible
in the other direction.

281
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,533
Let me show you
by show of hands.

282
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,500
How many people in this room,

283
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,767
when they watch television,
outside of live sports

284
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,433
and the Oscars

285
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,333
are now watching TV

286
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,600
on their time.

287
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,900
Not when it airs,

288
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,066
but you're watching
Netflix, HBO GO, DVR.

289
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:16,467
You're watching on your TV
at this point on your time.

290
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,700
If you're doing this,
raise your hand

291
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,266
because I want
everybody to see this.

292
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:21,000
Raise your hand if
that's how you do it.

293
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,834
Hold on.

294
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:22,700
Actually, you know what,

295
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,066
fuck it, I need
a snap real quick.

296
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,967
Give me a second.
(audience laughter)

297
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:29,100
Give me one second.

298
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,300
Thank you very much.

299
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,433
Hold on, I got a concept.

300
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,133
Hey corporate America assholes,

301
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,767
this is how
everybody now watches TV.

302
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:37,600
They're raising their hand

303
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
'cause they don't
watch it when it airs,

304
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,967
which means they're not watching

305
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,800
your fucking
bullshit commercials.

306
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,800
(audience applause)
Cool.

307
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,767
So,

308
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:53,066
everybody in
this room, everybody,

309
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:56,834
is now watching television 
on their time which means

310
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:00,734
they are fast forwarding
every single commercial.

311
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,133
And God forbid,

312
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,400
God forbid, I don't know,

313
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,100
your remote
control falls off your bed

314
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,166
(audience laughter)

315
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:14,100
and the
commercial actually airs,

316
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,900
every fucking person in
this room grabs their phone

317
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,500
and checks their email or
tweets or checks their social.

318
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,934
Which means, that the entire
first 12 minutes of this talk

319
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:27,333
has been predicated on the
only thing I do for a living,

320
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,567
the only thing
I do for a living,

321
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,200
besides try to guess
what you're gonna do

322
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,834
before you think
you're gonna do it,

323
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,500
the only thing 
I actually do a for a living

324
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,867
is day trade attention.

325
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,433
Let me break this
down because I really hope

326
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:43,767
that two fuckers understand this

327
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,333
and go on to 
make a lot of money.

328
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,100
(audience laughter)

329
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,767
I day trade attention.

330
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,133
What does that mean?

331
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:55,066
Here's what it means.

332
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,633
Direct mail still works,

333
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:00,000
it's just overpriced.

334
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,834
Right?

335
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,266
How many people
here, by show of hands,

336
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:05,433
can't wait to leave
sunny San Diego, go back home,

337
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,400
get to their house,

338
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,767
and carefully go
through their direct mail?

339
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,767
(audience laughter)

340
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:12,600
One.

341
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,700
(audience laughter)

342
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,600
Carol, you got some
fucking problems. (laughs)

343
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,567
(audience laughter)

344
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,400
One.

345
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,066
How can direct mail, as
post has just gone up in price

346
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,600
over last 30 years,

347
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,934
while we have so many
other options to do things

348
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:29,667
and not look at it, how can
direct mail be a viable media?

349
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,433
It is, it can work.

350
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:34,734
Multi-billion dollars spent
by brands and business

351
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:35,767
to do direct mail.

352
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,033
Some of you are
sitting here saying,

353
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,767
"My direct mail's working."

354
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:40,667
That's great, it can.

355
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,500
If you have a business model

356
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,100
that sustains the
conversion rate, hallelujah.

357
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
But the question always is,

358
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,800
can you do something else
with those monies to convert?

359
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,567
Wine Library has gone
completely away from direct mail

360
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,300
and now uses
Facebook as direct mail

361
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,633
and is converting exponentially
better, so you know,

362
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,066
this always my problem
with people that I talk to

363
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,900
when I go in the offense
on what they should be doing.

364
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,800
They're like, "Gary, but
I'm making $4 million a year."

365
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,300
I'm like, "That's great, dick.

366
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,633
"What's wrong with eight?"

367
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:10,600
(audience laughter)

368
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,600
And so,

369
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,567
direct mail maybe working,
but direct mail on

370
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,600
what's the date?

371
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,433
Thank you.

372
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,333
On February 9,

373
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,400
2016

374
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,300
is not as valuable as it was

375
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,834
a year ago, four years ago, 
or 11 years ago.

376
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:35,266
Outdoor media, 
multi-billions of dollars

377
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:38,400
spent on billboards
all across this country.

378
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
When you leave this conference,

379
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,867
go home and watch
five people driving.

380
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,000
Remember this talk.

381
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
Watch five people driving.

382
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,300
I promise you that
every single fucking passenger

383
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,300
that you see in the car is
looking down at their phone.

384
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,834
All of them.

385
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,467
As a matter of fact,
three of the five drivers

386
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:57,300
are looking at their phone.

387
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,000
(audience laughter)

388
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
And so,

389
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,867
people aren't looking
at outdoor media today

390
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,166
the way they were 10 years ago.

391
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,967
They're barely looking
at the fucking road itself.

392
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,500
And so,

393
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,967
tell me why billboard
prices have gone up

394
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:16,400
12% in the last
decade when your attention

395
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,367
has gone completely
away from it.

396
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,900
As a matter of fact,
attention is so intriguing

397
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,467
if you pay attention to it,

398
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,700
that fast forwarding 
of commercials

399
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,333
in 2015

400
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,200
have declined.

401
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,767
We have declined our behavior
of fast forwarding commercials

402
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:36,800
because we'd rather not even
 spend the second to do that,

403
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,066
we'd rather just grab
our phone and not do it.

404
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,567
Big media companies
at first were like,

405
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,900
"Oh, this is great data.

406
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,400
"They're not fast
forwarding anymore."

407
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Of course they are, we're
just not paying attention.

408
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,100
Attention is the game.

409
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,500
The reason Twitter's in
trouble and it breaks my heart

410
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,867
to say that because
I built my brand on it.

411
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:57,834
If there's a platform in
the world besides YouTube that

412
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:02,066
I really have to give my
career to, it is Twitter.

413
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,533
Not only did I
build my brand on it,

414
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:06,567
I invested very early on
and made a fuck load of money.

415
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,633
Right? I love Twitter.

416
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,033
I love that
little fucking blue bird

417
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,333
like you couldn't imagine.

418
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,867
(audience laughter)

419
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:17,400
So to stand here on
February 9, 2016 and know

420
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,734
that in South by Southwest 2007

421
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:22,166
when I was sitting
with my homie Nate

422
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,100
and I had 5,000
followers and I said,

423
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,233
"Follow my homie Nate,"

424
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:28,533
and he had 1,000
people follow him.

425
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,300
Within an hour
that I stand here today

426
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,767
with 1.2 million
followers on Twitter

427
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,934
and if I said
follow my homie Nate,

428
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,633
38 of them would follow.

429
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:40,700
I learned this
lesson a long time ago.

430
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,767
In 1997,

431
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,133
I bought

432
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:43,867
an ad

433
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,900
on luxury.com.

434
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,100
Now remember, the internet
for all intents and purposes

435
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,433
is really about 20 years old.

436
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,934
I know there's a bunch
of nerds in the back saying,

437
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,300
"Actually, the
government in 1965."

438
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,767
I know, nerd.

439
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:58,600
(audience laughter)

440
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,000
But I mean us normal people
have only been on the internet

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,333
for about 20 years,

442
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,500
and so we're very early

443
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,633
and this was only a
couple of years into it.

444
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:10,266
Here's this
thing called Luxury.com

445
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,567
that emails me and says,
"You have WineLibrary.com,"

446
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,800
because I was one
of only two people

447
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,367
selling wine on the internet,

448
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,032
and they're like,
"We have Luxury.com

449
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:21,132
"and we have one million
people on our email list."

450
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:24,000
At that point I had, 
I don't know, 7,000.

451
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,233
I was like, fuck.

452
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,165
They're like,"For $20,000 
we'll blast everybody."

453
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:28,834
I'm like, "This is it.

454
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:29,834
"This is it."

455
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,333
So, they're
gonna send the email,

456
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,033
they're on the
west coast, Luxury.com.

457
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:35,333
I get the whole top of
their email, this is it.

458
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,934
I'm so pumped, I hire
like eight fucking people.

459
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,967
Like we have to pack
orders for the rest of my life.

460
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,533
This is gonna be it.

461
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,600
Then day comes and
I have everybody on the schedule

462
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
like more than on
Christmas, it's like March 9th.

463
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,533
And like, I'm super
pumped and nothing happens.

464
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,433
It's like 9:30, I'm
like, "Oh wait a minute."

465
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:56,066
I'm super
panicking, it's like 11:30

466
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,700
and we got like no
orders and I'm like,

467
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,066
"What the fuck is going on?"

468
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:02,200
And I'm like, "Oh right,
they're on the west coast.

469
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,433
"They said nine o'clock,

470
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,800
"they're probably
gonna send it at noon."

471
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,233
Sure enough, that was the case.

472
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,767
I was super pumped
from like 11 to 12, nirvana.

473
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:10,867
You know like when you see a cop

474
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:11,900
and you get scared for a second

475
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,533
but then you're
cool when he drives by,

476
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,000
that's how I was.
(audience laughter)

477
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,133
I was like super pumped.

478
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,266
I'm like, good,
I'm gonna be okay.

479
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:23,900
12 comes and by 2 P.M.
 we had six orders.

480
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,200
I was like, fuck me.

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,433
It was the moment I
understood that width

482
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:31,100
is cute but depth is everything.

483
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,800
What's happening right
now is we are all living

484
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,367
through a very intriguing time.

485
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,233
My friends,
please take a step back

486
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,033
and don't think about
your business right now.

487
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,934
Take a step back
and be a human being

488
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,200
and understand the following.

489
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,166
We are living through
the single biggest shift

490
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,166
in communication
in human history.

491
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,800
This internet thing at scale

492
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,300
has fundamentally
changed everything.

493
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,934
There are so many things that
people have said in this room

494
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:00,567
that they were never
gonna do that they now do

495
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:04,200
because technology
is eating up the world.

496
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,533
If you're brave
enough because you

497
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,467
have humility and lack ego,

498
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:11,433
please raise your hand right now

499
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,667
if you were a
person that once said

500
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,867
that you would never be
on Facebook, raise your hand.

501
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,166
Raise it high.

502
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,500
Of the people that
just raised their hand,

503
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,066
and I thank you
for your honesty,

504
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,767
how many of you are on Facebook?

505
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,433
Raise your hand.

506
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,066
That, that right there.

507
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,800
The amount of people in here,

508
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,967
now, this should be much higher.

509
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,433
How many people in this room

510
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:33,934
the first time
they saw Twitter said,

511
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,600
"This is fucking stupid."
Raise it.

512
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,900
(audience laughter)

513
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,400
And right this second,
a ton of you are like,

514
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,467
"Snapchat, isn't that
for fucking dick pics?"

515
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,700
(audience laughter)

516
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,266
There are grown-ass 
men in this room

517
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,000
that are 55-years-old
 who in the last 24 hours

518
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,934
sent a poop emoji.

519
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:09,433
(audience laughter)

520
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:10,934
They're the same
people that didn't even know

521
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:14,500
what an emoji was 
24 hours ago. Right?

522
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,467
This is what I'm talking about,

523
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,000
and it's because
we're living through

524
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,300
the great age-downification
of our society.

525
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,400
What's happening is
technology is taking over.

526
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,800
This same keynote that I gave

527
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,834
probably at Affiliate
Summit not too long ago,

528
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,967
when we were a
little bit younger, brother.

529
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,066
I walked in and I said
look the reason Facebook

530
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,800
is going to win, while
everybody in that room,

531
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,033
if you remember in '07 or

532
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,667
whatever it was, 
was like fuck you,

533
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,400
it's all Google AdWords,
Google will always win.

534
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,233
What the fuck is Facebook?
Never, nothing is.

535
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,967
I said look, it's
the grandma effect.

536
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:45,700
The second all these 23
and 24-year-olds, in the next

537
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,900
three or four years, 
if they stay on Facebook, 'cause

538
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,367
I had to see that play out,
 the second they start

539
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,100
putting pictures
of their grandkids

540
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,433
on that platform,
grandma's coming.

541
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:55,567
And that's what happened.

542
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,667
And the reason I'm so
hot on Snapchat right now,

543
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:01,433
is normal people are coming,
not just 14 to 24-year-olds,

544
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,266
39-year-old dudes, 
57-year-old aunts,

545
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,633
normal people are
 coming and that's

546
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,433
when a platform hits scale

547
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,300
and it has attention.

548
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,767
I have 27 to 30,000
people looking at my Snapchat

549
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:15,300
stories, but out of
all my channels, including

550
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,133
250,000 plus on Instagram,
which has a ton of attention,

551
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:22,266
there's not a channel
that I can do and use today,

552
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:24,066
that will convert more
sales or get more people

553
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:26,233
to do what I want
them to do than Snapchat,

554
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,767
a platform that
I've only taken seriously

555
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,667
as a business since December.

556
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,166
Something that I've been
talking about since 2013,

557
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,567
something that I believed
in for a very long time,

558
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,100
but I would only
use it with people

559
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,600
that I knew in real life,

560
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,100
and then I would only
and never use it in business,

561
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,667
but only since ...

562
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,266
45 days ago,

563
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,734
have I used in that
manner and that attention graph

564
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:54,066
is so staggering and my friends,

565
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:57,133
that is where
branding matters vs. sales.

566
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,967
I can't convert it,
I can't show it.

567
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,900
I can turn it into that,
you can turn anything

568
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,100
with those brands,
look you can do QVC

569
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,033
or be Guthy-Renker
on television,

570
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,000
you can make
anything DR if that's

571
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,467
what you want to do with it

572
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:09,400
and that's fine and you should,

573
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,367
because at least it will give

574
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:11,967
you some
confidence that it's there.

575
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:14,066
But you have to
remember it's attention,

576
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,433
it's just attention.

577
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:18,967
Google AdWords, down
19% in click throughs,

578
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:23,033
Google ads are
being clicked 19% less

579
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:25,567
by the same
users in the last year,

580
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,133
because we ruin everything.

581
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:29,133
We ruined e-mail.

582
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,734
We're ruining Google ads.

583
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:34,467
Google today announced
no more flash banners

584
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:35,900
in the next few minutes,

585
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,400
it's the same old game.

586
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,266
Facebook was more
valuable 24 months ago

587
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:41,300
than it is today,
it's more valuable today

588
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,533
than it will be in
36 months and sometimes

589
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,166
more valuable today than
it's going to be in three years,

590
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,100
but it's not as valuable
as it was a year ago.

591
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,400
Influencer marketing 
is the grossest

592
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,767
undervalued product
in the world,

593
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:56,000
right now every
person on Instagram

594
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,467
that has 647 fans can do more
for your sales and marketing

595
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:00,600
than you'd ever imagine,

596
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,400
you just need 40,000 of
them, because there's no scale.

597
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,834
And so we're living
through very, very, very

598
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:10,500
interesting times, and so
what I would challenge you

599
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,166
to do is to go upstairs,
look in the mirror

600
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:16,266
and audit yourself, and
figure out where you sit

601
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:19,000
on the pendulum of
sales and marketing,

602
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,066
and the closer that
you can get to 50/50,

603
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,266
especially if
you're good at sales,

604
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:26,233
remember earlier when
I said hold my breath,

605
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:27,400
how did I get there?

606
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,467
It's because I'm so
fucking good at sales.

607
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,200
It's because in 2009,
nobody could sell

608
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,667
social media to big
brands, but I could,

609
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,100
and so those couple
of dollars allowed me

610
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,300
to stay alive and get there.

611
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,800
If you're so damn
good at selling,

612
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,700
take a percentage 
of those monies

613
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,433
 and invest it your long term,

614
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:48,000
to not look at branding
as the long-term play.

615
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
Why did I start
doing The #AskGaryVee Show

616
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,166
and go back to YouTube?

617
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,467
Why did I start doing
DailyVee and all this vlogging?

618
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:57,367
It's building
brand equity, it's brand

619
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:00,400
and over brand is
how you actually win.

620
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,967
There's a big difference
between Nike and Apple,

621
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:05,867
and their competitors
predicated on brand,

622
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:09,066
and there's a big difference
between social media experts.

623
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:11,667
I get paid $80,000 to speak.

624
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:14,834
Others get $4,000,
that's called brand.

625
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,767
And so what I need
people to understand

626
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,567
and what I hope people
in this room understand

627
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:20,300
is there's a huge opportunity,

628
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,400
because everyday that
somebody's better at something

629
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,667
than you,
something else comes along

630
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,133
and you've got it at-bat.

631
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,066
You missed Facebook and Twitter

632
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,333
and somebody in your
space took it and won,

633
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:35,033
good news, here's
fucking Snapchat, right?

634
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,867
You suck shit at
Snapchat because you're weird

635
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,066
and you don't want
to make content that way

636
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,700
and you have to wait, great.

637
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,533
Next sugar is
going to Shmapchat.

638
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,400
(audience laughter)

639
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,000
And so we're living
in a time where people

640
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,100
are just building on
top of the internet itself,

641
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,934
but we can't
underestimate the dynamics

642
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:52,333
and we can't get lazy.

643
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,967
Do you know how many people come

644
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:56,700
and want to talk about
the ROI of social media

645
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,433
or Facebook and have no idea?

646
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,834
Do you know how
many arguments I've had

647
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,233
about Instagram's
ROI or capabilities

648
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,467
in the last six months,
only to find out

649
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:06,700
as I'm negotiating or
debating with the person

650
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,900
that they say
something, I'm like,

651
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,967
wait a minute, do you
even have an Instagram account?

652
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,100
Do you know how
many of you pontificate

653
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,600
and regurgitate
headlines about shit

654
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,266
that you don't
fucking understand?

655
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:20,467
A lot.

656
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:24,400
And in that hyperbole,
and in that headline reading

657
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,800
is where practitioners
make their fucking money.

658
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,633
And so it is February 9th,

659
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:33,333
right, yeah, cool?

660
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,500
2016, and there's a
lot of shit going on

661
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,166
and a lot of opportunity,

662
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,467
yet what's holding people back

663
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,867
is drawing lines in the sand.

664
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:47,033
I don't believe that
social media has as much ROI.

665
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:48,767
Listen, I had
to do it to myself.

666
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:52,000
Three years ago I felt
that I was going too far

667
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,333
into my own hyperbole
and I needed to go back

668
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,300
and be smart
and more disciplined

669
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,600
about my e-mail marketing
 and my SEM,

670
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,233
because I was getting a little
too ahead of myself. Right?

671
00:26:01,233 --> 00:26:04,600
So it's finding that
balance of how to make

672
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,633
this stuff work
because the opportunity

673
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:08,600
is substantial and 

674
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,767
there's always going
to be an arbitrage,

675
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,967
there's always going
to be an opportunity,

676
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,166
but it's mixing the whole thing.

677
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:19,767
And again, I want to make sure
that we really nail down brand.

678
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:22,834
Not everybody is as extroverted,

679
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:26,367
not everybody is
unbelievably charismatic.

680
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:29,200
You know, like
not everybody, right?

681
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,700
And so you've got
to understand what

682
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,133
you're looking to build around.

683
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:37,400
I am not preaching for you
to build your personal brand.

684
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,033
I'm preaching for
you to build brand. Right?

685
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,467
You don't have to
build it around yourself,

686
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,367
and I know that's the
common play and people do it,

687
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,567
and by the way if you like it,
if you like the attention,

688
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:47,734
if you like the cameras,

689
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,767
if you like the accolades
and the laughs, God bless,

690
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:52,100
it's a lot of fun,
promise, super awesome.

691
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,133
But there are tens
of thousands of people

692
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,367
making real fucking
money building brands

693
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,667
around their businesses
that you've never heard of

694
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,667
and that's what
they've deployed it against.

695
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,266
That matters.

696
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:05,467
In parallel, while
you keep the lights on,

697
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:07,000
and you drive your sales.

698
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,133
My biggest frustration,
especially for audiences

699
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:13,000
of this makeup is the following:

700
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,667
if a lot of you
realized that you could leave

701
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,834
500,000 to 2 million
in top line revenue

702
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:22,133
on the table because
all of your behavior

703
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,533
wasn't to squeeze the
orange for every penny

704
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:26,900
on your conversion
funnels and you deployed

705
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,667
those monies and
you built it into brand,

706
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,967
over a 36 to 48 month window,
if you were good at brand,

707
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,700
the one thing I'm worried
about talking about brand

708
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,000
right now, is you've
got to be good at it.

709
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,266
Plenty of people buy
Google ads, plenty of people

710
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,867
try to do landing
page optimization,

711
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,667
plenty of people
buy Facebook ads,

712
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,000
so you have to be good at it,

713
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,700
but if you are good at it,

714
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,433
you're building
wealth instead of being rich.

715
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:52,133
You know, it's funny,
I always think about business,

716
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:53,266
I'm a big Chris Rock fan.

717
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,900
He had that joke
about Oprah and Bill Gates

718
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,166
and it's how I think about this,

719
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:01,033
which is you could be
rich by just playing the math,

720
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:04,500
but if you can figure out brand,
you can become wealthy.

721
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,934
And that's really the
question, are you willing

722
00:28:07,934 --> 00:28:11,166
to leave 500,000, 1 million 

723
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,166
or 5%, 20%

724
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,633
of the monies each year for
the next three or four years,

725
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:18,500
while you deploy those
dollars and those efforts

726
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,033
and energies into trying
to make a double, triple win?

727
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,900
That is basically what
I've seen my whole life.

728
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,367
There's a reason that the
two businesses that I've built,

729
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:29,900
and forget about
my opinion on stage,

730
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,934
I know there's a lot of people
here who don't know that much

731
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,567
about me, let me just ground it.

732
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,834
There's a reason that
I've run two businesses

733
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:38,166
in my life, 
Wine Library and VaynerMedia,

734
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,166
this is not
information products.

735
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,967
This is not a
fucking mastermind.

736
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,934
This is a retail store
that sells fucking wine

737
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:46,800
and an agency that
works with Madison Ave

738
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,367
Fortune 500
companies, businesses.

739
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:53,867
One went three from
$60 million in revenue

740
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:56,500
in four years, let me
just quantify that for you.

741
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,000
Wine Library, when it was
Shopper's Discount Liquors,

742
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,467
did $3 million dollars
in revenue on 10% gross profit,

743
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:04,867
which for all you
business people at home

744
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:08,300
means that I had
$300,000 before expenses,

745
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,767
luckily Sasha Vaynerchuk
didn't pay anybody anything,

746
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:12,633
so there was a
couple bucks left over.

747
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:15,333
But I built the business
from three to $60 million

748
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,867
with no fucking money, 
no raising capital,

749
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,066
like all these fuckers
have been doing

750
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,367
for the last five years.

751
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,900
(audience laughter)

752
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,400
I took the little money we had

753
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,033
and I made every
fucking penny work.

754
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,166
And I stood on the floor
from 7:00 in the morning

755
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,767
to 10:00 at night,
Monday through fucking Sunday

756
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:33,433
for 10 years, I punted.

757
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:37,934
Do you know what it is
to punt your fucking 20s?

758
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:38,867
Do you know what
it feels like when

759
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:40,033
all your friends e-mail you now

760
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,700
and say you're so
lucky and you have to reply

761
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,967
'cause you're so
fucking pissed that

762
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,767
that's cool Josh that I'm lucky,

763
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,500
but remember when you
went to the Jersey Shore

764
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,233
and banged fucking chicks?

765
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:50,300
I worked.

766
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,800
(audience laughter and applause)

767
00:29:57,867 --> 00:29:59,834
And so,

768
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,700
Wine Library, three
to 65 million dollars,

769
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,700
60 million dollars
in sales in five years,

770
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,700
and now VaynerMedia,
which I've now personally run

771
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,800
for four, almost five years now,

772
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,834
and I've grown VaynerMedia
 from 30 to 600 employees,

773
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:17,533
from three to 100
million dollars in revenue,

774
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:20,533
17% net profit,
real fucking money,

775
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,767
AJV gets to take
a lot of money home,

776
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:25,467
and so, how does that happen?

777
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:29,767
It happens because my
CFO hates my fucking guts.

778
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,033
(audience laughter)

779
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:32,333
And what do I mean by that?

780
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,066
You don't grow a
business from three to 100

781
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,133
if you're gonna
try to maximize profit

782
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,367
every 12 fucking months.

783
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:41,934
If you're not
making bets and investing,

784
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:43,133
if you're not building brand,

785
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,000
if you're not trying,

786
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,066
I started four major
divisions last year:

787
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:48,233
Sampling, a lot of
our clients sample,

788
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:49,400
yeah, here's the
new chocolate, right?

789
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,367
That shit.

790
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:54,233
Live events, like, you
know, all my fuckers go to

791
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:56,967
Coachella every year, my whole
company fucking shuts down.

792
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:58,934
Those kinda things.

793
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:02,467
Video, and paid acceleration.

794
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:06,500
Live events, and sampling, dead.

795
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,767
I'm announcing
that we're shutting down

796
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,800
live events next week.

797
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,934
Hopefully none of the
people paying for the livestream

798
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,000
work at VaynerMedia.

799
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,834
(audience laughter)

800
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,600
Dead.

801
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,033
Fucking lost two million bucks.

802
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:22,967
Bought a site called
Lost Lettermen, a sports site,

803
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,133
'cause we're doing more media,

804
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,300
dead.
Shut it down.

805
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,633
Lost a million bucks.

806
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:30,367
But, video and paid made
all that money back and more,

807
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:31,633
because I'm on the offense.

808
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:32,867
I'm not trying to maximize,

809
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:35,667
'cause I don't need to
buy a fucking boat this year.

810
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,767
And I don't need a
fucking Lamborghini

811
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,100
to put on the Instagram,

812
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,633
and I don't
need a fucking watch,

813
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:42,467
because I'm building
an actual business,

814
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,533
and I don't
wanna retire next year,

815
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:46,367
and so...

816
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,300
My punchline to this is,
please understand

817
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
what's really happening here.

818
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,400
Let me help you understand it.

819
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,700
Eyes and ears

820
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,533
are the only thing you
should give a fuck about.

821
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:58,667
And wherever they are matters.

822
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,300
Do you think
this fucking matters?

823
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,800
It matters more than
anything in the world.

824
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,400
This is the fundamental
extension of your life.

825
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,767
How many people here,
in every 24-hour window,

826
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:09,266
are always within
arms' reach of their phone?

827
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:10,800
Raise your hand.

828
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,567
Look at this.

829
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:12,934
Look, front row, raise it.

830
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:14,600
Look.

831
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,033
Within arms' reach
when you're sleeping,

832
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:18,433
taking a shit, it's there.

833
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:21,266
(audience laughter)

834
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,633
Guys, I literally am not
joking when I tell you this.

835
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:26,834
I literally would rather
somebody in New York City

836
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:28,800
stab me in the
stomach and steal my wallet

837
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,233
than lose my phone.

838
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:33,533
(audience laughter)

839
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,834
Now, we can all agree
it's important, right?

840
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:36,667
Cool.

841
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:37,834
Now.

842
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:41,367
Fifty-fucking-four percent
of every second of attention

843
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:44,066
on this fucking thing
is in a social network.

844
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,900
You still think it's a fad?

845
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,367
My friends, social
network is a bullshit term.

846
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,500
There is no...
What the fuck is social network?

847
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,066
Social networks is a slang term

848
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:57,467
for the current
state of the internet.

849
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:58,834
Period.

850
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,734
53% of every second,

851
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:02,667
and you got calendars, and
you got fucking Angry Birds,

852
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:03,734
and you got Words with...

853
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:06,400
Fucking horseshit, 
and utilities, it's all here,

854
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,734
yet 53% is gobbled up by
like seven or eight sites.

855
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:12,400
So you don't
think that's important?

856
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,467
Of course it is,

857
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,500
and every one of them is
becoming a place where you can

858
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
reverse engineer that
attention and sell something.

859
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,800
The problem is for so
many people in this room,

860
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,266
it's not as black-and-white
as email and Google AdWords.

861
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:25,266
It's not conversion.

862
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:30,100
It's why you like Facebook,
'cause it gives you that too.

863
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,200
That's why I love Facebook.

864
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,333
Facebook is so unbelievable.

865
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,133
Every time I...

866
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,567
Like, Facebook went down today.

867
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,333
I guarantee you tonight,

868
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,166
'cause I have to
take a car to fucking LAX

869
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,567
and a fucking red-eye to Miami.

870
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:43,266
Tonight, I will
absolutely buy Facebook stock

871
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:46,600
after the rant I'm about to
do, 'cause I do it every time.

872
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,266
Here's why Facebook's gonna win.

873
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,133
It has attention.

874
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,166
Yes, they are
vulnerable to the fact

875
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,600
that young kids
are not going on it.

876
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,700
Cool, they took care of that.

877
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,867
They bought Instagram,

878
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,734
so they're good for
another four to seven years.

879
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,400
And they tried to buy
Snapchat two fucking years ago

880
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,200
for three billion dollars,

881
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,834
when 80% of this room
hadn't even heard of it yet,

882
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:08,100
unless you had a 14-year-old
girl in your life, right?

883
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,734
So, Zucks
understands attention arbitrage.

884
00:34:11,734 --> 00:34:13,132
It's why he bought Oculus Rift,

885
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:15,799
'cause VR is the next internet.

886
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,233
Now, VR's 15 years away,
and a lot of people in this room

887
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:20,433
are gonna make a lot
of mistakes and lose money

888
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,667
'cause they think
it's gonna be here sooner,

889
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,033
but it's coming.

890
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:24,333
It's coming.

891
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,266
And so...

892
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,533
When I think about
what's really happening there,

893
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:32,567
and all the opportunity,
what Facebook provides

894
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:33,833
for everybody in this room,

895
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,899
if you have not realized
that Facebook is, right now,

896
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,000
the birth child of
television 

897
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,166
and direct mail,

898
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,500
that's what Facebook is.

899
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,000
If you understand
how Facebook works today,

900
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,199
February 9th, 2016,

901
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,265
it is the birth child of
television and direct mail,

902
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:59,367
AKA the greatest execution
anybody in this room can do,

903
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:02,633
B-to-B or B-to-C, 
is the following:

904
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,333
This is where I'm
going straight practicality.

905
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,066
Not giving you the rah-rah,
yay, this is all so cool,

906
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,266
pay the fuck attention.

907
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:10,867
Straight practicality.

908
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:13,667
If you understand
who you're selling to,

909
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:17,400
28-year-old women in Iowa
who are Red Sox fans,

910
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,000
42 to 47-year-old African
men, African-American males,

911
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,600
who like baseball, you know,

912
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,333
19 to 22-year-old dudes,

913
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,800
even though they're
not supposed to be on it,

914
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,700
I'll show you data, not
what your headline says,

915
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,233
that there's plenty of
18 to 25-year-olds on Facebook.

916
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:35,300
They may not check
it 7,000 times a day,

917
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,166
but there's
plenty of them on it.

918
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:40,633
And so, if you understand what
to do, here's the punchline.

919
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:42,133
Everybody here
needs to figure out

920
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:46,133
the most cost-effective
way to make a commercial,

921
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:50,033
which means a
video, which means...

922
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:52,667
You're not confined
by the way television is,

923
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,567
so you can make it two, three.

924
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,667
I actually wanna make
them as long as possible.

925
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,333
You'll understand in a minute.

926
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:02,633
If somebody watches my
four-minute and 18-second video

927
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:04,900
all the way through on Facebook,

928
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,667
so when I talk
about Facebook video,

929
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,367
the headline
readers here say, oh, fuck,

930
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,166
but they count every
3-second view as a view.

931
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,333
Cool.

932
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,700
Yes, they do.

933
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,834
I don't give a fuck.

934
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:18,033
Because I have access
to data that shows me that,

935
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:21,100
of the 4 million people,
17,000 of them

936
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,900
watched all 
 four minutes and 18 seconds.

937
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,000
And you know what I can
do with all 17,000 of them?

938
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,867
I can remarket to
those motherfuckers

939
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:29,600
with a DR call to action,

940
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,433
after I've
emotionally affected them,

941
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:32,333
and you know what happens?

942
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,533
It's a funny thing.

943
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,200
They fucking convert.

944
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,367
(audience laughter)

945
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:38,133
And so...

946
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:41,133
Plenty of people
think they know Facebook,

947
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,400
plenty of people
read about Facebook,

948
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,433
but people don't have
the luxury that I have,

949
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:47,266
which is spending 
$100 million in ads,

950
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:48,500
spent across our clients,

951
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,300
to have a lot of data
to support my hyperbole,

952
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,967
or a 60-million-dollar retail
store where I get to see

953
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:57,133
the impact on the bricks
and mortars and the e-com,

954
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,734
or a human brand that
understands what I am selling

955
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:03,734
on Snapchat vs. Instagram
vs. Facebook vs. Twitter

956
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:07,900
vs. LinkedIn vs. email vs.
my dot-com vs. medium.com,

957
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,600
against my books,
that I want you to all buy

958
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,133
on March 8th, please, thank you.

959
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:14,400
And so...
(audience laughter)

960
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,066
And so,

961
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:17,633
this is the world I live in.

962
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:20,133
I believe that I get
the luxury to stand on stage

963
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:22,934
in front of so many smart
people for a couple of reasons.

964
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:24,867
One, I'm handsome.
(audience laughter)

965
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:28,500
Two, two,

966
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,667
I'm the best 
fucking practitioner

967
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:33,700
at February 9th, 2016 marketing

968
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,834
because I don't
give a fuck about any platform.

969
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,467
Fuck social media. 

970
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:41,166
If social media doesn't 
have your attention tommorrow,

971
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,500
I don't give a fuck.

972
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,633
If you all go back to sitting
around your fucking house

973
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:45,967
'cause we have
too much technology

974
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,967
and we just sit
around like it's 1957

975
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,567
and listen to the fucking radio,

976
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,533
I'm fucking in.

977
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:54,233
(audience laughter)

978
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,500
And so, the reason 
I go on that little rant,

979
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
is because I know 
a lot of you and

980
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
you made your monies on Google.

981
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,567
You made your money on SEO.

982
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,400
You made your money on Facebook,

983
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,033
and you will make your money
on Periscope and Snapchat.

984
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,166
And then you make a mistake.

985
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:13,367
It's called getting
really fucking romantic.

986
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:16,934
You get real romantic
about how you did it,

987
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:18,367
'cause you put in a
lot of time and effort

988
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,900
to figure it out.

989
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,567
And you're sad
that shit's changing.

990
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,934
Well, good news.

991
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:27,567
Or bad news,
depending on how you roll.

992
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:30,133
The market doesn't give a fuck.

993
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,567
The market doesn't give
a fuck that you spent years

994
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:36,533
figuring out how to fucking
href your fucking Google pages.

995
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:40,633
(audience laughter)

996
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:43,567
The market doesn't
give a fuck, like I did,

997
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:46,734
in 1999, you figured out
how to get people's first names

998
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:48,000
at the top of the email,

999
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
which tricked them
into buying more shit.

1000
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,934
And the market doesn't
care that I figured out

1001
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:54,266
Snapchat today,
because I figured out

1002
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,700
fucking Twitter in
2006, 2007, and 2008,

1003
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,567
and to figure out Twitter,

1004
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,367
which is why so
many people didn't do it,

1005
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,033
I spent 15 fucking hours a day,

1006
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:04,600
talking to all you mother
fucking assholes every day,

1007
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,266
all the time, and
that's how you figured it out,

1008
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,667
and just because now
the attention has gone away,

1009
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:13,100
I can sit and cry about
how I wasted all those years,

1010
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,667
and how sad it
is, or I can realize,

1011
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,433
nobody gives a
fuck, and I can figure out

1012
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:19,567
the next thing and the
next thing and the next thing.

1013
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:23,166
And in that romance, and
in that line that you all draw

1014
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,200
in the sand, in that,

1015
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,533
is where all the
money is to be made.

1016
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,633
Understand?

1017
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:30,867
(crowd murmurs)

1018
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:31,834
Good.

1019
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:35,633
So.

1020
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,867
So please, please

1021
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:41,533
indulge me and
audit yourself and deploy

1022
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,900
what really separates
winning entrepreneurs

1023
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,233
from non-winning entrepreneurs

1024
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:46,967
which is a very
interesting word.

1025
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,266
It's called self-awareness.

1026
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:50,834
Know what you're good at.

1027
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,934
If you're a hardcore
mathematician, great.

1028
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:54,633
Keep quanting the
fuck out of things.

1029
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,667
If you're creative as shit,

1030
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,800
you better figure out that
Snapchat is really right for you

1031
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,367
'cause that's
what that's gonna be.

1032
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:02,567
Know yourself.

1033
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,600
Know where you're good at,
reverse engineer yourself

1034
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,367
and put yourself and
the people that work for you

1035
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,367
in the best position to succeed.

1036
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:10,567
You got somebody charismatic

1037
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:12,233
and clever in
your office right now?

1038
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,333
Instead of being mad

1039
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,066
that they might
not be good at details,

1040
00:40:15,066 --> 00:40:16,166
why don't you give them a phone

1041
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,600
and put them in
charge of putting

1042
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,033
the Snapchat
content out for you?

1043
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,900
Please eliminate romance.

1044
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,233
Please eliminate the
way you want it to be.

1045
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:26,300
I had a funny
meeting the other day,

1046
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,667
this is a good story, 
and then I'm gonna,

1047
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,266
I just want get in to
Q&A, so if you wanna start.

1048
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:31,400
Oh, actually Ryan,
you're gonna come up here

1049
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,467
so get prepped, brother.

1050
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:34,233
Here's a quick
story, I'm gonna use this,

1051
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:35,066
and then we're gonna go to Q&A

1052
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:39,300
because I wanna put
details on this hyperbole.

1053
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,433
Was at a meeting the other day,

1054
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:43,633
the guy's a CEO of
a $700 million company

1055
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:47,567
and they mainly sell to
13 to 22-year-old females.

1056
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:49,900
We have a meeting and I do this

1057
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,800
around Snapchat and Instagram,

1058
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,233
but because he's a fucking
Corporate America mother fucker,

1059
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:56,767
I give him a huge
deck with tons of data.

1060
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:58,033
He likes math.

1061
00:40:58,033 --> 00:40:58,667
We go through the whole thing

1062
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,200
and I'm basically
trying to convince him

1063
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,567
that he has to do a
hell of a lot less print

1064
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:04,500
because all the
18-year-old girls

1065
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,700
can't wait to get
magazines and go to page 97

1066
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,333
and look at the ad.
(audience laughter)

1067
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,867
And a hell of a
lot less Facebook

1068
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:13,133
which is something
we got him to do

1069
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:13,967
over the last couple of years,

1070
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:15,667
which was good
for a few minutes.

1071
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,900
And really start
deploying a lot more money

1072
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,600
towards Snapchat and Instagram

1073
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,834
because that's
where these people live,

1074
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:21,834
that's where their attention is,

1075
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:24,266
that's where we need
to arbitrage against.

1076
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:26,033
We go through the
whole presentation.

1077
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:28,033
He goes, "Gary, good stuff,
appreciate it."

1078
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:30,934
He goes, "But,

1079
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:31,867
"I gotta be honest with you.

1080
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,834
"I just don't get Instagram."

1081
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:38,934
And I go, 
"That's great, dick, but

1082
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:42,200
"everyone of
your customers does.

1083
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,133
"And it doesn't
matter what you get

1084
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:47,467
"or what you want it to be.

1085
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:50,667
"You've got to deploy
against the end consumer."

1086
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:53,400
Regardless of how you
want it, the market is moving,

1087
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,533
and it's marketing
and it's moving fast.

1088
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:58,667
When you look at
that age downification,

1089
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,400
because of the grandma rule,

1090
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,700
do you know that
the fastest growing demo

1091
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,133
of individuals taking
selfies on Instagram right now

1092
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:09,834
are 42 to 48-year-old females.

1093
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:13,166
Literally, literally
cougar selfies dominating.

1094
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:17,000
(audience laughter)

1095
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,433
And so we all,

1096
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:20,533
this is not how I thought
I was gonna roll at 40.

1097
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:23,033
I thought I was gonna be
fucking dead when I was 20.

1098
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:24,600
Like I think I was old as shit.

1099
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,800
We are living
much younger lives.

1100
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,467
If you map the average
42-year-old American female

1101
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,934
in what she does,
what she wears,

1102
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:35,166
where she goes out,
what she spends her money on,

1103
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:38,166
she acts like a
29-year-old American female,

1104
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,367
only 10 years ago.

1105
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:42,667
If you're lucky enough
like I am to sit here right now

1106
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:45,233
and you know what
your parents were like

1107
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:47,200
at the age that
you are right now,

1108
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,567
if you're fortunate enough
that you know how old you are

1109
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,433
and you knew or can remember
your parents at your age,

1110
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:56,133
you are stunningly
younger than them.

1111
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,734
And that's because
technology is dragging us down.

1112
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:01,200
If you wanna keep
up with the Joneses

1113
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,166
and be a part of society,
you have to figure it out.

1114
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:07,033
For us marketers and
sales and business people,

1115
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:09,333
this is gonna play out.

1116
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,734
It's already
starting to play out

1117
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:13,300
and what I'm really focused on

1118
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,900
and why I'm sitting
here a little longer

1119
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,934
is it's gonna play
out more than you think.

1120
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:21,300
4 1/2 hours is
still spent on television

1121
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,100
by the average American,

1122
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,767
4 1/2 hours a day.

1123
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:28,600
Two or three of
those hours are in real,

1124
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,100
real jeopardy, in my opinion,

1125
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,734
over the next 10 to 15 years.

1126
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,567
How many people
here are retiring

1127
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:36,433
in the next 10 years?

1128
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:40,233
And I don't mean you're gonna
fucking crush it and retire.

1129
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:43,266
(audience laughter)

1130
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,400
I mean, you're fucking
old and you're finished.

1131
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,266
(audience laughter and applause)

1132
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:50,533
Raise your hand.

1133
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:51,834
Who's out in 10 years?

1134
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:53,600
Raise it.

1135
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,934
Okay, good.

1136
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:56,333
So four of you.

1137
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,200
(audience laughter)

1138
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,967
So, for the rest of you,

1139
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:01,567
if you think a lot
of shit has gone down

1140
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:03,000
in the last 10 years,

1141
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,300
wait 'til you see
the shit I'm looking at.

1142
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,533
I'm running $100
million venture fund now

1143
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:08,734
so I do my startup
stuff as some of you know.

1144
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:12,000
Wait 'til you see
what's actually coming next.

1145
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,367
I mean, none of
this shit existed.

1146
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,967
If you go back 15 years,
not Google, not Facebook,

1147
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:20,900
not mobile devices, 
none of it existed.

1148
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,700
It didn't exist.

1149
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,233
I mean, all the
things that are coming,

1150
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:26,867
the smartification.

1151
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:28,367
Do you know how
interested I am in tourism?

1152
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:29,900
Do you know that VR in 15 years

1153
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,767
is gonna make your brain think

1154
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:33,233
that what you're
seeing in your VR device,

1155
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:37,700
which will probably be
contact lenses, is 98.5% real?

1156
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:39,834
What does that affect?

1157
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:42,533
That affects the
tourism industry.

1158
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:43,667
Like, I don't know.

1159
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,767
If I actually can sit in my
house and put on contact lenses

1160
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,033
and it feels like
I'm at the Eiffel Tower,

1161
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:50,700
maybe I don't wanna spend
all that money to go do that.

1162
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,367
Right?

1163
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,633
It affects movies and gaming.

1164
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,767
You know the porn guys
are gonna go there real quick.

1165
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,567
(audience laughter)

1166
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:59,233
So it's gonna
affect relationships.

1167
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,133
(audience laughter)

1168
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,934
And so, I think we are
grossly underestimating

1169
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,700
where things are going.

1170
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,867
In 2007, I talked about a
lot of shit at Affiliate Summit,

1171
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:10,200
and Sean, 
I watched that keynote,

1172
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,967
and I don't watch
my shit too often

1173
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:13,233
because what I remember
about that keynote

1174
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:14,033
more than anything,

1175
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:15,567
maybe more than
anything in my career

1176
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:17,600
was the audience
was not buying it

1177
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,200
because they were in
affiliate and Google math,

1178
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,633
and the social stuff
didn't seem right enough.

1179
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:25,367
What's interesting to me is

1180
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,967
watching that
conversation play out,

1181
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:30,200
it's become very obvious
how things are gonna go.

1182
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,533
To me, if you can
pattern recognize,

1183
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,133
you can make a lot of money.

1184
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,433
This is gonna
happen whether I say so,

1185
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,967
whether you want it to,

1186
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:39,066
it's just data.

1187
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:43,133
150 fucking
million people a day,

1188
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:46,734
a day are
spending multiple, multiple

1189
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:51,266
minutes and hours
watching videos on Snapchat.

1190
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:53,133
How do you disrespect that?

1191
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:54,133
I'll tell you how,

1192
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:56,734
'cause you haven't figured 
out how to monetize it yet.

1193
00:45:56,734 --> 00:45:58,867
That doesn't mean
the platform's wrong,

1194
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:01,100
that means you're fucking wrong.

1195
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,133
Thank you.

1196
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:04,867
(audience applause)

1197
00:46:04,867 --> 00:46:06,667
(upbeat music)

1198
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:09,367
Thank you, thank you.

1199
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,133
- [Ryan] Thirsty?

1200
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:13,333
Really, no?

1201
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:15,900
- Thank you.

1202
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,000
- So you guys--
- Hold on, hold on.

1203
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,233
- Wait, wait, wait,
where are you going?

1204
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:21,266
We ain't done yet.

1205
00:46:21,266 --> 00:46:22,800
Sit down, we got
some Q&A time here.

1206
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,834
- No, no,
let them go, let them go.

1207
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:29,000
I just want to
tell the 15 of you,

1208
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,133
you're fucking up, because
the good shit is coming now.

1209
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:34,767
I'm telling you,
dude, we're in the tie,

1210
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:38,900
sit your fucking
ass down, let's go.

1211
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,166
- He's actually doing it too.

1212
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:42,667
If you have a question,
 if you have a question,

1213
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:45,767
we've got some mic stands
there, there, there, there

1214
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:47,800
there, there,
they're kind of everywhere.

1215
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,867
Go ahead, hop up
right now, get in line,

1216
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:53,000
we're going to try to get
to as many of them as we can.

1217
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,834
That was a really--

1218
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:55,200
- Let me throw a
quick right hook,

1219
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,133
while you're waiting, 
everybody who's not

1220
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:00,166
already using it,
download Snapchat right now

1221
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:01,867
and follow me, you're
not going to know how,

1222
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:04,033
because the UI is very weird
the first time you're on it,

1223
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:05,533
but you should.

1224
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:07,533
- How many of you guys
followed Gary on Snapchat

1225
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,000
while he was doing this?

1226
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,200
Yeah, there you go.

1227
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,533
- Okay, you get the
first couple of questions.

1228
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:13,433
- Yeah, I get the first couple.

1229
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:16,200
First, I love
what you said about

1230
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,400
people saying, "I don't get it."
- Yes.

1231
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,700
- I think that is one of
the most dangerous things

1232
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,767
that we as human beings,
it's like you immediately

1233
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:27,333
shut yourself off to creativity.

1234
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:30,500
This is not so much a
question, more of a statement,

1235
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,100
if you ever hear
yourself say, "I don't get it,"

1236
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,700
and you say it
kind of a flippant way.

1237
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,567
- Dude, this is your conference,

1238
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,400
you can come and
talk shit all the time,

1239
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,100
ask questions, what
the fuck are you doing?

1240
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,667
(crowd laughter)

1241
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:42,500
- Just wanted to make that--

1242
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,166
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1243
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,834
- One of us has a foot on
the stool, the other one--

1244
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:48,867
- I'm ready to throw down,

1245
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,333
I've been working out.
- Yeah, there you go.

1246
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,467
So here's a question for you:
- Yeah.

1247
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:56,467
- With everything
that's going on, right,

1248
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:58,734
where it rewards
those who are out there,

1249
00:47:58,734 --> 00:48:00,667
who are very public,
 who are very vocal,

1250
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:03,000
who have that influential brand,

1251
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,033
how do you get
credit for being quiet?

1252
00:48:07,033 --> 00:48:08,734
I mean often times in life--

1253
00:48:08,734 --> 00:48:12,633
- I think this is guys
there are far more people

1254
00:48:12,633 --> 00:48:14,433
making money that are quiet

1255
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,667
than there are
people that look like me.

1256
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:17,800
It's not even close.

1257
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,400
It's data, how do you do it?

1258
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,033
You mean the
majority of the world?

1259
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,133
- Yeah, but okay,
but if you're a brand

1260
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,133
and you want to do this,

1261
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:27,133
is it about finding someone

1262
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:29,266
in your office
that can be that voice?

1263
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:31,967
- No, I think it's
about building the logo.

1264
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:34,834
There's no Nick
Nike, there's Nike.

1265
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:37,967
Right, like you don't need
to build it around a person.

1266
00:48:37,967 --> 00:48:40,734
We in this space--
- Yep.

1267
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:42,867
- default because there
is so many personal brands

1268
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:44,667
monetizing personal brands

1269
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:48,100
but to build your
brand, John Deere,

1270
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,066
or Reebok or
Sun Chips, you know,

1271
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:53,834
these are just brands,
build the brands.

1272
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:56,834
Or law firms, 
or clients that you,

1273
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,800
Ogilvy, or even VaynerMedia,
I mean the big joke

1274
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,934
at VaynerMedia
now is how many people

1275
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:03,500
come into the office as clients

1276
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,333
and have no idea I even exist,

1277
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,700
the brand in Madison
Avenue and Fortune 500

1278
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,000
is bigger than me, 
and I'm pumped.

1279
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,700
That's what
you're supposed to do

1280
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,967
when you're trying to scale.

1281
00:49:13,967 --> 00:49:15,467
- Yep, very cool.

1282
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:18,800
Why do you think Snapchat won?

1283
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,433
What was it about
and continues to win?

1284
00:49:21,433 --> 00:49:23,233
'Cause Facebook had it.
- Scale, scale.

1285
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:26,200
- But why did it scale?
- Because it was easy.

1286
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,400
- Why did the cool
kids start playing with it?

1287
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,633
- It was just the
right time in maturity

1288
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,500
for Facebook
where 15 to 19 year olds

1289
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,233
were like I don't
want to do that

1290
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:37,467
because I don't
think my seven year older

1291
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:39,266
brother is that cool
and I definitely don't think

1292
00:49:39,266 --> 00:49:40,767
my fucking mom is cool.

1293
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:44,667
It's really night club
New York City dynamics

1294
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,100
and it will continue.

1295
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,900
Snapchat in seven years is
going to be old people place

1296
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,600
and something is
going to come across.

1297
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,433
But it had multiple things.

1298
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:55,000
Number one, it was
another place to hide

1299
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,533
from mom and dad with
the shit that you want to do.

1300
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,166
Two, it disappeared.

1301
00:49:59,166 --> 00:49:59,867
You know what's so funny?

1302
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:01,467
People are like,
oh, but it disappears.

1303
00:50:01,467 --> 00:50:03,500
Yeah, you mean
like the way we actually

1304
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,300
communicate with each other?

1305
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,800
Snapchat is far
more similar to the way

1306
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,734
humans communicate
than Twitter or Facebook

1307
00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:13,400
and so it won on that.

1308
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,500
It won on the scale
of just word of mouth

1309
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,300
and not Evan Spiegel
did an amazing job

1310
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,834
keeping it pure and not
over-branding it

1311
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:25,300
and turning it into
a business too quick.

1312
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,433
So just one of those things.

1313
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:29,400
- So there will
be another Snapchat,

1314
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,633
there will be another
generation that comes up.

1315
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:32,467
- I believe so.

1316
00:50:32,467 --> 00:50:33,533
- And it's just
incumbent upon us

1317
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:34,667
if we want to continue
the stand up there--

1318
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,667
- Here's how I see it guys.

1319
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,900
I think this is
the television in 1965.

1320
00:50:41,734 --> 00:50:43,900
I actually like
I know a lot of you

1321
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,066
are like whatever, but just
really pay attention to this,

1322
00:50:46,066 --> 00:50:47,967
because this might be one
of the better things I say.

1323
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:50,667
This, this is the television

1324
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:53,600
in 1965 and the TVs,

1325
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,433
they're the radio.

1326
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:57,400
(stammering)

1327
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,333
What I do well, for somebody
who is a shit student,

1328
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:02,300
the one thing
I do study is history,

1329
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,667
'cause history loves
to repeat its fucking self.

1330
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,734
Right, and so if you
go look at the brands,

1331
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:11,100
the beer brands
that were romantic about

1332
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,967
staying on the radio
because that's how they did it

1333
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:16,166
and didn't shift to
television while things

1334
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:18,166
like Miller Lite that
nobody's ever heard of

1335
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:22,633
went TV only and became
the brands, if you look at

1336
00:51:22,633 --> 00:51:25,800
TV 1965, that's
what I think this is.

1337
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,867
And I think YouTube,
Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat

1338
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:33,734
are ABC, NBC and CBS.

1339
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,166
And then I think I within
it is M*A*S*H and Happy Days.

1340
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:42,066
(audience laughter)
Got it?

1341
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:44,734
So that's the system,
so do I think over time

1342
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,467
ESPN comes around and HBO comes?

1343
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:51,133
I do, there will be more
channels built on this platform

1344
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,233
and they'll be more competition

1345
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:54,934
that's what's happening

1346
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:57,767
and so what you need
to do for your business

1347
00:51:57,767 --> 00:51:59,433
figure out the
channels where you

1348
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:02,567
could be the
star of that network.

1349
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:03,667
- Yeah, really.
- You like that right?

1350
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:04,633
- Was that helpful?
- It's good.

1351
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:06,633
- That was some good stuff.

1352
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:09,300
I like that. 
Yeah, I like that a lot.

1353
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,967
So let's go, let's pick
some question from the crowd.

1354
00:52:10,967 --> 00:52:12,533
You want to start on one side?

1355
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:13,600
- [Man] Yo Gary,
 I got a question--

1356
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,467
- Yo, yo, yo, ladies first dude.

1357
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:17,667
- [Man] My bad,
my bad, the lady here.

1358
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,166
- Go ahead, darling.

1359
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,433
He does have a
huge beard though.

1360
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:22,800
- He does.
- So he goes next.

1361
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,433
- He could be hiding a
knife in there or something.

1362
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,800
- Gary, my question is you
have for your book marketing--

1363
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,934
- [Gary] Can you
get the mic closer?

1364
00:52:28,934 --> 00:52:31,700
- Yeah, for your
book marketing right now,

1365
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,467
for your book launch, you
have an entire barter page

1366
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:36,500
set up for the
street team and everything.

1367
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,533
And for podcasts, we
are doing the bulk orders

1368
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:41,333
and for live events,
but what about authors

1369
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:43,533
who have a much
smaller following,

1370
00:52:43,533 --> 00:52:46,834
maybe 10, 20, 30,000
people in their list?

1371
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:48,567
How can they do
something similar

1372
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:51,900
to be able to move
books in a creative way?

1373
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,734
- [Gary] They can do the
same thing I'm doing.

1374
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:55,800
I started that barter thing,
which has become

1375
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,233
a big standard for
bigger personalities

1376
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:01,266
with Crush It! when I was small

1377
00:53:01,266 --> 00:53:03,533
and the numbers
just look different.

1378
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:06,800
Now to even get me to
record my voice for your alarm

1379
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,734
is 50 books, when I did
Crush It!, seven years ago,

1380
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:12,367
if you bought three
books, I'd fucking come

1381
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:15,100
and babysit your
fucking kids, right?

1382
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,967
- [Ryan] That sounds
like a great prize.

1383
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:20,266
Yeah, that sounds like yeah.

1384
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,200
I got four of them,
you could lose a couple

1385
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,900
and we'd be all right still.

1386
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,600
That's why we had multiple ones.

1387
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,000
- So to answer your question,

1388
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,233
I think you need to
recognize your worth

1389
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:33,000
of where you
feel your brand's at

1390
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,066
and create different models

1391
00:53:34,066 --> 00:53:35,800
and maybe it's a two book deal,
an eight book deal,

1392
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,867
and a twelve book deal,
 I think I topped out

1393
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:40,533
at 500 for Crush It!,
which was like literally

1394
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:42,967
like I will become
your best friend

1395
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:44,500
and now I start there

1396
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,934
because I've been
able to grow and have

1397
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,233
it's just supply and demand,

1398
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:48,667
no different than
the attention thing,

1399
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,700
but you should do it because
it gives you a framework,

1400
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,400
especially if you keep doing it.

1401
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,967
The other thing I did
 to make Crush It! work

1402
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:57,700
that was I did it and then
I didn't rely on my audience,

1403
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,100
I went out and
sold it like a salesman

1404
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,900
and so you can create
it and then go and sell it

1405
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,400
instead of just
hoping people land on it.

1406
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,633
There's way too many people

1407
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:08,667
that are obsessed
with scale, right?

1408
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:10,367
Let's run Facebook
ads to my Barter page,

1409
00:54:10,367 --> 00:54:12,867
whatever happens happens,
there's just not enough

1410
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:15,700
actual working the phones,
going to conferences,

1411
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,467
calling people, e-mailing the
way I sell

1412
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:21,033
my most books is by
literally sitting down

1413
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:23,600
for normally two
straight days straight,

1414
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,500
18 hour day,
 36 hours within 48 hours

1415
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,700
and go in my
address book of my e-mail,

1416
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,100
sit there, type the letter
A, start with the first name,

1417
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,633
decide what my
relationship with that person is

1418
00:54:35,633 --> 00:54:36,800
and then e-mail them.

1419
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,500
And I go as low as hey man,
I have a new book coming out,

1420
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,667
this is somebody I
barely know or I've interacted

1421
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:43,700
once or twice, I'd
love for you to check it out

1422
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,700
and maybe leave a
social review up to like

1423
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,834
hey dickface, if you
don't buy 5,000 books,

1424
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:51,300
you're fucking dead, 
right and so--

1425
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,800
- [Ryan] The good friends 
get that one.

1426
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,734
- That's right and so 
I would tell you the single best

1427
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:59,066
way to sell books
is actually sit down

1428
00:54:59,066 --> 00:55:01,266
and do the non-scalable things,

1429
00:55:01,266 --> 00:55:03,066
instead of the scalable things.

1430
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,400
- [Woman] Yeah, thank you.

1431
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,367
- Alright, bearded. 
[Ryan] Alright,

1432
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:06,533
the man with a
knife hidden in his beard.

1433
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:08,767
- Well, I apologize,
ladies first, beards second.

1434
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,066
(audience laughing)

1435
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:11,200
With that being said Gary,

1436
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600
you hit the nail on
the head when you alluded

1437
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,400
to video being the future,

1438
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,133
and that you know
people's attention spans

1439
00:55:16,133 --> 00:55:19,233
are just fucking
rapidly shrinking these days.

1440
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,600
- [Gary] Be careful, be careful.

1441
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,033
I actually think
that that is a misnomer.

1442
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:24,367
- Well their attention
 spans are shrinking

1443
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:27,367
when I think it comes to
reading content that's boring.

1444
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:28,333
Like they want to see video,

1445
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,700
and if you can
lock them into the first

1446
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,300
you know couple seconds
of a video like you said,

1447
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,300
you have a four
minute 18 second video,

1448
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,900
that's taking
someone's attention onboard

1449
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,533
for 258 fucking seconds.

1450
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,734
That's a long ass time.

1451
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,100
So where do you
see this sweet spot?

1452
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,000
Obviously it's
platform dependent,

1453
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,533
and you're not gonna
have a two minute video

1454
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:45,700
on a 15 second Instagram 
or Snapchat's different.

1455
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,500
But when we're
talking just Facebook,

1456
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,233
how do you see you
know your audience?

1457
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:51,433
Where is the spot that
you want to have a video

1458
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:52,700
before you pull them
in and you have those

1459
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,900
17,000 leads to be
able to follow up with?

1460
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,166
- [Gary] So I think the
thing with Facebook

1461
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,266
that people have to understand

1462
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:59,734
is you have to create video
that's native for the platform.

1463
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:02,100
The reason I wrote
Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook

1464
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,767
was because people
were using social networks

1465
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:06,767
as distribution
instead of creating for it.

1466
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:09,867
So there's a very
different vibe and context

1467
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,133
that you have
to make videos for,

1468
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:13,700
as any brand, even
if you're Burberry,

1469
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,700
you still have to
make Snapchat videos

1470
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,867
in a much more
authentic, childish,

1471
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:19,734
you know kinda street way

1472
00:56:19,734 --> 00:56:21,400
than you make your
Facebook video, right?

1473
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,667
So first and foremost,
when I think about Instagram,

1474
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:25,834
Snapchat, and Facebook videos,

1475
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:29,066
I think about the room and
the psychology of the person

1476
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:31,200
while they're in
that room with the video.

1477
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,967
Specifically tactically,

1478
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:36,300
if you don't have the
first three second of your video

1479
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,266
strategy for Facebook,
 you're an idiot.

1480
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:41,367
You have a 100th of a second
to get these people in a feed,

1481
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,900
those first three
seconds are fucking everything,

1482
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,667
including the copy,
including how you do it.

1483
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:49,967
How many people here have
watched #AskGaryVee on Facebook?

1484
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:51,934
Just raise your hand.
Thank you first of all.

1485
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,734
Second of all,
you guys all know,

1486
00:56:53,734 --> 00:56:56,433
I'm always recording
something that's like, stop,

1487
00:56:56,433 --> 00:56:59,133
like I'm trying to
stop your actual feed

1488
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:00,934
because I know
that the speed's there.

1489
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:03,100
So my strategy within
a Facebook environment,

1490
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,300
the sweet spot is not
necessarily the length,

1491
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,100
but what the first
three to four seconds are

1492
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,367
and what the copy is,

1493
00:57:08,367 --> 00:57:10,734
because I don't even get
your attention or consideration

1494
00:57:10,734 --> 00:57:12,734
for it unless I do that,

1495
00:57:12,734 --> 00:57:16,533
on top of which, the ad
planning and the targeting.

1496
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,100
Like if I'm targeting
seriously good looking dude

1497
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,233
with huge fucking beard

1498
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:21,767
that might go to a
conference in San Diego,

1499
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:23,734
I'm gonna get you.
- [Man] Yeah.

1500
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:25,333
- Got it?
- [Man] Shit, on point.

1501
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:29,567
- So the planning, the planning
of who I'm trying to get

1502
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:31,200
and then the
first three seconds,

1503
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,767
that's what matters
the most on Facebook video.

1504
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,433
- [Man] Good shit man.
- You got it brother.

1505
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:38,467
- I feel like you and
I get very different questions

1506
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:40,600
when we're up here.
(audience laughing)

1507
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,000
From very different people.

1508
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,533
- Brand, you know.

1509
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:44,967
- Absolutely has a
knife in his beard, go ahead.

1510
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:46,600
(audience laughter)

1511
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,800
- [Sebastian] No beard, 
no knife, I'm safe.

1512
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,667
I'm Sebastian,
I'm from thefrenchmarketer.com,

1513
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:56,967
and my concern is about the
brand stuff that you mentioned.

1514
00:57:57,633 --> 00:58:00,800
We are reaching
hundreds of thousands of people,

1515
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,333
and I want to reach millions,

1516
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:03,900
and I'm using my personal brand,

1517
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,567
so I'm connecting with
people on Facebook Live

1518
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:07,867
and doing all of that.

1519
00:58:07,867 --> 00:58:10,800
But the quality that
Facebook Live allows me to do

1520
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,467
for instance is way,

1521
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:17,467
I would say, it's a lower
representation of the brand

1522
00:58:17,467 --> 00:58:20,667
than what I would do if
I was doing my usual video.

1523
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:24,433
And is that,
might that be a problem

1524
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:26,633
for the congruence
of the brand as we go

1525
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:28,567
to a bigger audience?

1526
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:31,700
- I think human beings
should be very careful

1527
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,633
about trying to go
too luxurious, right?

1528
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:36,200
So like if you're
trying to put yourself

1529
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,000
into a more serious place,

1530
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,367
or a higher visual quality,

1531
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:42,266
you know look,
you're talking to a dude

1532
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:45,967
who did 1,000
episodes of a wine show

1533
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:50,333
where it literally
looked like I was a hostage

1534
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:51,700
in Afghanistan.

1535
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,000
(audience laughing)

1536
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,166
Like there was no lighting,

1537
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,967
I didn't use a mic,

1538
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,100
like there was zero editing.

1539
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,233
Like and so I'm
always gonna believe

1540
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:06,800
that the content you know,

1541
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,600
even with DRock now,

1542
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,667
for people in
here that follow me,

1543
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:11,967
they always hear me
making jokes about the lighting

1544
00:59:11,967 --> 00:59:13,567
and things of that nature.

1545
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:16,467
I never want to tell
people what they should

1546
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:17,567
or shouldn't do.

1547
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:19,467
I will say this,

1548
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:21,300
I think it is dangerous,

1549
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,033
and I've watched
very carefully on this

1550
00:59:23,033 --> 00:59:24,333
for the last 10 years,

1551
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,633
of people trying
to propel themselves

1552
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:29,900
to a higher quality and status,

1553
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,967
because they become less
authentic to the end user.

1554
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:34,200
And I think they're leaving

1555
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,567
a lot of
opportunity on the table,

1556
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:38,000
and they're spending a
lot of time and infrastructure

1557
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,500
on shit that doesn't matter.

1558
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,300
Facebook Live will let
you do the quality you want

1559
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,633
if you put it in a studio,

1560
00:59:44,633 --> 00:59:47,233
set it on a tripod, set it up.

1561
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:49,500
I mean there's
plenty of like ability

1562
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,533
for you to make it fancier
than just walking around.

1563
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:55,266
But you're leaving a
lot of content, serendipity,

1564
00:59:55,266 --> 00:59:58,333
and just compatible
and like acceptance

1565
00:59:58,333 --> 00:59:59,967
instead of putting
you on a pedestal.

1566
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:02,333
A lot of people want
to monetize that pedestal.

1567
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:04,000
That pedestal is
a lot more dangerous

1568
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,667
than I think people realize.

1569
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:07,433
- [Sebastian] So you 
think it's better to monetize

1570
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:10,633
like one-on-one
feel of the video

1571
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:11,800
rather than--
- Look I think

1572
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,900
everybody should roll the way

1573
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,767
they want to roll, right?

1574
01:00:13,767 --> 01:00:15,266
Like you're
dressed sharp as fuck,

1575
01:00:15,266 --> 01:00:16,433
like I'm only

1576
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:17,600
- [Sebastian] Thank you.
- [Ryan] He's French,

1577
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,900
they have to.
(audience laughing)

1578
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,567
- I get it, but like,

1579
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:23,567
only funerals, like
that's a funeral getup for me,

1580
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:24,533
that's about it.

1581
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:26,600
(audience laughing)

1582
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,300
But, it works for you,

1583
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,834
and so you need to be you.

1584
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,934
But I would be very careful,

1585
01:00:32,934 --> 01:00:37,233
very careful to disrespect
the platform over yourself,

1586
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,133
unless you're
fucking Jaguar or Tiffanys,

1587
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:43,500
like it's awesome
that you are who you are,

1588
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,734
but I think Facebook
is more important than you

1589
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:46,567
in that equation,

1590
01:00:46,567 --> 01:00:48,734
and I think you
need to adjust to it

1591
01:00:48,734 --> 01:00:50,700
more than they
need to adjust to you.

1592
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,834
- Thank you.
- [Gary] You're welcome.

1593
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:53,800
Hey darlin'.

1594
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,066
- [Hilary] Hi Gary, I'm Hilary.

1595
01:00:55,066 --> 01:00:56,934
You asked about,
or you encouraged us

1596
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:59,367
in hopping on
emerging platforms,

1597
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:01,734
and then also
creating our own commercials,

1598
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:02,900
TV shows, so I wanted to

1599
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,633
- [Gary] Let me just say one
thing before you go any further

1600
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:06,500
on emerging platforms.
- Go for it.

1601
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,700
- I love emerging platforms.

1602
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,266
I'm spending a
ton of time right now

1603
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:12,500
analyzing After School,
Musical.ly,

1604
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,000
tons of other things.

1605
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,066
I encourage, when I go and
put my name behind something,

1606
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:19,266
like I'm doing
right now with Snapchat,

1607
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:23,066
I don't consider 150
million active monthly users

1608
01:01:23,066 --> 01:01:24,867
emerging, got it?

1609
01:01:24,867 --> 01:01:27,200
What I'm good at
is talking about today

1610
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,533
while everybody else is waiting.
- [Hilary] Mhmmm.

1611
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:31,300
- Right, I've been
talking about you know

1612
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,667
I don't know how many
people follow me here,

1613
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,033
but I've been
getting a kick out of showing

1614
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:37,533
my 2013 points
of view on Snapchat

1615
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:40,834
to show how long, this is
not a spur of the moment thing.

1616
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,500
I'm encouraging people here

1617
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,934
to go on platforms
that are relevant today

1618
01:01:45,934 --> 01:01:48,633
instead of waiting two
years after they're relevant.

1619
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,900
Got it?
It's not emerging to me.

1620
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,133
I haven't even gotten
that loud about Periscope

1621
01:01:53,133 --> 01:01:54,367
and Meerkat and Facebook Live,

1622
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:55,867
even though they're very strong.

1623
01:01:55,867 --> 01:01:56,967
Like I wait to.

1624
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:58,367
- [Hilary] That was gonna
be my question.

1625
01:01:58,367 --> 01:02:00,467
- [Gary] Interesting, 
go ahead, what is it?

1626
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,000
- So I wondered
what your thoughts were

1627
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,400
on Periscope and its
competitors as far as

1628
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,567
the need and strategy in future.

1629
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:10,300
- [Gary] Yeah I mean look
I'm very intrigued by it.

1630
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,700
I love live video.

1631
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,667
I think Ustream back in
2009 was a big brand builder

1632
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:17,300
for me even more so
maybe than YouTube and Twitter,

1633
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,300
believe it or not.

1634
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,633
I think a lot of
people are doing it.

1635
01:02:19,633 --> 01:02:22,834
I've been stunned by how bad,

1636
01:02:22,834 --> 01:02:24,800
at least by my,
I'm just one person,

1637
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,800
but like boy there's
a lot of shit content.

1638
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,734
'Cause live is hard.

1639
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:29,767
Live is hard,

1640
01:02:29,767 --> 01:02:31,500
but I think the people
that break out in live,

1641
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,100
whether it's Periscope
or Facebook Live that win.

1642
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,400
Look I wrote a
huge check into Meerkat.

1643
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,100
You know it's funny, I wrote
a $5 million check in my fund

1644
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:43,066
into Snapchat at a
$15.5 billion valuation.

1645
01:02:43,066 --> 01:02:44,433
So I can do well,

1646
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:46,000
but a lot of my
buddies were like,

1647
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,867
oh you're just pushing Snapchat
because you're an investor.

1648
01:02:47,867 --> 01:02:49,867
I'm like, I'm
not pushing Meerkat

1649
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:51,967
where I have way better finances

1650
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:53,834
because I'm using
Periscope and Facebook Live,

1651
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:55,600
because my word is more valuable

1652
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,333
than any individual investment.

1653
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:59,533
So, I do think it's
gonna be Facebook Live

1654
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:02,200
and/or, and/or
Periscope that win.

1655
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,900
'Cause they're got
the scaled platforms.

1656
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,667
I think they're very
intriguing platforms.

1657
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,934
I get a lot of value
out of them, I like it.

1658
01:03:08,934 --> 01:03:10,700
I do think people
should try to do it.

1659
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,567
Live is hard,

1660
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,500
but if you're capable
and you're enjoying it,

1661
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,934
I would bet on
it because I think

1662
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:18,200
it also as at enough of a scale

1663
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,700
that you're not
taking a big risk.

1664
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,433
- [Hilary] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1665
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:25,367
Hello.

1666
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:26,867
- You're up.
- Yep, you're up.

1667
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:29,000
- Yeah, okay, hi Gary.

1668
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,834
- [Gary] Hi.

1669
01:03:29,834 --> 01:03:32,333
- So basically,

1670
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,000
you know you spend a lot of time

1671
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,100
evangelizing Snapchat.
- [Gary] Yes.

1672
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,600
- Not just here
but at other platforms

1673
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,934
where I've been seeing you.
- [Gary] Yes.

1674
01:03:39,934 --> 01:03:41,166
- You have been
talking about Snapchat.

1675
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:41,600
- [Gary] Yes.

1676
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,266
- Now my 19-year-old
sister uses a lot of Snapchat,

1677
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:48,033
but now that she's 21
she's stopped using it.

1678
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,900
(audience laughing)

1679
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,467
- [Gary] Maybe because
she's drunk as fuck.

1680
01:03:51,467 --> 01:03:54,266
(audience laughing)

1681
01:03:54,266 --> 01:03:55,934
- [Ryan] It's a
correlation versus causation

1682
01:03:55,934 --> 01:03:56,967
kind of thing, right?

1683
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:58,433
- So go ahead, go ahead.

1684
01:03:58,433 --> 01:03:59,433
- [Woman] Okay,
so my question is

1685
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:02,266
that I can just go ahead
and open a Snapchat account

1686
01:04:02,266 --> 01:04:05,667
right away, but I
want to understand that,

1687
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:08,834
what does Snapchat really mean

1688
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:12,700
for a business that
has a workplace consistency

1689
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,266
and serving other
businesses and agencies,

1690
01:04:15,266 --> 01:04:18,266
what would it really
mean for a company like that?

1691
01:04:18,266 --> 01:04:21,233
- [Gary] So I think for B2B
business on Snapchat it's,

1692
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:22,867
I'm gonna give you an analogy

1693
01:04:22,867 --> 01:04:24,967
that some of you will get,
some of you won't.

1694
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:27,200
One of the most
fascinating ad campaigns

1695
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,934
of the last 30
years in my opinion

1696
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:32,066
was when ESPN in the
late 80s and early 90s

1697
01:04:32,066 --> 01:04:33,867
started to make
commercials about their office

1698
01:04:33,867 --> 01:04:35,900
and their sportscasters.

1699
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,934
The reason they did that

1700
01:04:37,934 --> 01:04:39,967
was because they
knew that Fox and CNN

1701
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:42,867
were about launch
rival sports networks,

1702
01:04:42,867 --> 01:04:44,567
and they knew that
anybody could cover

1703
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:46,567
Michael Jordan
and Ken Griffey, Jr.

1704
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:47,967
That was commoditized.

1705
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,433
But if they got us to
care about Keith Olbermann

1706
01:04:50,433 --> 01:04:52,934
and Stuart Scott
and Dan Patrick,

1707
01:04:52,934 --> 01:04:54,700
that that was their
competitive advantage.

1708
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,367
I literally am throwing
you for a curveball here,

1709
01:04:57,367 --> 01:04:59,333
but this is my actual belief.

1710
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,967
I believe there's
a company in here

1711
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:02,834
that is a B-to-B
company that could open up

1712
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,800
a Snapchat
account for their company,

1713
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,133
hand it off to
the most charismatic

1714
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:07,800
and fun people in the office,

1715
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,767
and do their
version of "The Office,"

1716
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:13,033
which would then be watched
by a small group of people

1717
01:05:13,033 --> 01:05:15,467
if they start to
promote it in other channels

1718
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:17,066
within the B-to-B landscape,

1719
01:05:17,066 --> 01:05:21,533
and that people liking you
guys would lead to business.

1720
01:05:22,867 --> 01:05:24,900
So, you know a lot
of people are like,

1721
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,734
well you can't do it.

1722
01:05:25,734 --> 01:05:29,300
You can, now,
you'd have to be likable.

1723
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,233
You'd have to know
how to make content.

1724
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:32,367
You'd have to know how to use

1725
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:34,333
all your other channels to get,

1726
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,800
and by the way, all you
need as a B-to-B company,

1727
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,700
you have a B-to-B company?

1728
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,500
- [Woman 2] Yeah.

1729
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,433
- How many current
clients do you have?

1730
01:05:41,433 --> 01:05:43,300
- Well we serve
agencies basically

1731
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:48,000
and we have a team of
13 people based in India.

1732
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,533
- How many agencies
are buying your product?

1733
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:51,033
I mean is it 50, is it 100?

1734
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:52,000
I mean, I'm not.

1735
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,500
- Yeah about 50 to 100.
- [Gary] Great.

1736
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,800
All you need is another 50

1737
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,066
for your business to
be substantially bigger,

1738
01:05:57,066 --> 01:05:59,567
so you don't need 30,000 views

1739
01:05:59,567 --> 01:06:01,567
when you're paying
consumer like I am.

1740
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:03,734
You need 80 people

1741
01:06:03,734 --> 01:06:06,000
to just sign up and
follow and pay attention

1742
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,166
and to think that
Stan in accounting's

1743
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:09,734
a real fucking hoot.

1744
01:06:09,734 --> 01:06:12,500
(audience laughter)

1745
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:17,100
And so I think more
people that understand

1746
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:21,400
that Snapchat is a
version of YouTube 2006,

1747
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,900
but back to the
nice French gentleman,

1748
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,200
a lot easier to produce.

1749
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,266
Once you get it,
Snapchat's been interesting.

1750
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:30,734
Twitter, people didn't get,

1751
01:06:30,734 --> 01:06:32,734
and people never got.

1752
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:33,867
Like I've watched it.

1753
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:36,133
Like if you understand
how small Twitter is

1754
01:06:36,133 --> 01:06:38,300
when television, which
is the biggest platform

1755
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,667
in the world of attention,

1756
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:41,934
has fallen over itself
for the last seven years

1757
01:06:41,934 --> 01:06:45,066
promoting Twitter, for
Twitter to be the size it is,

1758
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:47,000
speaks to it being broken.

1759
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,867
Snapchat's been very
interesting for me to watch

1760
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:51,367
because people
really don't get it

1761
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:52,767
the first day or two,

1762
01:06:52,767 --> 01:06:54,867
but when they get it,
they're stuck.

1763
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:56,734
My 40 year old brother-in-law,

1764
01:06:56,734 --> 01:06:59,133
who is my brother-in-law
so he knows all that stuff,

1765
01:06:59,133 --> 01:07:02,934
he's living in Snapchat now

1766
01:07:02,934 --> 01:07:04,100
in a world where he
would have never 

1767
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:04,967
followed the other things.

1768
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:08,100
So I would say making
content that's compelling.

1769
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,000
But look, I'm
doing business content.

1770
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,967
You're more than
welcome at 10 cents a,

1771
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:13,667
10 seconds at a time,

1772
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,500
to put out content of
how to use your product,

1773
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,734
best practices, you can
go a lot of places with it.

1774
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:18,700
You can go the
"The Office" route,

1775
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,567
you can go with
kinda like a you know

1776
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:24,133
a simulcast kind
of information play.

1777
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:25,900
It just depends on where
you want to go creatively.

1778
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,400
But I will tell you,

1779
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,667
I will tell you this,

1780
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:30,967
over the next five years,
the platform's gonna matter,

1781
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:32,567
there's gonna be a
lot of attention on it.

1782
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:33,633
- [Woman 2] Right, thank you.

1783
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:34,934
- Your sister will be back.

1784
01:07:34,934 --> 01:07:36,166
(audience laughter)

1785
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:37,433
- [Ryan] When she sobers up.

1786
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:38,934
(audience laughter)
- We'll bring her back.

1787
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:40,633
So with this, I think you know,

1788
01:07:40,633 --> 01:07:42,867
we'll go on YouTube and
Snapchat and let's be friends,

1789
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:45,400
thank you.
- [Gary] You're welcome.

1790
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,567
By the way, as a quick tidbit

1791
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:48,066
that I've been
telling a lot of people,

1792
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:51,266
you should go to YouTube
and search how to use Snapchat.

1793
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:52,767
A lot of you like it
doesn't come natively,

1794
01:07:52,767 --> 01:07:55,066
it's just a different
platform for a lot of people.

1795
01:07:55,066 --> 01:07:57,200
Like YouTube is the
second biggest search engine

1796
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,400
in the world,

1797
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,600
and in my opinion
the best to teach people

1798
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,233
how to do things because
of the way most people

1799
01:08:03,233 --> 01:08:05,200
map to visual and audio.

1800
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,967
So, if you want a quick
hack to be up to speed on this,

1801
01:08:08,967 --> 01:08:10,200
by tomorrow morning
you would understand it

1802
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,533
if you watched 15
minutes of content.

1803
01:08:13,533 --> 01:08:14,700
What's up brother?

1804
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,533
- Hey, my name's Billy Gene,

1805
01:08:16,533 --> 01:08:17,600
from billygeneismarketing.com.

1806
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,000
- [Gary] A little
closer on the mic.

1807
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,533
- I have a Facebook Ads
agency up the street from here.

1808
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:23,500
But Gary, I actually
wanted to come up here

1809
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,000
just to commend you man.

1810
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,867
I sat next to you at a bar
in like a couple years ago

1811
01:08:28,867 --> 01:08:30,966
at a Nick Unsworth event,

1812
01:08:30,966 --> 01:08:31,666
and you were sitting there,

1813
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:34,367
and I was there for him
and I had no idea who you were.

1814
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:36,265
But we sat next to each
other for like 15 minutes,

1815
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:37,466
and then you
were the guy speaking,

1816
01:08:37,466 --> 01:08:39,132
you were the
keynote at the time.

1817
01:08:39,133 --> 01:08:40,667
I had no idea who you were,

1818
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,000
but you just were the same dude.

1819
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,567
I mean you had so much energy,

1820
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:45,767
but you didn't
really have the authority

1821
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,600
and the brand that you have now.

1822
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,066
And then I've literally
followed you since that day,

1823
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:51,700
and dude your
hustle is so inspiring.

1824
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:54,466
Like the way you put out
1,000 episodes of #AskGaryVee

1825
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:55,733
or whatever it is,

1826
01:08:55,734 --> 01:08:58,734
it's crazy man to see how
much it's actually made you

1827
01:08:58,734 --> 01:08:59,966
and the revenue
it's brought you in

1828
01:08:59,966 --> 01:09:01,966
and how your agency has grown.

1829
01:09:01,966 --> 01:09:04,432
But like to see you
actually not just talk about it

1830
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:05,899
but sit next to you
when we were in a room

1831
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:07,599
full of 100 people,

1832
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,265
now to 3,000 people
and then you come up here

1833
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:10,933
and you just kill the stage.

1834
01:09:10,934 --> 01:09:12,033
It's just I just
want to tip my hat to you,

1835
01:09:12,033 --> 01:09:13,200
And on behalf--
- [Gary] Thank you so much.

1836
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,466
- of everyone here it's
like dude you're the truth,

1837
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:15,933
so I'll say that.
(audience applause)

1838
01:09:15,934 --> 01:09:17,800
- Thank you so much,
 thank you, brother.

1839
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,200
(audience applause)

1840
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:25,699
Thank you.

1841
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,100
How are you going to
follow that up, orange shirt?

1842
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,367
- [Ryan] And now
for a selfish question, go.

1843
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:35,000
- Uh yeah, actually,

1844
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,633
(audience laughter)

1845
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:38,899
but I do want that
inspires a greater share

1846
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:40,766
of vulnerability
for me actually,

1847
01:09:40,767 --> 01:09:42,300
so I actually resented
you and didn't want to listen

1848
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:46,633
to you, because you
were so all about the hustle

1849
01:09:46,633 --> 01:09:49,100
and I was actually trying
to get out of the hustling

1850
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,800
and try to find 
the answer and into--

1851
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,300
- [Gary] Right, the answer,
you know passive income,

1852
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,467
smoking weed in Jamaica
while shit just comes in.

1853
01:09:55,467 --> 01:09:56,867
(audience laughter)
- Exactly, so ...

1854
01:09:59,433 --> 01:10:01,066
- [Ryan] Is that not
how it works?

1855
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:02,400
- [Gary] Yeah, just go on Instagram

1856
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,567
they'll tell you,
they'll thank you, go ahead.

1857
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,767
- Yeah, anyways,
so now I'm actually

1858
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:08,500
really loving
you and enjoying you

1859
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,633
and I like your raw
take on human nature,

1860
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:12,633
and so your raw
take on human nature

1861
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:14,834
makes me actually
drop all my assumptions

1862
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:18,533
and all my paradoxes of
reality and just listen to you

1863
01:10:18,533 --> 01:10:20,533
and so I'm really curious.

1864
01:10:20,533 --> 01:10:22,667
With my business
being all about breakups

1865
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:26,367
and heartbreaks
and humans, I'm curious

1866
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:29,834
I'm not really I don't
need a tactical question,

1867
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:31,300
on like how to integrate
with Snapchat, I don't really

1868
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,200
give a shit, I just
mean what's your take

1869
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,367
on something so
fundamentally human

1870
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:38,900
and emotionally
rich and compelling?

1871
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,734
- [Gary] Well, let's do
what I normally do in

1872
01:10:40,734 --> 01:10:41,600
scenarios like this.

1873
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,166
This is what I think about
business and why I consult

1874
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:46,233
and why I invest,
so it's a really interesting,

1875
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:47,533
so first of all top line,

1876
01:10:47,533 --> 01:10:49,166
if you're talking about
breakups and relationships

1877
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:51,433
and things of that nature,
you're at the tippy top

1878
01:10:51,433 --> 01:10:55,433
of emotion which is immediately
interesting business, right?

1879
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:56,900
Like there's a lot to be done.

1880
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,367
I guess my next
question would be

1881
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:00,667
instead of doing something
you don't give a shit about,

1882
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:04,066
which would be a tactic,
leveling that up to a strategy

1883
01:11:04,066 --> 01:11:06,700
I have to understand what
you're trying to do backwards.

1884
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,233
I think the biggest mistake
for so many people in this

1885
01:11:08,233 --> 01:11:11,200
room is that you don't
know where your finish line is.

1886
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,367
And if you don't know
where your finish line is,

1887
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:14,867
you can't reverse engineer
it to make what happens.

1888
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:16,500
I know that I want to
buy the New York Jets,

1889
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,467
so three years ago,
I sold 30% of VaynerMedia

1890
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:23,066
when it was doing
$14 million in revenue

1891
01:11:23,066 --> 01:11:26,133
and I knew it would
do a 100 in two seconds

1892
01:11:26,133 --> 01:11:27,900
because the person
that wanted to buy it

1893
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,233
owned the Miami Dolphins

1894
01:11:29,233 --> 01:11:31,166
and I wanted to
get into the ecosystem,

1895
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:34,533
so I left tens of millions
of dollars on the table,

1896
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:36,033
because I know
what my finish line is

1897
01:11:36,033 --> 01:11:37,300
and I've mapped my behavior.

1898
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,433
And now I'm very
friendly with 11 owners,

1899
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:43,400
if I ever amass the wealth,
I'll easily get voted in

1900
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,834
and so that's how I'm thinking.

1901
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,100
Me as a proxy there,
I don't know if you want

1902
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,333
to buy the New York Jets
or things of that nature,

1903
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:53,967
but on a more granular level,

1904
01:11:53,967 --> 01:11:56,000
 at least short term,

1905
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,066
how do you want to monetize?

1906
01:11:57,066 --> 01:11:59,900
What are you trying to sell?
Your coaching advice,

1907
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,900
a product,
a service, what are you doing?

1908
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,100
- [Man 2] Yeah a combination
of product, services

1909
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,500
and soon to be supplements.

1910
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,967
- [Gary] So I think the thing
that you need to really think

1911
01:12:08,967 --> 01:12:11,333
about is building
awareness, and I think

1912
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:13,333
awareness comes through content.

1913
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:16,300
I just think people
grossly underestimate content.

1914
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,734
And you know it's
super ironic, because it's

1915
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,133
funny that that was your

1916
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:22,100
I do think Snapchat has a real
oppor--

1917
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,767
you know, let me
give you an example,

1918
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:25,600
Mike my personal
trainer, 18 months ago,

1919
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,133
I decided to take
care of my health,

1920
01:12:27,133 --> 01:12:29,333
I hired a full-time
health employee,

1921
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:31,700
travels with me,
the whole fucking nine. Right?

1922
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,700
He's done really well.

1923
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,834
He should be fucking paying me.

1924
01:12:34,834 --> 01:12:36,500
His business has done
5x because he just

1925
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,000
hangs around Vayner.
(audience laughter)

1926
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,667
I'm actually
quite bitter about it,

1927
01:12:40,667 --> 01:12:45,066
so anyway, so he's
been doing Facebook

1928
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:46,467
and YouTube and
doing all this stuff

1929
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:49,467
and definitely like
playing my blueprint.

1930
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:53,233
Since January 4th,
Snapchat has sold more

1931
01:12:53,233 --> 01:12:56,066
people to his
platform of $400 a month

1932
01:12:56,066 --> 01:12:58,834
online health
coaching than anything

1933
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,433
he did in Facebook or Google for

1934
01:13:00,433 --> 01:13:03,000
two and a half years.

1935
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,467
Right, like seriously?

1936
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:06,934
Like even that's
surprising to me,

1937
01:13:06,934 --> 01:13:08,633
we're talking about seven weeks.

1938
01:13:08,633 --> 01:13:10,834
It just has that much attention.

1939
01:13:10,834 --> 01:13:13,133
I guess health coaching
is more of a human thing

1940
01:13:13,133 --> 01:13:14,333
and it makes sense.

1941
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:16,700
I actually weirdly
think it could be ironic and

1942
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,266
a continuation of our story

1943
01:13:18,266 --> 01:13:19,233
that the thing that you said

1944
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:21,300
I don't care about
the tactics on Snapchat,

1945
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,467
I actually think
if you're capable

1946
01:13:22,467 --> 01:13:24,300
or somebody in your organization

1947
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,667
is capable to produce
content in that environment

1948
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:29,934
that there could be a really
great gateway drug to that.

1949
01:13:29,934 --> 01:13:33,367
I also think that if
you marketed against people

1950
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:36,834
whose relationship status
went from in a relationship

1951
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:39,700
to single and ran
Facebook ads with the right

1952
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,166
creative against that
demo on a daily basis,

1953
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:44,200
your fucking
business would explode.

1954
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,633
- [Man 2] That's not a
targeting feature yet,

1955
01:13:45,633 --> 01:13:46,734
but I'm praying for it.

1956
01:13:46,734 --> 01:13:48,333
- [Gary] It's coming.
- Cool.

1957
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:50,967
- [Gary] And so
that targeting feature is

1958
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:53,400
literally 40 seconds away.

1959
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,100
- Sweet.

1960
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,400
- [Gary] Yeah, so just wait
and fucking smoke weed

1961
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,000
in Jamaica until it comes out.

1962
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,600
- [Man 2] Thank you.
(audience laughter)

1963
01:14:01,934 --> 01:14:04,300
- [Ryan] We can maybe
do like one more row,

1964
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,400
unfortunately clock's getting--

1965
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,333
- Cool, my man.

1966
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,700
- [Man 3] Hi Gary,
welcome to San Diego man,

1967
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,000
thanks for coming
out, making the trip.

1968
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,900
- [Gary] Dude I love,
 how many people

1969
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,033
are here from San Diego?

1970
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:13,233
(audience cheers)

1971
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:14,767
- Dude I fucking love San Diego.

1972
01:14:14,767 --> 01:14:19,266
The Jets have won two
huge playoff games here.

1973
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:20,900
- [Ryan] You
see what he did there?

1974
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,400
See what he did there, he
set you up, you took the bait.

1975
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,133
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, at least it's not orange.

1976
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:27,200
- [Gary] Go ahead, man.

1977
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,600
- So one of my brands, we have

1978
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,533
about a thousand, under a
thousand orthodontic locations

1979
01:14:32,533 --> 01:14:33,667
and orthodontists are
different than dentists

1980
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:34,934
because they deal
with a lot of kids

1981
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:37,633
and they have to recirculate
patients and whatnot,

1982
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:40,467
so when we found out that
you were going to be here,

1983
01:14:40,467 --> 01:14:43,266
in one of our groups, I said
 hey going to get a chance

1984
01:14:43,266 --> 01:14:46,600
maybe to ask Gary a
question, what would you ask?

1985
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,567
So their question I think was
I could have probably guessed,

1986
01:14:51,567 --> 01:14:54,467
but I think what's cool
about you dude is the way

1987
01:14:54,467 --> 01:14:57,667
your goggles work is
what manifests your actions,

1988
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:59,233
it's your viewpoint.

1989
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:01,667
And so the
question that they I'll try

1990
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:03,767
to interpret this as best I can

1991
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:06,000
is ask Gary, go back
to when you were helping

1992
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
your dad, now imagine
you couldn't do it for him,

1993
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,100
but imagine that he
would take your advice,

1994
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,767
and imagine he
would do whatever it is

1995
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:15,033
that you needed him to do,

1996
01:15:15,033 --> 01:15:17,600
now imagine
he's an orthodontist,--

1997
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,533
- [Gary] Yep.

1998
01:15:18,533 --> 01:15:22,734
-and now imagine he's today,

1999
01:15:22,734 --> 01:15:24,533
this is happening right now,

2000
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:27,467
they said ask Gary
if I was Gary's dad

2001
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:29,400
and it was an
orthodontist and it was today,

2002
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,166
what would he be doing
to help us move the needle

2003
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:33,700
if he was our kid and
 I'm like alright.

2004
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,700
- [Gary] And these are
orthodontists who have offices

2005
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,834
in local places
all over the country?

2006
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:39,133
- [Man 3] Yeah,
we're under a thousand

2007
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:40,266
locations right now,
but there are--

2008
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:42,033
- And this is the
gateway to get people

2009
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:44,400
to get moms to bring their
kids into the orthodontist?

2010
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,934
- You're talking a lot of
14-year-old kids

2011
01:15:45,934 --> 01:15:48,367
with the sort of rite of
passage thing going on--

2012
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:51,800
- [Gary] But I assume the
mother is making the decision

2013
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,200
in that business
decision to which

2014
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,333
orthodontist
they're going to use.

2015
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,233
- It's interesting,
you can market to both

2016
01:15:58,233 --> 01:16:00,533
and they can kind of get
them to communicate to children.

2017
01:16:00,533 --> 01:16:02,300
- [Gary] You could and so
I think what you do

2018
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,867
is I don't know the
business well enough,

2019
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:05,867
but I've had two toy clients,

2020
01:16:05,867 --> 01:16:08,400
the two biggest toy
companies in the world

2021
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,934
and I keep arguing with them.

2022
01:16:09,934 --> 01:16:12,266
They keep wanting
to market to the kids,

2023
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:14,500
which only because
of laws in America,

2024
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,467
which would also apply
to you because of the way

2025
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:18,967
advertising to kids works here,

2026
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:21,000
that means they can
only run TV commercials

2027
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,700
on like Nickelodeon, right?

2028
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,467
I've been arguing
to them that the mom

2029
01:16:25,467 --> 01:16:28,533
is much more of a decision
maker in that household,

2030
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:31,600
if it was my dad and
he was an orthodontist

2031
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,633
and I was 20 today,
I would convince him

2032
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,667
to move an enormous
amount of money to Facebook

2033
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:39,767
and I would spend it
all on 42-year-old mom

2034
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:43,700
with kids in a one
mile radius of our locations

2035
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,066
because that feels
the quickest practical way

2036
01:16:46,066 --> 01:16:48,333
to more dollars that
in year two would allow

2037
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,734
me to take 20% and
maybe start playing towards

2038
01:16:50,734 --> 01:16:53,133
the kids a little bit. Right?

2039
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:55,500
After School is a
really fascinating platform

2040
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,233
right now that I'm
paying attention to

2041
01:16:57,233 --> 01:17:00,300
that is basically
high school Facebook.

2042
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,166
You can only be in high school.

2043
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:03,467
You have to prove it
with your high school ID.

2044
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:04,567
That could be an
interesting platform,

2045
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:05,667
but they don't advertise yet,

2046
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:07,900
but I would keep an eye on
it and wait for them to open

2047
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,300
because whoever land grabs
first is going to under pay

2048
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,300
so those would become a but
I would go all in on Facebook.

2049
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:17,000
Facebook ads against
millennial moms is fucking gold.

2050
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,967
- [Man 3] Big time.
- Gold.

2051
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,600
- [Man 3] Cool and then the
girls just wanted to make sure,

2052
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,934
you actually are married right?

2053
01:17:21,934 --> 01:17:23,200
- [Gary] Yes.
- Okay, I was correct.

2054
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,667
- [Ryan] Are you making,
this is about to get real.

2055
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:27,133
- Married.
- She lives around town?

2056
01:17:27,133 --> 01:17:29,333
- Getting real in the
Whole Foods department here.

2057
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:32,467
Thanks Gary, appreciate it.
- Thanks brother.

2058
01:17:32,467 --> 01:17:33,533
Yo!

2059
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,000
- [Man 4] Hey dude.
- Hey dude.

2060
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,033
- [Man 4] So I own
a few e-com businesses

2061
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:39,800
that sell physical
products and I heard you

2062
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,133
talk briefly about
affiliate marketing,

2063
01:17:42,133 --> 01:17:46,567
no sorry mini influencer
 marketing on Instagram,

2064
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:50,367
where they have like
600 to 2,000 followers,

2065
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:54,633
one of my businesses,
I sell jewelry to women.

2066
01:17:54,633 --> 01:17:57,433
My idea was to
basically find hot chicks.

2067
01:17:57,433 --> 01:17:58,367
- [Gary] Period!

2068
01:17:58,367 --> 01:18:00,066
- Yeah, period.

2069
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:01,200
- [Gary] But keep going.

2070
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,667
- And send them a free product

2071
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:04,233
and hope that they post
it on their Instagram page

2072
01:18:04,233 --> 01:18:07,367
because they'll
influence their followers,

2073
01:18:07,367 --> 01:18:09,033
but you said you need 40,000.

2074
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:10,533
- [Gary] Just remember
that a lot of hot chicks

2075
01:18:10,533 --> 01:18:12,433
have a bunch of fucking
creeper dudes following them.

2076
01:18:12,433 --> 01:18:14,300
- I know, yeah,
you're right, yeah yeah.

2077
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,166
- [Gary] Go ahead, and that's a
serious point by the way.

2078
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,700
I'm giving you
something right away.

2079
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,166
We do a lot of
influencing to females

2080
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:22,166
and pretty girls do well
with converting other women

2081
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:24,800
into the funnel, but be careful,

2082
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,200
because a lot of them don't

2083
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,467
because it's all
scum buckets you know.

2084
01:18:30,467 --> 01:18:31,800
- [Man 4] Got it,
you also talked--

2085
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,567
- [Gary] There's an app called
Ground Signal that you should

2086
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:37,567
look at that will
give you scale against

2087
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:40,133
the targeting
terms that you want

2088
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,400
and that long
tail that you need.

2089
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,200
Otherwise, it will take
20 humans a million years.

2090
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,000
- Ground Signal okay, yeah, 

2091
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
that was the
answer to my question.

2092
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,834
- [Gary] I figured.

2093
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:47,667
- Because I wanted
to know how to quickly

2094
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:48,934
get 40,000 mini influencers.

2095
01:18:48,934 --> 01:18:50,433
- [Gary] Grab Ground Signal.
- Got it.

2096
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:51,667
All right thanks buddy.
- You got it, brother.

2097
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:53,467
- [Ryan] Ground signal.

2098
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:54,633
- Yep.

2099
01:18:54,633 --> 01:18:56,533
- [Ryan] You can find
that on the world wide web.

2100
01:18:56,533 --> 01:18:58,967
- That's the thing.
What's up my man?

2101
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,100
- Hey Gary, I wonder,

2102
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,767
where is grandma going 
after Snapchat?

2103
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,934
- [Gary] Death?

2104
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:12,033
(audience laughing)

2105
01:19:12,033 --> 01:19:15,000
So grandma, grandma is Facebook.

2106
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,867
Facebook, Facebook, Facebook.

2107
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:19,367
Grandma's not even
thinking about Snapchat yet.

2108
01:19:19,367 --> 01:19:21,066
If you're asking
me after Snapchat,

2109
01:19:21,066 --> 01:19:23,600
if Snapchat's able to
get to where I think it could

2110
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,600
and get to modern
grandma 10 years from now,

2111
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,867
which is really 49-year-old
 female now, 59 you know.

2112
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:33,400
I mean we're talking
20 years before I would

2113
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,934
be thinking about what's
grandma going to after Snapchat.

2114
01:19:36,934 --> 01:19:40,600
Grandma right now is
really entrenched in Facebook.

2115
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,133
One of the things
that would blow you away,

2116
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:44,600
I've started
investing in and advising

2117
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,700
companies that are targeting
50 to 90-year-old Americans,

2118
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,100
because Facebook is
so good for that demo.

2119
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,033
Because the good
thing about grandma is,

2120
01:19:53,033 --> 01:19:54,000
and it's not even on her phone,

2121
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,400
though it is more
and more every day,

2122
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,333
grandma's going through
that newsfeed nice and slow.

2123
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:01,533
(audience laughter)

2124
01:20:01,533 --> 01:20:03,433
- [Man 5]
What I was really asking also--

2125
01:20:03,433 --> 01:20:05,166
- [Ryan] So creepy
the way you just said that.

2126
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:07,700
- [Gary] It's just true.
- [Ryan] I know, I'm not just.

2127
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:08,900
- Go ahead.

2128
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,667
- [Man 5] What are two or
three platforms to look for

2129
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:13,567
in the next two or three years?

2130
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,367
- [Gary] Just in general?

2131
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:16,500
I think I mentioned them,

2132
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,266
I think the two
emerging platforms

2133
01:20:18,266 --> 01:20:20,633
that could become
as big as Snapchat,

2134
01:20:20,633 --> 01:20:22,200
or the next big thing,

2135
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,600
are Musical.ly and After School,

2136
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,433
so I would look at those two.

2137
01:20:26,433 --> 01:20:28,333
I think it's gonna
be really fascinating

2138
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:32,400
to see if Jack Dorsey can
turn Twitter's product around,

2139
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,033
which would then
start a five year process

2140
01:20:34,033 --> 01:20:36,100
of them reemerging.

2141
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,767
But I think spending
time worrying about that

2142
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:40,100
is super insignificant.

2143
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,934
I think there's so
much work to be done

2144
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:45,400
on Facebook,
Instagram, emerging Snapchat,

2145
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,100
email marketing,
Google, content, Medium.com,

2146
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,333
to write long-form
content to convert.

2147
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:52,033
There's so much to be done now.

2148
01:20:52,033 --> 01:20:54,133
It's kind of, you know
what you basically asked me,

2149
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:57,367
hey Gary, M*A*S*H or Seinfeld's
the number one show now,

2150
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:58,900
and I want to do commercials.

2151
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,834
What's gonna be the
number one show in four years?

2152
01:21:01,834 --> 01:21:04,567
I don't know, and
who gives a fuck, right?

2153
01:21:04,567 --> 01:21:05,834
Let's just run
the best commercials

2154
01:21:05,834 --> 01:21:07,734
while people are
watching Seinfeld,

2155
01:21:07,734 --> 01:21:11,400
and then we'll worry
about when ER comes along.

2156
01:21:13,233 --> 01:21:15,400
- [Man 5] Perfect, thank you.
- You got it.

2157
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,567
- [Ryan] Yeah,
two more unfortunately.

2158
01:21:17,567 --> 01:21:18,700
I gotta be the bad guy.

2159
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,567
- Really?

2160
01:21:19,567 --> 01:21:21,000
I thought we had 6:40?

2161
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,066
Okay let's just go.

2162
01:21:22,066 --> 01:21:23,166
- You want to go to 6:40?

2163
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:24,767
- [Gary] Yeah.
What's up my man?

2164
01:21:24,767 --> 01:21:26,133
- Long time listener,
first time caller,

2165
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:27,233
love you, love your show.

2166
01:21:27,233 --> 01:21:28,867
- [Gary] Thank you.

2167
01:21:28,867 --> 01:21:30,200
- Little radio shoutout.

2168
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:30,867
- [Gary] That was good.

2169
01:21:30,867 --> 01:21:32,667
- I've actually changed
my question three times

2170
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:33,567
since I've been up here,

2171
01:21:33,567 --> 01:21:35,867
but I'm gonna go with this one.
(audience laughter)

2172
01:21:35,867 --> 01:21:36,667
I've heard you say,

2173
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:37,600
I don't know if it
was a couple years ago

2174
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,433
or how long it was,

2175
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:39,967
but you kinda made a prediction,

2176
01:21:39,967 --> 01:21:41,166
and you were
talking about Amazon

2177
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,100
and how you predicted
Amazon would one day

2178
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,667
take Walmart down.

2179
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:47,100
And so I, since this is
theoretically a room full

2180
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,100
of internet marketers,

2181
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,867
I was wondering what
your thoughts are there,

2182
01:21:49,867 --> 01:21:52,533
and what could a room
full of a lot of information

2183
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,867
marketers,
consultants, lead generators,

2184
01:21:54,867 --> 01:21:56,233
that are trying to
get more towards branding,

2185
01:21:56,233 --> 01:21:58,367
learn from Amazon which
is doing some amazing things

2186
01:21:58,367 --> 01:22:00,133
right now and where
are you at with that?

2187
01:22:00,133 --> 01:22:03,400
- That was just
infrastructure costs.

2188
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,200
What I think, what I
knew was gonna happen

2189
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,800
is that consumer
behavior was shifting

2190
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,166
and we were going towards
an on-demand economy.

2191
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:13,834
I mean, you know,
really the only vulnerability

2192
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:17,433
Amazon has is whether it
was Wish or whether it was Uber,

2193
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,967
like we are gonna
demand in a decade

2194
01:22:19,967 --> 01:22:23,734
to have every single
product we want within the hour,

2195
01:22:23,734 --> 01:22:24,700
like all of it.

2196
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,033
And so what I just
knew was that Walmart

2197
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:29,734
had all its costs and
infrastructure in locations,

2198
01:22:29,734 --> 01:22:31,333
and every day that goes by,

2199
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:33,000
more people are
gonna buy online.

2200
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,767
I also knew that people
were moving into cities.

2201
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:36,667
So if you look at the trends

2202
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,367
of where people
want to live now,

2203
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:40,233
it's more and more city culture.

2204
01:22:40,233 --> 01:22:41,800
All the cities are
reemerging, Detroit,

2205
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,100
it's just everywhere.

2206
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,834
So and it's still not over yet.

2207
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:46,600
It's funny, I took a
lot of flak for that,

2208
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,834
it was five years ago,

2209
01:22:47,834 --> 01:22:49,500
I was pretty emphatic about it.

2210
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,433
And when Walmart closed
all their stores the other day,

2211
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:53,667
I got a windfall of emails.

2212
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:55,033
And it's still gonna take time.

2213
01:22:55,033 --> 01:22:58,266
Look Amazon's gonna open stores.

2214
01:22:58,266 --> 01:22:59,400
Amazon's gonna open stores.

2215
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,467
So it's not about
bricks and mortars,

2216
01:23:00,467 --> 01:23:02,767
it's that when
Amazon opens its stores,

2217
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:04,367
they're not gonna be fat.

2218
01:23:04,367 --> 01:23:05,834
They're gonna be efficient.

2219
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:06,834
And that's why
internet companies

2220
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:08,400
that open up retail
stores are gonna be smart

2221
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,734
because they're
gonna do pop-ups,

2222
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:10,834
they're gonna do lightweight,

2223
01:23:10,834 --> 01:23:12,266
they're gonna
do minimal product.

2224
01:23:12,266 --> 01:23:15,166
When you've a mature
business, you get fat.

2225
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:17,100
And you just have more
and more and more overhead.

2226
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,567
So there's that,

2227
01:23:18,567 --> 01:23:19,900
and then what was the
next question, what else?

2228
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,367
- [Man 6] I feel like 
I kinda wasted my question

2229
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:24,700
with that one, but,
no I was just saying

2230
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,100
(audience laughter)
- Sorry I fucked up.

2231
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,533
- [Man 6] No, no no, not on you.

2232
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:30,633
(audience laughing)
It was my fault.

2233
01:23:30,633 --> 01:23:32,333
There's internet
marketers in here that are,

2234
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:34,600
a lot of most of us are
folks on direct response,

2235
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,233
and we're trying
to do this convergence

2236
01:23:36,233 --> 01:23:38,800
into branding and
I've this perfect.

2237
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,100
- [Gary] And do you
think it's commerce too, or,

2238
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,000
just branding?
- No I'm just saying,

2239
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,900
Amazon is obviously a
huge internet company.

2240
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,433
- [Gary] Dude it comes down
to what I speiled about

2241
01:23:48,433 --> 01:23:49,900
for the first 30 minutes.

2242
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,867
I wasn't talking tactics, 
I was talking religion.

2243
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:54,266
If you're, now that I
understand your question

2244
01:23:54,266 --> 01:23:55,300
a little bit better,

2245
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,734
if you're trying
to make the transition

2246
01:23:56,734 --> 01:24:00,266
from just quant DR
you know to a brand play,

2247
01:24:00,266 --> 01:24:02,700
you have to
change your behavior.

2248
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,266
You know I like to say
if you want to be an anomaly

2249
01:24:04,266 --> 01:24:05,166
you have to act like one,

2250
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,667
which means you
have to do different shit

2251
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,400
than everybody else, right?

2252
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,533
So you know if you want to
be in the branding business,

2253
01:24:11,533 --> 01:24:13,033
you have to do branding things.

2254
01:24:13,033 --> 01:24:16,166
A la, you need to take
the logo of your company

2255
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:19,233
and you need to
email Tim Ferriss and say,

2256
01:24:19,233 --> 01:24:21,834
can my company
sponsor your podcast?

2257
01:24:21,834 --> 01:24:24,333
And he's gonna say
cool, $8,000 an episode.

2258
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:26,633
And you're gonna
say, fuck, right?

2259
01:24:26,633 --> 01:24:27,567
Because you're gonna say,

2260
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:29,266
well how do I quantify the math?

2261
01:24:29,266 --> 01:24:30,900
You don't.

2262
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,100
It's kind of like for
the people in here building,

2263
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,767
anybody here have a
company that they run

2264
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:38,333
that has 50 or more employees?

2265
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:40,800
Right, so for the
couple of us in this room,

2266
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,200
it's kinda the
way I think about HR,

2267
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,633
and the way I treat my people.

2268
01:24:45,633 --> 01:24:47,233
Most of the things
I do with my people

2269
01:24:47,233 --> 01:24:49,100
are very bad business decisions.

2270
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,400
It's why, from a math
standpoint, my CFO hates it,

2271
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,266
my brother hates
it, and my COO hate it.

2272
01:24:54,266 --> 01:24:55,800
But I like it because I know

2273
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,066
that if I disproportionately
overtreat everybody well,

2274
01:24:59,066 --> 01:25:00,800
that that extra
two months of severance

2275
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,100
that they didn't deserve

2276
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,934
still has brand impact, got it?

2277
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:07,266
So if you want to get
into the branding game,

2278
01:25:07,266 --> 01:25:09,934
you have to stop
counting the beans.

2279
01:25:09,934 --> 01:25:13,633
You have to start investing
in creative and stories

2280
01:25:13,633 --> 01:25:16,100
and long-term and branding,

2281
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,133
and so you have to
change your behavior.

2282
01:25:18,133 --> 01:25:20,533
Two years ago I wanted to
lose weight and get healthier.

2283
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:22,133
I changed my behavior.

2284
01:25:22,133 --> 01:25:24,500
I stopped fucking
eating muffins every morning.

2285
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,567
(audience laughter)

2286
01:25:25,567 --> 01:25:28,166
Do you know muffins have
more calories than donuts?

2287
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,600
That shit is fucked up.

2288
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,433
(audience laughter)

2289
01:25:31,433 --> 01:25:33,633
I was pissed.
I was like the corn muffin?

2290
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:35,266
I was like son of a bitch.

2291
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:37,000
(audience laughter)

2292
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,433
It's a corn muffin,
it should be healthy.

2293
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:40,033
- That was a rider
downer right there,

2294
01:25:40,033 --> 01:25:40,967
if you guys
didn't catch that one.

2295
01:25:40,967 --> 01:25:42,533
- Alright let's do it.

2296
01:25:42,533 --> 01:25:44,066
- [Man 7] Hey Gary.
- Hey brother.

2297
01:25:44,066 --> 01:25:46,300
- [Man 7] If you were
building an online

2298
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,133
physical e-commerce brand,

2299
01:25:48,133 --> 01:25:51,033
like a wallet brand
or a sunglass brand,

2300
01:25:51,033 --> 01:25:53,233
how would you
practically go about building

2301
01:25:53,233 --> 01:25:55,233
that content for
Snapchat right now

2302
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,500
if the brand is
starting from scratch?

2303
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,500
- So let's go more specific so
I can really answer this for you

2304
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,533
and I'm sorry,
I can't hear super well.

2305
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:04,767
You have a sunglass
and wallet business or?

2306
01:26:04,767 --> 01:26:06,900
- [Man 7] No say like either/or,
so if you're building

2307
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,066
you know like all the...

2308
01:26:08,066 --> 01:26:10,100
- [Gary] If you're
selling a physical product

2309
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,567
that's in the $15 to
$100 range per unit?

2310
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:14,667
- Yeah.

2311
01:26:14,667 --> 01:26:17,033
- [Gary] Is that good or no?
- Yeah a $100.

2312
01:26:17,033 --> 01:26:19,400
- [Gary] You know look first
of all I would really focus

2313
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:23,500
on Instagram. Instagram is
killing it for stuff like that.

2314
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,133
I mean you look at
Protein World and Shreds

2315
01:26:26,133 --> 01:26:27,633
and like some of these
companies that have gotten

2316
01:26:27,633 --> 01:26:30,500
from zero, the
fucking hover fucking boards

2317
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:33,367
and all that shit, like
the amount of wine we sell

2318
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:35,433
through there like,
you could you know,

2319
01:26:35,433 --> 01:26:38,633
when you think
about wallets or fashion

2320
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:43,300
you know, print was a huge
medium for those things, right?

2321
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,433
Page 87 in Vogue,
things of that nature.

2322
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:46,800
I don't think
anything's changed,

2323
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,066
I just think there's new
platforms that took over.

2324
01:26:49,066 --> 01:26:52,133
I look at Instagram
as modern day print,

2325
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:54,767
I look at Instagram
as Vogue and Elle and Cosmo

2326
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:58,066
all wrapped up into one
for every female 15 to 45

2327
01:26:58,066 --> 01:27:01,266
in America, and definitely
35 to 45 on the coasts,

2328
01:27:01,266 --> 01:27:03,934
and 15 to 30 in America.

2329
01:27:03,934 --> 01:27:06,166
And so I would tell you
to really focus on Instagram,

2330
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:09,734
really focus in influencers,
a lot of those influencers

2331
01:27:09,734 --> 01:27:11,567
are starting to
build up their Snapchats,

2332
01:27:11,567 --> 01:27:13,400
but that's a commercial and
that's a little bit different

2333
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,000
product integration,
nothing's new man,

2334
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,533
it's just that you have
to the palate to understand

2335
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:20,967
the kind of video
content that will fly

2336
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:23,700
in a Snapchat environment just
like a Super Bowl commercial

2337
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,867
feels different than a
commercial on local access,

2338
01:27:25,867 --> 01:27:29,200
it's about the context of
the content a lot of times.

2339
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,467
But I would go
Instagram hardcore.

2340
01:27:31,467 --> 01:27:34,767
- [Man 7] So if you were trying
to stay ahead of the curve

2341
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:38,600
and build that brand
online, like moving watches,

2342
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,166
you know all these Shopify
stores that are crushing it,

2343
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:43,000
Instagram, but if you wanna stay
ahead of the curve and go on--

2344
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,834
- [Gary] Instagram, Instagram.

2345
01:27:44,834 --> 01:27:48,066
Because Instagram
is ahead of the curve,

2346
01:27:48,066 --> 01:27:49,900
Instagram might
not be for everybody

2347
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,066
who's been paying
attention to social media

2348
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:54,467
every day for four years,
but your competitors,

2349
01:27:54,467 --> 01:27:55,900
look, I'm very
friendly with the founders

2350
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:58,667
of Warby Parker, they're
not crushing Instagram yet.

2351
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,834
I'm the first
investor in Birchbox,

2352
01:28:00,834 --> 01:28:02,700
I had dinner with
Katia the other night,

2353
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,567
she's not crushing Instagram yet

2354
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:06,400
because they
also have gotten fat,

2355
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,166
not as fat as fuck as Walmart,

2356
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:10,266
but they got a little
love handle shit going on.

2357
01:28:10,266 --> 01:28:13,934
And so, and so the
answer is Instagram.

2358
01:28:16,066 --> 01:28:18,400
Cool, what's up bro?

2359
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,333
- [Octavio] Gary,
the wine expert.

2360
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:22,667
My name is Octavio
from Chile, we have

2361
01:28:22,667 --> 01:28:24,033
very good quality wine.

2362
01:28:24,033 --> 01:28:25,800
- You think so.

2363
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,433
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2364
01:28:27,433 --> 01:28:28,734
I'm kidding, go ahead.

2365
01:28:28,734 --> 01:28:32,934
- But very low price due
to our very low branding.

2366
01:28:32,934 --> 01:28:35,166
Except one company, Conti Turo,

2367
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:38,166
they did a strategic
alliance with Manchester United,

2368
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:39,633
they are in the moon now.

2369
01:28:39,633 --> 01:28:44,367
Now I am starting my agency
and I have wine company, okay,

2370
01:28:44,367 --> 01:28:47,600
as a client, how do
I help them crush it

2371
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,133
without the strong
personality of a CEO

2372
01:28:50,133 --> 01:28:53,200
or a owner as you did with dad?

2373
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,200
- [Gary] So just remember,

2374
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,800
and I want people
to understand this,

2375
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,800
and this is when lore and
branding takes over reality,

2376
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,500
which is a whole
another nothing with branding

2377
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,867
that can be good or
bad depending if

2378
01:29:02,867 --> 01:29:04,200
you know how to control it.

2379
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:08,133
I took my business from
$3 to $60 million,

2380
01:29:08,133 --> 01:29:11,900
went three to 45
before Wine Library TV,

2381
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,800
so I did not use my personality,

2382
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,400
I didn't even say
hello to the world

2383
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,433
until I was 30 years old.

2384
01:29:17,433 --> 01:29:20,033
So what I did was everything
that we've talked about

2385
01:29:20,033 --> 01:29:21,567
for the last hour and a half.

2386
01:29:21,567 --> 01:29:23,934
I marketed correctly today.

2387
01:29:23,934 --> 01:29:25,934
You take up, and
this a world I know well,

2388
01:29:25,934 --> 01:29:28,333
do you wanna market in the US?

2389
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:29,900
- [Octavio] In the world
yes, the brand, yes.

2390
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,433
- But like are we
talking US market branding?

2391
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:32,667
- [Octavio] Yes, yeah.

2392
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:37,467
- If you go to Instagram
and search the hashtag wine,

2393
01:29:37,467 --> 01:29:41,033
and wine review and all
that and you deploy people

2394
01:29:41,033 --> 01:29:42,967
reaching out to
all the sommeliers

2395
01:29:42,967 --> 01:29:44,533
that are now reviewing wine

2396
01:29:44,533 --> 01:29:47,033
on Instagram and
you incentivize them

2397
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:49,033
by either giving
it to them for free

2398
01:29:49,033 --> 01:29:51,066
or if they're a
little more fancy

2399
01:29:51,066 --> 01:29:53,166
$50 or $100 for a review,

2400
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:55,767
and you tell them
that if they don't like it,

2401
01:29:55,767 --> 01:29:57,567
if I'm paying them I'd
say if you don't like it

2402
01:29:57,567 --> 01:29:59,633
don't review it,
you'd prefer they don't say

2403
01:29:59,633 --> 01:30:01,133
it's a piece of shit, right?

2404
01:30:01,133 --> 01:30:04,567
But if you were
to do that at scale

2405
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:06,400
back to that young
gentleman over there also

2406
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,700
with Ground Signal,
if you went out and hit,

2407
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,133
right now I know 

2408
01:30:11,133 --> 01:30:13,967
1,000 sommeliers across America

2409
01:30:13,967 --> 01:30:16,266
that are leaving a lot
of reviews on Instagram,

2410
01:30:16,266 --> 01:30:18,567
if you've got your
wine to them at scale

2411
01:30:18,567 --> 01:30:20,433
I think you could start
a match that would give you

2412
01:30:20,433 --> 01:30:23,066
an opportunity because a
lot of press follow them.

2413
01:30:23,066 --> 01:30:24,400
See the other thing
that people don't realize

2414
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,800
is when you do things
right the reason

2415
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,767
$3 to $50 million and
the reason with VaynerMedia,

2416
01:30:28,767 --> 01:30:30,934
when you do things
right there's momentum

2417
01:30:30,934 --> 01:30:31,834
against that right.

2418
01:30:31,834 --> 01:30:33,934
You did Instagram
right you got 1,000 people,

2419
01:30:33,934 --> 01:30:35,767
some of the people
that follow that sommelier

2420
01:30:35,767 --> 01:30:38,133
are us normal people and they
buy it and the wine selling,

2421
01:30:38,133 --> 01:30:40,100
but other people are the press,

2422
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,300
and then they're
writing six good deal wines

2423
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,033
under $20
and they mention yours

2424
01:30:44,033 --> 01:30:46,133
'cause they saw it
six times on Instagram

2425
01:30:46,133 --> 01:30:50,533
because you properly day
traded attention, got it?

2426
01:30:50,533 --> 01:30:51,500
- [Octavio] Awesome,
thank you Gary.

2427
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,633
- You're welcome.

2428
01:30:53,633 --> 01:30:55,166
One more or two more.

2429
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:57,400
- [Ryan] Let's go two more.

2430
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,500
- I really just wanted
to get in this dude's hat,

2431
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,100
I was like it's his fucking hat.

2432
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:03,367
- [Ryan] Is this 
question rated Arrr?

2433
01:31:03,367 --> 01:31:05,033
- Yeah, that's good.

2434
01:31:05,867 --> 01:31:06,834
So my question is...

2435
01:31:06,834 --> 01:31:08,066
- Wait a minute, you
weren't joking that the first

2436
01:31:08,066 --> 01:31:09,700
one of these were just
shit jokes the whole time.

2437
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,867
- [Ryan] Yeah,
no, they're all like this.

2438
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:14,467
- So my question is
regarding kind of the emerging

2439
01:31:14,467 --> 01:31:16,767
platforms for content
recommendation discovery,

2440
01:31:16,767 --> 01:31:18,133
I'm not sure if you're
familiar with them,

2441
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:20,133
like Outbrain,
Taboola, Revcontent.

2442
01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:21,667
- [Gary] Know it 
super well, man.

2443
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:23,734
- Okay awesome, so
just your opinion on those

2444
01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:26,100
and where you see those
going and if we can use those.

2445
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,967
- [Gary] It's just
another marketplace, right?

2446
01:31:27,967 --> 01:31:30,200
Like fucking how long have
you been jamming in that world?

2447
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,333
- About three years.

2448
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:33,233
- [Gary] Well then you fucking
know what three years ago it was

2449
01:31:33,233 --> 01:31:34,867
compared to what it is today.

2450
01:31:34,867 --> 01:31:39,066
Right, and so what you need
to realize and think about is

2451
01:31:39,066 --> 01:31:40,633
you know, is it
still exactly work,

2452
01:31:40,633 --> 01:31:43,400
like it just right, it's
just when does it flip over

2453
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,400
and it's not worth it anymore?

2454
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,433
I mean two, three years
ago I was fucking in love

2455
01:31:46,433 --> 01:31:48,600
with that shit and
like it really worked,

2456
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,133
you know 17 fucking boob shots,

2457
01:31:51,133 --> 01:31:53,133
you know like
that would work right,

2458
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,934
like putting hot
chicks as a picture

2459
01:31:55,934 --> 01:31:58,200
even though the headline
was about like modern medicine

2460
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,433
and that shit worked,
like all those hacks

2461
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:02,500
worked in that world,
but I think you know is

2462
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,033
because we ruined
it and put hot chicks

2463
01:32:05,033 --> 01:32:07,100
over things that have
nothing to do with them

2464
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,500
people stopped
clicking it as much,

2465
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,400
they still click it,
there's certain market places,

2466
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,900
and so I think my
thought on that is

2467
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:17,467
much like deal of the day
with Groupon and Living Social,

2468
01:32:17,467 --> 01:32:19,433
much like what I lived
through with e-mail and SEO,

2469
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:21,767
much like what's gonna
happen with social media,

2470
01:32:21,767 --> 01:32:24,700
we know it works,
but is it arbitraging

2471
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,533
the way you want it to
today and don't get romantic

2472
01:32:28,533 --> 01:32:31,133
and let it be your only thing.

2473
01:32:31,133 --> 01:32:35,433
Guys how many people here
right now by show of hands

2474
01:32:35,433 --> 01:32:37,500
are really happy or
feeling really strong

2475
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,367
or feeling successful,
like business is good,

2476
01:32:39,367 --> 01:32:42,500
business is booming, how many?

2477
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,400
I'm really scared
of those people.

2478
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,233
Because they are the people
when things are going well

2479
01:32:48,233 --> 01:32:51,000
that's when you're least
likely to break your shit.

2480
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
The thing that I'm most
proud of is every single day

2481
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I wake up, I try to
put myself out of business.

2482
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,266
Right now I'm at
the prime of my career

2483
01:32:59,266 --> 01:33:01,400
and I'm trying to put
myself out of business,

2484
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,934
I'm trying to stress test
all my hyperbole on stage today,

2485
01:33:04,934 --> 01:33:07,400
does it still work,
is it still a good value?

2486
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,600
So I would say
to you 18 months ago

2487
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,867
when you were in
your prime in that space

2488
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:13,500
that would've been a
good time to start taking

2489
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,100
some of the profits, dollars,
and your energy and time

2490
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,633
and start learning what
was happening on Instagram.

2491
01:33:18,633 --> 01:33:21,533
Got it? It's that game,
deploying some of the energies

2492
01:33:21,533 --> 01:33:23,934
and dollars to what you
would think is emerging next

2493
01:33:23,934 --> 01:33:26,300
to be there
when yours goes down.

2494
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,033
So I think it's
a viable platform,

2495
01:33:28,033 --> 01:33:29,700
I just know it's not
converting the way it used to

2496
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,734
for most of the
stuff that I'm looking at.

2497
01:33:31,734 --> 01:33:33,500
- [Man 8] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2498
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,133
- Alright, dude you
get to be the last one.

2499
01:33:35,133 --> 01:33:35,767
- [Audience Ryan] Thanks.

2500
01:33:35,767 --> 01:33:37,333
- I'm so sorry
for everybody else.

2501
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:39,166
I know it hurts but you
can bum rush real quick and

2502
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:40,633
I'll give quick daps 
or something.

2503
01:33:40,633 --> 01:33:41,600
(audience laughter)

2504
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,967
I got a two hour
fucking drive to fucking LAX

2505
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:46,266
so I'll answer a shit load
on Twitter so you can ask there.

2506
01:33:46,266 --> 01:33:47,133
I promise, go ahead my man.

2507
01:33:47,133 --> 01:33:48,500
- Thanks for
taking the question.

2508
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,066
Ryan here.

2509
01:33:50,066 --> 01:33:54,166
I do a lot of live streaming and
one of the questions I have is

2510
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:57,867
first of all as an agency I have
an agency here in San Diego,

2511
01:33:57,867 --> 01:34:02,467
how would you recommend
incorporating Periscope into

2512
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:03,600
what we do as an agency.

2513
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,433
- [Gary] As a
gateway drug to clients?

2514
01:34:05,433 --> 01:34:07,100
- Yeah.
Well, both.

2515
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,967
For the clients for them
to leverage the platform,

2516
01:34:09,967 --> 01:34:11,500
how to charge for it.

2517
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:14,033
- [Gary] I would say give away
all your best advice for free.

2518
01:34:14,033 --> 01:34:15,600
- [Audience Ryan] Okay.

2519
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,233
- And so that is the
anti-answer to all agencies.

2520
01:34:19,233 --> 01:34:23,467
The craziest dirty little secret
about me is I give away all my

2521
01:34:23,467 --> 01:34:27,367
advice for free shit that
I'm using to build $100 million

2522
01:34:27,367 --> 01:34:30,567
billable, not pass
through, agency because

2523
01:34:30,567 --> 01:34:34,533
99% of fuckers don't do it.
- [Audience Ryan] Okay.

2524
01:34:34,533 --> 01:34:36,867
- That's like the
craziest dirty secret.

2525
01:34:36,867 --> 01:34:39,300
There's people here that think
they want to hold on to their

2526
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,600
biggest gift or the thing they
know and the number one thing

2527
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,400
you do is give it away for free
as leverage because the reality

2528
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,667
is most people won't do it.

2529
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:50,333
Everything I just talked about
many things people are like ooh,

2530
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:54,033
I want that's good
you're just not gonna do.

2531
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:55,500
- [Audience Ryan] So you're
saying give away in order to--

2532
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,300
- [Gary] I mean sit in
front of the stream, right?

2533
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:57,734
- Right.

2534
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,500
- On Periscope and
start giving away good advice.

2535
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,600
Like this week one of
our clients really crushed it

2536
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,300
because they did this Facebook
ad against this targeting or

2537
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,400
whatever the fuck you do.

2538
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,633
- [Audience Ryan] Yeah, no,
I'm doing that I guess and

2539
01:35:07,633 --> 01:35:09,867
that's building my plaftorm.
- [Gary] Yes.

2540
01:35:09,867 --> 01:35:10,867
- And building my agency--

2541
01:35:10,867 --> 01:35:12,100
- [Gary] How long
have you been doing it?

2542
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:15,233
- For seven, eight months.
- [Gary] Not long enough.

2543
01:35:15,233 --> 01:35:16,333
- I, okay.

2544
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:20,100
- [Gary] You know what I mean?
- Yeah. I hear ya.

2545
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,567
What do you think
the future is--

2546
01:35:21,567 --> 01:35:25,400
- [Gary] The other thing, if you
want it to be a gateway drug you

2547
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,867
should be saving that stream, 

2548
01:35:26,867 --> 01:35:28,433
then posting on 
your Facebook page

2549
01:35:28,433 --> 01:35:31,233
and then targeting employees
of companies that you

2550
01:35:31,233 --> 01:35:32,867
want to hire you.
- [Audience Ryan] Okay.

2551
01:35:32,867 --> 01:35:34,934
- [Ryan] But you also want
to do it for clients, right?

2552
01:35:34,934 --> 01:35:36,300
- [Audience Ryan] Yeah, yeah.
That's exactly.

2553
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,367
- No, no I gave him the
right answer which is take that

2554
01:35:38,367 --> 01:35:42,333
content then take it out
of Periscope download it,

2555
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:45,834
upload it as a Facebook
dark post and then post it and

2556
01:35:45,834 --> 01:35:49,667
targeted against employees
of the 40 targets for businesses

2557
01:35:49,667 --> 01:35:52,367
within a 10 mile radius or
100 mile radius or 

2558
01:35:52,367 --> 01:35:53,500
wherever in the world.

2559
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:56,433
There's much more B-to-B
transactional opportunities on

2560
01:35:56,433 --> 01:35:59,667
Facebook than people realize if
they started targeting employees

2561
01:35:59,667 --> 01:36:03,266
of the company, especially
if you started things with like,

2562
01:36:03,266 --> 01:36:04,934
"Does know does your
CIO know," you know,--

2563
01:36:04,934 --> 01:36:05,600
- [Audience Ryan] Yeah.

2564
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,266
- And then you have
the employees forward it

2565
01:36:07,266 --> 01:36:08,233
to their CIO.

2566
01:36:08,233 --> 01:36:09,100
- [Audience Ryan] Gotcha.

2567
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,567
- Practitioners mother fuckers.

2568
01:36:11,567 --> 01:36:14,834
(audience laughter and applause)

2569
01:36:18,633 --> 01:36:21,934
- Thank you, that's awesome.

2570
01:36:21,934 --> 01:36:23,734
Where do you see
the future of Google,

2571
01:36:23,734 --> 01:36:25,900
like livestreaming 360.

2572
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,567
- [Gary] Love it.

2573
01:36:27,567 --> 01:36:29,367
- I'm gonna produce an
action sports day here

2574
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,266
coming up really soon.

2575
01:36:30,266 --> 01:36:31,567
- [Gary] I'm obsessed with 360.
- On Periscope.

2576
01:36:31,567 --> 01:36:33,333
- [Gary] I'm an investor in a
company called Little Str that

2577
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:34,767
you should check 
out with no A,

2578
01:36:34,767 --> 01:36:36,600
- [Ryan] Yeah.
- before the R.

2579
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:40,367
We've done the Aflac, like
Facebook and Google just made

2580
01:36:40,367 --> 01:36:41,667
VaynerMedia partners because of

2581
01:36:41,667 --> 01:36:43,233
the great work
we're doing with 360.

2582
01:36:43,233 --> 01:36:45,200
I'm obsessed with 360.

2583
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,567
- [Ryan] I think it's
definitely the future.

2584
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:48,233
- [Gary] It's huge.

2585
01:36:48,233 --> 01:36:49,867
- So where do
you see that going?

2586
01:36:49,867 --> 01:36:50,967
I see it going...

2587
01:36:50,967 --> 01:36:51,967
- [Gary] I think 
it's going well.

2588
01:36:51,967 --> 01:36:53,867
- Yeah, okay.
(audience laughter)

2589
01:36:53,867 --> 01:36:55,400
And now Google.

2590
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,667
- [Gary] I think people are
gonna look to hire people that

2591
01:36:58,667 --> 01:36:59,967
are doing 360 video.

2592
01:36:59,967 --> 01:37:02,033
For example, I just did
a 360 video that 

2593
01:37:02,033 --> 01:37:05,000
I lost $120,000 in hard costs on

2594
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,834
because I just want
examples for the market

2595
01:37:06,834 --> 01:37:08,000
that I know is emerging.

2596
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,233
- [Ryan] Okay and YouTube
now they just announced they're

2597
01:37:10,233 --> 01:37:11,400
gonna do 360.

2598
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:12,667
- They sure did.
- [Audience Ryan]

2599
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:13,500
Yeah, awesome, alright.
- Awesome.

2600
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,233
- [Audience Ryan] Thank you.

2601
01:37:14,233 --> 01:37:16,300
- Alright, I'm gonna sneak one
more in real quick with a beard

2602
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,633
and then that dude all
at the end is really

2603
01:37:17,633 --> 01:37:19,100
fucking grinding so we may

2604
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:20,867
have to do three more
but I'm going real fast.

2605
01:37:20,867 --> 01:37:21,800
Don't worry about dinner.

2606
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,166
Alright, here we go.

2607
01:37:23,166 --> 01:37:25,200
- You rock, bro.
- [Gary] Thanks man.

2608
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,166
- Okay, so I don't
have a huge following.

2609
01:37:27,166 --> 01:37:28,500
My name is Keith
Persay by the way.

2610
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,767
I don't have a huge following,
I don't have a huge email list,

2611
01:37:31,767 --> 01:37:36,700
how the fuck do I sell a ton of
#AskGaryVee books and out-hustle

2612
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:40,066
everyone in the
#AskGaryVee squad?

2613
01:37:40,066 --> 01:37:43,533
- [Gary] Well, I think you
should go door to door--

2614
01:37:43,533 --> 01:37:45,667
(audience laughter)

2615
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:49,467
- [Ryan] Obviously.
- I would go door to door.

2616
01:37:49,467 --> 01:37:51,200
You know what's funny 
it's kind similar to the

2617
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,667
first question this whole thing.
- [Keith] Right.

2618
01:37:52,667 --> 01:37:55,700
- The only way when you don't
have a lot the only way you win

2619
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:59,633
when you're width is less
is your depth is more.

2620
01:37:59,633 --> 01:38:03,433
Like if you literally compel
every human being that you know

2621
01:38:03,433 --> 01:38:06,667
super well to buy
multiple copies of the book,

2622
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:08,667
which feels funny to say
out loud and I appreciate it,

2623
01:38:08,667 --> 01:38:10,300
you'll do better.

2624
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:11,667
You know there's a
lot of people that have,

2625
01:38:11,667 --> 01:38:13,934
I have tons of friends who
have hundreds of thousands of

2626
01:38:13,934 --> 01:38:16,467
followers and have huge reach
and they're gonna tweet it and

2627
01:38:16,467 --> 01:38:18,667
I'm gonna sell four books.

2628
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:21,567
It's always depth, man.

2629
01:38:21,567 --> 01:38:23,266
It's always, always depth.

2630
01:38:23,266 --> 01:38:24,100
- [Keith] Always, awesome.

2631
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,166
- And it's depth
in practitionership.

2632
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:27,333
That little rant 
we just had with that

2633
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:29,734
awesome dude it was fun for me
cause I really know what the

2634
01:38:29,734 --> 01:38:31,667
fuck I'm talking
about 'cause I do it.

2635
01:38:31,667 --> 01:38:35,834
So it's depth in your skills
and its depth in your approach.

2636
01:38:35,834 --> 01:38:37,700
It's the only thing.

2637
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:39,367
Always, forever.

2638
01:38:39,367 --> 01:38:41,367
It's so fucking zen.

2639
01:38:42,867 --> 01:38:43,600
I like your beard, too.

2640
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,300
Alright.
- [Keith] Thank you.

2641
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:45,967
- [Henry] Hey, what's up, Gary?

2642
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:47,500
This is Henry from New Jersey.

2643
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,467
- Where in Jers?
- [Henry] Long Branch.

2644
01:38:49,467 --> 01:38:51,133
- Love it.

2645
01:38:51,133 --> 01:38:52,233
- [Henry] I don't
really have a question,

2646
01:38:52,233 --> 01:38:54,100
I just want to share
a quick story with you.

2647
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,200
So about 16 months ago,

2648
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,400
I almost went out of business.

2649
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,667
I had a graphic design business
and I made all the wrong

2650
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:04,333
decisions invested in the wrong.
- [Gary] Yep.

2651
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:07,700
- And then Digital Marketer
popped into my life somehow,

2652
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:12,834
someway and I just want to take
this opportunity to thank Ryan

2653
01:39:12,834 --> 01:39:16,400
and the whole company to help me

2654
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,100
get out of my little jam and 

2655
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,033
16 months later

2656
01:39:21,033 --> 01:39:23,166
we did
1/2 million dollars in sales.

2657
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:26,567
- [Gary] That's awesome.
(audience applause)

2658
01:39:26,567 --> 01:39:29,800
- [Henry] And for Gary, 

2659
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,600
I tag the shit out
of you on Instagram

2660
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,467
and I'm surprised you didn't
tell me to go fuck myself yet.

2661
01:39:34,467 --> 01:39:36,800
(Gary laughs)
I'll tell you this.

2662
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,066
I watched this one video.

2663
01:39:39,066 --> 01:39:39,567
- [Gary] You know what?

2664
01:39:39,567 --> 01:39:40,300
That's a good example 'cause

2665
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:42,500
I want to make
learnings for everybody, 

2666
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,033
depth versus width.

2667
01:39:44,033 --> 01:39:46,934
Everybody who tags me on
Instagram 'cause they think it's

2668
01:39:46,934 --> 01:39:49,967
a pop up in my feed and then
I'm gonna look at their shit,

2669
01:39:49,967 --> 01:39:52,367
like I know what you're doing
and so does everybody else that

2670
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:55,367
you're doing that to and all
you're doing is actually ruining

2671
01:39:55,367 --> 01:39:57,300
your brand equity
instead of winning.

2672
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,667
This is another example
of depth versus width.

2673
01:39:59,667 --> 01:40:02,500
Cool, you think you're gonna
get all these people to see it.

2674
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,934
The way, the context of your

2675
01:40:04,934 --> 01:40:08,934
actions matters just
as much as your action.

2676
01:40:08,934 --> 01:40:09,633
Go ahead.

2677
01:40:09,633 --> 01:40:11,166
- [Henry] So the
video you you put out,

2678
01:40:11,166 --> 01:40:12,467
it was a few months ago.

2679
01:40:12,467 --> 01:40:14,133
It looked like
a Nike commercial.

2680
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:16,967
It was really well done.
- [Gary] Fuckin' DRock.

2681
01:40:16,967 --> 01:40:19,834
- Yeah, I give that dude props.

2682
01:40:19,834 --> 01:40:23,333
But the one thing at the end of
the video you said which just

2683
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:24,867
hit me like a bolt of lightning

2684
01:40:24,867 --> 01:40:27,767
you said there's
no game over for me.

2685
01:40:27,767 --> 01:40:28,433
- [Gary] Yep.

2686
01:40:28,433 --> 01:40:30,900
- And that just,
I'm gonna get emotional

2687
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,166
but that hit me hard, dude.

2688
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:36,200
And I think between Ryan's camp,

2689
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,266
Click Funnels and your hustle

2690
01:40:38,266 --> 01:40:42,133
and your motivation, ambition
got me to where I am today

2691
01:40:42,133 --> 01:40:43,734
so I just wanted to say thanks.

2692
01:40:43,734 --> 01:40:44,867
- [Gary] Thank you so much.

2693
01:40:44,867 --> 01:40:48,367
(audience applause)

2694
01:40:51,967 --> 01:40:53,100
You know, it's funny,

2695
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,533
I so desperately push against

2696
01:40:55,533 --> 01:40:58,000
the motivational, 
rah-rah part of my life.

2697
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,266
Like I do it and I'm good at
it and I like it but like every

2698
01:41:02,266 --> 01:41:04,367
time I'm like fuck this,
I don't want to do that anymore.

2699
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:07,000
Let me just keep building
businesses like you hear that

2700
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,100
shit and it's like crazy
that, it's communication.

2701
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,033
I do as a human but your

2702
01:41:11,033 --> 01:41:12,400
business and
brand can do it too.

2703
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,500
It's unbelievable what
communication does and when you

2704
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:19,700
see like a dude wear a wristband
from your wine show in 2008 like

2705
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:22,467
that kind of communication
is just so intense.

2706
01:41:22,467 --> 01:41:23,734
Yeah.

2707
01:41:23,734 --> 01:41:24,700
- Thanks so much, Gary.

2708
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,333
- [Gary] Dude,
those other two people

2709
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:27,433
should really thank you.

2710
01:41:27,433 --> 01:41:29,100
That dude got to
tell his emotional story,

2711
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:30,900
because you were
really not willing

2712
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:31,767
to let me off stage.

2713
01:41:31,767 --> 01:41:33,633
So, I'm impressed 
with the hustle.

2714
01:41:33,633 --> 01:41:36,333
- It was a good
testimonial too, right?

2715
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:38,266
I'm Jackson, I'm from Australia.

2716
01:41:38,266 --> 01:41:41,467
Just a quick one on
Snapchat for everyone.

2717
01:41:41,467 --> 01:41:45,166
Is there a formula
or a conversion rate

2718
01:41:45,166 --> 01:41:48,433
on how many views you're
getting to what you would pay

2719
01:41:48,433 --> 01:41:49,934
for a shout out?

2720
01:41:49,934 --> 01:41:52,533
Or some sort of advertisement?

2721
01:41:52,533 --> 01:41:54,967
- Just first of all, I think
you're really attractive.

2722
01:41:54,967 --> 01:41:58,433
(audience laughter and cheers)

2723
01:41:58,433 --> 01:42:00,567
So, I wasn't, I didn't
hear much of what you said.

2724
01:42:00,567 --> 01:42:03,000
(audience laughter)

2725
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,533
Good looking young dude, right?

2726
01:42:04,533 --> 01:42:05,467
- [Ryan] Have you
been to Australia?

2727
01:42:05,467 --> 01:42:07,033
They all look like that.
- [Gary] So, wait a minute.

2728
01:42:07,033 --> 01:42:10,200
You asked is there some
sort of data that supports

2729
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,300
what you should pay--

2730
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:14,000
- Hold on, I think
you're like the smartest person

2731
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
in the world right now.

2732
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:15,867
- [Gary] Well,
thank you, brother!

2733
01:42:15,867 --> 01:42:16,700
- Honestly!

2734
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:18,133
- [Gary] Should we
hook up or? (laughs)

2735
01:42:18,133 --> 01:42:21,533
(audience laughs)

2736
01:42:21,533 --> 01:42:23,367
- [Ryan] Now we're getting
back to the original purpose

2737
01:42:23,367 --> 01:42:25,200
for Snapchat right here!
(audience laughs)

2738
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:28,300
- [Gary] Alright so,
let me ask you a question,

2739
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,133
are you asking is

2740
01:42:29,133 --> 01:42:31,900
there some really
quantifiable understanding--

2741
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,533
- Like, like a ballpark--

2742
01:42:33,533 --> 01:42:35,200
- [Gary] To understand
what to pay people

2743
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,066
for Snapchat shout outs?
- For example,

2744
01:42:37,066 --> 01:42:38,767
alright,
I'm in financial services.

2745
01:42:38,767 --> 01:42:40,967
I run like a
trading education company.

2746
01:42:40,967 --> 01:42:42,800
It's a very similar
business model to this.

2747
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,400
- [Gary] Yes.

2748
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,400
And you know for Snapchat,

2749
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,000
what would I pay someone

2750
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,300
with 30,000 views
per 10 seconds?

2751
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,033
- So first of all,
are you even in a funnel

2752
01:42:54,033 --> 01:42:57,300
where the
consideration is 30 and unders

2753
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,767
would buy your shit?
- [Jackson] No.

2754
01:42:59,767 --> 01:43:01,367
- So, that's what I thought.

2755
01:43:01,367 --> 01:43:04,133
And so what I would say
is keep paying attention.

2756
01:43:04,133 --> 01:43:05,266
You know, it's
like running a marathon.

2757
01:43:05,266 --> 01:43:09,233
Get on the treadmill, but I
would highly, highly advise you

2758
01:43:09,233 --> 01:43:11,233
not to do any
Snapchat marketing right now,

2759
01:43:11,233 --> 01:43:12,967
'cause that
audience is not there.

2760
01:43:12,967 --> 01:43:15,100
It's 30-year-olds and under,

2761
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:18,100
and it's emerging social
media and marketing people

2762
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,033
of all ages,

2763
01:43:19,033 --> 01:43:20,500
that are your first group there.

2764
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:21,867
So, they're scattered.

2765
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:25,166
But in 12 months, in 24 months,
they're gonna be there.

2766
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:26,500
And so you wanna
know how to execute.

2767
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,600
That's number one.
Number two, yeah.

2768
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,333
It's gonna be hard,

2769
01:43:30,333 --> 01:43:32,300
because you'll be
doing endorsement.

2770
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:34,467
It's like trying to figure out
what to pay Beyonce.

2771
01:43:34,467 --> 01:43:35,767
Or what to pay, you know?

2772
01:43:35,767 --> 01:43:38,100
'Cause you're not
getting math clicks yet.

2773
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,367
You're just getting awareness
and then conversion.

2774
01:43:40,367 --> 01:43:41,867
What I would tell you is,

2775
01:43:41,867 --> 01:43:43,333
this is now for other people,

2776
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:45,033
that can take this advice.

2777
01:43:45,033 --> 01:43:46,767
I would ask an influencer,

2778
01:43:46,767 --> 01:43:48,200
if you're really paying them,

2779
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,333
and they're willing to do it.

2780
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:52,200
Because they may not
even be willing to do it.

2781
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,633
I would ask them to do

2782
01:43:53,633 --> 01:43:55,533
a call-to-action snap
to show you

2783
01:43:55,533 --> 01:43:58,367
how many people screen
shoot their call-to-actions

2784
01:43:58,367 --> 01:44:02,033
as a ratio to how many
people watch the story.

2785
01:44:02,033 --> 01:44:05,500
So the reason I'm so
bullish on Snapchat is

2786
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:09,033
when I go in for an ask
and say screen shoot this

2787
01:44:09,033 --> 01:44:10,166
and do something.

2788
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:12,400
When you've got 25,000
people that see something,

2789
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:17,000
and you have 9,000 people
that screen shoot something,

2790
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,066
not click, like that!

2791
01:44:19,066 --> 01:44:21,600
You're talking about
real depth of engagement.

2792
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,700
So, I think the
way you could proxy

2793
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:27,066
how much attention is
really happening is that.

2794
01:44:27,066 --> 01:44:29,100
The other thing is
I would just assume

2795
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:29,900
the attention's happening,

2796
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:32,133
'cause that's where
Snapchat is in its life cycle.

2797
01:44:32,133 --> 01:44:33,500
I think the bigger issue is

2798
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,000
what's the makeup
of their audience?

2799
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,900
And are they in the
consideration to buy

2800
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,100
what you're selling?

2801
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:39,867
- [Jackson] So, what
would you recommend instead?

2802
01:44:39,867 --> 01:44:42,066
Like Periscope, Facebook Live?

2803
01:44:42,066 --> 01:44:44,400
- [Gary] Facebook, man. 
- Facebook?

2804
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,734
- [Gary] Facebook. Number one?

2805
01:44:45,734 --> 01:44:46,567
- [Gary] Yeah.

2806
01:44:46,567 --> 01:44:50,834
- Alright, and would you
expand into Facebook Live

2807
01:44:50,834 --> 01:44:53,967
and Periscope as like a next
sort of center of attention?

2808
01:44:53,967 --> 01:44:55,900
- [Gary] Well, it depends
on who's doing that content

2809
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:58,166
and can they siphon
their audience to convert

2810
01:44:58,166 --> 01:45:00,166
for what your
product and service is?

2811
01:45:00,166 --> 01:45:01,200
- Right.
- [Gary] Right?

2812
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:03,166
So, if you've got the
right personality, absolutely.

2813
01:45:03,166 --> 01:45:05,100
- What about Instagram?
- [Gary] Yep.

2814
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,367
- Hypothetically, speaking?
- [Gary] Yep.

2815
01:45:06,367 --> 01:45:08,633
I would tell you that there's
so much depth of targeting

2816
01:45:08,633 --> 01:45:11,967
on Facebook that I would
first try to go deep into that.

2817
01:45:11,967 --> 01:45:13,834
And you can flirt
with the other stuff,

2818
01:45:13,834 --> 01:45:15,166
but that's where you gotta go.

2819
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:17,033
- [Jackson] We're pretty
deep into Facebook,

2820
01:45:17,033 --> 01:45:19,300
but Instagram,
what's like your best tip?

2821
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:22,200
I've got about 16,000.

2822
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:25,633
And I got like 5%-10%
conversion on 16,000.

2823
01:45:25,633 --> 01:45:27,867
What is the best way
to get through to the--

2824
01:45:27,867 --> 01:45:28,734
- [Gary] I think
the biggest problem with

2825
01:45:28,734 --> 01:45:30,333
Instagram right now 
is I'm stunned

2826
01:45:30,333 --> 01:45:32,800
that the targeting
capabilities aren't perfect

2827
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,166
like they are on Facebook.

2828
01:45:34,166 --> 01:45:35,033
They own both companies.

2829
01:45:35,033 --> 01:45:36,633
They're the best
tech company in the world.

2830
01:45:36,633 --> 01:45:39,633
I've been surprised
that when I target Instagram,

2831
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:42,533
it's not actually
targeting that person the way

2832
01:45:42,533 --> 01:45:43,767
I'd expect it to.

2833
01:45:43,767 --> 01:45:45,834
So, I would just test and learn.

2834
01:45:45,834 --> 01:45:48,066
The problem with your questions
for me right this second is

2835
01:45:48,066 --> 01:45:49,867
there's just a couple of
layers of details that I need

2836
01:45:49,867 --> 01:45:51,867
to understand better
to give you real advice.

2837
01:45:51,867 --> 01:45:53,533
But I will tell you this,

2838
01:45:53,533 --> 01:45:56,166
even I spending
$100 million a year

2839
01:45:56,166 --> 01:45:57,567
on ads right now,

2840
01:45:57,567 --> 01:45:59,767
focused on it 
18 fucking hours a day,

2841
01:45:59,767 --> 01:46:02,233
feel like there's still a
lot to be done on Facebook.

2842
01:46:02,233 --> 01:46:03,667
So no matter how
much you're doing,

2843
01:46:03,667 --> 01:46:07,000
don't completely say that
we've got Facebook done yet.

2844
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,200
- [Jackson] Sweet.
Thanks so much, Gary.

2845
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:09,166
- Take care man.

2846
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:09,834
Thank you guys!

2847
01:46:09,834 --> 01:46:12,266
- [Ryan] Gary Vaynerchuk!
Big round of applause!

2848
01:46:12,266 --> 01:46:13,467
(audience applause)

2849
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:14,867
- [Ryan] Thank you, brother!

2850
01:46:14,867 --> 01:46:15,467
Close this out.

2851
01:46:15,467 --> 01:46:17,600
See you on the the other side.

2852
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,500
Big round of applause, hey!

2853
01:46:24,033 --> 01:46:25,467
We're gonna be back here

2854
01:46:25,467 --> 01:46:28,533
in this room getting
started bright and early.

2855
01:46:28,533 --> 01:46:29,266
Show up at eight,

2856
01:46:29,266 --> 01:46:30,166
if you want a seat

2857
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:31,000
- [Gary] I got to
say hi to friend.

2858
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,934
- We're gonna get
officially started at 8:30.

2859
01:46:32,934 --> 01:46:35,033
Thank you all
again we got another

2860
01:46:35,033 --> 01:46:36,133
content packed day tomorrow.

2861
01:46:36,133 --> 01:46:38,800
So make sure
you're here, thank you!

2862
01:46:38,800 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
