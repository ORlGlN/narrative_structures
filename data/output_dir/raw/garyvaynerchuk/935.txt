guys just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little quick contacts</font>

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,029
because I know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a whole lot</font>

10
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:27,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">of time i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> born in Belarus in the</font>

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,730
former Soviet Union and i came here in

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,558
1978 when I was three years old my

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,720
family lived<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a studio apartment with</font>

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,239
eight family members about the size of

15
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">this couch and it was tough and we</font>

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,170
worked really hard and my dad got a

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,570
small liquor store<font color="#CCCCCC"> in New Jersey I was</font>

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">very entrepreneurial lemonade stands</font>

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,410
baseball cards all that stuff and then

20
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,660
my dad dragged my ass into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the liquor</font>

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,300
store when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was 14 paid me two bucks an</font>

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,329
hour to bag ice for 12 hours a day that

23
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,989
sucked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually I started getting</font>

24
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,760
passionate about wine because people

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,930
collected it and that's where I came

26
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,149
from so that brought me my interest I

27
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:11,619
launched Wine Library<font color="#E5E5E5"> com in 1997 and a</font>

28
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:13,810
lot of the talk about what social media

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">can bring to the table right now it</font>

30
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,649
reminds me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 97 when people</font>

31
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:20,170
were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about whether amazon had a</font>

32
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,319
shot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of winning or are these web things</font>

33
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,899
a fad and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think why I'm here today and</font>

34
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,609
what I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about is how it's</font>

35
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,459
relevant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this universe what what I</font>

36
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:33,060
think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really intriguing is that I</font>

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,289
built this large business grew the

38
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,520
business from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple million dollars a</font>

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,869
year to a 60 million dollar year

40
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,819
business in a very short period of time

41
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,939
leveraging web one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh lots of ads</font>

42
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,029
having a site all that good jazz I want

43
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:48,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to buy the new york jets and on my 30th</font>

44
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:51,520
birthday I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I couldn't</font>

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,619
because wine shipping laws in America

46
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,799
suck and I can't ship line to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boston or</font>

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Maryland or many other places so if</font>

48
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,729
anybody in the room here can fix that

49
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,809
that'd be awesome but what I what was

50
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:06,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting was i turned 30 and I</font>

51
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,889
freaked out because I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

52
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,179
that model would get me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> where I</font>

53
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,590
wanted to be because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the restrictive</font>

54
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,750
market and I decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build the one</font>

55
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,640
thing I knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could not be taken</font>

56
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from me which</font>

57
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,870
my personal brand and on februari 2006 i

58
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,209
sat in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a camera and drank wine</font>

59
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,670
for 20 minutes reviewing the three wines

60
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,140
and decided i was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build my</font>

61
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,610
personal brand by building Wine Library

62
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,549
TV somehow four years later hundreds of

63
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,260
thousands of people watched<font color="#E5E5E5"> that every</font>

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,829
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> day it grew my personal brand but</font>

65
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,239
what was most important and most

66
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,069
relevant to this room in my opinion is

67
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,170
how i went about building that brand and

68
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,379
why it's so relevant to elections to

69
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,180
this space<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the transparency that</font>

70
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,819
offers such amazing amazing opportunity

71
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,140
in my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> America is right now the</font>

72
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,709
brand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my parents were sold when we</font>

73
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,319
came here from a business standpoint

74
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,750
which is where I do a lot of consulting

75
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,409
and where my career has led me to

76
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,030
entrepreneurs and business have so much

77
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,709
more opportunity because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> World</font>

there are going to be enormous amount of

people that win elections in November

85
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,310
leveraging things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook and</font>

knew was this if they threw enough money

at marketing they had to three weeks to

143
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,780
pull in enough revenue against that

144
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,970

literally nine months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago a year ago</font>

146

those numbers there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are thirty to a</font>

148
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,610
hundred projects shelved because the

149
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,620
movie sucks and what happened with Bruno

150
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,500
was people came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the theater that</font>

151
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,990
Wednesday night and started facebooking

152
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,820
texting and twittering that the movie

153
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,000
sucked and nobody went and saw it word

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,160
of mouth is on steroids now things

155
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,860
travel and there's absolutely no hiding

156
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,080
there is no opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a candidate</font>
