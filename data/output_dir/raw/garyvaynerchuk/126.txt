1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,592
- We want to be very
thoughtful of what we're doing,

2
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:04,247
because you're only as vulnerable

3
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:07,069
as the one person you let down.

4
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:09,425
And, so, I don't think
there's a lot of people

5
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,275
in the game that understand

6
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:13,099
where the business world is going,

7
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,304
and, boy, what you do for a living,

8
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:18,137
you know, at the position
that you're doing it at,

9
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:20,472
like, it's just hardcore.

10
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:23,389
(electronic music)

11
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:28,417
Yo, what up vlog.

12
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,593
Location, location, location, location,

13
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:33,184
just like I'm sitting here right now

14
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:35,539
in Sydney Australia Airport.

15
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:39,129
And the way I've been thinking
about business down here,

16
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:41,559
is whether it's for
modeling or for surfing,

17
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,813
or footy kind of culture,

18
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:46,953
when you understand the
framework that you're playing in

19
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:49,589
you have a much better
chance of succeeding.

20
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:52,300
In this little chat I had
with a first round pick

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,164
of New York Mets,

22
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:56,741
I was really to articulate
to him and his family,

23
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:58,830
but really him, if you watch it carefully,

24
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,295
even though I'm not
directly addressing him,

25
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,375
that you need to squeeze your moment.

26
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,438
I'm yelling at all of you for
squeezing this Facebook Ads,

27
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:08,417
Instagram influencers moment,

28
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,938
the way I didn't as much
as I wanted to with Google

29
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,586
back in 2002,

30
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,472
'cause it's a moment in time.

31
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:15,850
If you're an athlete,

32
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,213
and you're lucky enough to be drafted

33
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,954
in New-York-fucking-City,

34
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,953
you need to fucking work.

35
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:24,106
And whether you're
drafted in New York, LA,

36
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:25,353
or San Francisco,

37
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,826
or if it's Dallas, Green Bay, or Detroit,

38
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:30,962
you need to be smart about
the unique opportunities

39
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:32,673
within the marketplace.

40
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,618
The framework of this conversation, is,

41
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,185
take advantage of your surroundings.

42
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:38,937
If you're going to UCLA or USC this year,

43
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:40,953
take advantage of that environment.

44
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:43,011
If you're going to Duke or North Carolina,

45
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:45,132
understand and take advantage of that.

46
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:47,216
If you're going to travel through Europe,

47
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:49,658
understand the room you're playing in

48
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:51,434
and the advantages,

49
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:53,211
the fruits that you can pick from.

50
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:55,731
You'll see that in this interview.

51
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:58,002
Well, thanks for reaching out.

52
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,875
And I've been looking
forward to getting together.

53
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,019
- Yeah, no, I've been very
impressed with what I've seen,

54
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,708
very impressed with what you're doing.

55
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,799
- [Gary] Thank you.

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,524
- Sort of seen you growing
from the ground up.

57
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:10,124
And I just wanted to talk
about the agency game,

58
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:12,552
and what you feel that,

59
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:14,872
you guys think is different
for the kids out there.

60
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:15,800
I wanted to come in

61
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,281
and talk a little bit about social media,

62
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,536
and kind of speak to my
son a little bit about it,

63
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,073
and what you feel about,

64
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,083
how you can help kids with regards to

65
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,712
what agencies are not doing,

66
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:25,968
or what they are doing.

67
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:27,245
- So, given the opportunity

68
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:28,758
that we're all sitting here together,

69
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:29,892
I'm thrilled to, like,

70
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:32,351
given you have the most context,

71
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,622
obviously, you have the
most context of your son,

72
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,823
and you've been able to context on me,

73
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,795
what can I bring you the most value of?

74
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:42,062
Is this a theoretical conversation?

75
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,637
Is there some details underneath?

76
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:44,695
To be very honest,

77
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:47,294
as you know, where we sit
with baseball versus football,

78
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:49,188
and things of that nature,

79
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:51,820
like, I'm obsessed with the
notion of paying forward.

80
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,934
I think karma is the most
practical thing in the world.

81
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:58,133
Even your first email caught
my attention from the vibe,

82
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,228
the second, black coffee, all that stuff,

83
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:01,852
so it's all good vibes,

84
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:03,067
it's all family.

85
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,126
At the highest levels,

86
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:08,581
I've been in two businesses my life.

87
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:10,606
My dad had a liquor store,

88
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:13,637
so I've been in the
liquor and wine business,

89
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:16,777
and now I'm in the advertising
Madison Avenue industry.

90
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:18,552
Along with my dad,

91
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:20,395
and along with my brother,

92
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,885
we've been able to build
much bigger businesses

93
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:25,718
quicker than anybody has
in both those spaces,

94
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:27,204
and they have one common theme,

95
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:29,045
which was, I think what I'm good at

96
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:30,914
is like CAT-scanning the industry.

97
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:32,464
And when I looked at him,

98
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:33,814
I was like, "Wow.

99
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,008
"This is what they're doing wrong.

100
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,823
I'm gonna do this."

101
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:41,186
This being probably our
third venture, VaynerSports.

102
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:43,956
I've never looked at an industry.

103
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:46,557
And because I'm investor in
Uber, and Facebook, and Twitter,

104
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:47,693
and all these things,

105
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,093
I look at a lot of businesses,

106
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:50,614
not just the two I've run.

107
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:53,511
I've never looked at a
business more broken.

108
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:55,239
Now, I'm empathic to the agents.

109
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,136
To be very honest, I don't
think it's a great business.

110
00:03:58,136 --> 00:03:59,879
You know, making small percentages,

111
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,533
having nobody really locked up,

112
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,702
you can have a kid for a long time,

113
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,286
you know, you get fired before
the real money comes in.

114
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:08,035
It's not a great business.

115
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:09,880
And I think when a business is not great,

116
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,797
it leads to bad behavior.

117
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:13,109
At the same token,

118
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,732
I don't think AJ and I
are necessarily in it

119
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:17,404
to become rich,

120
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:20,524
and, so, that allows us to
be a little more altruistic

121
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:23,999
and, to be very frank, what
I'm most interested in,

122
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,535
which is to fuck it up a little bit.

123
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:29,037
I mean, very basically,

124
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:31,799
agents, they don't care about their kids.

125
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:33,769
And honestly, I get that.

126
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,242
It's a business.

127
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,048
But that's the vulnerability.

128
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:39,097
The reason we're being so thoughtful,

129
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:39,930
and listen,

130
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,458
and this is a real player,

131
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,853
this is a real situation,

132
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:45,209
and we've had some other
real situations in the NBA,

133
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,438
and things of that nature,

134
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:49,000
is we want to be very
thoughtful of what we're doing,

135
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,610
because you're only as
vulnerable as the one person

136
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,102
you let down.

137
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:56,158
And, so, I don't think
there's a lot of people

138
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:58,166
in the game that understand

139
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,158
where the business world is going,

140
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:02,817
and, boy, what you do for a living,

141
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:05,439
you know, at the position
that you're doing it at,

142
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,278
like, it's just hardcore, right?

143
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:08,870
For me, it's data, right?

144
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,357
When you're the human,

145
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:12,383
people think they're
going to hall of fame,

146
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:13,216
as they should,

147
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:15,366
how the fuck do you think they
got there in the first place?

148
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:17,776
When you look at the data
of the outcomes of careers,

149
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,537
you know, I'm sure you
guys know better than I do,

150
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,863
you're holding your breath,

151
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,969
you're thinking about this,

152
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,713
you're thinking about that.

153
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:25,816
It's hardcore.

154
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,080
So, there's some good
advantages in baseball

155
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,647
with guarantee contracts,

156
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:31,607
is if you can get to that place,

157
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,142
but, for me, the biggest thing is,

158
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:34,918
you have to strike and squeeze,

159
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,484
when the outcome of like this great thing

160
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,478
has this low of percentages,

161
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:41,548
you have to squeeze the fuck out of it

162
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,048
while you've got the leverage.

163
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,687
I'm a big Jets fan.

164
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,514
I tell these kids when they're a Jet,

165
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,861
I'm like, "Look, you're in New York City.

166
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:54,825
Like, I'm meeting with you.

167
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:56,299
You think I would meet with you

168
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:57,557
if you're weren't a New York."

169
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,718
If you weren't Number
32 of the New York Jets,

170
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:00,571
I would never spend, you know,

171
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:01,435
and these kids don't.

172
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,141
I think of Dexter McDougle,

173
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,516
I think about all these kids.

174
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:07,058
Like, while you're in,

175
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:08,737
when you're a draft pick of that team,

176
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:11,714
like the amount of people
that are ruling the world,

177
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:13,073
especially in New York,

178
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,873
that are diehard Mets fans,

179
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,939
that really give a shit
right now, and may not,

180
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,633
listen, I'm an old time
baseball card collector,

181
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,804
Brien Taylor was the first pick overall

182
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,505
of the New York Yankees,

183
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:26,083
and we all cared.

184
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:26,916
- I remember.

185
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,215
I'm a diehard Yankee fan.

186
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:31,350
Trust me, it hurts my hard
that got draft picked.

187
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,273
(laughs)

188
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:33,571
- Did you grow up a Yankee fan?

189
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:34,728
I love it, I love it.

190
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,363
I get it, I get it, I get it.

191
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,770
But it's still great that
he's here, man it's the best.

192
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,603
But, right?

193
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,604
Brien Taylor, forget
about the contract he got,

194
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:44,223
which was probably why
we all knew who he was,

195
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,186
'cause it was a big one at the time,

196
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:50,019
you know, every CEO in this,
the biggest city in the world

197
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,852
call it what it is, cared about...

198
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:56,425
That's right, and for me
the most important thing

199
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:59,816
like if I was a part of this
team, an enormous amount.

200
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,882
Now first of all, I think
the other thing that's gonna

201
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:03,557
allow us to be successful
and the thing you should

202
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,165
be always thinking about
is, does the person

203
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,272
representing you have empathy.

204
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:09,524
And why I think about empathy
so much in this business

205
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:12,848
is my strategy would be like hey my man

206
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:15,265
we need to meet everybody that
gives a shit about the Mets

207
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:16,844
that matters in New York,
that can put you on,

208
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:18,440
whether that's advice,
whether that's getting you

209
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,926
business opportunites,
whether that's writing you

210
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:23,002
a $50,000 check when you're
probably worth $1500 dollars

211
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:26,429
as a face of a marketing campaign
because they can afford it

212
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,614
and they love the fuckin Mets.

213
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,740
Let's do that.

214
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,740
On the flip side, the reason
I said empathy is if he's like

215
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,766
man I'm just working on this
third pitch, I don't like

216
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:39,236
being around people, I
don't want to go do this.

217
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:41,200
I don't want people up in my, look,

218
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,753
you've gotta have empathy.

219
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,762
So I think for us uniquely,
because of the marketing

220
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:48,601
machine, we definitely
have to be smart and listen

221
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,549
carefully of who says they want that.

222
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:52,929
Who needs that.

223
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:56,095
- [AJ] If Derek Morgan is a
vegan and I call a chicken wing

224
00:07:56,095 --> 00:07:58,620
restaurant, I'm not going
to bring that to Derek.

225
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,827
That's not authentic to
him, he won't advertise

226
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:02,550
anything he won't put into his body.

227
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,757
- And that's why the
agents are vulnerable.

228
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:07,145
The agents, the CA's,
they've got six moves.

229
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:09,605
And you've got to fit into their moves.

230
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,406
They're gonna try to get
you a sneaker deal, they're

231
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,931
gonna try to, they've got
six moves and so what we're

232
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:16,073
trying to do is create a swiss army knife

233
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:18,271
instead of a hammer.

234
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:20,496
And then to be very frank, win on the

235
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:24,867
only thing you can win
on which is, if he quit

236
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:27,840
tomorrow because he fell
in love with yoga retreats

237
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,745
and that's his calling in life,
be his homie for that too.

238
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,410
And I think that's why we're
going to win ultimately,

239
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,323
because if you're in the
business of the kid for life,

240
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:40,923
regardless, as long as they're
not a complete piece of

241
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:42,863
crap and changed on you.

242
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:46,202
We spend so much time on
okay he's from a small town,

243
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:49,452
what happens when he hits the big city.

244
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:55,024
We can afford to not be
in the business of getting

245
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,934
the phone call at two in the morning.

246
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:01,089
So we don't need to be in
that and we're generally not.

247
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,080
And the other thing is,
you get your heart broken.

248
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,240
I already have, four
seconds in the business

249
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,048
we signed a kid who then
fired us before he went

250
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:10,473
to the league and I watched
it and I'm heartbroken.

251
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:13,323
I love him, and so we want
to be very thoughtful.

252
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,662
And so I think the way
we're going to beat it,

253
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:18,772
but I think the most important
thing for you from afar,

254
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,850
and I haven't done a lot
of homework so I don't

255
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,257
want to bullshit but, squeeze
it while you've got leverage.

256
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:27,348
Not a lot of human beings
get to be the number one pick

257
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:32,237
of a team in New York, it's a
real thing, it's really real.

258
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,532
Ya know what's funny?

259
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,372
And let me tell you
something, it's not even like

260
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,476
a young or old, I respect
that, and I don't know

261
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:39,309
and I'm sure he'll speak for himself,

262
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,559
I didn't understand either.

263
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,952
By the way, you don't
even understand, I bet you

264
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,629
you don't even understand
how lucky even are to be

265
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,647
a human being when the
math is 400 trillion to 1.

266
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:50,848
How can you?

267
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,126
You're a human being.

268
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,709
It's what you know.

269
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:57,270
He can't feel what it feels
like to only be able to throw

270
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,815
57 like the way I can feel it.

271
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,334
He just doesn't know what that feels like.

272
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,223
He did that when he was seven right?

273
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:05,569
The key is empathy,
you're right, he doesn't.

274
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:09,736
And the same way that all
of us sitting here can't.

275
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:11,432
You can't.

276
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:14,332
What you've got, you take
for granted by the nature

277
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,054
of being a human being.

278
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:19,678
It's all of us around
each other that see it

279
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:23,845
and so for me it's not about,
I'm empathetic I love it.

280
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:31,230
I'm even more excited
about the meeting based on

281
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,896
the way it's going but I have
no interest in being like

282
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:35,885
hey listen to me kid, I fuckin
made, that doesn't work.

283
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,142
The reason why so many kids
resonate with me and why I

284
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:43,298
have 2 million followers on
instagram, is I went to USC

285
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:46,004
football team and spoke to
the football team and was like

286
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:48,715
yo, for 91 percent of you,
this is the greatest year

287
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,874
of your life.

288
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:51,825
And cause it's true.

289
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,245
It's not cause I'm cool or
cause I came in with swag.

290
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:55,872
It's cause it's true.

291
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,653
Go look at every fucking
person that was drafted in

292
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:01,393
the first round of major league
baseball and look at what's

293
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,226
happened.

294
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,834
Lot of good, cause there's a
lot of fucking talent there.

295
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,613
But a lot more bad than
you would think just

296
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,003
cause it's life.

297
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,263
The truth, right?

298
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:14,430
So for me it's super
compounded because of the local

299
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:19,915
kid and how big the money is in New York.

300
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:23,521
If you were the first pick
overall for The Royals,

301
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:25,809
off the field money is
different than being

302
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,682
a first round pick for the
Mets in New York as a local

303
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:30,850
kid and all the advantages you have.

304
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,895
That's something you need
to debate and it's hard

305
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:35,531
because it's a counter-pull
from what question

306
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:39,698
you should be focused on,
just being a great fuckin...

307
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:41,639
Like I get it right?

308
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,878
That makes sense.

309
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:46,538
So finding that right
balance I think is super hard

310
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:50,705
and a challenge but super
important because it becomes,

311
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:55,251
I spend a lot of time with
kids that just regret.

312
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:58,032
And just regret, regret, regret right?

313
00:11:58,032 --> 00:12:02,557
I grew up like a lot of
people, which is like fuck man,

314
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:05,564
I was real sad around third or
fourth grade when I realized

315
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:07,651
it wasn't gonna happen, ya know?

316
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:10,815
We all grow up wanting to do what you do

317
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,362
but now that I'm a 41
year old man and now that

318
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:16,544
entrepreneurship is so cool
it's even easier to say

319
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:18,702
fuck, thank God I wasn't an athlete.

320
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:21,500
It's over when you're 30,
ya know for a lot of them.

321
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,703
I think about running Curtis
Martin, ya know running backs

322
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,124
at 28 years old running
back, your finished?

323
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:29,633
I mean what the fuck, you're a kid right?

324
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,055
We've lived it right?

325
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:34,103
We've been 28, so I think
it's just all those feelings,

326
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:36,616
all those thoughts and
I think it's the balance

327
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:39,147
of following your
intuition and your gut even

328
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:43,036
when you're so lucky to
have good voices around you

329
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:45,689
pulling super hard on like
doing what you want to do

330
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,530
and believing and that's real.

331
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,442
In parallel, in opposite
direction of listening

332
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:52,017
to everything and filtering it.

333
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:56,178
Not saying no to anything
upfront just so you hear it,

334
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:58,983
and then you being the filter.

335
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:02,030
Too many kids just say no upfront
cause it's from their Dad,

336
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,463
it's from somebody else and
it's like fuck you I'm not

337
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:07,464
gonna be like you I'm gonna
fuckin make, all that shit.

338
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:09,721
So many people just don't even hear it.

339
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,503
The key, the only piece
of advice is hear it

340
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:14,209
and then make your decisions.

341
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,433
Not for anybody but yourself,
not for that man, not for her,

342
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,115
not for nobody, for you.

343
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:20,708
That's how you win, that's
how there's no resentment,

344
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,187
that's how it's real
family all the way through.

345
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:25,331
I think people break on both parts,

346
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,250
they don't hear every, they
don't listen to everything.

347
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,275
You should listen to
everything and they do make

348
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,529
decisions for other
people besides themselves,

349
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,863
and those two macro
vulnerabilities to me are,

350
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:38,364
is really my anchor advice
and squeeze the shit

351
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:42,387
out of your situation
cause it's an opportunity.

352
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:45,243
- I had a conversation with
his agent, I told his agent

353
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:46,959
this, and I told him to watch you.

354
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,254
I said you guys got to get
this because if you don't

355
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:51,820
the industry's gonna go this
way, I just have that feeling

356
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,178
about what you're doing.

357
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:55,082
And I look at his
opportunities in this city,

358
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:58,117
who he is, and he has the
same feeling that you have

359
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:01,564
with your success and where
you're going, he's the same way.

360
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:03,238
- And you know what's crazy for me?

361
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:06,586
Unless I have a terminal
disease, I should be good.

362
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,039
He doesn't.

363
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,703
I've become real empathetic to that.

364
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:14,011
I literally sleep every
night and hope I don't die,

365
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:16,381
hope I'm not sick, hope
nobody I care about is sick

366
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:18,039
cause that's my only kryptonite.

367
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:22,743
Especially now, it's over
other than something tragic

368
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:25,689
right to the seven people
I give a fuck about

369
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,256
which will slow me down for a year or me,

370
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:30,752
which would slow me down completely.

371
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:35,067
You could throw one pitch,
and that's scary as fuck man.

372
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:38,861
I don't envy, and I
respect the shit out of

373
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,690
the psychology of that which
then creates even a greater

374
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,470
sense of urgency for me
of like hey be thoughtful

375
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,966
of how you want to do this.

376
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,504
At the same token, putting
your face out, putting

377
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,884
yourself out there and doing things.

378
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:53,576
That's a DNA thing, not
everybody's an extrovert.

379
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:56,594
Not everybody likes it, not
everybody wants to sellout.

380
00:14:56,594 --> 00:15:01,248
- I don't want to go on
stage or anything like that

381
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,045
so DNA matters too.

382
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,269
- And when you force kids, so
I think it's being thoughtful.

383
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,500
My big thing is reverse engineering.

384
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,941
Dissect the shit, if we
started a baseball division

385
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,806
and he was first, dissect
the shit, have real talk.

386
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:15,302
Be like, I don't want you
to do shit, I just want

387
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:17,842
to deliver them what you want me to do.

388
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:21,059
And if you want to get a
deal with Kit the brand

389
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,090
versus this or if you want
to fuckin, you tell me.

390
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,006
You want to do a deal with
Bape cause you think it's

391
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:28,146
cool great, let's reverse
engineer it and if you don't,

392
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:30,457
if it's just money and you
don't give a shit about

393
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,142
which bottled water, it's just money,

394
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:34,580
which I have empathy for,
I would do that with things

395
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,438
that I don't care about,
that I'm not against.

396
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:38,766
You may not drink alcohol and
there's rules and all that.

397
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,565
You may not drink bottled
water and you don't

398
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,833
want to do it cause that's
how you roll, mazel tov.

399
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,352
Just figuring it out and
reverse engineering and

400
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:46,596
creating avenues.

401
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:49,968
- I think that's something
that him and we were

402
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,589
down by Bape and down
by Kit and these guys

403
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:54,613
support Jordan to the nth degree.

404
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:57,638
Its, ya know is he in position now to make

405
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:59,000
those kind of deals.

406
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,880
- He's in position now to
make those kind of deals

407
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,357
with the people that become
Bape before they're Bape.

408
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:10,025
- I think he is, I think
if you're a New York, again

409
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm making way too many
assumptions just on

410
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,726
the clothes he's wearing and the vibe.

411
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:19,859
Yes, I think there are
deals, we've already quickly

412
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,557
made a name for ourselves
for getting dollars

413
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:25,263
in places that people
don't think they are.

414
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:27,136
Whether off of my equity or just being

415
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,803
strategically smart.

416
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,497
Five minutes.

417
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:33,901
Can't?

418
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:35,265
Gotta go?

419
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,883
We're hurting?

420
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:38,800
Fuck okay, two minutes.

421
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:43,194
I would reverse engineers
Queens, Base, Mets, there's

422
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:45,586
a lot of smart things that
could be done so I think

423
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:48,065
the answer is yes but
I don't think Adidas is

424
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,861
signing him to a Yeezy deal right?

425
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:55,037
So it's just being
realistic, finding interests,

426
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:58,293
and it's all about finding opportunities.

427
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:00,725
Finding startups that are
sitting with more money

428
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:03,158
than they know what to
do with and trying to

429
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,003
make a name for themselves in New York

430
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,220
and then compelling them to understand

431
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:08,723
that this is the guy.

432
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,604
And then it's finding the right partners.

433
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:13,009
We're producing content
for Postmates and things

434
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:15,195
of that nature, and AJ can
walk you through a little

435
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,664
bit more of that and I
know you gotta go too.

436
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:20,219
So keep putting pressure
on them to think about

437
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:23,109
it this way but the answer
is whether it's too early

438
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,509
or too not, you don't get unless you ask.

439
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,347
And honestly, you don't strike
me as man who needs to wait

440
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:33,580
or if that's appropriate
you don't need to wait

441
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,479
for your agent, you
just do your thing too.

442
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:39,561
- My agent wants to meet
with you so I said to set

443
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,370
something up, and I heard
that you are a card collector

444
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,893
so we bought you that one.

445
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:45,716
- That's what's up I appreciate it.

446
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,691
That's great, I appreciate that.

447
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,840
Can I have the case?

448
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,634
Hell yeah, I don't want
to bend this stuff.

449
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,274
Ultra-pro is still around?

450
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,432
Jesus Christ.

451
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:56,204
This is when I started my business.

452
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:58,755
Listen, we had a lot of
conversations about a lot of things,

453
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:02,922
I didn't take this meeting
just for kicks and giggles

454
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:06,636
I really wanted to meet and
say hello and say what's up

455
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:09,256
and see where the paths lead.

456
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,285
Feel free to reach out anytime,
and I will meet that guy.

457
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:16,222
Feel free to set that up,
and I wish you success.

458
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:17,880
- Thank you, appreciate it.

459
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,713
- My man.

460
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:19,546
Good luck to you.

461
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:20,379
- Thank you.

462
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,346
- Yeah, good luck, such a pleasure.

463
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:23,604
Hope you guys enjoyed it.

464
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,350
Fun fact, coffee in Australia
is just fuckin good.

465
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,987
I'll see you soon, leave
a comment, please leave

466
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:31,814
me a comment of your
favorite young athlete.

467
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:34,003
That's what I want to see
in the Youtube comments.

468
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:35,836
Let's make this a little
more interactive, a little

469
00:18:35,836 --> 00:00:00,000
more fun, thank you so much
for watching the fuckin vlog.
