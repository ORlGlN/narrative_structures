1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,235
- Dude, there's no difference between

2
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,243
six figures and eight figures.

3
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:04,828
Like, what's the fuckin' difference?

4
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:06,275
- Yeah.

5
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:07,426
- Like I get, I'm like practical,

6
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:08,642
I understand, but like what?

7
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,562
Two extra bedrooms?

8
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:12,979

What's up, vlog?

11
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:30,092
Good day.

12
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:30,946
A little gloomy here.

13
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,723
About to have a great meeting with Kaylen.

14
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,043
Kaylen, five years?

15
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:34,918
- Almost six.

16
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:36,268
- Oof, real veteran. Love you.

17
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:38,100
Hope everybody's doing well.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,483
Thank you so much for
everybody who's listening

19
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:41,027
to the airport project.

20
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:42,474
Have you listened to the airport project?

21
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:43,307
- Yes, half of it.

22
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:44,140
- See?

23
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,098
Do you see how scared she got

24
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:46,154
because she knew I was about

25
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:47,059
to ask her a very detailed question.

26
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,307
- I got to the one after the parents one.

27
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:49,170
- Good, seven.

28
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,540
See ya!

29
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,802
Should be a good day, a lot going on.

30
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,059
Hope to see all of you later.

31
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,976
We got some stuff, busy day though.

("Heartbound" by Mitchell Bailey)

33
00:01:11,877 --> 00:01:13,115
Life is good.

34
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,603
If you're good enough

35
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:15,769
it always pays off,

36
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:17,666
that's the biggest thing
everybody's confused about.

37
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,874
With patience.

38
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:21,163
The reason patience is the best strategy

39
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:23,970
is because the merit of
your skills will play out

40
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,741
in the long-term.

41
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:27,339
Will it work out?

42
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,387
I don't know how talented you are.

43
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:31,555
My intuition is you're hungry as fuck.

44
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:32,899
And so that already

45
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:36,202
To me it's patience, ambition, and talent.

46
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:37,266
So

47
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,643
you've got ambition

48
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:40,595
everybody's got ambition.

49
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:43,780
Well let me rephrase, a lot
of people have ambition.

50
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,571
A lot of people actually have talent

51
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:48,819
especially if they're
self-aware of their ambition

52
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,988
and talent, then they can really win.

53
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:52,931
But nobody has patience.

54
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:53,859
- Photo?

55
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:54,859
- Hell yeah.

So I'm heading to a

59

Big one.

This is Marcus Krzastek

What's going on?

64

Airplane project still in the back.

65
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:43,636
How you doing?

66
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:45,364
- Man, never better man.

67
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:47,082
- That's good man, that makes me happy.

68
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,780
One thing with him that's
different is the youngsters

69
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,643
fuck with him on a respect
level that's different.

70
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:54,939
That's why I'm gonna win.

71
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:55,772
- Yeah

72
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:58,108
- It's not how cool or big I'm gonna be

73
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,706
17 million Instagram followers
in four years is gonna

74
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,683
be great, it'll be cool,

75
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,275
but it's not gonna make
people, like I'm not

76
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:07,579
gonna be able to move
America to all of a sudden,

77
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,644
by myself give a fuck
about whatever the fuck

78
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:11,586
I deploy that against.

79
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:14,962
The thing you have is the
tentacles as an entrepreneur

80
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:18,315
in business, man, within
people that are moving culture.

81
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:19,148
- Yeah

82
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:24,140
- It doesn't matter what
the Migos are doing,

83
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,379
it matters who the Migos look up to.

84
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,046
That's where skill comes in man.

85
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,606
But fuck man, Atlanta is culture

86
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:35,795
And I think you need to
be super thoughtful about

87
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,354
how much leverage that actually is

88
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:38,187
- Right

89
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:39,210
- I think you guys take it for granted

90
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,043
You know,

91
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,115
it just feels normal,

92
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,140
you're so in it it feels normal.

93
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,914
You take it for granted.

94
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:50,331
Like I just think it's
fucking really matters.

95
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,700
Like at a level that fucking confuses me

96
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,634
Meaning like just watching
it go from LA Reed

97
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:59,866
Just watching it my whole
life, like the leverage

98
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,051
is so real.

99
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:03,938
- We're continuing to grow

100
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:06,580
- The thing that fucks with
me the most is the difference

101
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,443
between 21 Savage, Russ,
the Migos, Danny Glover,

102
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:13,852
the Hollywood shit that's
happening in the fucking suburbs

103
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:17,675
Like there's so much really happening,

104
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:18,636
that's what I'm good at.

105
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,219
I'm good at people's attention.

106
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:24,940
That's why I invested in
Facebook and Twitter and Uber

107
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,186
before everybody else, I
knew it was gonna happen.

108
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,707
I really think you guys
can build some big ass

109
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:32,540
business.

110
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,675
- It was a pleasure man.

111
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,347
This your name?

112
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:36,434
- That's me my man.

113
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:37,634
- Alright I'm gonna lock you in.

114
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,217
I'm on you big dog.

115
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:48,080
- When I put up the five,
don't shake my fucking hand.

116
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:53,312
(dramatic music)

117
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,416
- Hey man, appreciate it

118
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,666
- Stay healthy.

119
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,015
Did you get my look in the
camera because he grabbed my hand

120
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,111
Do you know this meme?

121
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,134
Did you capture it.

122
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:04,720
- Yeah that was the same thing
that happened at foot action

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,823
- I think we got it

124
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:07,935
I think you got it.

125
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,513
It's gonna be a meme and a half.

126
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:11,999
I did the five, he put shook it

127
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:13,582
and I looked in the camera

128
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:15,007
which is gonna be amazing

129
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:15,983
- Do you mind?

130
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:16,816
- Signing it?

131
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,103
- Can you make it out to
my brother by any chance?

132
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:20,175
- 100%, what's his name?

133
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:21,522
- His name's Collin

134
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,355
- Collin

135
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,567
- He actually bought five copies

136
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,815
- That's amazing

137
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:28,927
- He's dying. He's like
can you put my name in and

138
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:33,010
I was like, I might be
able to do you one better.

139
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:34,688
- Awesome.

140
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:38,288
There's a lot of great reasons
to build a personal brand.

141
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:41,607
Both on like a human selfish
level and on a business level

142
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,319
But the way to build the
best, biggest personal brand

143
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,927
is to not monetize the audience

144
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:46,760
- Yeah

145
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,106
- One of the ways I figured
out how to do that was

146
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:51,071
to get book deals and speaking
engagements where I wasn't

147
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,631
monetizing the audience.

148
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:53,943
The key is a couple things.

149
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:56,070
First and foremost, for
everybody here, and this is like

150
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,198
giving advice that will
transcend for everybody

151
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:01,086
There's three ways humans communicate,

152
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:03,751
the written word, audio, and video.

153
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:06,047
You should do them all

154
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:07,880
If you can, afford to.

155
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,159
And if you cannot, my
big thing is to become

156
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,895
self-aware of how you best communicate

157
00:06:14,895 --> 00:06:17,217
It would be a real mitzvah,
using a nice Jewish

158
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:20,560
word on Hannukah, if you could do video

159
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,072
because video can give you the other two

160
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,750
and the way you do that is the way I do it

161
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,599
it's video, as you guys know
if you listen to my podcast,

162
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,654
that becomes audio pretty
easily, and you can

163
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:34,431
literally hire an intern or
somebody to work for free

164
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,798
based on the successes
you've had to transcribe it

165
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,127
into written.

166
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:40,863
And now you're reaching people everywhere,

167
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:44,390
now you have a blog and a
medium and a Linkedin presence

168
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,815
now you have a Youtube and
a Facebook video presence,

169
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,903
now you have a podcast presence.

170
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:52,183
My part of this equation
to make you win, is to try

171
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:55,575
to get you not to monetize
them for as long as possible

172
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:56,408
if ever.

173
00:06:57,823 --> 00:07:00,519
There's no difference between
six figures and eight figures

174
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,128
like what's the fuckin difference,

175
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,671
like I get, I'm practical, I understand,

176
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,671
but like what two extra bedrooms,

177
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,231
like what an extra trip,

178
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:11,399
like the caviar supplement.

179
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,423
(laughter)

180
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,663
Like what, right?

181
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:18,215
The reason to make more money
to close a vulnerability

182
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:19,715
and an insecurity.

183
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:24,470
The reason young men want to
make money is to get girls.

184
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,263
- You already have her

185
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,728
(laughter)

186
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:29,143
- And that's the point,

187
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:31,183
like you literally have no

188
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:34,111
like there's not a whole
lot, especially if you

189
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,063
give any fucks about legacy.

190
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:39,319
People say they want legacy, but they use

191
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,527
that as a disguise to make more money.

192
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,559
Tell your story in a fuckin minute.

193
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,694
And then you have to understand
why this is important,

194
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:47,945
because tomorrow Instagram
announces that videos are

195
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,942
now not capped to one minute
and we're all like oh.

196
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:53,535
Like everybody makes decisions
based on the rules of today

197
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,159
when these platforms
change their rules on an

198
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,409
everyday basis.

199
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:00,063
So first, figure it out.

200
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,918
It was a lot easier to
convert people with the word

201
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,769
wine than it was in 1997 super Tuscans.

202
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:06,983
Right?

203
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:09,473
It's, I get it, it's
easier for you to fully

204
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:12,287
articulate your whole god
damn thing in three minutes

205
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,799
and nineteen seconds.

206
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,975
Go challenge yourselves
for once because this

207
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:16,991
is all becoming very

208
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,255
like you guys have it.

209
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:20,416
Cool, alright, I gotta go.

210
00:08:20,416 --> 00:00:00,000
