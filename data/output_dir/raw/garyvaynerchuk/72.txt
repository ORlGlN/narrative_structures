1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,597
- [Man] I got a date with
Star Wars this evening.

2
00:00:01,597 --> 00:00:02,764
- Oh, amazing.

3
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:04,658
- What Star Wars?

4
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:05,671
- The one that's coming out at midnight.

5
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:08,325
- Holy fuckface, it's
December 15th already?

6
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:09,438
(laughing)

7
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:13,605
That was the most crazy
thing that has ever happened.

8
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:15,702
Can we go see Star Wars?

9
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:18,619
(industrial music)

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,802
What up, vlog?

11
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:26,824
Lando is here now, guest starring here.

12
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:27,657
- What's up?

13
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:30,649
- In Chattanooga, flew
into Atlanta this morning

14
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:31,913
on a six A.M. flight,

15
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:34,612
did a bunch of meetings
with one of our clients.

16
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:37,359
Mickey and I did a two hour
drive, did a bunch of calls.

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,383
Now we're here at the Westin,

18
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:40,365
the new fancy hotel here in Chattanooga

19
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:41,734
for a bunch of meetings,

20
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:44,986
and the Chattanooga
Holiday Party is tonight.

21
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:47,903
(industrial music)

22
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,066
- Yep, doing a podcast.

23
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:04,250
- What up, what up?

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,083
- Good to see you.

25
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,631
- Welcome, how ya doing?
- Good, man, how are you?

26
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:11,381
Voice, bro, like I don't
think people get it.

27
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,245
It's oxygen, it's all-encompassing.

28
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:17,831
I want to interact with,

29
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:20,295
we all love interacting with a computer.

30
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:22,367
The passive nature of the consumption,

31
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,682
which means it equates into time savings,

32
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:29,042
and my belief that time
is the number one variable

33
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,788
asset that we continue
to gravitate towards

34
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:33,545
even more than money.

35
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:35,011
Probably other than health,

36
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,594
the most important thing to us.

37
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,800
And the fact that the voice written

38
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:46,766
and video consumption in our society

39
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:49,221
are the three pillars of
how we consume content.

40
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,119
The consumer entrepreneurs
that I want to spend time with

41
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,003
are people developing on
top of voice platforms,

42
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:56,709
period, end of story.

43
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,042
(R&B music)

44
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:06,288
One of our guys from over there

45
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:08,705
went into an innovation role.

46
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,411
You built an event around that theme.

47
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,244
- [Man] Yes.

48
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:14,458
- It's called, if you're
in innovation roles,

49
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,532
come see Gary Vee.

50
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:18,468
- [Man] Corporate innovation roles, yeah.

51
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,801
(R&B music)

52
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:27,235
- How you doing?
- Good, man, how are you?

53
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:28,155
- I'm good, man.

54
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:29,969
I'm in real estate in this area,

55
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,168
I have my own real estate company

56
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:32,468
and I also do development.

57
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:34,604
So what I bring is something
completely different,

58
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:36,635
which is the design is just different

59
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:38,098
than what Chattanooga's used to.

60
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:41,169
And so I'm hitting that wall.

61
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,336
- The conservative nature of it?

62
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,159
- Yeah, hardcore.

63
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,786
As far as, for example,
roof lines, in general.

64
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:49,761
Like my roofs do this versus this.

65
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,603
And so that's hard for them to grasp that.

66
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,565
- Well, that's a far more
interesting conversation.

67
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:57,054
So I'll go maybe in a different direction

68
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:58,120
that you may not want to hear.

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,091
One of my biggest thesises is

70
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,335
whenever you fight the market, you lose.

71
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:05,054
Pushing is imperative, right?

72
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:07,221
But if you push to a place that doesn't

73
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,265
map the practicality wants and needs

74
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:10,825
and you create too much friction?

75
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,498
What I think I've done
really well in my career

76
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:13,442
when I look at other things

77
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:18,106
and why I admire Amazon or
others is it's all about,

78
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,307
by the way, back to Nicky,
I'll appease you here,

79
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:23,064
innovation, things of that nature.

80
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:26,779
There's a level of practicality
that has to be part of it.

81
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:28,659
Otherwise you're just too far ahead of it.

82
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:32,826
I think you have a timing
slash appetite friction.

83
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,468
One thing I would definitely not do

84
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:37,467
is try to convince people.

85
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,395
So if you're hitting a
wall and they're selling,

86
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,879
I would profile the nos and the yeses

87
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,545
and spend a lot more time with people

88
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:44,936
that look the part of yeses.

89
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:47,041
I'd rather convince Jesse,

90
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,152
open-mindness, grew up in Jersey,

91
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:50,010
East Coast flavor,

92
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,890
okay, let me see if I can get him to

93
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,272
spend a little bit more than he wanted to

94
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:56,362
to come into this thing that he's open to,

95
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:59,145
than going to somebody
who's super conservative,

96
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:00,433
may have the finances

97
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,727
but literally has made a
religious line in the sand

98
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:05,394
of like, this funky junky stuff.

99
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:07,570
I'm projecting a little here,

100
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,284
but I think the key when
you're doing something new

101
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,724
is two things:

102
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:16,927
one, not being so far out
that it's not consumable,

103
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,447
and I don't sense that
that's necessarily it,

104
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:23,041
two, everybody wastes time
selling the unsellable.

105
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,147
- It's not profit-driven,
so that's my problem.

106
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:26,790
- It's artistic-driven.

107
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,207
That scares me, it scares me.

108
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,324
- [Man] Can you go down the rabbit

109
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:33,491
trail where it would work?

110
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,344
- It would work if, here's how

111
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,995
things like this
theoretically tend to work.

112
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:42,091
I would lose a lot of money on

113
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:46,258
the most alpha influencer
in this market to take one.

114
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,203
I'd like give one of these

115
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:51,141
historic families that live in the hills

116
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:52,641
one of the houses.

117
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,212
Where you see it happen

118
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,500
is when a tastemaker on a macro or a micro

119
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,148
goes onto the other side.

120
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:01,713
- [Man] Okay.

121
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:04,706
- When Hip Hop, I'm just gonna use music.

122
00:05:04,706 --> 00:05:09,102
When P. Diddy and Biggie
started talking about lifestyle,

123
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:12,962
and it's about champagne and living good,

124
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,104
hip hop changed from who's the toughest

125
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:16,991
to who's the richest?

126
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,649
And it changed the whole genre.

127
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,745
But it needed to be someone
who was that popular

128
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:22,370
to change the conversation.

129
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,037
(hip-hop music)

130
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:29,038
Nick, I'm excited about this,
I want to make this work.

131
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,355
- [Nick] Yeah, fire it up.

132
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:32,022
- What should we do?

133
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,224
We're thinking like a
brand and a salesman.

134
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,057
Obviously, it's the restaurant thing

135
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:42,138
with a (bleep) every 90, not a,

136
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:46,121
with a (bleep) in
Chattanooga every 90 days

137
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,582
for the group that came
in during that time.

138
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,388
If you come in, right?

139
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:54,555
So what's this packaged
(bleep) dollar thing

140
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,416
that we can build a well-oiled machine.

141
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:04,214
That he can go find out three more of him.

142
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:06,067
How do we just do it?

143
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,121
'Cause it's there.

144
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:09,440
If I make a (bleep) for
the hundred mile radius

145
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,264
of this location, and we
pound it, we will sell.

146
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,265
Guys, think about this
from business terms.

147
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,765
You know your P&L.

148
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,812
Next year 50 days in the year,

149
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:25,947
we will have seven to 14
people in our office paying

150
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:29,780
(bleep) a head for education.

151
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:31,909
Yeah.

152
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:34,576
(hip hop music)

153
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:38,844
- [Man] You ready, let's do it.

154
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:39,677
- Let's do it.

155
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:42,337
- How are you, sir, it is an honor.

156
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:45,420
- Happy holidays, thank you, brother.

157
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,730
If you're ever in Chattanooga, tell 'em.

158
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,118
- Come to 2 Son's Kitchen!

159
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:52,830
- I don't even know, I met one second

160
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,784
and I'm like, let's just give a shout-out!

161
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:55,878
I feel it, it's awesome, man.

162
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:59,338
Sometimes I just get in the
mood to, like, give people love.

163
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:00,891
He's just a good dude.

164
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,298
This is an amazing spot.

165
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,965
(hip-hop music)

166
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:11,650
Shit, you guys got real wine.

167
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,187
I know, I can see it.

168
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:18,346
Dude, do you know how sick this wine is?

169
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:20,378
Who drinks pinot noir here, anybody?

170
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:21,914
You're gonna freak your shit.

171
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:23,922
This is big, I'm so pumped right now.

172
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:27,042
This is what I want to say for all of us,

173
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:29,195
from youngest to oldest.

174
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:30,372
A, everybody here is gonna live

175
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:32,356
a lot long longer than they think.

176
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:34,013
Let's project technology.

177
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:35,987
You know, you could get hit
by a bus in an hour, I get it.

178
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:38,570
But a lot longer than we think.

179
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:43,303
The internet's maturity,
which is what we're living in

180
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:46,141
right now, is the biggest culture shift

181
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:49,301
to our society since the printing press.

182
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:52,149
So it's very hard for us
to actually grapple with

183
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:53,596
what we're going through right now,

184
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:57,323
cause it's so much bigger
than anything we can point to.

185
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,725
So we have no reference,
but it's happening.

186
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,676
And it's an incredible era,
and I'm excited about it.

187
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:04,178
And I think if we take
the offense out of it,

188
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:08,428
you know, it's funny, we default
into demonizing technology.

189
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:11,702
We think writing a note
is some miraculous feat,

190
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:14,191
but sending a text is kids
don't talk to each other.

191
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:18,268
We are missing the point of
the evolution of communication

192
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:19,687
and the power of it.

193
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,746
And I've never been more optimistic,

194
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:26,209
and I think in a micro,
everybody's businesses

195
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,000
and ambitions to raise
money for nonprofits

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,669
or get a mayor elected in this town,

197
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,660
or whatever the hell you care about,

198
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,395
it's all gonna happen here.

199
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:36,461
This is it.

200
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:38,107
You gotta wrap your head around it.

201
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:40,796
And becoming a communicator on this device

202
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:43,437
is not about a luxury,

203
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:45,563
it's a necessity over the next decade.

204
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:47,885
And I highly encourage all of you

205
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:49,844
to get a hell of a lot
more serious about it.

206
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:52,965
I think to the point of net neutrality,

207
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,154
I think there's a lot
of things that people

208
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:55,442
don't understand about the issue.

209
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,114
I don't want a toll booth.

210
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:57,947
Let me give you an example.

211
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,436
Who has Verizon here, anybody?

212
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:03,081
Great, Verizon, Verizon owns Yahoo!

213
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:04,968
Net neutrality is just
like a news headline

214
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:05,961
you're hearing about,

215
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,082
until a year from now, Yahoo! is free

216
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,685
and Google is 25 dollar a month.

217
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,229
It's interesting.

218
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:14,517
You know, there's a lot that happens now,

219
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:18,796
if they let the service
providers become the toll booth.

220
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:22,314
But I'm a big believer in capitalism.

221
00:09:22,314 --> 00:09:27,171
Okay, so Comcast does this
and Schmomcast does that.

222
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:29,532
Meanwhile, Google shoots
a balloon in the air

223
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:32,512
and provides us all service for free

224
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:34,504
and no net neutrality issues.

225
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:37,599
So I think we, a lot of times.

226
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,681
Remember when Microsoft
had to be regulated

227
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,009
for being a monopoly?

228
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,603
Remember when Walmart was too big?

229
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:46,549
We're very bad at
understanding the greatness

230
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,672
of actual macrocapitalism
and entrepreneurship.

231
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,087
There's always innovation because

232
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:54,427
people are incentivized by
the openness of the upside.

233
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,844
(slow music)

234
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:02,322
I think we have a real
shot to do something

235
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:04,077
that everybody will talk about forever.

236
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:06,078
I really believe that,
I'm being dead serious.

237
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,042
And I think that I aspire to that,

238
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,563
and so I'm really excited,
it's a really good feeling.

239
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,628
I really, really love the
way you guys love each other,

240
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:16,795
and I think that foundation
gives this office

241
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:18,333
unbelievable upside.

242
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,186
I've been thinking a lot
more about the long-term

243
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,046
aspect of this office,
and what we're up to here.

244
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:25,298
I really wanna go deep, I really do.

245
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:28,505
I really want a big,
build a big, successful,

246
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:30,612
impactful, happy place.

247
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:32,011
And I think when I look around,

248
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,679
it became very obvious to me that.

249
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,377
I often use the analogy of like, okay,

250
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:39,856
this is a nice building and this is

251
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,292
a brand new nice building.

252
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,564
But the thing that makes this stick is

253
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:45,683
the steel that's behind that column

254
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:46,704
that we'll never think about

255
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:48,016
and the concrete that it's poured into,

256
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,536
the foundation's the fucking game.

257
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:53,235
And within a company that does what we do,

258
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,126
obviously you guys know

259
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:55,175
I'm disproportionately confident

260
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:56,413
that I'll know where to take us

261
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:58,126
with our products and services.

262
00:10:58,126 --> 00:10:59,989
That's something I was gifted with.

263
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:02,725
We will never, ever lose that game.

264
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:04,070
I think the thing that will make us

265
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,084
ultimately special is empathy.

266
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:08,534
I will pound empathy down
the throat of this company

267
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,413
next year, for you to be
empathetic to each other,

268
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:13,677
to each other's disciplines,

269
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:15,277
to what might be happening at home

270
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:16,950
or what's going on with that client

271
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,443
or the history of how you got there,

272
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:20,213
why you got transferred on our team.

273
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,535
But I'm sold that this office deploys

274
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:25,318
the prime example of
empathy across the board.

275
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,800
All right, vlog, it's been a great time.

276
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,831
Gonna spend some time
with the Chattanooga crew.

277
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:31,248
Happy holidays to you guys.

278
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:33,628
Leave in the comments a story

279
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:37,182
about a holiday party in your company.

280
00:11:37,182 --> 00:00:00,000
