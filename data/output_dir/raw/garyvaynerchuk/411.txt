1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,959
- Hey guys.

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,083
Thank you for having me.

3
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,083
This is a beautiful room.

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,500
I'm very excited to be here.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,083
And very honestly, I do want
to get into Q&A pretty quickly,

6
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:13,917
and I don't want to
bore you with my life story

7
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:14,750
or things of that nature.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,500
But here's where I will go.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,041
In doing some of my
homework before I got here

10
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,917
and some of the
talking that we did beforehand,

11
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:25,375
what I really feel
excitement about is even more so

12
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:29,208
than in the U.S. market,
where I've been able to

13
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,458
what I call day trade attention.

14
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:35,792
Which is, very simply, no
matter what you do in this room,

15
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,166
you've got to
communicate your value, right?

16
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,750
No matter what
you do in this room,

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,375
whether you're in B to B,
whether you're in B to C,

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,750
whatever you sell,
whatever you do,

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,208
if you're running for office,
if you're trying

20
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,041
to raise money for a non-profit,

21
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,542
if you're trying to sell
sneakers, if you're a lawyer,

22
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:53,792
if you're trying to raise your
profile to get a promotion,

23
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:54,792
or get a different job.

24
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:58,834
Regardless of what
you do, what your real job

25
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:03,250
at the macro is to find
where people's attention is

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,125
and then try to figure out how

27
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,583
to communicate your value prop.

28
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:10,166
When I see a market
like this that has decided,

29
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,041
and this is holistically,

30
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,291
this is not every
individual person,

31
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,708
but has decided things like
television or outdoor media,

32
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:20,000
or even more
specifically, direct mail,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,583
become the
preference points in a world

34
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,750
where Facebook has 

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,250
such underpriced
attention potential,

36
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,917
it just gets me very excited.

37
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:33,417
The reason we opened a
VaynerMedia London office is

38
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,917
when we carefully looked
at the cost of Facebook ads

39
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:39,750
in western Europe,
they were stunning to us

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,041
on how much
better of a deal it was

41
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,208
than the U.S. penetration.

42
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,959
What's interesting
about that, and some of you

43
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,458
that follow me know this,
and usually when I talk,

44
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,500
I talk in U.S. marketing terms,

45
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,083
we believe that
Facebook is disproportionately

46
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,875
the best deal in the marketplace
today in that market.

47
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,375
So, as you can imagine, it
created enormous excitement

48
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,458
for me about the
potential in markets

49
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,708
like Belgium, U.K., and
other places of that nature.

50
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:09,333
For me, very simply, this
speech is 

51
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,959
one minute of content,

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,417
which is, everything
I've done for 20 years

53
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,375
has been the same exact move.

54
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,083
What does everybody
spend their time and money

55
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,834
and energy on?

56
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,708
Is that worth it?

57
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,792
And then what can
I do that is emerging,

58
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:27,959
that is underpriced, because
people don't have reports

59
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,542
to justify it at
Corporate America?

60
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,875
Or, on the entrepreneurial
level, they're scared

61
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,375
to do it because
they're fake entrepreneurs.

62
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:40,041
For me, that has been the
tried-and-true real history

63
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:40,875
of my career.

64
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,125
It started all the way
back when I got involved

65
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,208
in my dad's liquor store.

66
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,583
It is literally only
20 years ago, 

67
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,083
now almost 21 years ago,

68
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,792
which is not that long of
a time if you really think

69
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:57,125
about it, that when we
launched WineLibrary.com,

70
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,792
everybody told me and
my dad that it was a fad.

71
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,583
Forget about is SnapChat a fad.

72
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,667
Forget about if
Instagram is a fad.

73
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,875
The entire internet was
a fad if you were really

74
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:15,125
a business person
in 1995, 1996, 1997.

75
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,208
It's fascinating to think that.

76
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,166
It's the same way
that many of you in here

77
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:23,125
probably don't realize if
you're not studying the space,

78
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,208
that we're probably
only 20 or 30 years away

79
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:29,125
from virtual reality
making the internet obsolete

80
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,542
and all of us just
living in contact lenses

81
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:34,000
and in a VR world,
and the real world

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,750
and the internet
world become arbitraged out

83
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,792
because what will
happen is our attention

84
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,834
will now be in a
new virtual reality.

85
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,125
For me, this is
how my brain works.

86
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,625
To me, I'm not a digitalist
over a traditionalist.

87
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,000
For example, in
the American market,

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,375
one of the things I'm really
pushing our clients towards

89
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,375
is actually radio.

90
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,333
There's a
platform called IHeartRadio

91
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,375
that I believe that the ads on
that platform are underpriced

92
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,125
for the attention because people
listen to that programming.

93
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,959
When the disc jockey
jumps in and reads a live ad,

94
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,792
I actually think
that's a good deal.

95
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,166
That confuses a
lot of my friends

96
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,917
that think I'm a digitalist.

97
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,083
In America, if you
were to launch a product,

98
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,959
and you had
$20 million to launch it,

99
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,541
the first thing I would
do is buy a Super Bowl ad.

100
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,707
Because in America,
every single person

101
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,750
watches the
Super Bowl commercials.

102
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,458
And so, this is how I trade.

103
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,583
This is how I think.

104
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,208
And the truth is,
much like what's happening

105
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,291
with your agency,
I've always thought

106
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,792
it was a huge
advantage to not be in America,

107
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,041
not be in Silicon Valley.

108
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,792
In a world where so much
of what we do is just human,

109
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,041
not American or
European, or Asian.

110
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,375
It's just human psychology,
not everything maps.

111
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,959
Obviously Americans
are more comfortable

112
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,875
being outspoken and in front.

113
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,750
Some countries
are more reserved.

114
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,208
Some countries have
political instability

115
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,291
that makes them scared to share.

116
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,500
There's different
variables across the world.

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,583
But when I look at this market,

118
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,708
it's interesting
to me and exciting.

119
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,041
Because the truth is,
you actually get to watch

120
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,542
the future play out
in a different market

121
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,667
and then all you have to do is
interpret it to your market.

122
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,959
And then all you
have to do is be patient.

123
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,959
See, the real reality here is,

124
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,208
the far majority of
upside sits in this room

125
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,708
with the individuals
here that map similar

126
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,375
to my overall thesis,
which is they're patient,

127
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,917
and they're waiting
for it to come to them.

128
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:30,375
But they're good enough in
staying alive to get there.

129
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:34,208
The backbone of my success
that I don't talk a lot about

130
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,000
is the fact that
I'm so good at sales

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,208
that I can scrounge by.

132
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,792
And that's what
the VaynerMedia was.

133
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:45,125
In 2009, '10, '11, when nobody
wanted to buy social media,

134
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,708
I was good enough to
just get by, stay alive,

135
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,708
stay alive, stay alive.

136
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,792
But, I was the loudest and

137
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,959
proudest about
believing in this.

138
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,625
I had to be right.

139
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,125
Because again, in 2009,
'10, '11, most people thought

140
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,875
these sites would go away.

141
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,708
This was coming on
the back of Myspace--

142
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,792
(phone ringing) Make
sure you pick that up.

143
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,333
(audience laughter)

144
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,041
This was on the back of
Myspace in the U.S. market

145
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,083
and people were still debating
if every site would have

146
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,375
a one or two year thing.

147
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,083
Everybody was very
emotional about investing

148
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,291
in new platforms.

149
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,000
I had to stay alive.

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,417
I was able to stay alive, and
then the market came to me.

151
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,708
Patience is such a big deal.

152
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,125
The thing that concerns me,
and that I'm curious about

153
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,083
in this room, is of the
300-plus people in here,

154
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
how many people
actually sell something

155
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,542
they fully believe 
in in their heart,

156
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:36,166
versus they sell it
because it's what they're doing,

157
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,583
or it's what
they've committed to,

158
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,208
and it's where
their money is tied into?

159
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,792
To me, this is a very
important part of being

160
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:47,875
in the agency,
brand, startup world.

161
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,959
If you do not fundamentally
believe in what you're selling,

162
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,125
and I mean really, not
how you posture to each other,

163
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,834
but how do you talk to yourself
in your own brain at night.

164
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,750
If you do not,
you're vulnerable.

165
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,166
You're very vulnerable
for many different reasons.

166
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,041
But my belief is now looking

167
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,542
at the global
advertising market.

168
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,375
It's amazing to me.

169
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,125
When I go to Cannes every year,

170
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,708
I'll sit on a panel like this.

171
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,834
Usually with somebody from
WPP and somebody from Omnicom,

172
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,208
and a big brand, and usually
it's a gang up session,

173
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,083
three against me.

174
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,208
Which is usually a blowout

175
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,041
because I can
slaughter the three of them.

176
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,375
It's not enough.

177
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,417
They bash me.

178
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,667
Tried-and-true reporting,
bullshit reporting,

179
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:35,000
Nielsens, Millward Brown
horseshit, fake math.

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,625
And then we'll end,
then we'll leave.

181
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,542
And then,
at 3:00 in the morning, 

182
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:44,750
after 11 glasses of rosé,

183
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,417
they'll see me at
the Carlton Hotel.

184
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,458
They'll come up to
me and they'll say,

185
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,417
"Psst. You're right."

186
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:54,041
I find this to be the
single most fascinating thing

187
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,000
about the advertising
and marketing landscape.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,375
In a world where
Facebook is disproportionately

189
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,417
the best direct-to-consumer
advertising,

190
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,166
the fact that Wine Library,
my family business,

191
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,208
has moved all of its direct
mail business into Facebook.

192
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,291
The math isn't even close.

193
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,834
There's people in here
doing direct mail marketing

194
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:14,083
who have made a
decision that that works

195
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,834
without spending
the same amount of money

196
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,166
on Facebook to
see if that works.

197
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,041
We are living in a
headline-reading society.

198
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,333
Everybody has opinions.

199
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,083
Everybody has
opinions about everything,

200
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,917
but they're not
actual practitioners.

201
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,250
You can't have an
opinion on Snapchat

202
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,875
or Snapchat ads if
you've never used it.

203
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,750
You can't have a
smart opinion to me

204
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,041
if you've run
$1,000 in Facebook ads

205
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,833
and have made
your entire decision

206
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:46,667
on the plethora of opportunites
on the platform on $1,000.

207
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,041
Clients tell me
all the time,

208
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,291
"Gary, we know
television commercials work,

209
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,625
"we don't if know
if Facebook works."

210
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,792
I go, "No shit,
you spent $8 million on

211
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,708
"a television
commercial campaign

212
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,291
"in production and distribution,

213
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,375
"and you spent
$100,000 testing Facebook."

214
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,417
Of course it's
not going to work.

215
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,875
And so we live
in this environment

216
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,291
where people go and play safe.

217
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:11,083
You make decisions, so many
of you in here make decisions

218
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,166
on what's best for your
career in the short-term,

219
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,959
not what actually sells shit.

220
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,542
And to me, that's where
all the opportunity sits.

221
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,667
That's where the action is,
that's the white space.

222
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,875
That's why in America,
in the fashion industry,

223
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,333
every brand is in trouble
because there are thousands

224
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,792
of little brands doing Facebook
and Instagram influencers,

225
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:32,750
and they're chopping
away at the big brands.

226
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,166
Ralph Lauren's
biggest problem isn't Prada,

227
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,750
it's 41 women and men
startups that are doing

228
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,208
from zero to three
million in revenue in one year

229
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,083
because they're marketing
in underpriced channels

230
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,083
while Ralph Lauren and
Prada are buying full page ads

231
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,500
in fuckin' Vogue
that nobody's seeing.

232
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,542
This is happening,
this is happening every day.

233
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,458
And here's the
funniest part, I know

234
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:01,000
that everybody in this
room knows it's happening.

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,583
I just don't know if it actually
is in your best interest

236
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,667
for it be happening
in the short-term.

237
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,166
That to me is the bet,
that to me is the strategy.

238
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,625
That is the only thing I care
about pushing in this room.

239
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,667
It's why I want to go
to Q&A sooner, I'd rather go

240
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:17,542
into details 'cause
the thesis is very simple.

241
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:20,750
I can say this
again five more times

242
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,125
and get to the Q&A part,

243
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,834
but it will not change,
it will be the same thing.

244
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,667
I will give you
four different analogies

245
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,166
for the same fucking thing.

246
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:31,667
Attention has a price,
everything still works,

247
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,708
the problem is most
things are overpriced.

248
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,500
For example, in
America and the globe,

249
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,000
programmatic buying for digital
has completely taken over.

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,291
Why? It's profitable
for media agencies.

251
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,667
But it's not good for
brands and businesses.

252
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,375
Who the hell here
goes to a desktop computer

253
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,959
and goes to blah
blah blah dot com

254
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,083
and goes to the
right side of the website

255
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,500
below the fold and
clicks a banner ad?

256
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Nobody.

257
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,625
So in a world where
I put enormous pressure

258
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,000
on my clients to move
money away from television

259
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,375
because nobody,
nobody in the U.S. market

260
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,500
and nobody in the global
market, if you look at the math,

261
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,208
is really consuming a
television commercial.

262
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,667
Every single time
you're in a position

263
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,083
where a television
commercial is about

264
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,208
to give you
something, you grab this

265
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,250
and you check your
work, you talk about

266
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,208
what you just watched
'cause you're watching...

267
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,625
I love when my
competitors on stage say,

268
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,792
"Gary, television
ratings are through the roof."

269
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:34,375
I'm like, "Yes,
television shows."

270
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,208
Everybody likes to sneak
in commercials with shows.

271
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,125
You're watching the show,
you're watching the match.

272
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,458
You're not watching the
piece of shit commercial.

273
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,125
In a world where I'm
trying to move all my clients

274
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,458
away from that, when
they come to me and say,

275
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,834
"Hey Gary, great
news, we're going digital."

276
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,750
I get scared because I'm even
more scared of banner ads

277
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,041
and pop-up ads than I am
of television commercials.

278
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,667
So when people go
digital I get scared

279
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:03,333
'cause I think they're
going digital 2002 to 2005.

280
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,875
In 2002, when I was
buying the word wine,

281
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,375
and buying the word champagne,
and buying the word bordeaux

282
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,542
for five cents a
click, that was good.

283
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:15,458
And now, some of those words
are properly priced at $4.12,

284
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,041
for Wine Library,
champagne is good.

285
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,458
At $11, the word wine, 
it is not good.

286
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:25,125
Every single day, if 
I came here, seven months ago

287
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,500
I would have told
you that I was concerned

288
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,708
about Instagram globally,
especially in the U.S. market.

289
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,041
Because Snapchat
was getting older,

290
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,291
Facebook's younger
than people think,

291
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,458
and I was questioning
where would Instagram play.

292
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,166
Instagram, as a lot of you know,
copied every single feature

293
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:44,959
that Snapchat had, grew,
exploded, and now Instagram,

294
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,542
seven months later is
my number one platform

295
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,834
that I'm paying
attention to and marketing on.

296
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:52,041
This is day trading attention.

297
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,083
This is not
making a commitment to,

298
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,542
in 2017, it's all about Snapchat

299
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,291
and then just sticking to
it, no matter what happens.

300
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,875
No, no, no, this
is, on February 19th,

301
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,208
this is the best trade.

302
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,917
On March 16th,
this is the best trade.

303
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:09,375
My friends, here's the
part that really scares me,

304
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,625
which is, as the world continues
to change very quickly,

305
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,208
the truth and the
rules always stay the same.

306
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:20,417
For example, for all
the math that we now have,

307
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,834
the creative is the
variable of success.

308
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:27,166
The video, the
picture, the words,

309
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:31,333
the sounds, the creative
is the variable of success.

310
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,166
When people hear me talk.

311
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,125
It's interesting
'cause I talk about creative

312
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:35,917
in a lot of interesting ways.

313
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:39,083
Number one, I think
creative is 100% subjective.

314
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,542
I understand why if
you're the creative director

315
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,166
of an organization
you don't want that

316
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,291
necessarily to be
true, you've worked hard

317
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,041
for 20 years to
build a reputation

318
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,458
so that you can walk in and say,

319
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,542
that's not funny enough,
 that's not green enough,

320
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,625
that wasn't
snarky enough, I get it.

321
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,041
The problem is the
market doesn't give a fuck

322
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,959
about you Han.

323
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,166
(audience laughter)

324
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,667
So creative is
subjective until it comes out

325
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,375
to the market and
then the market decides

326
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,125
if it was funny,
snarky or green enough.

327
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,000
But creative is the variable.

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,875
At Vayner we are very
much obsessed with attention

329
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,417
and the platform
and the context.

330
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,750
How do you
story tell on Facebook

331
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,166
different than
Pinterest different

332
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,834
than a pre-roll on
Google different than

333
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,667
an original piece of
content different than

334
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,959
a native ad on
Buzzfeed different, different,

335
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:26,667
different, different.

336
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,750
It's context along with content.

337
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,917
However, there
is no misconception

338
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:34,208
that the creative itself
is the variable of success.

339
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,875
And so the thing
that excites me though

340
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,083
is that we live in a world.

341
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,667
So for Vayner
right now we're obsessed

342
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,959
with one thing, obsessed.

343
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,750
You give me a brief,
you want to do something.

344
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,166
You want to sell this,
right, you want to sell this.

345
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,208
The first two
things I think about

346
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,750
is number one,
how do I make one to,

347
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,959
depending on your budget,
one to seven 

348
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:59,792
different videos that are
a minute and 19 seconds long

349
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:02,208
that are gonna hit the emotional
center of the individual?

350
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,417
But not one, not
one 30 second spot

351
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,542
because I promise you
if you're 44 years old

352
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:10,750
and make $400,000 a
year and you're a male

353
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,667
this brand means
something different to you

354
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,000
than if you're 18
years old and a female

355
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,667
and making $27,000 a year.

356
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,959
And how in the world
would I talk to both of you

357
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,000
the same way to
make you buy this?

358
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,458
That's insanity.

359
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,000
It wasn't insanity when we lived

360
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
in a television first world,
it was your only option,

361
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,083
life's about options.

362
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,542
I'm not mad at
people that made TV spots

363
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,000
and billboards and
direct mail in 1984,

364
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,041
that was the game, I'm
mad at everybody in this room

365
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:43,041
that are acting like
it's 1984 when it's 2017.

366
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,333
That's the problem.

367
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,208
So I have to make seven videos.

368
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,333
And they don't have to be
15 and 30s and 60 seconds,

369
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,208
we did that because
that's how television sold them.

370
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,166
The fuck are you
making 30 second videos

371
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,000
for Facebook for?

372
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,542
It makes no sense.

373
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,708
And I don't mean,
well everybody says

374
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,000
we've got to make them short
because they read a headline

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,083
that attention spans
are short on Facebook.

376
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,041
Meanwhile as a practitioner
DRock and I are putting

377
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,792
out 25 minute
videos on Facebook everyday

378
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,500
and I'm watching everybody
watch the whole fuckin' thing.

379
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,708
Content is content.

380
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,875
If it's good, it works.

381
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,875
If it's bad, it's bad.

382
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,375
You could make a six second Vine

383
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,458
that people won't watch three
seconds 'cause is sucks shit.

384
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,583
And you can make
a four hour movie

385
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,250
and if it's the
best four hour movie ever

386
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,291
everybody will sit nice and
calm in a theater like this

387
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,375
and watch every second.

388
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,959
And so these are the
things that I think about.

389
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,041
The other thing, and
this is a huge opportunity

390
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,083
in this market 'cause this is
one thing I did do last night

391
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,500
'cause I had to stay up 'til
four o'clock in the morning

392
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,458
to do something on
the west coast in the U.S.

393
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,000
And this is something I
dug into a little bit here.

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,917
I implore you, you
too, I implore you guys

395
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:50,708
to start looking at influencer
marketing very serious.

396
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,625
Influencer marketing
is grossly underpriced

397
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,500
more so than anything I've seen

398
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,125
except for
Facebook three years ago

399
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,208
and Google 10 years ago.

400
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,625
Individuals, humans
that have followings.

401
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,165
Especially in the way, you
know I asked you a question

402
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,749
about Instagram,
I looked at it last night,

403
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,375
it's emerging much
quicker and quieter here

404
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,165
than I think people realize.

405
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:15,332
Instagram influencers
that can bring value

406
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,625
to your brand and
story at extremely low costs

407
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,208
including just
giving them the product,

408
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,708
they're just
happy to get it for free

409
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,791
and they'll give you media
in return that's incredible.

410
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,708
The two places if
you're trying to sell something

411
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,792
that are grossly
under priced in this market

412
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:34,750
are Facebook ads in video
form and influencer marketing.

413
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,166
Is it at the scale of
the U.S., absolutely not,

414
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,208
is that really
interesting to me?

415
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,333
Of course, 'cause the
price is much lower here too.

416
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,083
And when you look at
the gross over investment

417
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,792
on direct mail
in this environment,

418
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:50,625
that arbitrage is
extremely attractive.

419
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,667
What I don't
understand is why in a world

420
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,500
where people are
spending hundreds of thousands

421
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
of Euros in a
direct mail campaign

422
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,208
why that can't be 75,000
and they take 25,000

423
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,834
to at least become educated
if what I'm talking about

424
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,625
is real or bullshit.

425
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,125
Like to me, I don't
care if I'm right or wrong,

426
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:15,291
I'm just blown away that
you're willing to not find out.

427
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,500
We just sit with our
thoughts and theories

428
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,917
of what's tried-and-true.

429
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,875
Let me tell you something,
what got you here today

430
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,750
is not gonna get
you to the next place.

431
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,375
And we sit in theory
and we sit in romance

432
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,250
and we sit in how,
you know how many people

433
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,291
in this room make
business decisions

434
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,417
on how they wish
the world was working?

435
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,125
They're sad
that when they go out

436
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,750
to a restaurant or cafe
they see people sitting there

437
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,166
and both looking at the phone,
they're upset about that.

438
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,750
They've made a
romantic decision on how

439
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,000
the world should be.

440
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,792
I see that and I'm
happy because I realize

441
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:51,667
those people
want to be doing that.

442
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm thrilled that
this woman in the third row

443
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,166
is looking at her
phone, I'm happy for you.

444
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,875
Because that's what she
wants to be doing right now.

445
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,708
I'm not upset
'cause I'm talking,

446
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,208
I don't give a
fuck about my feelings,

447
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,834
that's what she wants to do.

448
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,917
That right there
is the punchline.

449
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:10,125
The market is always
right, not your fuckin' ego.

450
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,291
And I've got nothin' but ego.

451
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,959
But when it comes to the market

452
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,417
I only have humility.

453
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,708
The market is always right.

454
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,083
And we sit in
ivory towers thinking

455
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,500
we're super fuckin'
smart and we disrespect

456
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,375
the market every day
and that's why we lose.

457
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,375
In last years fiscal year 

458
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,667
96% of the Fortune 500

459
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,917
companies in the
world lost market share.

460
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,000
They lost
market share because 

461
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,166
they're marketing 
like it's 2005,

462
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,125
they're marketing
like it's 1997,

463
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,500
they're marketing
like it's 1984, 

464
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,417
that's why they
lost market share.

465
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,208
And I know this because
there's only one other time

466
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,625
that we have seen
this big of businesses

467
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,375
lose this much
global market share,

468
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,166
it was the
late '40s and early '50s

469
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,458
when the world transitioned
from radio to television.

470
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:03,083
My friends, we are transitioning
from television to this.

471
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,542
It's already happened.

472
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,875
I've been here for a long time.

473
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,166
I implore you to join me.

474
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,250
Thank you.

475
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,917
(audience applause)

476
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:16,125
Can we put the
lights on for Q&A?

477
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,792
- Yeah that'd be great.

478
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,583
Yeah, now that's good.

479
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,708
I should have done that earlier.

480
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,250
I was just focusing
on these 18 people.

481
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,375
Sorry back there.

482
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,125
Yeah, so, I'd
love to do Q&A.

483
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,458
I mean that's the
philosophy, and honestly,

484
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,375
I know a lot of
people here may follow,

485
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,041
I went very marketing
heavy because I try

486
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,583
to kind of gauge the room, but

487
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,375
if people want to
talk about startup world,

488
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,125
you know something that a
lot of you who don't know me

489
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,166
may not know.

490
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,375
Back in 2007-8, I invested
in Facebook and Twitter

491
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,625
and Tumblr, and have
had a very good career,

492
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,250
Uber, things of that
nature, and that world.

493
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,750
If you want to talk
about building a business,

494
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,291
I've run two
businesses in my life.

495
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,250
Both of them I grew from,

496
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,333
one from zero to a
$100 million in seven years,

497
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,667
one from three to
$60 million in seven years.

498
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,000
So I think I know what it takes.

499
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,792
One from three to 150 employees,

500
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:08,000
one from zero to 800 employees.

501
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,125
So if you want to
talk about management

502
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:13,834
or building organizations,
HR, we can go there.

503
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,792
(audience laughter)

504
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,125
You like that one?

505
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,417
Good, awesome.

506
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:19,875
So, wherever you want to go.

507
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,708
Who's got questions?

508
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,208
Great, let's get you a mic.

509
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,834
Thanks for
breaking the ice, my friend.

510
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:27,417
What's your name?

511
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,458
Make sure you give me your name.

512
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,458
- [Hans] My name is Hans.

513
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,750
- Hans (laughs)

514
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,000
(audience laughter)

515
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,458
- [Hans] I really
loved your talk

516
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,708
with Adriana Huffington.

517
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,375
- Yes.

518
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,375
- [Hans] About value of sleep.

519
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,041
- Yes.

520
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:47,083
- [Hans] Because that's
an item that's not a lot

521
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,792
getting noticed in your posts.

522
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:50,625
- For me.

523
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,875
- [Hans] Yeah.
- Correct, I agree.

524
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,667
That's why I had her on,
because I wanted to clear it up,

525
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,583
once and for all.

526
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,625
- [Hans] Exactly.

527
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,667
- You want me to expand on it?

528
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,625
- [Hans] I'm a big fan of

529
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,083
silence for me,

530
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,458
as a way to
recharge my batteries.

531
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,667
And center and focus on
what I want to do, and why.

532
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:06,708
- Yes.

533
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,166
- [Hans] Now, I
would like to hear,

534
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,750
what's your take on
the value of silence,

535
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,583
and is there

536
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,417
- Silence?

537
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,083
- [Hans] Silence,
is there a place for it

538
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,542
in your 24/7/365 life?

539
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:18,375
- No.

540
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,291
(audience laughter)

541
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,125
But that's good.

542
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,500
This is important for everybody.

543
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,583
It's amazing
that you're self-aware

544
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,417
and you know your hard wiring,

545
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:28,000
that silence is
important to you.

546
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,291
The thing that I fear
as I grow in popularity,

547
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,917
is that people
try to emulate me.

548
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,375
And the reason I
continue to put out,

549
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,542
now, I want to talk
about what I think is

550
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:37,667
the way I do it so
people can use me as a blueprint

551
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,041
for themselves.

552
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,333
But the reason every

553
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,083
two weeks, three weeks,
four weeks, I'll say something

554
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,792
that throws them off,

555
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,041
is I want to remind them

556
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,208
that I'm just one human being
and this is what works for me.

557
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,375
I'm the reverse.

558
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,333
Something that, you know,

559
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,750
I'm sure DRock's
laughing right now.

560
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,083
There's times when
we walk into the office

561
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,875
and it's quiet because
everybody's on headphones

562
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,000
and trying to be respectful,

563
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,291
and it freaks me out.

564
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,542
I need volume.

565
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:05,208
Like I need the
light to see your faces.

566
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,917
I need the stimulation.

567
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:09,166
I suffocate in silence.

568
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,083
Of course when I'm
exhausted, these guys

569
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,542
picked me up last night, we
flew from New York to Ireland.

570
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:17,125
One-hour nap, all day Ireland,
flight, they picked me up.

571
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,417
I had to get mentally ready.

572
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:19,959
I wanted to catch up
with him but I was kinda like,

573
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,959
I needed a little bit of
silence, sometimes I need it.

574
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:27,125
But 99% of the time,
when I'm awake,

575
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,250
I need action.

576
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,375
You know?

577
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,625
And so,

578
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,000
but you have to understand,

579
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,875
and I think we're
going to connect on this.

580
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,625
I'm only
comfortable and at peace

581
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,708
in the chaos.

582
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,000
When I get silence,

583
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,500
I get sad, I get anxious.

584
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,750
It's not interesting to me,
so I think the key here is

585
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,166
to just know yourself,
and not try to map to,

586
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,333
oh this person.

587
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,250
One of the biggest reasons
I go after Steve Jobs's legacy

588
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,583
is because I want to build the
biggest company in the world,

589
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,125
and I want to do it by
being nice to my people.

590
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,542
But all the kids
in Silicon Valley

591
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,041
after Steve Jobs got so big,
everybody heard how tough

592
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,250
he was on people,
so they were faking it.

593
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,208
I had good people, good
friends, who I knew very well,

594
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,208
start being assholes at work

595
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,291
'cause they thought
that's how you had to do it

596
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,375
to be successful.

597
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,875
Fuck that.

598
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,708
I think you get much more
out of honey than vinegar.

599
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,917
Much more from people.

600
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:22,875
So,

601
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,500
you know, I'm
comfortable doing it my way.

602
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,000
I have no interest in
imposing my way on you.

603
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,708
I think it's important
for you to see how I do it.

604
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,792
The reason we
started DailyVee, the vlog,

605
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:35,250
is, when I was talking about
hustling and working hard,

606
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,041
people interpreted
that differently.

607
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,583
Now that they see it,
 they're like, fuck.

608
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,375
You know, am I really,
is that really me?

609
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,834
Do I want it that bad?

610
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:46,250
Like to achieve greatness, 
wow, it takes real work.

611
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,875
You know everybody,
everybody's fascinated by luck,

612
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,250
or the big idea.

613
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,041
It doesn't exist.

614
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,291
You don't know a single
person that's made it big

615
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,875
unless they
worked their face off.

616
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:59,083
You might know somebody
who inherited a lot of money

617
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,458
from mommy and daddy.

618
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,000
They may be rich,

619
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,917
but they didn't build it.

620
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,792
Anybody you've ever
met that built something

621
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,291
worked their fucking face off.

622
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,041
You got it.

623
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:16,291
(audience applause)

624
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,458
Questions.

625
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,166
Let's go with this lovely lady.

626
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,375
We'll get you back there next.

627
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,250
Hi.

628
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,500
- Hi Gary.

629
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,417
I'm Noriko.

630
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm Japanese,
living here in Belgium,

631
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,917
I've been translating your
videos--

632
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,166
- I'm very aware,
it's good to see you.

633
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,792
Thank you for your help.

634
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,917
- It's really my
pleasure thanks to your team.

635
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:36,750
- Hold on one second,

636
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,583
is there any way she can hold it

637
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,458
so she can get it closer?

638
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,583
Is that alright with you?

639
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:40,417
Thank you. Thank you.

640
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:41,834
- So, thank you--
- Little closer.

641
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,333
- Okay? Alright.

642
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,542
Thanks to your team,

643
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,417
getting here, so
you just talked about

644
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,083
honey and vinegar.

645
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,250
But I really can see,
you're not just talking,

646
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,000
but you have wonderful people

647
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,834
- [Gary] Thank you.

648
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:54,834
- I really want to say

649
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:55,625
to everyone.
- [Gary] Thank you.

650
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:58,166
- So my question is
about negative comments.

651
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,166
- [Gary] Negative comments.

652
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,000
- Any platforms you get,
- [Gary] Yes.

653
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,375
- And you talk about
this also on the videos

654
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,625
and I totally understand
because I have thick skin,

655
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,708
and I really, like in your
terms, I don't give a fuck.

656
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,708
I really don't care.

657
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:15,000
But, I help small
business people, and when it

658
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,708
comes to my clients,
that's a different story

659
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,250
because they get
stuck, they got hurt,

660
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,458
so they can't put
enough content because

661
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,458
they don't want to get it--

662
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,542
- Most people are
not putting out work

663
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:28,750
because they're scared
of other people's feedback.

664
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,500
And the second they get
negative feedback they collapse,

665
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,959
and they go in a cacoon.

666
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,959
- So is there a
way somehow that I can

667
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,875
convince them to move on--

668
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,708
- Yes, and no, let me explain.

669
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,625
This is a self-esteem game.

670
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,750
So, there's no
drug for self-esteem.

671
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,041
People in here who were
unfortunate and had parents,

672
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,375
or were hard-wired in a way
that lacked self-esteem,

673
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,750
you're not going to be
able to fix that overnight.

674
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,500
You can't just be a cheerleader,

675
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,000
and for two minutes
they'll be like, "yeah"

676
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,417
and then you walk away
and they're like, "no".

677
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:01,792
So,

678
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,125
there's a couple things:

679
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,792
first and foremost,
negative comments.

680
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,083
I really don't
give a fuck either,

681
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:11,291
however, I take every
one of them seriously.

682
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,041
I think the
biggest thing that is

683
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,875
missing in the world today,

684
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:18,458
politically, globally, business

685
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,166
is empathy.

686
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,834
We lack empathy,

687
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,375
in today's society, at a
level that is very intriguing.

688
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,959
I'm trying to go
backwards and figure out

689
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,417
why over the last
30 years, 40 years

690
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,875
have we lost so much empathy.

691
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:33,083
Or, do we just not have it?

692
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,208
Is that just a skill that humans

693
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,750
have always underperformed in?

694
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,375
Which is, by the way, something
that I'm starting to realize

695
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,000
looks like it's
gonna be the case.

696
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,083
But we lack
empathy, so the biggest,

697
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,166
when I get
negative comments,

698
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,458
the reason I
like looking at them is

699
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,333
I respect, back to making
that joke of that lovely lady,

700
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,458
they're the market.

701
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,041
They think I'm full of shit!

702
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:54,583
They think I'm too egotistical,
they think I'm wrong.

703
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,750
I want to
understand why, and I want to

704
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,834
respect that
they're coming with it.

705
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,458
Most negative comments,
especially 'cause I have

706
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,083
a lot of young dude fans,

707
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,291
come at very harsh terminology,

708
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,417
I don't respect the
vulgar, or the language.

709
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:13,500
But I do respect the energy.

710
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,917
I've done, is
I've done it upfront.

711
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:19,041
So before you
even start with them,

712
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:22,291
I'm very aggressive of
like, this is going to happen.

713
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,125
And really getting there.

714
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,250
And spending a lot of
time in the beginning,

715
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,875
so that instead when it happens,

716
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,583
and they look at
you and go, "woah!",

717
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,583
you've already had that talk.

718
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,250
And I mean,
really have the talk.

719
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,041
It's probably with
small businesses what I spend

720
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:40,291
70% of my energy on,

721
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,041
in getting them
mentally prepared

722
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:45,917
for somebody saying,
"Your ice cream sucks."

723
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,458
But they're
used to it in America

724
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,792
in some ways because of Yelp,

725
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,792
and they've been
dealing with that.

726
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:54,000
But yeah I mean,

727
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,375
what makes me so
sad, at the macro,

728
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,291
is those couple
of negative comments

729
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:04,708
compared to all the
upside of producing content

730
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,166
and being on the offense,
and being aggressive.

731
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,291
The weight is,

732
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,417
right?

733
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,125
Yet, unfortunately, so
many people are crippled

734
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,000
by even one negative comment.

735
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,250
Because of their
own internal wiring.

736
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,166
It's a challenge.

737
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:21,125
What I would say is
you need to be patient,

738
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,500
and you need to
be understanding.

739
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,834
Because, you can't just
instill self-esteem overnight.

740
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,667
You got it. You're welcome.

741
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,208
Questions.

742
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,041
- [Bart] Hello.
- Hey.

743
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,542
- I'm Bart, I practiced
my question so many times

744
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,041
that I lost my voice.

745
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:42,125
(audience laughter)

746
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,834
- That's amazing.

747
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:47,917
- [Bart] First of all, I would
like to thank you because

748
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:50,333
I started my career
as an entrepreneur by

749
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,417
trying to build
the next Facebook.

750
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:56,083
But thanks to your
speeches on self-awareness,

751
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,750
I came to realize that I
lose sleep over borrowing

752
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,625
a hundred euros from my
brother so I probably will

753
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,708
never build the next Facebook.

754
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,667
Having that in mind.

755
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:09,417
So, a year ago,

756
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:14,041
I started to build a data
migration company, organically.

757
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,834
So, I landed a
big customer, and now

758
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:20,000
I get paid every day,
and I'm developing my stuff.

759
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,834
And we went live in
production in Chile,

760
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,208
in December.

761
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,917
This year for the
same company we will do

762
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:31,083
USA, Mexico and Canada.

763
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,417
So it's growing really great.

764
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,834
But my question to you was,

765
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,792
you talk a lot about patience,

766
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,542
but you also talk
sometimes about speed.

767
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:41,708
And patience
for me that would be

768
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,417
continue with the same--

769
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,166
- Can I answer you
real fast and you'll

770
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,333
understand it forever?

771
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,291
- [Bart] Okay.

772
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,166
- Macro, patience. Micro, speed.

773
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,667
- [Bart] Yeah. Okay.

774
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,583
- And let me expand on it,
'cause that didn't work.

775
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:55,458
Fuck.

776
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:59,083
No no, hold on, hold
on, hold on, back back back.

777
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,667
Macro-patience.
You're a young man.

778
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,750
Building something
meaningful, a relationship,

779
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,250
a business, it
takes 10, 20, 30 years.

780
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,375
On your day-to-day work,
you have to be fast.

781
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,583
With the clients, they email
you, you email them back.

782
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,959
Like, your day-to-day.

783
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,333
But your vision?

784
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,917
What you want
to achieve in life?

785
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,166
You're not going to
build it in one year.

786
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,083
And so many
people have it reversed.

787
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,750
In the day-to-day, they're slow,

788
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,583
and in the macro, they
want their business to be huge

789
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,792
the next day.

790
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,583
So you need to reverse it.

791
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:35,792
- [Bart] So if you have to
make the decision between,

792
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:38,250
in my case,
building a better framework

793
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,834
or focusing on that, or
trying to find more customers,

794
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:44,291
what would you advise?

795
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:47,250
Knowing that I don't need
the money of new customers

796
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,083
right now.

797
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,417
- Both.
- [Bart] Okay.

798
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:52,250
(audience laughter)

799
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,750
- And so here's another,

800
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,458
here's an answer of both:

801
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,000
Number one, how
hard are you working?

802
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,750
I don't know.

803
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,667
If you're
working 12 hours a day,

804
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,500
I feel like you could
work 17 if you want! Right?

805
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,333
Number two, if
you're working every hour,

806
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,166
and you can't work more,

807
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,834
with the money that's coming in,

808
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:13,417
too many young people
and too many young businesses

809
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:15,000
when they start
having money come in,

810
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,708
take it for themselves.

811
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,208
They want to buy a good watch.

812
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,583
They want to buy a good car.

813
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,542
They want to buy fancier shoes.

814
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,708
What I would do is,
when my first money,

815
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,708
so here's my story.

816
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,333
This is not advice
I'm giving just for fun.

817
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,208
This is my life.

818
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,792
I walked in my dad's store,

819
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,166
it did $3 million a year,

820
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,917
10 percent gross profit,
$300,000 dollars in profit

821
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,250
before expenses,

822
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,583
we had no money,
I was making $40,000 a year,

823
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,166
37,4, actually.

824
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,000
And I built that
business from 3 to 45 million,

825
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,917
in the first kind
of four or five years,

826
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,125
and five years later,

827
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,208
five years later this is doing
$45 million dollars in sales,

828
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,792
and I'm making $40,000 dollars.

829
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,500
This is the advice I gave.

830
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,417
And by the way, I was
in my twenties, and a guy.

831
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:00,208
The exact time, if you're
making that kind of money,

832
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,166
that you want to use it
 to do guy things.

833
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,166
Right?

834
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,542
I put it back into the business,

835
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,500
I hired four more managers,
six more managers,

836
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,875
seven more managers,
I did more advertising.

837
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,208
I built a business.

838
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,834
So if this money's coming from
Chile and U.S. and Mexico,

839
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,000
hire people.

840
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,083
Then you can do both.

841
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,417
- [Bart] Okay. Thanks.

842
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:19,959
- You're welcome.

843
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,792
Questions.

844
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:22,792
Great, now they're coming.

845
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,375
Okay, here we go up there.

846
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,041
- [David] Hello,
I'm David, my question

847
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,792
is a bit in line
with the former question,

848
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:32,166
it's about building a business

849
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,708
and growing and having...

850
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,333
being scared about
growing the business.

851
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,166
- Okay.

852
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:40,250
- [David] It
would push me to more

853
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,083
be saving money then investing

854
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,750
in technology in the future.

855
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,500
What would be your advice?

856
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,750
- David, I want to
make sure I understand.

857
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,542
You're saying that you
need to deploy capital.

858
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,458
So, here's my
advice in investing.

859
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,417
How old are you?

860
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:54,625
- [David] I'm 40.

861
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:55,458
- Four zero?

862
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,667
- [David] Four zero, yeah.

863
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:57,583
- You look great!

864
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:01,083
- [David] Tomorrow, 
ha, tomorrow.

865
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,000
- My answer in building a,

866
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,375
everyone's like turning back.

867
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,208
How good does he look?

868
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,834
(audience laughter)

869
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:07,333
By the way, best part,
this is the truth,

870
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,583
I can't fucking see him.

871
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:11,583
(audience laughter)

872
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,291
- [David] You can
have a photo with me.

873
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:14,875
- We'll do it later.

874
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,041
David, my answer
always is, always, is

875
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,500
well, here's a question.

876
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,417
Are you
planning on this business

877
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,875
still being your
business five years from today?

878
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:25,583
- [David] Yes.

879
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:27,667
- Okay, then I
would invest every penny

880
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:28,792
you can afford
that doesn't put you

881
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:31,958
personally in bankruptcy
or out of business.

882
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,165
- [David] Okay.

883
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,333
- Does that answer the question?

884
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,166
- [David] Yes.

885
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,375
- Great.
- [David] Thank you.

886
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,750
- If you were
looking to sell the business

887
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,041
in the next two or three years,

888
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,041
then there's a debate.

889
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,125
But if you put in the money now,

890
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,041
and you're gonna be in business

891
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,333
in five years and
assuming that you're right,

892
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,708
you're gonna have a
much better business,

893
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:50,500
and that's why
it's the right bet.

894
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,208
VaynerMedia, VaynerMedia, again,

895
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,542
I always like
when I can give you

896
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,500
examples of what I'm doing.

897
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,000
'Cause, it's not
just me, oh I made it,

898
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,792
let me give advice.

899
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,708
The last two years I've
run VaynerMedia as a CEO.

900
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:02,959
Two years ago the business did

901
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:06,625
$67 million in revenue, 
its an agency.

902
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,875
Last year it did 100 million.

903
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,834
Both years we made
the same amount of money.

904
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:14,458
The bottom line made
the same amount of money.

905
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:17,250
When you make $33 million
more in revenue,

906
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,917
and you make the
same amount of money

907
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,625
that you did the
year before, you're doing

908
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:22,250
two things, the two
things I believe in.

909
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,333
One, I'm investing in
the business for real.

910
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,000
Number two,
I took a lot of risks.

911
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,875
Many of which will
work, many of which won't,

912
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,375
but it felt like the right year

913
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,917
to take those risks,
'cause I was tasting

914
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:37,208
that the business was
gonna go from 67 to 100.

915
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:41,375
So, I knew that I had the
economics to make those bets.

916
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,166
So, you know,
I think one of the things

917
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,041
that makes me comfortable
and one of the reasons

918
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,667
I want to remind
people in this room,

919
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:51,083
especially in the
advent of the new digital world

920
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,667
where every 20 year old
thinks they're an expert,

921
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:57,834
I spent 13 years
bulding a business.

922
00:35:57,834 --> 00:36:00,708
365 days a years,
15 hours a day,

923
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:04,041
before I ever made a blog post,
before I ever wrote a book,

924
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,000
before I ever gave a speech.

925
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I take a lot of
pride in the fact

926
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,875
that I only give advice
that I actually do myself.

927
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:14,125
It's your job to interpret where

928
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,792
you and I are different,
because everything

929
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:19,291
I do won't
necessarily work for you,

930
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:23,375
but the advice is me
eating what I'm serving.

931
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,417
Cool, let's keep it going.

932
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,542
Let's get this guy right here.

933
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,000
You guys, like,
they told you not to

934
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,333
ask questions, got you.

935
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,166
- [Man] What's up Gary?

936
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,041
- Hey man.

937
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,250
- [Man] I hope you
that I vlogged this.

938
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,208
- I see it. You were saying.

939
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,750
- [Man] So, my question is,
thank you from us,

940
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,458
thank you for
everything you're doing, man.

941
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:50,542
You changed my life
and my question is that...

942
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,291
Do you know Patrick Bet-David?

943
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,125
- Do I know what?

944
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:56,125
- Patrick Bet-David. He's
also making videos on YouTube.

945
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:56,959
- [Gary] I'm not
sure, no I'm sorry.

946
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,500
- One of his videos, he said,

947
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,375
"I don't use business cards
anymore, I only use Linkedin.

948
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,583
"When someone is coming to me,

949
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,667
"I just give them the Linkedin."

950
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,500
- [Gary] Okay.
- [Man] Is that good or not?

951
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,625
Because for now, I'm
starting my business next week

952
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,166
and I'm deciding on if I
want to use business cards

953
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,542
or just, if people ask
for my contact details,

954
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,291
just give them the Linkedin.

955
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:19,125
- I don't use business cards,
and haven't for a long time,

956
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,041
and not because
I think I'm fancy

957
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,750
and easy to find on
the internet or Linkedin.

958
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,583
It's 'cause I take
their phone and I email them.

959
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,250
The amount of
times I do business cards

960
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,792
and nothing happens,
because we throw them out,

961
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,458
we lose them, we don't care.

962
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:37,000
So, if I want to do
business with somebody,

963
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,125
I actually take
their physical phone

964
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,083
and have them email me
or I email them on the spot

965
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:45,166
or I text them on the spot.

966
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:49,375
Again, making 30 second videos

967
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:50,959
for a Facebook world,

968
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:54,959
because that's how television
was formatted is stupid.

969
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,875
You have a business card 'cause

970
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,542
you want to do
business with that person.

971
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:01,917
To give a business
card, you're physically

972
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:04,041
in front of that person.

973
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:07,083
I don't know if you
know, but it's 2017.

974
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,542
This is called a cell phone.

975
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:12,500
It is much smarter to
create no vulnerability

976
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,333
by making that
transaction happening there.

977
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,166
The end.

978
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,667
- [Man] Thank you so much.

979
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:22,166
(audience applause)

980
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,542
- And let me tell you,
I'm so glad you asked that,

981
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:27,500
because in a macro I'm
gonna use that analogy.

982
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,125
I hope DRock caught it
'cause I see him moving around.

983
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,667
That was a very
important moment.

984
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:37,834
My friends, we
lack common sense.

985
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,792
We go through
school and we get educated

986
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,667
and it takes over
the part of our brain

987
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,166
that is left for common sense.

988
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,917
What I just said is funny.

989
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:49,458
Some of you snicker, its funny.

990
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,583
It makes so much sense.

991
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,458
We forget why we're doing things

992
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:58,083
and so we get into the
tactics, not the strategy.

993
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,959
You have business
cards to do fucking business.

994
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:03,583
All of you have probably
missed minimum 50 percent

995
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,542
of your business card exchanges.

996
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,917
We have this now, use it,

997
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:11,375
and that's the same
thing for everything.

998
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,291
What was the
purpose of the video?

999
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:14,750
Not to make a commercial.

1000
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,917
To sell somebody on the emotion

1001
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:19,083
of the video so they buy it.

1002
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,834
So, if you have
to make that story

1003
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:23,583
in 48 seconds,
make it in 48 seconds.

1004
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:26,583
Not 'cause 30 was
the way we did it.

1005
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,667
Facebook's direct mail,
you have they're address.

1006
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,000
You actually
know how old they are,

1007
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,083
what they care about,
how many kids they have,

1008
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,208
when they got married.

1009
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,375
You know way more
than the mailbox knows.

1010
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,750
What are you doing with your
direct mail when you get home?

1011
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,333
Let me save you time.

1012
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,041
- It's real.

1013
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:51,125
And by the way, again, history.

1014
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,333
History will always
tell you the future.

1015
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,458
Go get educated on what happened

1016
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,917
in marketing and business

1017
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:59,250
in the late '40s 
to the early '50s

1018
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,875
in the U.S. and Western Europe.

1019
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,625
You will see it.

1020
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,166
There was a major transition

1021
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:06,125
because people held on
to the romance of radio

1022
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,625
and disrespected the
emergence of television.

1023
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:10,500
Now we're doing
that with the television

1024
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,291
instead of the cell
phone and the networks

1025
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:14,625
that dominate the cell phone.

1026
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:18,291
Television, Facebook
is the number one channel

1027
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,542
on this television.

1028
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,583
You need to become
the number one show

1029
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,333
on that channel.

1030
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,000
There are a lot more shows

1031
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,792
and that comes down to content.

1032
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:29,625
Cool.

1033
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,083
Questions?

1034
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:33,667
- [Henrick] Hello

1035
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,500
- Oh how are you?

1036
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,542
- [Henrick] My name is Henrick.

1037
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:36,375
- Henrick, thank you.

1038
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,250
- [Henrick] Thank you,
thank you Gary.

1039
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,083
- You're welcome.

1040
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,291
- [Henrick] I have a question.

1041
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:40,917
Peter and Steven told us

1042
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:42,625
about The Day After Tomorrow

1043
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,375
and Tomorrow,
artificial intelligence

1044
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,125
and things like that.

1045
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:47,083
- A.I.?

1046
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,166
- [Henrick] And A.I.
- Love it.

1047
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:50,542
- [Henrick] And it's something
big companies can buy

1048
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:51,375
the advise ad--

1049
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,625
- Do you guys have Alexa Voice?

1050
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,333
Do you guys have Alexa here yet?

1051
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,166
- [Crowd] No.

1052
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,000
- [Henrick] No, not yet.

1053
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,959
- You're gonna shit.

1054
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:58,083
(audience laughing)

1055
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,083
It's great.

1056
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,417
(audience laughing)

1057
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:01,500
(chuckles)

1058
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,333
It's gonna happen
in the U.S. soon to.

1059
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,875
Go head.
- [Henrick] So that's a question

1060
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,041
you talking about
empathy and things like that.

1061
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:06,875
- Yes.

1062
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,000
- [Henrick] Sometimes
when we send an email,

1063
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,834
send a message on
Facebook to companies,

1064
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:13,834
I think the
bots are in sleeping.

1065
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:16,291
And so we don't
get information back.

1066
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:17,333
- Yes.

1067
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,375
- [Henrick] So they are talking

1068
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,959
a lot of it, about it.

1069
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:20,875
What's your point of view

1070
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,959
on artificial intelligence--

1071
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,041
- It's gonna be, it's gonna be

1072
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,500
- [Henrick] And then 
the human thing about it?

1073
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,708
- I think A.I. is
gonna be enormous.

1074
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:31,667
It makes a lot of sense.

1075
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:35,792
Humans, our brains
are the best computers

1076
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,625
in the world, for now.

1077
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:42,417
And so we do too many
things that we don't need

1078
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,792
to be doing.

1079
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,250
And for the last
forever of human race,

1080
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,375
we chip away at the
things we don't need to do.

1081
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,959
We got animals to do things
that we didn't have to do.

1082
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:53,458
Like we got
other people to do it.

1083
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,500
We got machines.

1084
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,875
We are very smart.

1085
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:56,875
A.I. works

1086
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:59,917
because fourteen
hundred people a month

1087
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,041
ask me which one

1088
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,291
of my four books
they should read.

1089
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:06,583
I don't need to do
that by hand a hundred times

1090
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,959
out of luck and
serendipity and timing.

1091
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,917
I should answer

1092
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,625
that fourteen
hundred times a month

1093
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:14,166
through my decision
and then the A.I. bot

1094
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,041
will take care of it.

1095
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:17,208
There are a
million things like that.

1096
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,625
Right?
Let me go through it.

1097
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:19,583
When you email
Wine Library, and go

1098
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,041
"Where the fucks my wine?"

1099
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,959
I have a human
that goes and looks at

1100
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,667
where it is on
FedEx, and UPS and DHL.

1101
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:28,125
That doesn't need to happen.

1102
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:28,959
And we've seen that.

1103
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:30,166
Automated emails.

1104
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:34,000
A.I. will be
enormous but all the magic

1105
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,375
looks like this.

1106
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,208
If the point is to go

1107
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,500
from here

1108
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,083
to here,

1109
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,333
if that's the point.

1110
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,625
Where is my wine?

1111
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:45,792
How do I do this?

1112
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:46,708
What book?

1113
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:47,500
What service?

1114
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,875
If that's the point,
A.I. at its height

1115
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:53,834
and it's prime
will look like this.

1116
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:57,750
A.I., A.I.,
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.,

1117
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,583
and for the
really good shit, human.

1118
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:04,000
We just need to
get to 95% of it,

1119
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,583
get the human in
the best position

1120
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,417
to create the context
because our brain's better

1121
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:09,458
than the A.I. brain, for now

1122
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,959
and on the most important stuff.

1123
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:12,375
There's plenty of
things that can be

1124
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,375
A.I., A.I.,
A.I., I, I, I, to this.

1125
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,834
The companies and the
humans that understand

1126
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:19,291
which ones need to be
A.I., A.I., A.I., I, I, I,

1127
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,375
(slapping)
A.I.

1128
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,667
Versus A.I., A.I.,
A.I., human, will win.

1129
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,291
- [Henrick] So I'm
in the real estate aged.

1130
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,291
I'm a traditional
real estate agent.

1131
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:27,750
- Yep.

1132
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,125
- [Henrick] So there is a future
for the real estate agent?

1133
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:34,291
- Humans will be fine
until the robots kill us.

1134
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:37,875
(audience laughter)

1135
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:40,208
And what that
means is, I'm not joking.

1136
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,333
By the way there
are gonna be two paths

1137
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,959
when this is all said and done.

1138
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:47,166
Immortality or
robots took over completely.

1139
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,542
We'll probably not see it

1140
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,208
but it's very basic
chess, if you actually

1141
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:52,417
understand what's
happening in society.

1142
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:53,250
I prefer not to see it

1143
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,583
'cause for somebody
that's not scared of anything,

1144
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,333
even that's pretty intense.

1145
00:43:57,333 --> 00:44:00,291
I'll be really pissed
if I just miss immortality

1146
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:02,667
by this much,
which is concerning me

1147
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:04,041
'cause I really don't wanna die.

1148
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,625
But, yes.

1149
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:06,917
I remember seven
years ago when I would talk

1150
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:09,166
about what was happening,
everybody got scared

1151
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,875
that journalists would die.

1152
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:12,667
Right? Because there
was a lot of pressure

1153
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:13,500
against journalism.

1154
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,708
And I said, "no, no,
you don't understand,

1155
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,208
"it's gonna be better
than ever for journalists

1156
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:19,375
"'cause there's gonna
be more things to do".

1157
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,708
There's been plenty
of things that have gone

1158
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,458
after real estate
agents, you've heard it.

1159
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,333
Technology always
says it's gonna take

1160
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,041
everything over.

1161
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,625
It's not,
because the human brain

1162
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,041
is still winning.

1163
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,291
But if things like IBM Watson

1164
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,792
and all the future
stuff that's gonna happen

1165
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,708
and when A.I. and
V.R. and you know,

1166
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:36,000
we're just starting.

1167
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,959
There is a lot more to go.

1168
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:40,917
So yeah, I don't
think, I never bet against

1169
00:44:40,917 --> 00:44:43,041
innovation and technology.

1170
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:47,667
That being said, you'll
see your career through.

1171
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:49,208
- [Henrick] We have
the same idea, thank you.

1172
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,041
- You're welcome.

1173
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,333
- [Henrick] Good confirmation.
- Good.

1174
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,041
-Awesome, who do we got?

1175
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,708
Yep.
Awesome.

1176
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:57,500
- [Man 2] Hello Gary.
- How are you?

1177
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,708
- [Man 2] Fine, thanks.
- Good.

1178
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,917
- [Man 2] You told us that
it's very important

1179
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,250
to sell anything by heart.

1180
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,291
It's your passion
that's easy, of course, and...

1181
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:07,250
- Selling something
that you believe in.

1182
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,166
- [Man 2] Yeah.

1183
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:10,375
- I couldn't be more
passionate about something.

1184
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,375
- [Man 2] Okay.

1185
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,875
Now we have a startup, two guys,

1186
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,041
and we are in a short period.

1187
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:18,291
We must hire, we
must hire somebody.

1188
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:20,208
And of course,
we want to be sure

1189
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,667
that we hire
some guy, some woman

1190
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:23,917
with the same passion.

1191
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:25,333
How can we be sure?

1192
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:29,166
- By being more
focusing on firing than hiring.

1193
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:31,291
- [Man 2] Okay.
- Let me explain.

1194
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:35,375
I think I have the greatest
intuition, EQ, I've ever seen.

1195
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,291
It's my biggest
ego, it's all I've got.

1196
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,583
I know I'm not that smart.

1197
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:40,041
It's all been intuitive,

1198
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,959
and it's been very good to me.

1199
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:45,333
And I've hired
a ton of assholes.

1200
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,834
And I really pride myself,
 I think I'm really good at it.

1201
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:50,792
I married my wife in
five seconds, all my investments

1202
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:53,458
have been amazing on
intuition, friendships, like

1203
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,625
I'm good at it.

1204
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,875
And I still have missed.

1205
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,917
And so what I've
learned in 20 years is

1206
00:45:58,917 --> 00:46:00,917
it's not about the hiring,
because too many people here

1207
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:03,083
are fancy and think
they're so good at hiring,

1208
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:04,667
and it takes them four months,

1209
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,417
and they make a hire
and still half of the time

1210
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:08,625
it doesn't work out
and it's just not smart.

1211
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:10,792
What's smart is
go with your gut,

1212
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:11,917
don't cripple yourself.

1213
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:14,250
Now, easy in the U.S.,
I know that in Europe,

1214
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,166
there's different kinds
of laws and there's more

1215
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,500
finances, I don't know how,

1216
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,625
I don't know what your
current state is of like,

1217
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,166
fuck, like if you
have to fire somebody

1218
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:23,166
they get seventeen
years of fucking severance.

1219
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:24,750
(audience laughter)
But, you know,

1220
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,166
you gotta work your economics,

1221
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:27,875
but what I would
say is regardless

1222
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:30,834
of how painful
it is on the firing,

1223
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:33,500
it is always
firing versus hiring.

1224
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,792
You know, you gotta taste it.

1225
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,875
- [Man 2] 'Kay.
- That's very important.

1226
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,208
That is where the businesses
that have grown the best

1227
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,166
have won.

1228
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:44,166
- [Man 2] Don't be
afraid to fire the guy.

1229
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:45,583
- Don't be afraid to fire?

1230
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:46,375
- [Man 2] Yeah.

1231
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:48,000
- Yeah, no don't
be afraid to fire.

1232
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,834
- [Man 2] Yeah.

1233
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:50,959
(audience laughter)
- And by the way,

1234
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:52,875
there's nothing I hate more.

1235
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:56,834
I wish, I wish my
HR and CFO were here.

1236
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:59,083
I drag firing

1237
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,333
so long.

1238
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,875
I hate confrontation.

1239
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,500
I'm a good guy.

1240
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,542
I hate it.

1241
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:06,667
It's taken me 20 years
to get better at it,

1242
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:08,250
and I'm still not great at it.

1243
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,000
I still fire people
three months, six months,

1244
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,083
after I decide.

1245
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:13,291
Six months.

1246
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,959
Because I hate it, I feel bad.

1247
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:17,083
It's the worst part
of running a business.

1248
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,625
But it is essential.

1249
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,125
Because as you
grow your company,

1250
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,542
and you get to
seven and nine, and 14,

1251
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:25,000
it's an important skill to have
because here's the problem,

1252
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,917
when you don't fire losing
players, winning players leave.

1253
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,417
It's a big deal.

1254
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:33,250
- [Man 2] Okay.
- It's a big deal.

1255
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,875
- [Man 2] Thank you.
- You got it.

1256
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,917
(audience applause)

1257
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:41,542
Let's make sure we get
to this guy eventually.

1258
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:43,625
Oh we can go now, awesome.

1259
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,625
That was good execution.

1260
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:49,917
- [Bren] Hey Gary.
- How are you?

1261
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:52,166
- My name is Bren,
and I fucking love your energy.

1262
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:52,875
(Gary laughs)

1263
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,083
Seriously, you're
such an inspiration.

1264
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,542
Keep on, keep going,
keep working, keep hustling.

1265
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,208
- I will.

1266
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,708
- [Bren] And I'll 
always be watching.

1267
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:00,542
- Thank you.

1268
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:02,458
- [Bren] So the question is,

1269
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:07,083
I founded a 3D animation
and virtual reality company

1270
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,291
together with my co-founder.

1271
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:09,959
We're doing
actually pretty good.

1272
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:12,083
Every time we get in front
of people, they get excited

1273
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:14,458
on our energy and we
get a human connection.

1274
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,041
- [Gary] Yes.

1275
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,917
- Now to get
bigger assignments to get

1276
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:18,959
to be able to hire developers,

1277
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:19,834
- [Gary] Yes.

1278
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,834
- People don't let
us in, like the bigger

1279
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:24,041
advertising agencies,
they don't see that you have

1280
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:24,959
a hundred people.

1281
00:48:24,959 --> 00:48:26,208
They're like, yeah, fuck it.

1282
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:26,917
- [Gary] Yeah.

1283
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,875
- And in the same sense, we
have a lot of creative energy.

1284
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:31,208
- [Gary] Yes.
- And we want to put that out.

1285
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,000
In the same sense,
let's say DRock

1286
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,583
wants to make
his own feature film,

1287
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:35,750
- [Gary] Yes.
- He needs a crew.

1288
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,542
He needs a crew. He needs
somebody who holds the audio.

1289
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,208
He needs somebody
who has the sound.

1290
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,125
- [Gary] Yes.

1291
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,083
- What is your advice
on creating more revenue

1292
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:45,750
without just
asking money from people?

1293
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,583
- [Gary] Yea.

1294
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,875
- How do you get more sales
when DRock can only produce

1295
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:49,792
so many videos a day?

1296
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:51,625
- DRock worked for free.

1297
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,583
- [Bren] Yeah, did that.

1298
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,708
- [Gary] Well,
 that's your answer.

1299
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:58,291
Your energy, 
that is a human connection.

1300
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,542
If your biggest
vulnerability is you need money

1301
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,083
to get more people,

1302
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,708
get a bunch of
people to work for free.

1303
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:04,583
- [Bren] I don't 
want to do that.

1304
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:05,041
- Why?

1305
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:06,333
- [Bren] I don't want to
take advantage of people.

1306
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,000
- [Gary]  You're not.

1307
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,834
- [Bren] I worked in the game
industry and people were working

1308
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:10,834
at a thousand euros a
day for eighteen hours.

1309
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:12,417
- [Gary] You're confused.

1310
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:14,208
If you're so great,

1311
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:16,500
you are not
taking advantage of them.

1312
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,625
I can promise you,

1313
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:20,959
I did not take
advantage of DRock.

1314
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,792
(audience laughter)

1315
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,291
- Can you leave the stage?

1316
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:27,166
- We sure can.

1317
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:29,083
And the answer is, you
know what's better about that?

1318
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,458
That's a really
good way to put it.

1319
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,917
What's really most interesting,

1320
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,500
is the emails he
gets and why he doesn't

1321
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,041
take those opportunities.

1322
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:36,875
Right?

1323
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:39,083
You know what's
great about the game?

1324
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,834
It's not the words,
it's not him saying that

1325
00:49:40,834 --> 00:49:44,500
with me here or not me
here, it's the actions.

1326
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,083
It's the actions.

1327
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,875
If you think you're so good,

1328
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,708
you wouldn't be
taking advantage of them.

1329
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:51,208
And,

1330
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,375
if you don't want to
take advantage of them

1331
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,542
because you've made the
romantic point of view that

1332
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:56,417
that's not a good strategy,

1333
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:58,834
well then go make some money.

1334
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:01,708
- [Bren] Well,

1335
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,792
(audience laughter)
I get it, I fucking get it.

1336
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,208
So, the making
money part, it's okay.

1337
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:06,834
But,--

1338
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:09,583
- [Gary] You can't sell people
that aren't willing to buy.

1339
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,417
- Say again?

1340
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:12,917
- [Gary] You can't sell somebody
who's not willing to buy.

1341
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:14,208
If they're
looking at you and saying,

1342
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:16,291
"You don't have a hundred
people and you're too young,"

1343
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,333
they're the market,
they're not wrong.

1344
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,500
- Yeah.
- [Gary] You're wrong. 

1345
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,959
- Yeah, I get that.
- [Gary] Okay.

1346
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:23,250
- So, what you're saying is,--

1347
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,667
- [Gary] What I'm saying is,

1348
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:26,125
you need to realize

1349
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,917
that this is all practicality,

1350
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:30,375
and not philosophical.

1351
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,500
- I'm asking also as well
for practical information so,--

1352
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,333
- [Gary] I just gave it to you.

1353
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,166
- Yeah.

1354
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:35,250
- [Gary] Practically,
you have two options.

1355
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,834
- Yeah.
- [Gary] Go make money,

1356
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,250
and pay fucking DRock,

1357
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,083
- Yeah.
- [Gary] Or,

1358
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,750
go figure out that there's
thousands of fucking people

1359
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,041
that just want to do the work
'cause they're creative.

1360
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,667
And it's better to do it for
a leader that they believe in

1361
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:50,291
than fucking sitting on
their ass in their basement.

1362
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,375
- Thank you.

1363
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,417
Seriously.

1364
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:55,417
(audience applause)

1365
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,250
- [Gary] There is no third move.

1366
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,792
You know that's like,
that's the best part, right?

1367
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,667
Like what's the third move?

1368
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:04,750
There just isn't.

1369
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,291
- [Bren] Those people
at the same time

1370
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,375
are working at 
that moment for free.

1371
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:08,208
- Yep.

1372
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,083
- [Bren] But if their resources
(mumbles) that they can't

1373
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:12,917
pay their student loan.

1374
00:51:12,917 --> 00:51:15,542
- Then they won't come to you.

1375
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:17,834
Don't say no for the other guy.

1376
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:22,750
- [Bren] Thank you.
- [Gary] You're welcome.

1377
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,250
Hi.
- [Woman] Hello.

1378
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,083
- [Gary] How are you?

1379
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,166
- [Woman] Very good, thank you.

1380
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,792
We have something in
common, so I'm very happy today.

1381
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:30,500
- [Gary] We're both very
good looking?

1382
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,625
- [Woman] Okay, thank you!
(audience laughter)

1383
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,375
Maybe we can talk later then!

1384
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,917
Okay.
(Gary laughs)

1385
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:38,583
No, we have
something in common.

1386
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,625
I can't sit still,
I'm never quiet,

1387
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:41,875
so that's a bit difficult

1388
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,750
for colleagues of mine,
(Gary laughs)

1389
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,542
but you just said,
"More firing than hiring."

1390
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:47,500
- [Gary] Yes.

1391
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,208
- [Woman] But you
can't just fire somebody

1392
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:52,208
like that, but what do
you do with your people

1393
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:55,041
to keep them motivated, keep
them going, keep them happy?

1394
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,041
- You got it.
- How do you do it?

1395
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:56,959
- [Gary] Great question.

1396
00:51:56,959 --> 00:52:00,542
The thing we do that has
worked unbelievably well is

1397
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:03,333
I massively
over-invest in realizing

1398
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,250
that managing
people is the same way

1399
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,250
that I think about marketing.

1400
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:11,041
You can't have one 30 second
video that works for everybody.

1401
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:14,083
I have no idea what
those three care about.

1402
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:15,875
Somebody might care about money.

1403
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:17,959
Somebody might care
about work-life balance.

1404
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:20,208
Somebody might
care about notoriety.

1405
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:22,917
Some might care about
football as their passion,

1406
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:24,458
and I get them
tickets to the World Cup.

1407
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:28,834
I don't care what my
800 employees want in life,

1408
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:31,500
I just want to know what it is.

1409
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,708
- [Woman] When you
started, in the beginning,

1410
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:37,291
were you surrounded
by young people or...?

1411
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,250
- Both.

1412
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,875
When I started the wine
business, I was surrounded

1413
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:43,542
by older people, and I was
22, and that was challenging

1414
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:45,125
'cause I had to break through.

1415
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:48,125
When I started Vayner,
I started it with young people,

1416
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:50,792
but it doesn't
matter how old or young.

1417
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,417
I hate when people are like,
"Millennials love work life."

1418
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:56,000
I know tons of
millennials that just want cash.

1419
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,834
You know, like,
everybody's different.

1420
00:52:57,834 --> 00:52:59,333
When I started out it was easy.

1421
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,959
There was only six people
to know every single thing

1422
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:03,291
that they cared
about in the world.

1423
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,333
Now it's hard.

1424
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,000
Now I've built a
lot of infrastructure.

1425
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,250
Now I run a lot of big
data to see what their posting

1426
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,125
in social media to know what
they care about in their lives.

1427
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:15,125
I'm obsessed with
knowing what my 800 people want,

1428
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,875
because then I can
reverse engineer it,

1429
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,875
because I work for them.

1430
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,792
Leadership is understanding
that people don't work for you.

1431
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:26,333
Leadership is understanding
that you work for them,

1432
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:29,000
and the best way to build a
great company is retention,

1433
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,500
keeping people forever.

1434
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,041
My mission, my obsession,
is that everybody that walks

1435
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,542
through VaynerMedia
works for me

1436
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:36,500
for the rest of their lives.

1437
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,333
To be able to do that,
I need to know what they care

1438
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:41,583
about at 24, what
they care about at 29,

1439
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,625
what they care about at 35.

1440
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:43,834
Oh wait, they fell in love.

1441
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:47,542
Oh wait, their
husband wants to move to L.A.

1442
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:50,708
I have to be flexible, nimble,
I have to pay attention,

1443
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,542
I have to be obsessed.

1444
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,000
- [Woman] I'm starting today.

1445
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,333
I'm going to be obsessed.
- Love it.

1446
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,291
- [Woman] Okay.

1447
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:58,166
- How many people?

1448
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,166
Hold on to it, this is fun.

1449
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:01,041
How many people do you have?

1450
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:03,125
- [Woman] My boss has a lot
of people working for him.

1451
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:04,208
- Yep.
(audience laughter)

1452
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,333
- Around 150--
- So you and your boss

1453
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:08,375
and for him, I'm telling
you this is an amazing way

1454
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,125
to build a great company.

1455
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,291
You have to take
15 and 20 minutes,

1456
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,458
you have to take a dinner.

1457
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,291
If somebody's very
important, it's dinner

1458
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:16,834
once a quarter, twice a year.

1459
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:18,083
If it's somebody new--
- [Woman] Alright!

1460
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:19,708
- What's that?
(audience laughter)

1461
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:20,542
Got it!

1462
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:21,917
- [Woman] You can
come with us! (laughs)

1463
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:22,875
- But you know what I mean?

1464
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:23,834
That's the key.

1465
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:25,291
I mean some of you
that watch my vlog,

1466
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,625
you see five minute meetings
with every single person

1467
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,625
that comes in.

1468
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,417
It's five minutes, you
can't accomplish that much,

1469
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:33,959
but let me tell you why I do it.

1470
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:34,917
Some people try to razz me,

1471
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,291
they think I'm
doing it for show.

1472
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,625
I'm not doing it for show.

1473
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,041
By sitting with
you for five minutes,

1474
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:40,375
knowing your name, 
knowing your phone,

1475
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:42,375
I remember a lot of stuff too.

1476
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,041
Knowing if you have a brother
or sister, or you like sports.

1477
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:47,834
When I go into
the elevator with you

1478
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:50,208
in three months
and we go up together

1479
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,708
and we can have a 3 minute
conversation, I'm chipping away.

1480
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:54,125
They're scared to talk to me.

1481
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,583
I'm the CEO, and
not only am I the CEO,

1482
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:59,583
I'm also internet
famous and a CEO.

1483
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,959
So it's really hard for
them to get comfortable,

1484
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:04,125
and I need them to
feel safe to tell me

1485
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:06,708
when something's wrong.

1486
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,959
That's the key because the cost

1487
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:13,166
of somebody leaving
is so great, so great.

1488
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:16,875
Much more expensive
than the 15 to 19 hours

1489
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:19,625
that you deploy to stay close,

1490
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:22,500
and remembering that you
need to give them more value

1491
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,583
than they're giving to you.

1492
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:27,375
I hate when
leaders, founders, bosses,

1493
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:30,083
expect people to
work as hard as they do.

1494
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,917
If you want them to
work as hard as you do,

1495
00:55:31,917 --> 00:55:34,291
give them the same economics.

1496
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,125
My friend's always like,
"Gary, I can't get my people

1497
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,625
"to work as hard as me."

1498
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:41,458
I'm like, "How much do
they own of the company?"

1499
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:42,291
"Nothing."

1500
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:44,375
I'm like, "That's
a starting point."

1501
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,333
(audience laughter)

1502
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,792
I don't expect
anybody to work as hard as me.

1503
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,583
They need to
care about themselves.

1504
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:53,041
They need to execute
for what they're doing.

1505
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:56,583
And then, people are motivated
by very different things.

1506
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:57,542
It's been so interesting to me,

1507
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:59,500
I'm using soccer,
slash your football,

1508
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,667
because it's such a
passion in this country.

1509
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,917
There's a kid that works
for me, who flat-out told me

1510
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:05,208
that he was considering to leave

1511
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:06,375
because he got offered double--

1512
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:07,708
You know,
Vayner's in tough spot.

1513
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,041
We're so hot,
and we're so young,

1514
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:12,083
and there's such big
advertisers in the world

1515
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,458
that are trying
to steal our people.

1516
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:16,000
He's like, "Somebody
offered me double my salary.

1517
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,500
"But three weeks earlier,

1518
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,458
"because you knew I was
a St. Louis baseball fan,

1519
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:21,834
"you came to me and
I was doing a good job,

1520
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:22,750
"and you gave me two tickets."

1521
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,708
Randomly.

1522
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:27,625
Not his anniversary,
not his birthday, randomly.

1523
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,000
He's like, "That made me stay."

1524
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,208
And now he's one of
the most important people

1525
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:32,458
in our paid media team.

1526
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:34,708
Those tickets cost me $937.

1527
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,667
- [Woman] Okay, 
thank you. (laughs)

1528
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,250
(audience laughter)
- [Gary] What's that?

1529
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,500
- [Woman] He gave us Gary.

1530
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,166
- There you go.

1531
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:48,250
It's amazing, but for
other people, I try to do it,

1532
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,583
and they're like take your
fucking trip to Florida back.

1533
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,417
Give me $3000, asshole.

1534
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:54,667
You know, like, you
have to know the person.

1535
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:57,083
Everybody has
their own North Star.

1536
00:56:57,083 --> 00:57:01,375
- [Woman] Okay.
- Thank you.

1537
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:02,291
Two more?

1538
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:05,208
You know, I love this.

1539
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:06,667
- [William] Hi Gary.
- Hey.

1540
00:57:06,667 --> 00:57:07,500
- [William] My name is William,

1541
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,708
I've been working for
a year now at a startup.

1542
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,166
We've gone from three to
fifteen employees...

1543
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,125
- Five-zero or one-five?

1544
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,125
- [William] Sorry?

1545
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:16,083
- Fifteen, one five?
- [William] Fifteen,

1546
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:19,458
not fifty, let's
hope we get there.

1547
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:20,458
Influencers...
- Yes.

1548
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:22,083
- [William] And I
feel like I've heard this,

1549
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:24,542
like five years ago, but then
they were called evangelists.

1550
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:25,041
- Okay.

1551
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,083
- [William] Where do
you see the difference,

1552
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:28,041
and how to go
about really practical,

1553
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:31,208
how to go about in getting
those on board in the company?

1554
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:32,417
- I think we're
talking about the same thing,

1555
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:34,500
the difference is five
years ago, they had blogs

1556
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,083
and they didn't reach anywhere
close to as many people.

1557
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,959
I would go into Instagram,
and Facebook fan pages,

1558
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:43,041
and I would
message them, by hand.

1559
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:45,583
- [William] Alright. Do
you have a Facebook account?

1560
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,708
- I do, slash Gary.

1561
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:53,500
But remember,
when you approach slash Gary,

1562
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,000
figure out what Gary cares
about, not what you care about.

1563
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
- [William] Alright, 
the market's always right. 

1564
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,875
Thank you.
- You got it. 

1565
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:01,542
Yeah, the
market is always right, man.

1566
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:03,333
I'm really glad you
ended with that, bro,

1567
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:05,417
because if you
actually internalize that, 

1568
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:07,667
so much changes.

1569
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:11,333
Too much ego in the world,
people think they are so smart,

1570
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,917
they latch onto
things like, they latch onto

1571
00:58:13,917 --> 00:58:15,208
the guy who created the Porsche,

1572
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:17,166
or the guy that
created the automobile,

1573
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:20,750
legendary, all time billionaire
visionaries, and they go

1574
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,458
"Yeah okay, but if Henry Ford
listened to his customers,

1575
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:26,542
"he would have
made a faster horse."

1576
00:58:26,542 --> 00:58:30,375
Cool, go be
Henry Ford, you know?

1577
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,208
Back to my young man over here,

1578
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:35,625
like, there's four
Facebooks, Facebook, Snapchat,

1579
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,750
like, everybody's
going and reverse engineering

1580
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,625
all time, all time stuff.

1581
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:44,750
We lack practicality.
There's only two options.

1582
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,875
That's business,
not this bullshit

1583
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,792
that venture capital, give me,

1584
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:52,000
I mean 98%
of startups in America

1585
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,834
are losing money every month.

1586
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:56,291
Like, what do you
think happens when

1587
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,834
the economy gets tighter?

1588
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,542
There's no next funding round.

1589
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,125
Some of the people in
this room have seen it

1590
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:02,125
a couple of times.

1591
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,625
(makes rising
and crashing noises)

1592
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,458
Because people aren't
smart. They don't realize

1593
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,542
when they're up here,
is exactly when they need

1594
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:11,917
to get practical
and change everything,

1595
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:13,166
and make sure
they're not burning money

1596
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,166
but making money,
so when it goes this,

1597
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:16,667
then they pick up everything.

1598
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:19,667
I built two businesses,
both during crashes,

1599
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:22,458
I came into Wine Library when
the stock market crashed,

1600
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,417
and 9/11 happened
and all my customers lived

1601
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:27,417
in New York and New Jersey.
Built a huge business.

1602
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:30,125
I started VaynerMedia
in the financial crisis

1603
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:33,000
of 2008 and 2009 in America.

1604
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,375
I'm a wartime general.
That's a true entrepreneur.

1605
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:39,625
Not when idiots
are giving you funding.

1606
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:45,959
How much talent does it take
to lose money every month?

1607
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,542
I think we can all do it.

1608
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:52,000
- [Sophie] Hi Gary, I'm Sophie.

1609
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,917
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1610
00:59:53,917 --> 00:59:54,875
- [Sophie] I was just wondering,

1611
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:57,834
how do you think the future
of ads agencies looks like?

1612
00:59:57,834 --> 01:00:00,000
Because here in
Belgium, we still have

1613
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,375
a lot of traditional agencies.

1614
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:02,208
- Yeah.

1615
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,166
- [Sophie] Who
are now trying to get

1616
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,667
a digital part inside of them.

1617
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:05,542
- Yeah.

1618
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:07,834
- [Sophie] And we also
have the younger agencies,

1619
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:10,041
who are really
digital, digital natives.

1620
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:10,750
- Yes.

1621
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,708
- [Sophie] And who are
really performance based.

1622
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:13,250
- Yes.

1623
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,834
- [Sophie] But I feel that
in those agency, the really,

1624
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:21,041
the smart marketing,
essence that we used--

1625
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,667
- Like strategy and
creative lax, right?

1626
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:24,250
The same
happened with my company.

1627
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:25,875
- [Sophie] The
first ones, they have the,

1628
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:28,667
the real, the great creative
directors and everything,

1629
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:31,750
and the smaller ones,
the young ones, they don't,

1630
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,041
but there is this mismatch.
- [Gary] Correct.

1631
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:36,041
- [Sophie] And as a client,
we now need both of them.

1632
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:36,792
- [Gary] Yes.

1633
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:38,834
- [Sophie] So how is, how
is this now in the States?

1634
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:40,875
- The big ones are
gonna get disrupted,

1635
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,500
they're going to lay off people,

1636
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,583
the €230,000 creative director

1637
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:48,250
is gonna go work for
the upstart that survived,

1638
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,917
and make €130,
then that one will have it,

1639
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:53,750
then they'll get big, and then
Martin Sorrell will buy 'em.

1640
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,333
- [Sophie] Okey-doke.
Alright, thank you.

1641
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,542
- So what your
job is as a client,

1642
01:00:57,542 --> 01:01:00,166
is to day trade
attention, right?

1643
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:02,792
Like, VaynerMedia was a steal,

1644
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,875
for so many years,
still creatively.

1645
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,333
Every single one of
my creative directors

1646
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:10,667
are from Crispin Porter,
Wieden & Kennedy, Droga, right?

1647
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,708
But were less priced than that,

1648
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:16,875
yet clients buy into the
bullshit like a Cannes Lion,

1649
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,792
or what Ad Age said,
so they're stupid.

1650
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:22,041
And so, that's good,
if they're stupid,

1651
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:22,959
they deserve to lose,
and if they're smart,

1652
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:25,708
they deserve to win,
but that's what will happen,

1653
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:27,583
because it's
always happened, right?

1654
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,542
So the key is, when
can you find the upstart,

1655
01:01:30,542 --> 01:01:33,333
when it has enough
scale and has the nuances

1656
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,625
of what you feel they're
missing, because you're right,

1657
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,417
when you have two, you know,
they don't work together.

1658
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:38,625
- [Sophie] No they don't.
- Never.

1659
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:41,458
That's not, you know, some
things are great in theory.

1660
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,375
It's great on paper, let's get

1661
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:45,000
an above the line
traditional agency,

1662
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,375
a digital agency,
a social agency,

1663
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,625
and they'll all work together.
Great on paper.

1664
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,166
You know what else is
great on paper? Communism.

1665
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,625
(audience laughter)

1666
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,375
It's great. Like if you read it,
it seems really good,

1667
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:59,333
it just doesn't
match to the human spirit.

1668
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,458
You can't ask two
companies who both want

1669
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,208
to build their
business to play nice,

1670
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:04,583
when they're both
undermining each other

1671
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:06,667
to get more business.

1672
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:08,000
And that's why my
companies really worked

1673
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,041
in the sandbox, because
I've taught all my people

1674
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:13,417
to just assume that's
what everybody's doing.

1675
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:15,375
We're not mad when the
agencies do that to us,

1676
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:17,250
that's what
they're supposed to do.

1677
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,000
What I tell them
to do, my people,

1678
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,125
even the most senior, is to
eat shit, be the bigger person.

1679
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:26,458
I'll take care of it up here,
and it's worked very well

1680
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,875
cause the client can feel who
is trying to make it work,

1681
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,750
and who's not.

1682
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,708
- [Sophie] Alright, thank you.
- Cool, yep.

1683
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,208
- A couple more
and then we'll go.

1684
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:36,041
- [Yama] Hello.
- Hello.

1685
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,792
- I'm Yama, I
just would like to know

1686
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:40,041
what you would
consider personally

1687
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:43,458
your biggest business mistake
you made in your career.

1688
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:44,375
- That's a great question.

1689
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:47,333
I said this the other
day with DRock, I'm like,

1690
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:50,500
"I hate this question,
because I have no respect,

1691
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,333
"or time, or
energy for my failures,

1692
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,250
"and so I don't
think about them as much."

1693
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,625
I think, I mean
there's a lot, look,

1694
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,834
my first book was
called "Crush It!",

1695
01:03:00,834 --> 01:03:02,542
and in the acknowledgements,
if you go get it

1696
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:05,041
in the library right now,
I thank my entire family

1697
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:07,333
and one random person:

1698
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:10,959
Travis, the founder
and CEO of Uber.

1699
01:03:10,959 --> 01:03:13,750
Travis came to me, and
wanted me to invest in Uber,

1700
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,792
and I passed, twice.

1701
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:19,041
That $50,000 investment,

1702
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:21,333
because that was the
size of what I was writing,

1703
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:25,125
would now be worth
close to $400 million.

1704
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,542
That's a bad move.

1705
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:28,750
(audience laughter)

1706
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,875
So that's, that's not
as valuable to everybody.

1707
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:35,792
I'll tell you what's
valuable to everybody.

1708
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:40,333
Every time in my
career that my eyes got big,

1709
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:41,750
and I decided,

1710
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,333
so what I do very
well, I referenced

1711
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,417
the 100 and 67 million thing,

1712
01:03:45,417 --> 01:03:48,792
I'm very good at making
80% of my business stable,

1713
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:52,041
tried-and-true,
staying the course,

1714
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:54,083
continuing to do
what I know will work,

1715
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,750
and then taking 20%
of my money and energy

1716
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,708
and being very risky,
and trying to put myself

1717
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:00,667
out of business.

1718
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:02,667
Back to the agency
question, what's the agency

1719
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,750
that's coming next
that could hurt me.

1720
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,625
Is it a VR shop? I'm trying
to put myself out of business.

1721
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,250
I'm very good at that,
and that's why I build

1722
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,959
very big businesses. I'm not
as profitable every year,

1723
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:14,667
but I get really big, got it?

1724
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:17,959
When I've taken
that out of my control,

1725
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:21,792
and have given
money and some energy

1726
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:25,667
to other companies and put
a founder and CEO in charge,

1727
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:28,083
like I did after
I left Wine Library

1728
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:30,917
and started VaynerMedia for a
social network called Cork'd,

1729
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:32,875
which was a wine social network,

1730
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:35,750
for a company called
Forrest, which was a designer

1731
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,875
and developer social network,
where I was the "co-founder",

1732
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,708
but I really wasn't
running the company,

1733
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:43,291
it was mainly,
I was giving money,

1734
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:46,792
we leveraged my name, I would
check in once in a while,

1735
01:04:46,792 --> 01:04:49,375
I've done very poorly.

1736
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:54,208
- So, what I've
learned is, when I'm operating

1737
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,917
and building scale around me,
it's a very good strategy,

1738
01:04:56,917 --> 01:05:00,208
financially worthwhile,
when I've gotten big eyes

1739
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:02,417
and I wanna do
everything and support other

1740
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:05,834
entrepreneurs, in a
world where I try my best

1741
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:07,792
to vet them, but they
may be good or they may not

1742
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:11,667
be good, those have
been some of the places

1743
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:13,417
where I've made a mistake.

1744
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:15,166
And I think, I'll
be honest with you,

1745
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:19,333
I think my greatest
mistake is still ahead of me.

1746
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,166
Because of the way I play.

1747
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:26,000
Where I will have a
great mistake is that I hedged

1748
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,792
so much, I invest so much,
I'm building so much

1749
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:33,917
for the future,
that I may not achieve

1750
01:05:33,917 --> 01:05:37,458
my great ambitions
because I left too many dollars

1751
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,375
along the way in
a thirty year macro

1752
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:44,208
and at 70 or 75 or 80, when
I realize shit, I don't have

1753
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:47,333
a lot more time, it
could get me into a place

1754
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:51,166
where I become
cynical and bitter

1755
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:52,417
because I left so much,

1756
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:53,959
I did so much
for everybody else.

1757
01:05:53,959 --> 01:05:57,250
The 51-49 that I give to
everybody else hurt me

1758
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,041
in the end and so I could
become this weird character

1759
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:03,625
that goes and lives
in a cave out of anger

1760
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,625
in my old years and
young entrepreneurs are gonna

1761
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:08,250
try and find me
and shit like that so,

1762
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,708
that's how I think
my story could end.

1763
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:11,583
And I mean that.

1764
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,792
I think my greatest
failure is at the end.

1765
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:17,834
My intuition is I'll
convince myself that the journey

1766
01:06:17,834 --> 01:06:20,708
and the legacy trumped
whatever materialistic thing

1767
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:24,750
I wanted, I kind of
already know that too, yeah.

1768
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:28,291
Okay, one more and then we
should get on schedule right,

1769
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,250
cause I'm fucking it up, yeah.

1770
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,917
- [Sebastian] Hi Gary.
- Hello.

1771
01:06:31,917 --> 01:06:33,583
- [Sebastian] It's Sebastian.
- Hey Sebastian.

1772
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:35,792
- [Sebastian] Yeah you've
touched on

1773
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:38,041
influencer marketing
briefly already.

1774
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:38,875
- Yes.

1775
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:41,166
- [Sebastian] And I've dabbled
in it a little bit so far.

1776
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:42,208
- Okay.

1777
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:45,250
- [Sebastian] But the problem
is that a lot of the clients

1778
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,875
they actually well
treat it as product placement

1779
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:49,917
or endorsements.

1780
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:50,750
- Okay.

1781
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,625
- [Sebastian] Do you think it
works in that respect, or not?

1782
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:56,000
- Well I think that's what
it looks like historically,

1783
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,959
do you mean that
they're forcing the influencer

1784
01:06:57,959 --> 01:06:59,458
to do something
very specifically.

1785
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:00,333
- [Sebastian] This is
my product.

1786
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:01,166
- Yeah, not smart.

1787
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:02,333
- [Sebastian] Put it in
your hands and put it on.

1788
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,625
- Yeah, I think the only way
to do influencer marketing

1789
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:06,291
is to give the product
to the person and tell them

1790
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:07,959
to do whatever the
fuck they want with it.

1791
01:07:07,959 --> 01:07:10,583
The problem is the
brands wanna control the message

1792
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,834
and they may say that's off
brand, they don't understand

1793
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:15,500
that's very much on brand
because the interpretation

1794
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,750
of that product to that
audience where that person

1795
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,375
intuitively understands
that audience

1796
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:21,458
is exactly what you want.

1797
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,583
- [Sebastian] How
would you suggest I,--

1798
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,417
- By,

1799
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,250
- [Sebastian] Try to
convey that to the clients?

1800
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:30,208
- By not taking their money
unless they do it your way.

1801
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:32,083
- [Sebastian] Thanks
that makes sense.

1802
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,417
- It's, it makes sense,
it's the right answer

1803
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:37,542
it's also very difficult to do.

1804
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:39,792
You know one of the
great things about being good

1805
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:43,458
at what you do is it
allows you to say no.

1806
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,375
So I have given you advice
that's right but it might not

1807
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,792
be practical
because that might be

1808
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:49,125
the only way you make money

1809
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,792
but you need to
fight for it harder

1810
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:52,083
than you're fighting for it.

1811
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:54,333
You have to be
willing to lose the client,

1812
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,750
you'll be surprised,
four out of every ten times,

1813
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,834
the client will be
even more excited because

1814
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:01,750
the client-agency
thing is hilarious.

1815
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:05,625
The client's want more strategy,

1816
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:08,250
but when the agencies
bring the right strategy

1817
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,667
they try to make
it the wrong strategy.

1818
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,959
Like people hire us all
the time and then I'll sit

1819
01:08:12,959 --> 01:08:15,083
in the first meeting
and I'm like, you guys hired

1820
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:18,625
VaynerMedia, not J.W.T.,
what the fuck are you trying

1821
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,500
to make us do that?

1822
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,125
You could have just go
fucking hire Poolassist

1823
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:24,041
you fucker.

1824
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,166
- [Sebastian] Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1825
01:08:28,707 --> 01:08:31,457
Thank you, thank you.

1826
01:08:31,457 --> 01:08:35,040
(audience applause)

1827
01:08:35,041 --> 00:00:00,000
(light music)
