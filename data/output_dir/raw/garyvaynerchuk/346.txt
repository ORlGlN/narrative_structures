1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,946
(audience cheering)

2
00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:02,166
- [Gary] Thank you.

3
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,133
Thank you so much.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,467
Thank you guys.

5
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:13,300
- [Woman] We love you!
- I love you back.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,433
(audience laughter)

7
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:15,900
How many people
here have seen one of my

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,667
full keynotes on
YouTube, raise your hand.

9
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,700
Right, so as you can imagine,

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,166
I'm sure there's
people in this room that

11
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,367
don't know who I am, and I'll
give you a little context.

12
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:26,567
I feel like I'm a
CAT scan of business.

13
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:29,400
It's really interesting
to me, much like many of you

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,233
can do certain
things very quickly like,

15
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:34,734
I would equate it to
if you're a great cook,

16
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,367
you can open a refrigerator,
look at it, scan it,

17
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:39,734
find things and then
cook and create a meal.

18
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:42,767
I couldn't do that on
my best day, you know.

19
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:45,867
But I can absolutely hear a
question about a business,

20
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:48,333
reverse engineer it
and start figuring out

21
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,967
how to make it more
profitable or more successful.

22
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,800
That's what's been
in me my whole life,

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,500
and that's why I really
do want to get into Q&amp;A.

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,900
Regardless of what
you're trying to sell,

25
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,367
or if you're trying to
raise money for a non-profit

26
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,266
or help a family
that's house burnt down

27
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:06,667
or whatever you aspire to do

28
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,433
from my biggest clients

29
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,033
like Toyota and
Chase and Budweiser,

30
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:13,734
to somebody who yesterday
decided they're gonna try

31
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:16,000
an entrepreneurial
venture and they want people

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,533
following them for
their fitness advice,

33
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:21,533
the one thing we all
trade on here is attention.

34
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,767
It's why this has
become the big mantra for me.

35
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:27,033
I day trade attention
and build businesses.

36
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:30,834
The reason I put day
trade is I've come to realize

37
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,934
how unbelievably fast the world

38
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,600
I care about is in actuality.

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
Let me explain in
a very finite detail.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,166
If I stood here
nine months ago today,

41
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:47,100
I would go on a rant
about Snapchat and Facebook

42
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,266
and tell you
somewhere during that rant

43
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,500
that I was
concerned about Instagram,

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,033
because I felt that
practitioners didn't realize

45
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,934
how young Facebook
was, and by the way

46
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:58,800
I'll say it again here,
if you're trying to sell

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,700
to 25, 26, 27-year-olds
in the world,

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,367
including Instagram,

49
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,367
there is still no
place like Facebook because

50
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,333
of its ad product, so
that's much younger than people

51
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:13,333
think, and then
Snapchat nine months ago today,

52
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,400
was much older
than people thought.

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,900
I was watching and
seeing the conversions

54
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,900
of 30, 35-year-olds at
scale and growing by the day.

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,800
Every single day,
hundreds of thousands of

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,200
35 to 40-year-olds
getting on the platform.

57
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,934
So nine months ago today,
I would've stood here

58
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,633
and said Instagram's in trouble.

59
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:33,400
It's getting
squeezed from both ends.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,333
I stand here
today to tell you that

61
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,734
there's no
platform more important.

62
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:39,800
So your feelings felt
better that you got more views

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,333
on the stories on Instagram
than you did on Snapchat,

64
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,867
so you jumped off of
Snapchat and thought you only

65
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:47,867
needed one, and what that
meant was the trade on

66
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,467
attention shifted,
and the deal became

67
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,166
even more extreme on Instagram.

68
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:57,834
So the thing that
I'm always scared of

69
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:01,133
is how many people in
the room will read a book

70
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:04,266
or a blog post or
even watch one of my videos

71
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,867
from three months ago,
from six months ago,

72
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:10,433
and then from two years ago,
and four years ago.

73
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:13,300
The thesis,
the clouds as I call them,

74
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,900
always gonna be the same.

75
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,066
The dirt, the details,
I promise you,

76
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,133
the single biggest
reason that I have the luxury

77
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:25,200
of standing up here,
and many of you don't,

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,734
is that I'm a much better
practitioner than you are.

79
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:31,767
People like to talk
in thesis, and to me

80
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,133
that is the punchline.

81
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,100
That is why I love
Q&amp;A 'cause I'll give you

82
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
the actual answer in detail.

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,100
It's about the practitionership.

84
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,934
You know I've never
really gone down this path.

85
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,266
DRock's gonna be excited
'cause I'm gonna go

86
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:46,667
to a different place right now.

87
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:50,233
I keep the GaryVee thing

88
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,900
that the majority of people

89
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,100
are here for, not only because

90
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,333
it makes my ego
feel good, and it does.

91
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,633
(audience laughter)

92
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:01,033
I keep it because
it forces me to be

93
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,867
the best
practitioner in the craft.

94
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:06,633
I continue to build my
brand more than any other

95
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,033
reason, and there's a lot of
vanity that comes with it,

96
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:12,133
there's a lot of financial
aspects that come along with it,

97
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,967
but I want
everybody to know, and again,

98
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,533
my behavior has proven this,

99
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,166
because I did it
before this happened.

100
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,433
The single
biggest reason I continue

101
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,100
to build my personal
brand, is it forces me

102
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,667
every single day, to
use Instagram, Snapchat,

103
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,300
Facebook, Twitter,
YouTube, Tumblr.

104
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,600
It forces me, and
then I become the plumber

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,467
not just the architect.

106
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,500
And there's way too
many architect's in here,

107
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
and there's way too
many plumbers in here,

108
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,233
and there's not enough
of people that are both.

109
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,166
And all the action,
all the upside, all the growth

110
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,533
in building big businesses comes
from being able to do both.

111
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:52,700
Stop reading books,
stop watching documentaries,

112
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,367
stop hiring more services,
coaches, people,

113
00:04:56,367 --> 00:05:01,967
all which are disguises for you
not to actually do the work.

114
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,667
(audience cheers)

115
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,300
I'm curious when
that's gonna happen,

116
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
because that has
been fascinating to me.

117
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,433
I think the thing
that I am most proud of,

118
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,734
and that I spend
a ton of time on,

119
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:17,800
and you guys
have heard it from me,

120
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
and I don't know if
you think I'm doing it

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,467
'cause I think it's funny,

122
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,934
I love when
people stop watching me.

123
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:25,567
I like when people
hit me up and go GaryVee,

124
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:26,967
now I'm not
watching you any more.

125
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,633
And then I go to
their Instagram account

126
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,533
three weeks later,
'cause you guys know I'm weird,

127
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,734
I do that kinda stuff, and then

128
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,533
they're just
watching somebody else.

129
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm like no, no no,
you missed the point.

130
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,033
The point is doing
is the only option.

131
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:43,133
Doing is the only option.

132
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,567
It's the only way to win.

133
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:48,033
Work ethic is the
main thing that everybody

134
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,066
in this room controls.

135
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,600
You're not gonna
control your talent.

136
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,734
You're not gonna
control your charisma.

137
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:57,066
You're not gonna control your
looks, you're really not,

138
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,133
I mean, the fact of
the matter is, you can make

139
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,166
all those things a
little bit better, but you're

140
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,900
gonna only max them out.

141
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,800
It's the work ethic,
A, that makes them all

142
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,767
a little bit better.

143
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,100
It is the most controllable
aspect of your life,

144
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,500
and your career, and
it's the thing that most

145
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,667
people don't wanna do.

146
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,900
As a lot of you know, who've
been following me a long time,

147
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,233
three years ago I decided
to take care of my health,

148
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,400
and I've gotten those benefits.

149
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,233
Like it wasn't easy,
I didn't want to do it,

150
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,900
I didn't do it for 35 years
of my life, I came up with

151
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,633
every excuse of why.

152
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:29,400
I'm busier than I've
ever been, and I do it more

153
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,100
than I've ever done before.

154
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,066
So the excuses are the
excuses, and we all have them

155
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,166
in different parts of our lives.

156
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,734
The fact of the matter is,
building a meaningful business,

157
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:41,467
something that you can
live your life on, no matter

158
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,633
what your means are.

159
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:47,600
Even call it $100,000 of
profit in a year

160
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,967
to allow you to live a really
great life if, you know,

161
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,467
if you don't let
yourself dream of

162
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,300
like trillions of dollars.

163
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,834
Even that is difficult,
'cause if it wasn't,

164
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,567
the math would
play out differently.

165
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:02,834
There's a reason that the
math of, the top one percent

166
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:06,300
of earners in the entire
country, and take in all the

167
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,266
billionaires and, you're
talking about $400,000 a year.

168
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:13,667
That's a lot of money,
yet, nobody even starts

169
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,100
a conversation of success
lower than a million dollars.

170
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,734
Yet 400,000, data,
math, 400,000 is the bottom

171
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:25,734
of the top one percent
of earners in this country.

172
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:28,467
You know, even if we just
change the conversation to,

173
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:31,133
I want to make
$400,000 a year, it would change

174
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:34,934
your behavior because so
many people in their goals

175
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:38,867
to achieve these great big
businesses, become impatient,

176
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:42,066
are looking for shortcuts,
and want it to happen quickly,

177
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:45,133
which means, and I know this,
which means you just start

178
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,600
doing stuff that you
don't feel good about.

179
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,867
Whatever the hell you're up
to, if I can have you leave

180
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,400
with anything, here are
basically the core pillars,

181
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
before I get into Q&amp;A.

182
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,266
So you have a mic right?
Who's got mics?

183
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,567
How many do we, do we
have any of those, great.

184
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,433
So before I get into
Q&amp;A and I'm going in earlier

185
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:02,734
than I expected
based on how many hands.

186
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:05,066
The core pillars are, if
you're not trading attention,

187
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,367
if you are not putting
out content where people

188
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,300
actually are, you lose.

189
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,033
You're basically quiet.

190
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,467
Like if you are not
successful at putting out

191
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,800
written words, pictures,

192
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,100
videos, or audio, four things.

193
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,567
If you are not capable for
what you're trying to achieve

194
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:26,734
and why you're here today,
to write something, to put

195
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:29,934
a picture that shows
something, to audio it

196
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:33,299
in podcast form, or
some other form, or a video

197
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,866
on the seven to 10 platforms
that live on this device,

198
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:41,633
you are 100%
irrelevant in 2017.

199
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:43,100
That is, that is
something you have to

200
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,232
wrap your head around.

201
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,533
If you are not communicating,
and by the way,

202
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,400
not as a personal brand, right?

203
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,900
Like you can be Toyota,
you can be an energy drink,

204
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,033
you can be a sneaker,
or you can be you,

205
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,800
but if that, those,
either one of those two things

206
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,467
is not producing one
of those four core things,

207
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,567
in one of these 10
websites, Facebook, Twitter,

208
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:07,333
Instagram, Snapchat,
you know LinkedIn, you know

209
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:11,266
podcast form,
Medium, or a blog form.

210
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:14,133
If you're not doing that,
you're silent to the world,

211
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,066
because I don't know
where you think the attention

212
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,633
of the consumer actually is.

213
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:20,867
Everybody in this room
for free, has bigger audience

214
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:24,033
on 10 websites, or apps
on this device, and they

215
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:27,433
don't realize it, and
what they get hurt by,

216
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,900
is the supply and demand issue.

217
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,834
The problem is, as
great as what I just said is,

218
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,934
that you have bigger reach

219
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:36,834
capability than
those characters,

220
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,000
the problem is
everybody in this room has

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,467
that same reach capability.

222
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:44,133
Everybody in this state,
everybody in this country,

223
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,333
so now you get
into supply and demand.

224
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,266
I love, I can't wait for
one of you to ask, hey Gary,

225
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:53,300
but I produce great content,
but nobody's listening.

226
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,600
That's my favorite,
Gary, I'm making great stuff

227
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,433
and everybody's
following all these crapheads.

228
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,633
My stuff is great,
why's it not working?

229
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,200
'Cause your stuff is crap.

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,900
(audience laughter)

231
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,100
You think it's great,
your momma said it was great,

232
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,867
but the market didn't.

233
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:11,800
- [Man] Amen.

234
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,900
- Amen is right my friend.

235
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,867
The market, is the
market, is the market.

236
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,467
It's always right.

237
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,333
You don't like that
people watch the Kardashians?

238
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,433
Tough shit.
(audience laughter)

239
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,767
The market spoke, right?

240
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,200
You don't like that I watch
grown men run into each other

241
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,900
for four hours a day on
Sundays in the Fall and Winter?

242
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,367
Tough, the market spoke, right?

243
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:36,700
You can't decide, what is
really imperative in this room

244
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,400
is to figure out
how you bring value

245
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,533
in today's modern world.

246
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:44,400
What products and
services can you deploy,

247
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,533
and where is the attention?

248
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,133
What are you actually offering?

249
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,800
Are you commoditized?

250
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,567
And really to be very frank
given the makeup of the room,

251
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:55,000
do you actually even give
a crap about your customer,

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,033
in what you're trying
to achieve, or is it just

253
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,433
solely about what
you're trying to achieve?

254
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,500
When I really
audited some of the people

255
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,200
that were coming to
this event using this hashtag

256
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,967
yesterday, and I looked at what
they do and how they do it,

257
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,500
you don't give a rat's
ass about anybody but what

258
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,834
you're trying to achieve
and sell, and it's so quick

259
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:14,734
and easy for me to taste it,
it took me about five seconds.

260
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,600
So that's something
you need to think about,

261
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,200
because the second you
deploy selfish behavior is the

262
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,667
second that you're
losing other people's attention.

263
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,266
I understand that you
want stuff to be automated,

264
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:28,467
and hit one button, and send
an email to 100,000 people,

265
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:29,500
and lots of people buy.

266
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,700
I understand that's
why it's good for you.

267
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,800
I also understand that
when that's happening to you,

268
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,767
you delete that email before
you even start reading it.

269
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,233
I understand that you
want to make a Facebook ad

270
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,133
that sells your thing,
that you want them to watch

271
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:45,266
the two minute video and
buy your thing, but I also

272
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,100
know that every time you see
that in your Facebook stream,

273
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,567
you do this.

274
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:53,834
Let me tell you the quickest
way to become very successful

275
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,400
at selling something,
to become very

276
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,834
empathetic very quickly.

277
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:03,133
Empathy my friends, is
the secret drug of sales.

278
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:07,333
I always, always, only care
about what you're thinking.

279
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,734
You know why you guys like me?

280
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,367
'Cause I'm empathetic.

281
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,000
You know why you guys like me?

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,567
'Cause I'm bringing
you way more value than

283
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,133
I'm asking for you in return.

284
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,667
You guys know why you like me?

285
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,934
'Cause I look different than
people that look like me,

286
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:22,400
'cause I'm not
asking, I'm giving.

287
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,100
And so when I say to you,
don't listen to what I'm saying,

288
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,467
watch what I'm doing,
that's what I mean in a macro,

289
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:33,100
and then the micro, there's
a reason I put 15 hashtags

290
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,066
on every post on Instagram.

291
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,834
There's a reason I ask
you to swipe up and draw

292
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,867
on top of an Instagram story.

293
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:42,333
There's a reason I have
call to actions at the

294
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,767
end of a YouTube video.

295
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:48,133
There's a reason I reply to so
many of you in the comments.

296
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,066
Watch those things.

297
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:54,000
I can say anything I want,
my behavior trumps it all.

298
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,333
If you don't see
me going hardcore on

299
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,667
Snapchat glasses or VR,
that means I don't believe in it

300
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,600
at this second,
but I'm watching it, right?

301
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm doing nothing.

302
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,567
Let me promise you one thing,
I'm doing nothing by accident.

303
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,367
There's nothing I do
for kicks and giggles.

304
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,100
It's all strategic, it's
all for me to collect data,

305
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,500
it's all for me
to make decisions on.

306
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,166
So, what I'm asking you to
do, is pay closer attention

307
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,667
to what I'm doing, and
replicate that behavior

308
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,033
for your audience,
because you know it works,

309
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:27,700
'cause it's working on you.

310
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,700
The problem is, nobody
wants to put in the work

311
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,867
and the
patience that that takes.

312
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,266
I understand why you
don't want to do it, it sucks.

313
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:38,734
Yet me, who works 18 hours
a day and I've proven

314
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,800
that to you over the last year
and a half with DailyVee.

315
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,600
Me, who works 18 hours a
day, who travels 500 times

316
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,767
a year, who does all
that stuff, is engaging with

317
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:52,867
his community more than every
single person in this room.

318
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,700
You're so fancy you
don't have time to reply to the

319
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,066
three people that left you a
comment on your Instagram post?

320
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,233
(audience laughter)

321
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,266
I mean, seriously.

322
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,567
Everybody loves to talk
about loving their community

323
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:04,767
and you care
about your customer.

324
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:05,700
Really?

325
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,266
Because the 12 people
I audited last night, by the way

326
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:10,600
at midnight in my
hotel room before this talk

327
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,533
so I could bring you value,
when I looked at you,

328
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,700
and I looked at your stuff,
you're really good at

329
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,400
throwing your right hooks
and getting your people

330
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,667
into your products and
services, but you actually

331
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,066
replied to zero
people collectively,

332
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:25,133
in the comments of those posts.

333
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,433
Because you
actually don't give a shit,

334
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,533
and smart winners can smell it.

335
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,600
And I promise you, let me give
you a really bad business;

336
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
selling to losers.

337
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,433
(light audience laughter)

338
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:40,433
Thank you.

339
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,834
(audience cheers and applause)

340
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,000
First name and where you're
from, and then we'll roll.

341
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,166
- Jared Greenhurst
from Salt Lake City, Utah.

342
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,000
- Awesome.

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,166
- Welcome to Utah man.
- Thank you my man.

344
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,333
- Low riders...
- (laughs) Yeah what's up?

345
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,266
- My question is
so I built a business from

346
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,900
zero to five million
in the last two years.

347
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,734
- Amazing.

348
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,767
- And dealing with the
next piece, and I know you are

349
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:04,934
a dictator on culture,--

350
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,700
- Yes
- like your Honey Empire game.

351
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,700
How many people are you
actually managing and how do you

352
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,533
scale that, even from
now from 700 to like 3,000,

353
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,333
'cause you, I know
you're dealing with that,

354
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,934
how do you have that,
all the way down to 701?

355
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,767
- You don't, what
you do is you make,

356
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:25,600
in my company of 750,
I try to make 650 people know

357
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,233
that my door is open,
and it is, so when number 419

358
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,967
emails Tyler that five
minutes is being scheduled

359
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,200
within three to six weeks.

360
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,967
My father-in-law Peter Kline
has a friend here,

361
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,700
and different like, whether
you've worked in big companies,

362
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,133
or you've got a small company,
the quickest, biggest mistake

363
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:44,233
that people make is they
don't have the 20 to 30 people

364
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,266
that directly
impact their business.

365
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:48,400
The top, let's just
call it the top one percent,

366
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,834
don't even call it 20 or 30.

367
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:52,967
If your right-hand
person isn't 100% aligned

368
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:56,033
with you on everything,
you are vulnerable.

369
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:58,800
I fire the inner 20,

370
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,734
top 20 or 30, pretty often

371
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:04,266
if they waver from me,
because I'm vulnerable

372
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:06,867
to them not executing my vision.

373
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,433
So how many
people do you have?

374
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,266
- [Jared] We've got 25.
- Right, 25.

375
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:12,300
So, those top five or seven,

376
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,867
number four, she might
be so important to you.

377
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:18,633
She may do the thing
that you don't know how to do,

378
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:21,767
or don't like to do,
which is always important.

379
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,934
A CFO, I don't want to
do the finances, right?

380
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:26,767
I just did an episode
with my CFO, if you saw it.

381
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:31,667
I don't like to do that,
I'm not a CFO-driven guy.

382
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,266
I don't make my
money by cutting costs.

383
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:36,600
I make my money by selling,
that has always been my career.

384
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,266
I don't like to do that

385
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,133
but I've always had the person,

386
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,767
the person has to be in place.

387
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,033
My last CFO, some of you

388
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,266
who have been
following me for a while,

389
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:45,900
we used to call
him CFbrO, right?

390
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,600
Scott Heydt, I love him, right.

391
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,567
He's in the Namely
commercials right now.

392
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,700
I haven't stopped those
'cause I have love for him.

393
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,500
But it got to a point

394
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,333
where he wasn't
executing how I needed,

395
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,633
and he couldn't
be there anymore.

396
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,533
Undermining certain
things that you believe in,

397
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,800
she's gotta go.

398
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,667
And most people
don't make that move.

399
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,333
They value the
money over the culture.

400
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,867
They value the
money over the thesis.

401
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:11,000
They value the short term
money over the long term money.

402
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:13,400
And then by the way,

403
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,665
you just put in the work.

404
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:18,665
You can't read
about doing push-ups.

405
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,633
So, you just have
to allocate the time.

406
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,433
And the other thing is
you need to face the things

407
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,633
that you don't wanna face.

408
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,100
Like I know my shortcomings.

409
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,367
I don't like them, but every
time I'm with my direct people,

410
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:35,100
my leaders,
I expose myself to them,

411
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,133
so that they know I know them.

412
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,834
Because that builds trust.

413
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,567
Got it?
- [Jared] I got it, thank you.

414
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,867
- That's it,
it's the only way.

415
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:45,000
Yep, hey, man.

416
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,667
- [Sergei] Hi,
Gary, my name's Sergei,

417
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,667
and I'm a big fan of you.
- Thank you, brother.

418
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,567
- [Sergei] I'm from Russia, man.

419
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,367
- I love it, I know it well.

420
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,500
- [Sergei] My question is:
what are the biggest mistakes

421
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
you see young entrepreneurs make

422
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,133
when starting their own
company or, you know, app,

423
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:01,533
and stuff like that.

424
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,767
- To generalize, Sergei,
the biggest mistakes are

425
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:08,100
number one, especially in the
tech world we live in now,

426
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,100
they're not
actually building businesses.

427
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,433
They wanna raise money,

428
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:14,633
like, let me
just remind everybody.

429
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:17,400
How many people here have
raised money for their business?

430
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,900
Raise your hands. Right.

431
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,600
Big thing for you guys.

432
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,367
It doesn't take a hero
to lose money each month.

433
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,567
(audience laughter)

434
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,700
Everybody can do that.

435
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,967
So, the biggest thing,
Sergei, is I have a lot of,

436
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,433
and I'm involved in a
lot of these business,

437
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,667
they raise money,
they're losing money each month.

438
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,133
They're not
actually building a business,

439
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,700
they're building a
financial arbitrage machine.

440
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,800
They're trying to hit metrics

441
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,867
to get to the
next round of funding.

442
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,400
Huge mistake, especially if the

443
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,367
macroeconomic climate
collapses, which 8, 9 years in,

444
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,166
and you guys have been
hearing it from me, right.

445
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,900
I brought Tony Robbins
on the show

446
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,133
to talk about
Wall Street and that,

447
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,834
more so than the
thing that you would think

448
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:57,834
that me and him
would talk about.

449
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,300
Because I wanna
get this in your mind,

450
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,567
it can't last forever.
That's number one.

451
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,367
Number two, kids are impatient.

452
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,600
Everybody's impatient,
kids are triple impatient.

453
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,500
Because you're in
that part of your life

454
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,633
where you wanna
prove everybody wrong.

455
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,867
Right? You're in that place
where you're gonna show Dad

456
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,500
that you're
right and he's wrong.

457
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,300
You're gonna show your
friends that you're special.

458
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,033
There's that
video from the other day

459
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,433
that I put as a
separate piece of content today,

460
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:23,500
that call I had,

461
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
how many people
saw the #AskGaryVee

462
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,900
where I talked to
Taylor for like 20 minutes?

463
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Raise your hands.

464
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
The reactions on
this video are so insane.

465
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,133
I'm sure you watched it.

466
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,133
That's what
young entrepreneurs are

467
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,233
making a mistake of.

468
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,433
She's got
nothing going on at 22,

469
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,467
and she's telling me she's
gonna be a millionaire at 25.

470
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:39,300
How?

471
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,266
You guys make up dumb shit.

472
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,667
(audience laughter)

473
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:49,934
So, impatience and
lack of actually building

474
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:51,266
a profitable business.

475
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:54,000
Lack of practicality,
lack of experience.

476
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,834
You've heard me say,
many of you have heard me say,

477
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:58,233
I built my dad's
business from 3 to 60 million,

478
00:19:58,233 --> 00:19:59,900
it should have been 200 million

479
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,533
because I figured out
AdWords before anybody else

480
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,834
but I didn't put all
my money into AdWords

481
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,333
because I was doing
direct mail, and radio,

482
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,734
and television because
I didn't have the experience

483
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,467
to know that when
you've got the best hand,

484
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:11,934
you put all your money on it.

485
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:13,467
I thought I had
to do everything.

486
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:17,066
Now that I know that at 41,
I am putting all my money

487
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,700
into Facebook, and
Instagram, and Tumbler

488
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,400
because that's the best
hand, and I'll milk that.

489
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,100
And when it changes, I'll adjust

490
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,700
but I'm not gonna hedge,
which why I've been so loud.

491
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,834
- [Man 2] A big buzz
word right now is passion.

492
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,500
- [Gary] Passion.
- [Man 2] Find your passion.

493
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,834
You might be
sitting at a desk job

494
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,867
but you need to
find your passion.

495
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:35,400
When I look at my
career, your career,

496
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,600
the way it's actually
presented, you have one passion.

497
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
What I'm thinking is,
I saw your passion with wine.

498
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,800
- Yes.

499
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,367
- [Man 2] And I see your passion
with VaynerMedia, your brand.

500
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,867
Is it possible that we
have more than one passion?

501
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:46,667
- [Gary] Of course.

502
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:47,700
- [Man 2] It comes
down to something inside of us.

503
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,800
- [Gary] I also think, my man,

504
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,834
that you have to ladder it up.

505
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,467
My passion is to
communicate complicated things

506
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,333
in average-Joe talk.

507
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,033
That's why I won in wine,
wine's complicated, right?

508
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,000
How many people know somebody
that's really into wine?

509
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,333
Raise your hands.

510
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,867
Great, so 80% of you
know that once somebody

511
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,533
learns a lot of about wine,

512
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,266
they become a 
straight douchebag.

513
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,433
(audience laughter)

514
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,600
Right?
Like that's what happens.

515
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,834
So, me being Jersey and being
into wrestling and sports,

516
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm like, you know what,
I know the most about wine.

517
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,800
The most, I know
as much as the top

518
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,200
10,000 people about
wine, or in that mix.

519
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,934
Let me talk to people about wine

520
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,834
the way we talk
about everything else.

521
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,967
Let's not put
wine on a pedestal.

522
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:32,567
Now, what I do really
well, for whatever reason,

523
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,533
I have figured
somewhere around that time

524
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,734
when I started Wine Library TV,

525
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,633
the way I communicate,

526
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,533
and I truly believe
what I'm about to say,

527
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:42,367
because I don't think
I was very well educated

528
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,300
and I've always
lived in my own bubble,

529
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
I think I say the same stuff
that has always been said.

530
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,667
I just think I say
it a different way

531
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,667
because I don't
know the other way

532
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:54,133
that it's actually said
like everybody else says it.

533
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,200
And I think that,
for some reason,

534
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,300
that helps people because
it's just a different way.

535
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,867
And I also
think that people feel

536
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,200
that I actually mean it.

537
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,700
So, I think that
has a lot to do with it.

538
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,400
My passion is to
communicate the things

539
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I most believe in.

540
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,533
Whether that's the
good values in wine

541
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:13,500
or the business
opportunities of the day.

542
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,233
But, yes, of course,
we're passionate a bunch of,

543
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,734
I mean, I could
start a Jets show,

544
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,066
I could start a root beer
show when I'm off my diet.

545
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,500
I could talk
about a lot of stuff

546
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,967
that I'm passionate about.

547
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,767
I don't think you need to be
crippled to your one passion.

548
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:25,934
And we evolve.

549
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:27,934
What you're
passionate about at 24

550
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:30,100
is different than what
you're passionate about at 33.

551
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,000
And it's different what
you're passionate about at 57.

552
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,600
Plus life brings things.

553
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,133
I promise you, if
one of the four or five

554
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,233
most important people in my life

555
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,500
pass away from a rare disease,

556
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,867
I'm gonna be passionate about
figuring out that disease.

557
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:43,567
- [Man 3] I'm trying to decide

558
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,700
should I just grow
it and do my own product

559
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,433
and just shout out my own stuff

560
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,734
or go the influencer
route? And when do I determine

561
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:52,934
to monetize or just keep growing
just giving free content?

562
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:57,700
- I think this is what's great
about Q&amp;A, hold the mic.

563
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,567
Can you afford to
continue to not monetize?

564
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,633
- [Man 3] I could.

565
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,066
- Because?

566
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,900
- [Man 3] Because I go to school

567
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,767
and I, I'm just.

568
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,100
- You don't need a lot of money.

569
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,734
- [Man 3] I don't.
- You keep it...

570
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,100
- [Man 3] (mumbles)
- Humble.

571
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,500
I think you hold your
breath as long as possible

572
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,400
because you build more equity.

573
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,900
The second you go in for the ask

574
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,633
is the second that
you're giving away the leverage.

575
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:24,300
When you're giving,
you're gaining leverage.

576
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300
That's why I have so
much leverage with you.

577
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,934
When I'm giving, I build,
build, build up leverage.

578
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,400
I hate when I come out with a
book every two or three years

579
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,667
and I'm like, can
you guys buy books?

580
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm like, I hate it,
I have a goal.

581
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,066
I have to do something
but I hate that month or two

582
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,300
and then people are like,
"GaryVee, you've changed."

583
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,667
I'm like shit, this shit again?

584
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:42,500
You know like...

585
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,266
(audience laughter)

586
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:47,533
I hate that month!

587
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:50,433
The biggest problem, my man,
that a lot of people here

588
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:53,266
that are not kids make is
when they start getting into

589
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:57,000
a little bit of money, they
start spending it on dumb shit.

590
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,433
Which then forces
them to have to make more,

591
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,667
which means then they
get into short-term behavior

592
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:05,100
and they
continue to take leverage

593
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,533
and give it to the other person.

594
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:09,033
Which makes them a
sleazy sales person

595
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:12,200
one way or the other
over time, and then they lose.

596
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,734
I would say wait
as long as possible.

597
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:19,600
If you were 34 years old and
lived with four roommates

598
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,934
in the basement
of somebody's home

599
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,433
in the suburbs 
of Salt Lake City,

600
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:25,867
I'd be pumped with 
you because that means

601
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,200
you're holding your breath.

602
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,100
Dude, I was 29 years old

603
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,567
and lived in a $2,000 a month

604
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:37,000
rent apartment in
New Jersey which, by the way,

605
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,200
Jersey rents are
different than here, right?

606
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,633
Had nothing.

607
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:49,333
I had a car, a Jeep Cherokee,

608
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:52,033
and had built a
business from three,

609
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,900
at that point to
40 million in revenue

610
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,033
and was paying
myself $49,000 a year.

611
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:03,867
I don't give you
advice that I didn't take.

612
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:06,033
All these 
23-year-olds on Instagram

613
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:09,000
who want to buy
watches and go on private jets.

614
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,333
When I make fun of that,
it's not 'cause I'm jealous.

615
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:16,133
It's not because I want
to rag on somebody or compete

616
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,233
'cause it's fucking stupid.

617
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:21,667
(audience laughter and applause)

618
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,367
Do you understand what

619
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,867
you could do with that $5,000?

620
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:29,033
You could reinvest
it into your business.

621
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:30,867
The reason
Wine Library grew so fast,

622
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,934
why do you think
VaynerMedia's growing so fast?

623
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:34,934
Everyone's like, why is
VaynerMedia growing so fast?

624
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:38,100
It's 'cause I reinvested
in the business.

625
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,600
It's 'cause I put the
money into the business.

626
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,667
Everybody wants
to build a business.

627
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,500
You know many people
here want to build a business

628
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,667
or a personal brand so
they can buy stuff with it?

629
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,266
That thing I said the
other day on the vlog, right,

630
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:54,266
I don't want to buy a
private jet like everybody

631
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,333
tells me to do
when they see that

632
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:58,734
I'm wasting an hour on
an extra commercial flight

633
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,333
because I want to
buy the New York Jets.

634
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,767
You know what I mean?

635
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,934
(audience applause)

636
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,033
All this behavior, my man,
is predicated on insecurity.

637
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:15,967
You know why
24-year-old dudes buy watches?

638
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,033
'Cause they're not
confident and they need that

639
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:20,467
to get a girl.

640
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,300
(audience laughter)

641
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,734
All those dudes that are
flashing on social media,

642
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:29,100
I look at them like, insecure.

643
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,867
Not real confident.

644
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:34,200
You know, puffed up fake.

645
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,467
You know it's
the same old thing.

646
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:37,867
It's the same reason people
buy followers on social--

647
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:41,333
Guys, and some of you did
it 'cause one of the people

648
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,567
I looked at last
night that's here

649
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,734
with the hashtag bought it.
You know how I know?

650
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:48,533
You can't have
800,000 followers on Instagram

651
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:51,867
and get 27
comments and 94 likes.

652
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:55,367
(audience laughter and applause)

653
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,967
I ended my talk with it,
which is the worst businesses

654
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,066
to sell to losers
and I promise you

655
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:05,734
there's a stunning
amount of people here

656
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:08,700
who try to sell to
the bottom-feeders.

657
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,166
And you never trick winners.

658
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,467
When people DM me,
and they're like,

659
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,166
"Yo GaryVee,
check me out, I'm killing it."

660
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:20,066
They've got 900,000
followers on Instagram,

661
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,767
but they don't actually have it.

662
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,533
I reply, "No, you aren't."

663
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:25,900
Then their feelings are hurt.

664
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,467
(audience laughter)

665
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,200
And it makes me feel awesome.

666
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,066
(audience laughter)

667
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,500
Hold your breath.

668
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,033
Keep building for the audience.

669
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:34,934
Bring them value.

670
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:36,533
You know what you're
next Instagram post should be

671
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,934
instead of taking
$400 for a sponsored ad?

672
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,734
Why don't you're
next Instagram post be,

673
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:43,633
"What can I do for you guys
to make this account better?"

674
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:47,000
Then read all the
comments and then act on them.

675
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,100
- [Man 4] What
peaks your interest

676
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,467
on one, if it's going to work?

677
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:53,433
And two, if you want to invest
your time and money in it?

678
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,467
- [Gary] How many users it has.

679
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:56,867
You've heard me say this,

680
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:57,967
if you've been
following my stuff,

681
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm not Nostradamus.

682
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm not
predicting the next apps.

683
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,734
I'm just watching the ones
that are already popping.

684
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:05,233
The only thing
that peaks my interest

685
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:07,767
is reverse engineering
the actual market.

686
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:11,867
Again, I don't to
say if all of a sudden,

687
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,166
let's talk about
what peaked my interest

688
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:18,700
in Snapchat five years ago.

689
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,734
Users.

690
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:24,367
It was ranked 130
in the top 150 apps

691
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:26,467
in the world in the App Store.

692
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:29,867
That caught my attention,
so I downloaded it.

693
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:32,633
And then I said,
"This thing's confusing."

694
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:33,600
Right?

695
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,767
Then it was 111, then
it was 96, then it was 74,

696
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:41,667
then it was in the
40's for a long, long time

697
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,600
and that peaked my interest.

698
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,667
I don't judge if
Twitter is smart or stupid.

699
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,700
I don't judge if
Snapchat is smart or stupid.

700
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,633
I don't judge if
Musical.ly is smart or stupid.

701
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:54,700
I judge that
people are using it.

702
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,333
And then I try
to figure out why.

703
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,834
And I try to figure out
how to story tell on it,

704
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,767
contextual to the platform

705
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,367
with the content that
is most important to me.

706
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,667
The end.

707
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:07,166
You just have to
be the tallest midget.

708
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,567
(audience laughter and applause)

709
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,400
You know?

710
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,667
- Hey, my name's Taylor.

711
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,467
I'm from Wayhigh, Utah.

712
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,300
I'm a big fan.

713
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,500
- [Gary] Hey, Taylor. Thank you.

714
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,533
- So I have a question,

715
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:24,200
Have a great family,
great friends,

716
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
great surroundings,

717
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,533
but I feel like in the culture

718
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:29,567
that I was raised in,
I had a lot of limited beliefs.

719
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,900
- [Gary] About upside
of like, yeah.

720
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,734
- Exactly.

721
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,600
- [Gary] Like keep it
humble, chill, okay.

722
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,200
- So how does someone
overcome limited beliefs

723
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,100
that are imposed on us

724
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,433
by school teachers
growing up, surrounding.

725
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:43,834
- Family, uncles, yeah.
- [Taylor] Exactly.

726
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,867
- By not giving a
shit about what they think.

727
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,900
- [Taylor] I don't 
give a shit but--

728
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,567
- You do though

729
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,500
because you asked the question.

730
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,567
(audience laughter)

731
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,433
You know what I mean?
You say you don't but you do.

732
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:56,500
And by the way we all do.

733
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
But that's the answer.

734
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,967
- [Taylor] Okay.

735
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,300
- You have to understand,
I've lived this.

736
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,567
Literally, somewhere in my
early teens and late teens,

737
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:09,100
just started looking
at my teachers and parents

738
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,266
and just saying, "Sorry.

739
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:13,800
"You're just not going to be
able to impose your will on me.

740
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,900
"This is what's up."

741
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,867
I did that at a
very, very young age.

742
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,834
There's plenty of
60-year-olds, right now,

743
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:24,100
whose 82-year-old mother
is still suppressing them.

744
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,166
I'm not saying
I'm, I'm just thankful.

745
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,467
I don't think I'm cool.

746
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:28,967
Please know that
I'm not saying that

747
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,000
because I think I'm cool.

748
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,300
I think I was lucky

749
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,867
by given the chemicals
that I was given DNA-wise

750
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,967
to have the audacity to do that.

751
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,100
I don't know
where that came from.

752
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,533
It's not like I read a book

753
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,533
or trained
myself as a 15-year-old

754
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:42,800
to be like, "Okay, I'm not going
to care what anybody thinks."

755
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,834
That's not, that's insane.

756
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,233
The other thing is,

757
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,800
what's interesting, and
you've heard this from me,

758
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,266
I'm also pushing
from the other direction.

759
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,266
I genuinely don't give a crap

760
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,400
about what anybody thinks

761
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,133
and I equally think I care
about what you all think.

762
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,266
Which is what makes
me the guy that I am.

763
00:30:57,266 --> 00:30:58,400
I'm pulling from opposite sides.

764
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,900
But the thing that
you're worried about,

765
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,867
very simply, this is a cliche,

766
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,900
and I would say
this is 98% likely,

767
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,066
is you're worried
about talking a big game

768
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,233
and then failing and
then them all saying,

769
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:13,066
"I told you so. You
should have kept it humble."

770
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:14,834
To me, that's the insight.

771
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,133
- [Taylor] So--
- Keep going.

772
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:19,100
- [Taylor] I own a business.
- Yep.

773
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,767
- [Taylor] I painted
all my vehicles hot pink

774
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:26,400
so I don't care what
people think on that.

775
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,767
So mine's more
of scale and size.

776
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:33,000
I feel like a lot of
people don't have confidence

777
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,400
in getting from five
million to 10 million,

778
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,300
or turning it into 20 million.

779
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,600
- [Gary] Okay.
- So more along those lines.

780
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,900
- [Gary] You're looking
for that confidence?

781
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,633
- [Taylor] Yeah.

782
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:44,066
- I think the other thing

783
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:47,066
to give real thought to,
and this is a tough one,

784
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:52,200
is a lot of time, people
aren't spending their time

785
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,400
with other winners, right?

786
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
I think that, and the way

787
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,567
that you asked the
question the first time,

788
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,200
I was going to go
here and then I pivoted

789
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,400
based on what you said,

790
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,533
you might have to move. Right?

791
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,667
Or you might have to
start spending a lot of,

792
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,600
so one of the great things,

793
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,100
let's say you
don't want to move.

794
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,567
But you've got this business.

795
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:11,400
What I would tell you,

796
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,500
back to the same
advice that I gave

797
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,900
to that young man, right there.

798
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,166
I would give up all
your profits to travel,

799
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,467
a ton every year.

800
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:23,600
And go to places where people
are bigger winners than you.

801
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,667
It feels like you just need

802
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,567
to be rubbed off
on with other winners.

803
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:28,166
I definitely changed,

804
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,934
and I was already a "winner,"

805
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:31,166
when I started spending time

806
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,533
with Mark Zuckerburg, and
Travis, and the people who

807
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,433
were going to go on
to change the world.

808
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,066
The ambition of the
conversation changed.

809
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,734
They were on a
kick to build products

810
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:41,934
that were going to change
every single person's lives,

811
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:44,400
and they did.

812
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,367
Go Google this.

813
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,367
Go put Gary Vaynerchuk,
Uber, Business Insider.

814
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,300
They wrote the article.

815
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,100
I was in the room.

816
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,934
In the room.

817
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:54,633
Back to a Hamilton reference,

818
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:58,266
I was in the room when

819
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:01,033
Garrett Camp invented Uber.

820
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,066
Literally, verbatim,
seven people

821
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,333
sitting in a room
in Paris, him saying,

822
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:10,467
"What if you could order a limo

823
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,066
"with your iPhone?"

824
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,767
And we were like,
"That's just for rich people."

825
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:18,333
(audience laughter)

826
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,000
It sounds like you
need to spend more time

827
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,166
with people that
will press you up

828
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,433
instead of push you down.

829
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,266
(audience applause)

830
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:27,667
And there's a way to do that

831
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,867
without moving to New York City.

832
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,667
It's going to these conferences.

833
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,633
And I don't mean to be,
and this is with all respect,

834
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:37,266
more coaching, more
motivational me stuff.

835
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,800
I mean, go to an
Elon Musk conference.

836
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,133
Go to an Apple conference.

837
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:43,367
Stuff that's less about
the emotional part of it

838
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,767
and more about the
black and white part of it.

839
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,967
I mean,
I've been offered, you know,

840
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:51,133
$500,000 to wear
a pair of sneakers.

841
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,934
Stuff that is life
changing, game changing,

842
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:57,367
super fun to brag
about, and just weird.

843
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:58,767
I haven't gone
there because that's not

844
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,367
how I want to monetize.

845
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,333
But, you'll be
pumped about this,

846
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:06,600
you can get
everybody by just asking.

847
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,000
It's literally just asking.

848
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,367
You don't know what's going

849
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:13,800
to drive Mark Cuban, or
Tim Ferriss, or Beyonce.

850
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,967
But it's something.

851
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,766
- [Man 5] You know,
it's funny you say that

852
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:18,766
because I've heard you talk

853
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,000
about a lot of
people emailing you

854
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,900
asking for $10,000
to start a business

855
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,400
and I just published this book

856
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,132
called Business Funding Formula.

857
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,065
And I can do an
Amazon free download

858
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,867
for all those
people that need to learn

859
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,233
how to get money
for their business.

860
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:33,433
Maybe some zero
percent line credit,

861
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:34,266
that kind of thing.

862
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:35,333
- Was that a right hook?

863
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,166
(audience laughter)

864
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,333
- [Man 5] No, it was my value
to let it be free.

865
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,166
- Yeah, that's not
real value, brother.

866
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,400
That's you pitching your shit

867
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,867
in disguise as value.

868
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:45,567
I'm being serious.

869
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:46,567
- [Man 5] I believe you.

870
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,266
(audience cheers and applause)

871
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:49,367
- That's cool though.

872
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:50,667
By the way, I'm a salesman.

873
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:53,000
It doesn't bother me
but I want you to win.

874
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,600
20,000 of
200,000 is very different

875
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,066
from 200,000 to
two million a month

876
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,500
or 20 million a month, right?

877
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,433
So the big difference between
20,000 and 200,000 a month

878
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,033
and two million and 20 million

879
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,467
is understanding
that wasn't actual value.

880
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:08,734
That's disguised value

881
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:10,200
that's in your best interest.

882
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,600
It's like a humble brag.

883
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,700
Like, I'm working so hard,

884
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,333
I'm making 10 trillion a year.

885
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,834
That's not, you
know, that's like.

886
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:17,533
(audience laughter)

887
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,133
- [Man 5] What's
an example, though?

888
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,700
- An example is having nothing

889
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,967
that values you when
you gift to somebody.

890
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:26,467
Like you promoting
your zero-priced book now

891
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,734
in front of everybody,
that's value to you.

892
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:33,200
So it's the mindset of
not thinking about yourself.

893
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,700
It's a mind shift.

894
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,934
And just knowing
that you have the skills

895
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,266
that it'll come
to you regardless.

896
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:40,600
It's a good feeling.

897
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,633
And it's really interesting.

898
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:43,467
So I think, people are like,

899
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,567
"Get my free ebook.
It's value to you."

900
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:46,867
No it's not.

901
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:48,066
It's a gateway drug for you

902
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:50,533
to sell them something else.

903
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:51,967
The fuck's the matter with you?

904
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:54,066
(audience laughter and applause)

905
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:56,033
Right?
So it's like that mentality.

906
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:57,200
You know what I mean?

907
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Cool.

908
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,700
- My question is,
if you were writing a book

909
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
and you were self-publishing,
how would you distribute it

910
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,033
and what would
your marketing be like?

911
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:06,633
- You would do
it through Amazon,

912
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,233
not super hard.

913
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,700
It's nice that self-publishing

914
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,967
doesn't have as much stigma

915
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:12,500
as it did five or 10 years ago.

916
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,166
I mean, five or 10
years ago, at a conference,

917
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,333
someone saying
"self-publishing,"

918
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,100
you're like,
"Oh, spam, crap," right?

919
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,567
It's now slightly
gotten to a better place

920
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,100
which I think is great.

921
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,333
I would use
influencers and Facebook ads.

922
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,467
I mean, my stuff is
super easy to understand.

923
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:28,467
All I care about is under,

924
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:31,233
when I say "day trade
attention," everything works.

925
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,467
You could run a
television commercial

926
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:34,667
during the Super Bowl,

927
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,867
I just don't
think you can afford it.

928
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:38,600
So you have to find the things
that are underpriced.

929
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,066
The underpriced
attention right now

930
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:42,500
are Facebook ads and
you can target people

931
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,333
based on what
your subject matter

932
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,166
of your book is

933
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,767
based on them
being interested in that.

934
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,700
- What's the subject about?

935
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,700
- So the book that I'm
writing is about my (mumbles)

936
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,467
of becoming a mom and
experiencing miscarriage.

937
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:56,333
- [Gary] Yep. Great.

938
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:00,967
So you run, so if you
type in the word miscarriage.

939
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:03,333
There's a site called
Facebook, at the top it has

940
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,166
a search engine, if
you type in miscarriage,

941
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,266
here's what will happen.

942
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,967
You will see
hundreds of groups on Facebook

943
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,567
and you will see
thousands of pages.

944
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,033
Have you ever run a Facebook ad?

945
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,000
- Yes.
- [Gary] Good.

946
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,900
You go, you make
your piece of content,

947
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,467
it's a picture of you,
it's a picture of the book,

948
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:20,867
it's a five second video of you,

949
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:22,433
it's a five minute video of you.

950
00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:25,567
It's a clip from this talk,
I don't care what you do, right?

951
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:29,367
You place that ad, and
then you target the people

952
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:31,734
in those groups
and in that interest.

953
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:33,333
- [Woman 3] Using
detailed targeting?

954
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,233
The end.

955
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:36,300
You know the answer.

956
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,600
Like that's the answer.

957
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,300
Niches are better.

958
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,967
It's better to sell
Pinot Noir from Burgundy

959
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:45,166
than it is to sell wine.

960
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,266
It's more narrow
and it's easier to get

961
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:51,133
to the actual person
and it's cheaper, at times,

962
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:52,467
depending on the category.

963
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:55,233
And so, that's what I would do.

964
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:58,533
You can go to Instagram
and type in miscarriage,

965
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,200
the hashtag, let me
promise you there will be

966
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,567
hundreds of
thousands if not millions.

967
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:05,400
And then you click the
people that posted about it

968
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,834
and people are talking about it

969
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:10,033
and then you find somebody
who's equally talking about it,

970
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:13,400
she has a radio show
on a podcast about it

971
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,066
and then you DM her and say
I'm writing a book about this,

972
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:19,567
you're talking about this,
I want exposure for my book,

973
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,867
what do you want
from me, and she's like,

974
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,133
I'm just looking for guests.

975
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,767
And now you're done.

976
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:27,934
(audience applause)

977
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:32,734
You know what mean?
Those are details.

978
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:34,934
The thing that makes
what I do hard is it takes

979
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:39,633
a lot of time, like
I scale unscalable behavior.

980
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,834
It's why Corporate America
has been so weird with me.

981
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:46,533
Johnson &amp; Johnson's
and you know, and Dove,

982
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,066
and Pepsi and Mountain Dew,
these companies struggle

983
00:38:49,066 --> 00:38:51,800
with the unscalable
nature of my beliefs

984
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,734
because they
believe in width not depth.

985
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:57,066
It's how they bought
media their whole lives.

986
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:59,867
It doesn't change the
fact that it's working.

987
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:01,000
And it doesn't change the fact

988
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,967
that width is not
working anymore because

989
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:05,300
we don't three television
channels that 50%

990
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,734
of the country
watches the commercials

991
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:08,467
'cause we didn't
have remote controls.

992
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:10,300
The world's changed.

993
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,667
And by the way, digitally too.

994
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,767
I'm sorry that banner
ads don't work anymore.

995
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,834
I'm sorry that
affiliate marketing doesn't work

996
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:19,734
as well on mobile as it did
on desktop, I'm sorry.

997
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,667
But it's the market.

998
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:25,233
Like Twitter built me,
it doesn't work anymore.

999
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,667
I'm not sitting
in my room crying

1000
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:31,166
that Twitter died. I don't
give shit that blue bird.

1001
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,266
(audience laughter)

1002
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,700
Sorry that
you blew up on Snapchat

1003
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,000
but now it's
declined a little bit, sorry.

1004
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,767
Like, you know, you
can't control the market

1005
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:43,500
and where the attention is
but those are details for you.

1006
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,100
You got it, hey man.

1007
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,467
- (inaudible)
Salt Lake City, Utah.

1008
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:51,200
First of can I say how thankful
I am for your perspective

1009
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,033
on life has literally how
changed how I view gratitude

1010
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:56,934
and perspective
on how to live it (inaudible).

1011
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:58,200
- [Gary] Thank you.

1012
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,233
- Just want to publicly say
thank you for everything.

1013
00:39:59,233 --> 00:39:59,967
- [Gary] Thank you.

1014
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,200
- My question is
is there a difference

1015
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,066
between asking for
permission from other people

1016
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:07,934
and taking criticism
from your inner circle

1017
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:09,834
and applying it to
how you deploy in a space?

1018
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:12,600
- Of course,
everything's a fine line, right?

1019
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,900
That was a really
awesome question, I appreciate

1020
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,133
you asking that and
that hasn't been asked of me

1021
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:18,066
in that form.

1022
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:19,033
Of course.

1023
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,767
You know how
I always say I don't give

1024
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:23,800
a rat's ass about what
any of, I just said it,

1025
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,400
20 minutes ago, I don't give
a shit about what you guys

1026
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,767
think about me. I genuinely
care what everyone of you

1027
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:30,667
think about me, 
that contradiction,

1028
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:33,533
that tightrope,
that's where all the magic is.

1029
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:37,400
Like it's all,
everybody's trying to figure out

1030
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,166
what that kind of
finely formulate it like this

1031
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,767
macro patience, micro speed?

1032
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,200
Right, 'cause I'm
talking about go fast

1033
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,066
and then I'm like patience,

1034
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:46,567
everyone's like what
do you mean, GaryVee?

1035
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:49,667
Like, you listen to me
carefully, I'm confusing

1036
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,367
because I'm talking out
of both sides of my mouth

1037
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:54,500
on every issue 'cause
that's actually what it is.

1038
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,934
It's like a bridge.

1039
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:58,900
You have to be basically
pulling from both ends.

1040
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,533
And so of course,
you know of course,

1041
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:04,767
there's a fine line
between being caught up

1042
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:07,567
in everybody's feedback
stopping you doing anything

1043
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:10,533
and taking the
feedback and applying it.

1044
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:11,900
It's a very fine line.

1045
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,967
- Thanks so much.
- [Gary] You're welcome.

1046
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:15,233
- Thank you so much.
I love you!

1047
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:17,633
(audience cheers and applause)

1048
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:18,967
- [Gary] Thank you guys.

1049
00:41:18,967 --> 00:00:00,000
