1
00:00:00,118 --> 00:00:03,034
- We are living in the internet age.

2
00:00:03,034 --> 00:00:05,482
- [Woman] Why don't people get this more

3
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:06,865
and foster, I mean

4
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:10,322
- Because people look backwards
instead of looking forward.

5
00:00:10,322 --> 00:00:13,266
90 percent of people default
into looking behind them,

6
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,450
instead of looking ahead of them.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,283
It's the human psyche.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,737
I think most people are scared of change,

9
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:22,803
and they look for negatives.

10
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:26,886
(classical-influenced pop music)

11
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:34,982
Yeah!

12
00:00:34,982 --> 00:00:35,815
I don't know.

13
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:39,068
Just so happy you're part of the team.

14
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:39,901
Ahh!

15
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:42,989
Literally something about that scene

16
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,917
that was so perfect for me!

17
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:47,389
Morning, Vlog.

18
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:49,109
Nine AM here in Stockholm.

19
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,045
Gorgeous.

20
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:51,965
Nice background.

21
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,181
I'm with a bunch of good looking men here.

22
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,285
We're about to go to some meetings.

23
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:58,621
Super excited about the day.

24
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,493
Getting a lot done, yes.

25
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,997
Oh, thank you very much.

26
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:02,269
Here's my good friend,

27
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:03,365
ArcticStartup

28
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,197
- Yes.
- You guys might have

29
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,193
saw that headline.

30
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:08,005
- Finland 100 Independence Day today.

31
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:08,957
- Finland's hundred?

32
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:10,309
- Yes.
- Independence,

33
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:11,142
from who?

34
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:11,975
- From Russia.

35
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:12,808
- I thought so.

36
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:13,641
(laughs)

37
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:14,602
I know my history.

38
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:15,435
Anyway,

39
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:16,268
see you in a second.

40
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:18,634
Bunch of meetings, got my keynote.

41
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,673
Couple of recaps before we go into today.

42
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:22,545
Gonna give you some edits here, Babin.

43
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:24,265
Number one, pop it fully in,

44
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,641
in full, full edit mode.

45
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,665
The $1.80 Strategy is crushing.

46
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:31,201
I want you to start deploying the

47
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,618
18 cent strategy.

48
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,393
You're gonna drop $1.80 a day,

49
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:37,761
two cents at a time.

50
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:41,497
Nine top posts times 10
different hashtags everyday,

51
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:44,201
and that will massively
build up your audience.

52
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,682
Shane, everybody wants to talk.

53
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:47,809
The way to win is to listen

54
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,209
and then contribute.

55
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,963
Everybody wants to put
a picture of themselves

56
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,137
like you, looking cool, running,

57
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:53,625
but I looked at your social and

58
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,089
just like 99 percent
of the people watching,

59
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:56,313
nobody's listening yet.

60
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:57,966
That's okay, that's
not discouraging to me.

61
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,242
Nobody listened to me at first either.

62
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:00,539
Let me say it one more time.

63
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:02,105
For over a year, nobody watched my

64
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,073
(bleep) shows on YouTube.

65
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,769
The way to be discovered is to either

66
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:06,873
put out great content,

67
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:09,008
have one great piece of content go viral

68
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,552
and then everybody discovers you,

69
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:12,481
or become part of the community.

70
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,881
You're gonna get exposure,

71
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,009
you're gonna get some followers,

72
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,048
you're gonna contribute,

73
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:17,353
but you're also gonna learn because

74
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:18,505
you're gonna watch

75
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,057
90 pieces of content
doing well on Instagram

76
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,586
which is then gonna inspire
and help you strategize

77
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,186
the content that you yourself are gonna

78
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:27,186
put out on Instagram.

79
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:29,314
That's a good use of three hours a day.

80
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:31,082
I'm getting tweeted, DM'ed,

81
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:33,106
emailed like (bleep) crazy.

82
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:36,578
When I taste something,
like the 2017 Flip Challenge

83
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:38,148
that I know brings value to you,

84
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:39,882
an amazing thing is happening.

85
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,980
People are blown away that

86
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,291
one of the best strategies in social media

87
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,482
is being social.

88
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:48,874
Understand it, watch this clip.

89
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:49,940
Actually, you know what?

90
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,773
I got nothing else to say.

91
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:51,606
Get that in,

92
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:54,523
let's go on to the rest of the day.

93
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:56,677
- [Man] Exactly

94
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,251
- And that taste of
like, actually doing it.

95
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,291
- Exactly, exactly.

96
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,859
- It shows you then how to run all (bleep)

97
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:03,119
- Right because you have
friends that have been

98
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,371
working in the place for 15 months,

99
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,340
still haven't done anything.

100
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,280
- Exactly, like making coffee and like

101
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,717
printing things out for
their boss and that's it!

102
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:13,118
It's just incredible and like I say,

103
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:14,535
a year went past,

104
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:17,707
built the processes from the ground up.

105
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:18,827
I said to Jenna, look,

106
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:20,589
I don't actually think
I'm learning anymore,

107
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,380
I think I'm just following processes now.

108
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,891
And within a month I'm on grand tour,

109
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:26,203
and running like the biggest spend that

110
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:29,644
had, pretty much autonomously as well.

111
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,780
And that just, that I don't know

112
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,924
whatever happened anywhere else.

113
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,083
- Yeah I know.

114
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,260
- It's so good.

115
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,774
And that's the way you learn
and the way you develop

116
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:42,316
and as you say, I have
friends that go work in

117
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:43,645
finance or for other agencies

118
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:46,204
and they don't do anything
for two years, three years.

119
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:47,380
In two or three years

120
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,550
- The game changes.

121
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,383
- Exactly!

122
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:51,444
So much that's

123
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,476
- There's no substitute for doing.

124
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:54,309
- No.

125
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:55,142
Literally.

126
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:55,981
- I'd rather,

127
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:57,014
you know, the other thing,

128
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:58,518
the biggest mistake that business makers

129
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,836
business owners make,

130
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:02,684
or companies make is

131
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,213
when they don't let somebody do something

132
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:05,165
for two or three years,

133
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:06,621
they don't know if the person's good!

134
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,524
- Exactly.

135
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:09,052
- So you've paid for two or three years

136
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:09,885
(laughs)

137
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:10,718
you've not done anything productive

138
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:13,393
and then they get exposed
once they hit the field

139
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:14,721
- Yeah, exactly to the point.

140
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,825
- Just a bad strategy.

141
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:16,865
To me it's like,

142
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,313
it's offense versus defense.

143
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:19,897
For me the reason we
put you in that position

144
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:23,537
and everybody in that position is to

145
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:24,787
we believe, and

146
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,009
if unfortunately it doesn't work out,

147
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,409
quicker to learn, you know?

148
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:30,242
- Yeah.

149
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:32,194
- You're not gonna know
if you're good at skiing

150
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:33,609
by watching videos.

151
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,714
You're gonna learn by getting on there

152
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:36,777
and finding out.

153
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,444
- 100 percent, yeah.

154
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,354
- Yep, they're waiting inside.

155
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:41,187
- Thank you very much.

156
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:42,020
See you later.

157
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,103
- Take care.
- Thank you.

158
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:51,885
- [Man] Hello, Sebastian.

159
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:52,718
- Sebastian.

160
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:53,551
Real pleasure.

161
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:55,125
- Thanks.

162
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,758
- [Gary V] Yeah, where do you want me?

163
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:58,509
Let's go this way.

164
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,342
- Yeah so what's up, Gary?

165
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,175
How you doin'?

166
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,008
- Life is good.

167
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:01,841
- Man,

168
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:02,717
I've been following you since

169
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:03,829
two years back.

170
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,118
- Thank you.

171
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:06,278
- And, I mean, it's crazy when I

172
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:09,749
saw your style and the
vibe you sent out there,

173
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:12,509
to your audience and I just felt like,

174
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,216
this is the thing I need
to put some energy on.

175
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,283
- I appreciate it.

176
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,839
- I didn't know nothing about filming,

177
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,102
so I went out filming with my cell phone,

178
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:23,757
and client were buying my

179
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,924
- Films, clips

180
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,484
- Basically.

181
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:28,317
- Love it.

182
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,150
- And I got into this,

183
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,434
selling content for companies.

184
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,267
- Yes.

185
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,138
- So I've been working for two years,

186
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:34,658
got a little bit bigger camera

187
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:35,922
- Yes.

188
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:37,818
- Got some people around me that's gonna

189
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:38,796
potentially be

190
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,499
- Surround yourself
with good looking people

191
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:41,722
- Good
- Smart, smart strategy.

192
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:43,218
- They're better than me.

193
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,051
- I get it.

194
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,234
- I mean it's thanks to you, man.

195
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:46,121
Honestly.
- That makes me

196
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:46,954
very happy, brother.

197
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,946
I was the seed but you nurtured it, right?

198
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:51,330
- Yeah.

199
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,234
- So when people are like,

200
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,218
you did it, thanks to you,

201
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:55,051
I'm like,

202
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:55,884
I'm doing it for everybody!

203
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:57,827
I'm doing it for the culture

204
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:58,660
for the community.

205
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,689
I'm doing it.

206
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,836
But the people that grab it
and do something about it,

207
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:03,731
you know?

208
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,626
I'm just creating the conversation.

209
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,738
I'm forcing the conversation.

210
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:09,971
And the way I do it,

211
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,554
down people's throats.

212
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,505
But I'm fascinated by the people that

213
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:15,946
listen and watch, and are like, yeah.

214
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:17,474
Listen and watch and say (bleep) you,

215
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:18,930
(bleep) him.

216
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,346
But most importantly,
listen and watch and then

217
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,114
go do something.

218
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,410
That's the more interesting part.

219
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,882
And the reason I talk
so much about patience

220
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,906
is a lot of people watch me,

221
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:32,458
start something, and then
give up 10 days later.

222
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,291
10 days.

223
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:35,306
Silly.

224
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:37,026
I think the next step is to

225
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:40,569
not overly think about the next step.

226
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,298
You know like those cliche things like

227
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:43,540
if you want to get on top of the mountain,

228
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,938
it's like one step at a time.

229
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,922
I believe in that (bleep).

230
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,306
I think the biggest thing
that cripples a guy like you

231
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:50,884
two years in, starting to build something,

232
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:54,594
you get a little taste
and you want more, right?

233
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,609
That's always a dangerous part.

234
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:00,138
I'm very scared, usually
at year two, three, four

235
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,138
of a little bit of momentum.

236
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,834
That's where a lot of
people try to go too fast

237
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,453
and break the whole thing,

238
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:09,308
get a little fancy, get
either content or too hungry.

239
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:11,429
It's about staying in the middle.

240
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:12,933
And remembering what got you there.

241
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,878
I mean, look.

242
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,661
I'm a great example of it.

243
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,366
I always want people
to watch me carefully,

244
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:21,509
like I'm winning, I've gotten fancy,

245
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,759
and I'm getting less fancy.

246
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,018
You know, as good things
are happening for me,

247
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:30,456
I'm trying to go more tried and true.

248
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:33,328
As the light gleams,
I'm trying go more into

249
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,574
being an operator.

250
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:35,726
I'm gonna speak less next year,

251
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:36,766
I'm gonna operate more,

252
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:39,270
I'm gonna do more HR and see my people.

253
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,086
I think it's just important to,

254
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,150
I don't think about what's next.

255
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,590
Ever.

256
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,022
Like, of course I'm thinking every day

257
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,430
about what I want to do that's going to

258
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,902
help me win.

259
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:53,758
But I don't think of it as next.

260
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:55,526
I think people look at it, like,

261
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:56,423
you know?

262
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:58,590
And I just look at it like

263
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:03,823
And so, I think the best
way to have something happen

264
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:06,750
that's going to bring you value is

265
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,142
remembering what got you there.

266
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:11,422
What got you to where you are right now

267
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:12,642
is you got motivated.

268
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,462
You took a camera from your phone and

269
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,686
you started doing (bleep) and then

270
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:17,934
good (bleep) started happening

271
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:21,113
and I think a lot of
people start overthinking.

272
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:22,470
And putting too much
pressure on themselves

273
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,803
for what's next.

274
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:27,846
I see a lot of companies
and people go from

275
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,326
zero to a million dollars,

276
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:32,134
and then stick at a million
for five or six years

277
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,038
and they beat themselves up.

278
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:36,736
And I always remind them
that that's incredible,

279
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:40,486
but more importantly, I try to remind them

280
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,569
that the reason you're not growing is

281
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:48,039
you changed when you got
from zero to a million.

282
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,566
Got it?

283
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:50,399
- Yeah.

284
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,062
- And so, for me,

285
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:56,126
as I get more fame and
recognition and opportunity,

286
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:58,518
I'm tripling down on humility

287
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,230
and patience.

288
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,910
I think the guy or girl
that has my position

289
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,142
is always in the best position.

290
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:07,862
I think when you're selling something new,

291
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:10,339
it's less early bird gets the worm

292
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,098
and it's more second
mouse gets the cheese.

293
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,054
- Wow.

294
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,358
- There's a lot of people that

295
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:17,078
don't want to work with us,

296
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,454
because I'm the one that most upset them.

297
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,814
And it's the second or third.

298
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:22,647
- Wow.

299
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:23,480
- Yeah!

300
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,313
- I can imagine.

301
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,146
- Yeah.

302
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,653
- How do you do that then,
how do you even know?

303
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,912
- I mean,

304
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:29,904
I get enough for what
I'm looking for, right?

305
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:30,996
- Yeah.

306
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:32,606
- You know, it's all relative, right?

307
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,995
- How do you transcend

308
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:37,275
with your platform,

309
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,616
you create a lot of

310
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:41,129
leads, obviously.

311
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:41,962
- Yes.

312
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:43,714
- How do you convert them?

313
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:45,337
- By running an actual good business.

314
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:46,241
- Yeah.

315
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,122
- You know?

316
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:47,955
Bye.

317
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:48,930
- [Man] Wanna get a selfie?

318
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,763
- Yes of course.

319
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:50,596
Of course.

320
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:52,983
- Thanks man.

321
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:53,837
- I wish you well.

322
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:54,670
- I'll email you then.

323
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,503
- Please.

324
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:56,336
- Yeah.

325
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:57,169
We'll come and visit you.

326
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,002
- That'd be very nice.

327
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:58,835
The basketball team?

328
00:09:58,835 --> 00:09:59,668
I'm a real fan.

329
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:00,809
'Cause they haven't won yet!

330
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,374
- I probably watch the Rangers

331
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:03,530
more than you watch the Rangers.

332
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,863
- Yeah, I bet at this point.

333
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:08,923
Babin!

334
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:09,756
Babin, this is it!

335
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:11,923
This is, you've been waiting for this,

336
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:14,590
why don't you go take a picture?

337
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:17,178
This horse lamp is

338
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:18,011
hi everybody!

339
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:18,844
(bell ding)

340
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:19,677
Give Babin some love!

341
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:24,661
(multiple bell dings)
Little more, good!

342
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:25,898
- [Woman] We will take

343
00:10:25,898 --> 00:10:27,091
approximately over there

344
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:28,699
approximately 25 minutes of your time.

345
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:29,659
- [Gary] No problem.

346
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,659
I don't think this is as generational

347
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:32,499
as people think.

348
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:36,821
I think this is more psychology than it is

349
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:39,117
none of the four people
sitting in this room,

350
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:41,182
Babin's young, but the
three of, you're pretty

351
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,245
how old are you?

352
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:43,078
- 35.

353
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:43,911
- Yeah

354
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,540
- [Woman] Gary's talking
to our sound engineer.

355
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,373
- That's right.

356
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:48,716
I bring everybody into these podcasts,

357
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,500
I like to break the walls
and visualize for you

358
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,578
everybody who's listening.

359
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:52,411
Look,

360
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,410
the three of us didn't,

361
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,842
35, you know,

362
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:56,851
it's not about how old you are,

363
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:58,858
I'm 42 and I feel more curious

364
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,594
and more understanding of
the culture and the game

365
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,976
than plenty of people that are 18.

366
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:06,666
I think it's a mindset.

367
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,674
And so, it's a very
interesting time to be alive.

368
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:12,859
There's so much opportunity and

369
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,586
I'm excited to be a part of it.

370
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:17,284
I only want one thing
for people that I have.

371
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,611
Really, outside of health,

372
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,434
the only thing I wish for people is them

373
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:24,034
to love what they do as much as I do.

374
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:27,290
When I do new podcasts or new video shows,

375
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,146
I love reading the
comments of the audience

376
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,554
that don't know me.

377
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:31,506
Inevitably,

378
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:33,266
five percent of the audience

379
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:36,197
will leave a comment that refers to

380
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,030
drugs.

381
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,067
If they want to be really snarky,

382
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,028
they'll say I, you know,

383
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:42,445
cocaine, ritalin,

384
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:47,376
they think that I'm on something.

385
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:51,362
And I always reply because

386
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,977
I've never tried smoking a cigarette,

387
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,977
let alone done adderral.

388
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,289
I reply with

389
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:01,130
so they'll say, cocaine.

390
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,963
I'll reply, gratitude.

391
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:07,225
I'm so grateful that I
do what I love everyday,

392
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:08,633
and what I love for clarification is

393
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,380
just being an entrepreneur!

394
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,637
Playing.

395
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:15,441
The challenges, the risk, the excitement.

396
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:17,481
- [Woman] But you're also
high on your own energy.

397
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,697
You have tremendous energy.

398
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,466
- I have tremendous energy
because it builds momentum.

399
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,209
When you're doing what
you want to be doing

400
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,601
for a long period of time,

401
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,497
it builds momentum.

402
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,395
I didn't have this same energy in school.

403
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:29,540
I hated school.

404
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,524
I was optimistic, I was high energy

405
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:32,852
that's my DNA.

406
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,444
But not like this, this is now a supernova

407
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:38,628
because now I'm 20 years
into being in my zone.

408
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:42,356
The breath of fresh air, the exhale

409
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:44,565
I had on the first day that I worked

410
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,170
at my dad's liquor store,

411
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,082
like worked,

412
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,099
there was no more school ever again.

413
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:50,002
That

414
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,539
(exhales)

415
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,995
was incredible.

416
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:54,050
Just posted something on Instagram,

417
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,371
For The Mindset.

418
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:58,120
I'm getting more and more
intrigued by mindset.

419
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,705
Because I used to think of it as fluffy,

420
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:00,861
like self help.

421
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:03,354
And now I think of it more as strategy.

422
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:05,297
What's your strategy in life?

423
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:07,345
Somebody asked me,

424
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,346
on Instagram after I posted this,

425
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:10,412
Gary, if the mindset has been skewed,

426
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:11,937
how can you bring it back?

427
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,033
And I answered with

428
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,927
by surrounding yourself with people who

429
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,289
have the mindset you aspire to.

430
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:19,521
My friends, please understand that

431
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:21,305
mindset is controllable

432
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:23,874
in the same way that all our
opinions are controllable.

433
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:27,233
The key is to add more
people with optimism,

434
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:30,232
and cut people with negativity.

435
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:31,963
It's very, very simple.

436
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:34,714
Now it's very hard to cut
people with pessimism,

437
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,818
cynicism, and negativity

438
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:38,841
when they are the people
that are the closest to you.

439
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:41,777
Parents, siblings, spouse.

440
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,329
But the bottom line is,

441
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:44,747
if you're asking the question,

442
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:45,969
I'm gonna give you the answer.

443
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:49,641
The answer is, add more people
with positivity and optimism,

444
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:52,634
and cut people with
pessimism and cynicism.

445
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:54,857
Who you surround yourself matters.

446
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:57,417
What content you consume matters.

447
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,921
I basically suffocate myself

448
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,993
for a long period of my time

449
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:04,451
and created an environment
that was based on

450
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,787
offense and optimism,

451
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:07,411
and now I know no different.

452
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:08,969
Please do the same for you.

453
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,241
Make that move.

454
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:12,265
Mold, and I mean mold

455
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,889
your mindset by what you consume

456
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,306
and with whom you consume it.

457
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:19,366
- [Man] Julien, nice to meet you Gary!

458
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:20,262
- Good to see you.

459
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:21,462
- Nice to meet you, man.

460
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:22,295
- Such a pleasure.

461
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,222
How are you guys?

462
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:24,375
- Just fine, how about you?

463
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,208
- Hey nice to meet you, Gary.

464
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,041
- How are you?

465
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,094
- First of all, I am so inspired by

466
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:31,473
your whole career, everything you've done,

467
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,608
and your social work as well.

468
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:35,714
How do you do to stay in shape?

469
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:36,792
- Mentally or physically?

470
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,112
- Physically.

471
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,455
- Physically I travel with a trainer.

472
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:41,288
- Yeah.

473
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:42,921
- Which was a huge commitment I made.

474
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:45,088
And I try to watch what I eat

475
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:46,743
but I work out every single day.

476
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:47,904
- Yeah.
- Seven days a week

477
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:48,928
I'm in a gym.

478
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,153
- That's amazing.

479
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:51,577
Because I actually saw before

480
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:54,060
I saw you had something
in your back pocket.

481
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,943
It's a donut!
(laughs)

482
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:56,776
- I love it.

483
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:57,609
- Hey man.

484
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:58,725
- I eat those too.

485
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,325
(laughs)
But that just makes me work

486
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,353
for an extra 20 minutes.

487
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:02,186
- Yeah!

488
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,019
- I love it.

489
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:03,852
- But it's funny because they

490
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:04,685
actually showing up whenever

491
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:05,754
- Yes.

492
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:06,617
In my armpit too.

493
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:07,929
Yes.

494
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,857
- If you hold your hand like that,

495
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:10,737
and we have two of them,

496
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:12,097
so I take

497
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:13,946
one of the donuts in my hand

498
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,001
and you squeeze this one
really tight in your hand.

499
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:16,834
- Okay.

500
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,227
- And then I take this one invisibly,

501
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,083
and I place it back into your hand.

502
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:21,916
Did you felt anything?

503
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:22,923
(laughs)

504
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:23,947
- I'm gonna have two donuts, aren't I?

505
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,043
(laughs)

506
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:26,307
Jesus.

507
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:28,459
- If I pull out one, two

508
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:29,819
how many do you have left?

509
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:31,581
- I'm supposed to have two.

510
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:32,827
But I have a funny feeling I don't.

511
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:34,189
(laughs)

512
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:35,515
- Open your hand, like bam!

513
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:36,348
- Yeah.

514
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:37,181
I have a lot,

515
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,014
I have a lot of donuts.

516
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:38,847
(laughs)

517
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:39,680
- That's crazy.

518
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,430
- Crazy, right?

519
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,722
What do you think, Mom?

520
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,282
- [Woman] Yeah I think

521
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:46,803
you know they are so,

522
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,914
when you do something

523
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:49,842
- They're all in.

524
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,498
- [Woman] Yeah, they're all in.

525
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:52,979
Sometimes too much.

526
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:53,812
- Yeah.

527
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,130
I understand.

528
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,914
You know, honestly, honestly,

529
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,594
honestly that's an
interesting observation.

530
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:02,290
I really think, to be successful,

531
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,250
it has to be sometimes too much.

532
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,083
- Yeah.

533
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,626
- To be successful when
everybody else wants it too,

534
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:09,435
it has to be 110 percent

535
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,873
- Yeah
- Not 97.

536
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:13,386
And everybody wants to be 97

537
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,219
- Yeah

538
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,195
- And what people don't realize is

539
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:17,514
I don't even think it takes 100.

540
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:18,722
I think it's 102.

541
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:19,654
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

542
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:21,803
- I dream strategy.

543
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:23,218
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

544
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,210
- Gary you work about

545
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,233
14, 15 hours everyday.

546
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,854
- I believe it, man.

547
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,834
- You know the deal.

548
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:32,481
- Working on new ideas, different things,

549
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:33,855
creating content, everything.

550
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:35,009
Behind the screen or in front of it.

551
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,151
I get it!

552
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:37,200
It's such an interesting,

553
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,871
and I remember Maradona in '86

554
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:41,015
with the punch.

555
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:42,079
The fist, yeah.

556
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,367
I watched that game, and so there's things

557
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,543
I've always remembered

558
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,991
and '94 World Cup was in the U.S.

559
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:46,951
But my soccer

560
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:48,687
I'm setting up for the vlog that

561
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:49,727
my soccer skills
(laughs)

562
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:51,599
are (bleep), zero.

563
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:52,432
(laughs)

564
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:53,265
Double zero.

565
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:55,064
But I'm competitive as (bleep)

566
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,351
and I'm trying,

567
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:57,383
I'm basically trying to mentally will

568
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,727
a miracle right now.

569
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,559
- So basically the goal is to get the ball

570
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,751
between the legs

571
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:02,584
if you do that

572
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:03,703
- Of who, of the other person?

573
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:04,857
- We would try to do it to you,

574
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,523
and you would try to do it to us.

575
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:07,356
- Play like one against one

576
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:08,190
- Understood.

577
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,961
Alright let's go, let's
make a circle real quick.

578
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:11,794
Okay.

579
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:12,627
- Perfect.

580
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:13,958
(hip hop music)

581
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,829
- Wait a minute, wouldn't
it be better for me to

582
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,318
have the bigger bag?

583
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,006
- Three goals to win the game

584
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:20,469
or a nutmeg that is direct

585
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:21,301
okay?

586
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:22,844
- Oh a nutmeg is a direct win?

587
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:24,345
- Yes, direct win.

588
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,934
(claps)

589
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:30,715
- Strategy.

590
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:31,548
- I have a strategy!

591
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:33,923
I'm not getting nutmegged
on the first (bleep) minute.

592
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,043
(laughs)

593
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:36,315
Alright, one, nothing.

594
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:39,065
(group exclaims)

595
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:41,387
Be careful!

596
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:42,443
Be careful!

597
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:46,026
I'm already feeling
extremely accomplished.

598
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:48,820
- Ooh!

599
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,372
Wooo!

600
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:52,205
(claps)

601
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,468
- Oh, he nutmegged me!

602
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:55,551
(laughs)

603
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:00,252
I didn't even realize I lost!

604
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,454
- That was amazing, man.

605
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:02,287
Thank you.

606
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:04,602
My other twin.

607
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:05,978
- Great.

608
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:07,722
Super pissed about the nutmeg.

609
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:09,440
I didn't even realize I lost!

610
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,523
(laughs)

611
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:18,269
- Great game, great game.

612
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,050
- Thank you so much.
- We couldn't get it better.

613
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,388
- Yes.

614
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:24,225
Okay.

615
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:26,392
I'll catch you guys later.

616
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:29,227
S'up?

617
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,369
Very excited to be here.

618
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,025
You have to understand
what we're living through.

619
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,961
We're living through a race.

620
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,369
We're about to run a marathon

621
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:38,473
in technology.

622
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:40,610
Technology will eat up every aspect of

623
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,282
everything, always and forever.

624
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:43,857
It's how it works.

625
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,673
The bookstores were first,

626
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:48,297
then it was people who
owned taxi services,

627
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:50,593
then there's the hotel
industry with Airbnb.

628
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:51,729
But it will keep going.

629
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,809
The biggest TV networks in the world

630
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:54,820
now that there's OTT,

631
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,010
this will keep going, everything.

632
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,553
Just 'cause you have
big contracts with the

633
00:18:58,553 --> 00:18:59,641
biggest companies in the world,

634
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,969
what's the contract worth,

635
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:03,668
when that company's not alive?

636
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,131
This is real.

637
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:07,195
And so we're about to run a marathon.

638
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:09,187
And the reason I stress on you to be

639
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:10,265
good at that

640
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,248
is not because I think that's the

641
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:12,520
end all be all.

642
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,711
But you have no chance
to be good at AR and VR

643
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:17,543
and machine learning and cryptocurrency

644
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,327
and everything else that's coming next,

645
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:21,264
if you did not ground yourself in this.

646
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:24,114
You can't run a 40 mile marathon right now

647
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,079
on the spot,

648
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,339
if you haven't been on the treadmill

649
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,415
for the last six months

650
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,631
and running little mini races to prepare.

651
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:31,687
And if you are not adapting this

652
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,743
psychologically, first,

653
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:35,375
religion, first,

654
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,136
and then becoming a practitioner,

655
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:40,023
you need to be the architect,
the general contractor,

656
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:41,727
and the plumber.

657
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:45,159
Because if you don't, you will lose.

658
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:45,992
And so

659
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:46,991
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

660
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:50,078
- Just based of your stuff, right?

661
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:52,030
Started live streaming myself

662
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,070
making a hip hop demo every single day,

663
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,102
because that's what I'm into.

664
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:56,489
So, I'm on Twitch now.

665
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:57,322
- Yes!

666
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,764
- Build that up over the last month,

667
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,766
I was like (bleep),

668
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,166
no one's doing that much in the creative

669
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,288
in the music section right now.

670
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,361
Why don't I lead that up?

671
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,194
So I've been doing that,

672
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:08,622
I've seen baby steps even for
a small artist like me, right?

673
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:10,615
One month from starting,

674
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:12,718
I see Soundcloud plays
every single day now,

675
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,793
go from 10 to 20, 100, 150,

676
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:15,984
climbing up, so

677
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:17,278
just want to say thanks

678
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:18,462
give you a hug.
- Yeah brother.

679
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:19,582
- Really appreciate everything you do.

680
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:20,999
- Thank you, man.

681
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,283
Is that right?

682
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:29,116
- Yes it's true!
- Get outta town!

683
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:31,589
Get outta town, you knew this?

684
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:32,901
(laughs)

685
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,453
Ah dude, this is amazing!

686
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,397
It's such a pleasure

687
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:37,230
- Thank you so much
- Welcome to Sweden!

688
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,949
- Such a pleasure

689
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:39,852
- It's a pleasure

690
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:40,956
having you here.
- So fantastic!

691
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,460
- We couldn't miss it
when you were in town.

692
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,757
- I'm so glad you guys came.

693
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:45,597
- Yes, thank you so much
for everything you done

694
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:47,276
so much appreciated
- Thank you, thank you.

695
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:49,652
He's a very special kid.

696
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:50,485
- Yeah

697
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:51,388
he really is.
- He really is.

698
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:52,461
He really is.

699
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:53,294
That's amazing!

700
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,945
- I'm sorry you have this
weather and everything

701
00:20:54,945 --> 00:20:55,808
- Nah it's fine

702
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:56,856
- You've been here before.

703
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:57,779
- I've been here before, yeah

704
00:20:57,779 --> 00:20:58,612
I've been here before.

705
00:20:58,612 --> 00:20:59,445
- So then you know

706
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:00,278
- I am so glad you guys are here.

707
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:01,111
(laughs)
This is such a

708
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,128
pleasure for me.

709
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,032
Dunk, look who I found!

710
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:05,008
(laughs)

711
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,537
The family is finally together!

712
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:07,721
(laughs)

713
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:10,388
(hip hop music)

714
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,169
I can do this.

715
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:15,002
I got that!

716
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:17,085
(laughs)

717
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:23,496
That was symbolic!

718
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:24,600
That was super symbolic

719
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,517
I felt good about that.

720
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:29,813
There was literally
something about that scene

721
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:31,885
that was so perfect for me.

722
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:34,052
Me through you stuck, yes.

723
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,845
She was very senior in this market.

724
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:43,042
- Thank you Gary for the invitation.

725
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:45,936
- Yeah of course, great to see you.

726
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,174
The fact that I would have
time to look at something

727
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,462
and think about the bad?

728
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:51,302
I mean, I don't have time

729
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:54,553
I don't have time to celebrate

730
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:57,502
my good friends doing good.

731
00:21:57,502 --> 00:21:59,934
The (bleep) am I doing
spending time trying to

732
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,638
drag somebody?

733
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:04,134
It's such a bad life,

734
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:06,415
that I now when I read

735
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:09,755
his daddy helped him, he sucks,

736
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:11,178
cocky, ass,

737
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:12,162
I feel bad!

738
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:13,075
I'm like, that's

739
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:15,777
you're using that as the energy
of the output of your life?

740
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:17,897
You have absolutely lost!

741
00:22:17,897 --> 00:22:19,138
And the other thing and I apologize,

742
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,305
the truth wins at the end!

743
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,099
I mean, I did a sneaker.

744
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:27,044
I got killed behind the scenes.

745
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:29,899
He thinks he's a big shot, nobody's gonna

746
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:32,106
who the (bleep)'s gonna buy a sneaker?

747
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:34,515
K-Swiss, who gives a (bleep)?

748
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:36,506
Gary Vee, what does he think he's famous?

749
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:39,365
Until my sneakers sold out!

750
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:40,627
In a day!

751
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:41,460
Then what?

752
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,614
The truth is gonna win.

753
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,947
Either they're right, or you're right.

754
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:48,011
But you're too important to

755
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:50,322
spend a (bleep)ing minute on them.

756
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:52,489
The five percent of people

757
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,096
that you actually need
to win with, mentally

758
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:59,179
never believe that stuff.

759
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,187
- [Man] The five percent only?

760
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:03,284
- The five percent of people that

761
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:06,012
you need to win with in the world

762
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:08,860
are not paying attention to a headline in

763
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,277
Business Insider.

764
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:13,148
I started realizing, it started

765
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:14,363
you know what started happening?

766
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,980
I started getting more trolls,

767
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,897
but more Warren Buffett

768
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:22,027
and The Rock, winners.

769
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:23,829
And I said, wait a minute.

770
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:24,819
If that's happening

771
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:27,516
at the end of the day
it's gonna be the results.

772
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:29,227
At the end of the day
it's gonna be the results.

773
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:30,148
Nothing else.

774
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:31,285
Nothing else!

775
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,429
So to me,

776
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:34,287
just 'cause people are booing your team

777
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,824
when you're losing in the second quarter

778
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:37,221
down by 10,

779
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:41,706
as long as you win the
game at the end, you win.

780
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:42,539
- [Man] This is good.

781
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:43,372
- Good.

782
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:44,205
- [Man] This is karma.

783
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:45,805
- I know!

784
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:47,711
My man, you're gonna fuckin',

785
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:49,341
listen here's the best part,

786
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:50,279
I know!

787
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,112
You're good!

788
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:52,587
(laughs)
It makes me so happy, man.

789
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:53,690
Look,

790
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,434
my whole life has been that.

791
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,330
I got made fun of for launching a website

792
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,081
instead of a second liquor store,

793
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:01,194
I got made fun of for
doing a YouTube show,

794
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:03,210
I got made fun of a lot for investing in

795
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,444
Facebook and Twitter,

796
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,658
2007.

797
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:07,910
My financial advisors were upset!

798
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,050
This is stupid.

799
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,426
What if it goes to zero?

800
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:11,820
I'm like, but what if it doesn't?

801
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,914
(laughs)

802
00:24:12,914 --> 00:24:14,682
Everybody's on the defense, my man.

803
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:16,762
You've done something!

804
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:19,364
The fuck have they done?

805
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:20,197
Yeah man.

806
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:21,850
And more importantly, merit will

807
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,980
and by the way it's not
that you and I are cool,

808
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,578
we may be wrong!

809
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,514
They may be right!

810
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:30,402
But when they're writing from the stands

811
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,506
they have to wait for the game to end.

812
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:33,442
I mean look,

813
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:36,139
if somebody came along and tweaked the MLM

814
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,628
network marketing model,

815
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:39,699
and made it cleaner and less bullshit,

816
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:41,746
it's real, by the way it happened.

817
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,499
It's called Seamless and Uber.

818
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,514
Like affiliate, it works.

819
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:47,611
Incentivized works.

820
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,090
You can make anybody do anything if you

821
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,082
incentivize.

822
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:54,489
I can get everybody naked here right now.

823
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:55,338
Hundred percent.

824
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,516
Babin, what's your price?

825
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:58,337
No (bleep), now be careful,

826
00:24:58,337 --> 00:24:59,639
I'll tell you why.

827
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:00,563
- [Man] When you put it in cash,

828
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:01,396
that's a big difference

829
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:03,601
- I agree, I agree.

830
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,434
Watch

831
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:05,311
But wait a minute,

832
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:06,349
I'll Venmo you.

833
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:09,454
I want you to get butt
naked right here right now.

834
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:10,306
(laughs)

835
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:11,836
Let's play this out for a second.

836
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:14,537
In theory, what do you think?

837
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:16,161
How much?

838
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,477
Like you agree that I can
get you butt naked, right?

839
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:19,310
- [Babin] For sure.

840
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,143
- Okay.

841
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,697
- [Babin] So immediately
like 10K popped in my head

842
00:25:21,697 --> 00:25:22,913
but then I was like,

843
00:25:22,913 --> 00:25:23,817
Venmo

844
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:24,650
I just don't know.

845
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,977
- Right, so let's play!

846
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:28,060
(laughs)

847
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:34,025
How much money do you think
it would cost right now

848
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:35,721
for you to literally go right there

849
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,769
literally right there right now,

850
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,081
and get butt naked?

851
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,017
What do you think?

852
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:40,921
Like, seriously.

853
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,617
And be careful 'cause I'm in a weird mood.

854
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:45,329
And I'm looking to get 10 million views

855
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:46,662
on this episode.

856
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,233
What do you think?

857
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,265
- [Man] Are you a Swede?

858
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:51,098
- [Babin] Nah

859
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:52,529
- He's from Pensacola.

860
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,546
- [Man] You don't know anybody.

861
00:25:53,546 --> 00:25:54,437
- [Babin] 20.

862
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:55,270
- 20

863
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,353
(laughs)

864
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:01,103
- [Man] And then you
should do like Gary do

865
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,647
- I swear on my kids I
might pay you the number

866
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,823
so I need you to really be careful.

867
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:07,942
And really, because
this is where you could

868
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,287
lose all the equity if you go back on it.

869
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:13,680
What do you think it would cost

870
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,240
for you to get 100 percent
naked right here right now?

871
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,903
What do you think?

872
00:26:18,903 --> 00:26:21,919
I'm trying to think for myself.

873
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,698
How much would it cost
you to shave your head?

874
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:26,162
No no, shave the head.

875
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:26,995
Shave your head

876
00:26:26,995 --> 00:26:30,647
That's an interesting one, you're fine.

877
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:32,183
What about for you?

878
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:33,514
- I'm cheap.

879
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:34,347
- How much?

880
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:35,180
- I've done it.

881
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,013
- So how much?

882
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,103
- I don't know, a hundred bucks?

883
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,047
- I'll pay that right now.

884
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:39,167
(laughs)

885
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,000
Let's shave his head,

886
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,962
a hundred dollars.

887
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:42,415
Right now, right now.

888
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:43,881
Let's shave his head.

889
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:45,704
How do we get, like

890
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,711
Can you go into

891
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:47,871
is there a razor in your

892
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:48,704
you in?

893
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:50,463
- Hey I'm game.

894
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:51,903
It's Finland, I'll do it for Finland.

895
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:54,423
- For Finland's hundredth birthday

896
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:55,778
(laughs)

897
00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:57,111
This is amazing.

898
00:26:57,111 --> 00:26:58,600
- I'll pay you 100 if you shave

899
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,263
- I'm paying you a 100
dollars, that's done.

900
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:03,296
But now, they have a razor

901
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,503
Babin, get on it.

902
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:07,447
(laughs)

903
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:08,280
- [Man] Bring the camera

904
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,507
- Leave this, leave this right here

905
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,424
there's gotta be either

906
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,289
it's either in our hotel room,

907
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:16,945
go downstairs and find
out if they can give us

908
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:18,377
shaving cream

909
00:27:18,377 --> 00:27:20,521
because I want it to be good for him.

910
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:21,561
Doing this, 100 percent

911
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:23,529
Vlog, we're shaving his head, 100 dollars.

912
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:25,649
(laughs)

913
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:27,001
Babin, record yourself

914
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:28,481
- [Babin] I'll vlog on my phone

915
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,721
- Even better.

916
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:31,804
(laughs)

917
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:39,797
- So a few minutes ago, Gary
asked me how much it would cost

918
00:27:39,797 --> 00:27:41,676
me to get naked in the middle of the bar.

919
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:43,044
I said $25,000.

920
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:47,211
He then asked everyone how
much to shave their head.

921
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:50,769
The guy next to me said 100 bucks.

922
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,825
Gary told me to go out and buy a razor.

923
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:55,587
I have a really weird question.

924
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:57,859
Is there like a pharmacy or
anything open around here

925
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:02,565
that I can get clippers to
cut someone's hair with?

926
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:04,278
- [Female] We have a 24 hour pharmacy.

927
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:05,935
- Okay.

928
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,679
- [Female] So if you
go between those houses

929
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,230
- I just want to say that
if I was in New York,

930
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,775
this would have been handled
in about six minutes.

931
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,046
But because I'm in Stockholm,

932
00:28:14,046 --> 00:28:16,879
everything closes at, like, seven!

933
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,103
Which is providing a
little bit more difficult

934
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:27,960
- Hi.

935
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,168
- [Male] How's it going?

936
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:31,111
- Do you guys have razors?

937
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:33,332
Like in theory I needed
to cut my hair off?

938
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:34,500
- [Male] No

939
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,012
- Would there be anywhere around here that

940
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:39,004
would have that, at this time?

941
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:39,940
- [Male] No.

942
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,012
- Alright, thank you.

943
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,337
Alright, I guess we're adding another L

944
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,524
in Babin's column.

945
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,388
Now I have to go tell
Gary I couldn't find it.

946
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:51,020
(laughs)

947
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,758
Not gonna go over well.

948
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,276
Which means I might end up having to

949
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:55,596
take all my clothes off

950
00:28:55,596 --> 00:28:57,324
in the middle of the bar.

951
00:28:57,324 --> 00:28:58,157
- [Gary] Ready?

952
00:28:58,157 --> 00:29:01,074
Vlog, very upset, Babin has failed.

953
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:04,271
Lev one, Babin zero.

954
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,484
You're very fortunate or unfortunate.

955
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:09,317
- I'm fortunate.

956
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:10,404
I want to do it for Finland, you know.

957
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:12,692
100, 100, boom.
- Yes.

958
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:14,492
We should shave 100 in his head.

959
00:29:14,492 --> 00:00:00,000
(rock/soul music)
