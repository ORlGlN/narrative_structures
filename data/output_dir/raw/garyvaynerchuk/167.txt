1
00:00:00,386 --> 00:00:02,494
- Can you give me some light, you got it?

2
00:00:02,494 --> 00:00:05,117
All right, we got some
Pommery champagne here

3
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:08,313
in Amsterdam, we're leaving it

4
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:10,101
'cause we can't take it with customs.

5
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:11,480
So people just gotta find 'em.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,595
Somebody's just gonna get
some free champagne tonight.

7
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:17,547
Those bubbles though!

8
00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:20,547
â™« We're unstoppable

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,077
(atmospheric hip hop music)

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,671
- Literally the last fuckin'
seven emails in my inbox

11
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:57,459
are fake titles.

12
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,433
- [Man] Like "thank you so much?"

13
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,383
- Like "thank you,"

14
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:04,541
or like, I don't know,
the wine tweet I had,

15
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,981
like wine, "I really want wine."

16
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,072
"Can you review my app?"

17
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,603
Or like New York Jets thing,

18
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,739
like I'm just kidding, I
wanna get your attention,

19
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,993
can you give me four million dollars?

20
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:14,618
- [Man] That's the worst.

21
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:16,824
- I'm the last person
that shit's gonna work on.

22
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,534
Trying to teach.

23
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:20,447
- [Man] The cornerstone of what you teach,

24
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,515
like going against it.

25
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,061
- Yeah man you super
appreciate my hustles,

26
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,586
I trick you here, yeah.

27
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,281
I super appreciate it.

28
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:28,628
(all chuckle)
You got me, Rick.

29
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:30,346
I think you're amazing.

30
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:33,047
- [Man] Fuckin' Rick.
- Fuckin' asshole.

31
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:35,834
(all laugh)

32
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:39,584
- So here we are, it's
4:22 p.m. in Amsterdam

33
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:42,823
on the way to the conference.

34
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:43,845
Super excited about this.

35
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:45,795
Also, getting some texts
from my friend Harper

36
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:47,258
who I haven't seen in a long time

37
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:48,582
so I'm gonna try to connect with him.

38
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:51,275
A guy who I met when he was at Threadless,

39
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,086
do you remember Threadless,
the t-shirt site?

40
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:54,154
Best dude ever.

41
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:55,710
Got a quick phone call right now

42
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,709
with my Ruby Tuesdays client.

43
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,309
And then the keynote, the Q and A,

44
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:01,631
and then I get to depart
and I got a phone call

45
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:03,048
with a potential Vader Sports client.

46
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:05,686
And for the last four hours

47
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:07,297
I've been laying in the hotel

48
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:09,805
just doing a ton of VaynerMedia calls,

49
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:11,802
operations operations operations,

50
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:13,961
I'm sure Babben's got some b-roll.

51
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,392
Let's show it,

52
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:16,724
because I want them to see

53
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:19,259
the boredom of the operations.

54
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:22,676
(voices murmur on phone)

55
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,450
Sure.

56
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,797
Hi, sorry.

57
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:30,731
- I'm Esther.
- Thank you.

58
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:31,699
- No that's okay.

59
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,280
- I'll bring you back home.
- Thank you.

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,166
Can somebody tell me who's in the audience

61
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,984
so I can get a little bit of a sense?

62
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:38,817
Hey Rob.

63
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:39,650
- [Man] This is Rob, Rob, Gary.

64
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,483
- [Rob] Rob Ransom.

65
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:41,316
- Such a pleasure, how are you?

66
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:42,149
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you man.

67
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,124
- Thanks for coming all the way.

68
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:43,957
- Yeah, no worries, thrilled to be here.

69
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,641
- The other theme is
cross-cutting around technology,

70
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,799
that this is, the world's
moving fast, right?

71
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,587
And it's not just,

72
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,955
can you manage an AdWords
campaign anymore, right?

73
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,882
It's algorithmic stuff,

74
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,787
it's artificial intelligence,

75
00:02:56,787 --> 00:02:58,055
and there's a theme a little bit

76
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,403
which our interests, which you've guessed.

77
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:00,703
Hey, you need to partner with someone

78
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:01,980
'cause the world's moving way to fast

79
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,839
for a small hotel company.
- Makes sense.

80
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,325
YouTube, it's the calm before the storm.

81
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,492
Hey Brandon. Wine Library.

82
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,358
Hold one one second.

83
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:09,635
YouTube, it's the calm before the storm.

84
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:11,516
I'm about to go out here in Amsterdam

85
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,516
and destroy their faces.

86
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:17,530
Sorry, Brandon, how's it going today?

87
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,316
- [Announcer] So please
welcome to the Click stage,

88
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:23,381
join me in a big, warm round of applause

89
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,657
for Gary Vaynerchuk, thank you.

90
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:28,074
(drums beat)

91
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:30,428
- Hello.

92
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:32,685
(crowd applauds)

93
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:33,518
Thank you.

94
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,770
First of all, this is beautiful.

95
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,813
I'm thrilled to be in this amazing city.

96
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:42,507
I'm really, really happy
to be in front of you.

97
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,782
And I gave a lot of thought backstage

98
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:46,686
and on the flight out here last night

99
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,730
on what I wanted to address.

100
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,903
And it was interesting for me to think

101
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:54,206
about the theme that really drove me

102
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:56,230
during that thought process,

103
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,807
which is ironically a
pretty interesting word

104
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:01,083
which is "practicality."
- [Woman] Right.

105
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:01,916
- Instead of like,

106
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,349
instead of hyperbole in either direction,

107
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,996
like this is the great,
everything's changed,

108
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,248
or the other way, none
of it fuckin' matters,

109
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,338
the kind of cross-section of the two.

110
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:14,241
Like how do you sell a hotel room today?

111
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:17,329
Yeah, I agree with you, the
last 10 minutes is good right?

112
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,412
- [Man] Yeah, I think so.

113
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,416
Bring this over here,
'cause I've got a theme.

114
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,374
There's always that moment

115
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:24,930
when there's finally
a little bit of trust,

116
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,950
once they realize that this
agency is really a proxy

117
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,482
for me to do something else

118
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:29,829
and I'm not just trying
to get their scope.

119
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,106
Once they get comfortable,

120
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:32,151
once we get comfortable,

121
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:34,937
every one of them starts to talk

122
00:04:34,937 --> 00:04:36,632
about all the things that they're doing

123
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:37,817
that they don't believe in.

124
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,907
And let me leave you with this

125
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:43,072
because I've been watching a
lot of head-nods in this room.

126
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:45,766
It is far more fun to die on your sword

127
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,879
than to die on someone else's.

128
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,365
I'm inspired, YouTube,

129
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,199
we're gonna make this the episode thing,

130
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,551
you'll get whatever you want, Tyler,

131
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:53,498
but this is the fucking core of it.

132
00:04:53,498 --> 00:04:54,891
You just saw it on stage.

133
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:55,878
(phone rings)

134
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,711
- Oh sorry.

135
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,212
You just saw it on stage.

136
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:01,300
Dying on your sword is better
than dying on someone else's.

137
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,876
So many of you are doing
things, making decisions

138
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,385
and navigating your lives

139
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,452
based on somebody else's thesis;

140
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:11,308
you're doing it because you
think it's the right thing,

141
00:05:11,308 --> 00:05:12,933
because your dad's telling
you it's the right thing,

142
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:15,028
you're doing what you're doing right now

143
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,439
'cause you're pandering to your boss

144
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,740
even though you don't believe in it.

145
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,458
This is how it's gonna play out.

146
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,151
You are doing things, right now.

147
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,497
Yesterday you made a decision
that you don't believe in.

148
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:26,308
But you're smart, you did it

149
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,281
because you know how your company scores.

150
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:30,534
Here's the problem with
disruption in innovation.

151
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:34,226
Right now, you're being
rewarded for being a yes-person.

152
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:35,874
And in 36 months,

153
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,707
you're gonna be fired
for being a yes-person.

154
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:40,254
And you're doing it 'cause you just need

155
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,470
the security of your job.

156
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,887
I'm telling you, right the fuck now,

157
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,582
if you're watching this vlog

158
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:47,624
and you've got like, that
means you have a certain DNA,

159
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,017
please, I implore you,

160
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:51,826
please die on your sword,
not somebody else's.

161
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:54,288
If you're gonna lose, it's much more fun

162
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,029
to lose based on what you thought.

163
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:58,746
Do you know how many of you are gonna lose

164
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:01,022
on somebody else's thesis?

165
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:03,460
It's gonna kill at you,
it's gonna eat at you,

166
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,285
it's going to be the
worst fucking feeling,

167
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:07,314
so please, fuckin' pause
this video right now

168
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:09,752
and ask yourself, am I
doing my shit because of me?

169
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:11,563
Then you're good, whether
you're winning or losing.

170
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,398
Or am I doing it because somebody else

171
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:14,954
is telling me it's the right way?

172
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:17,624
Or, I'm subconsciously pandering

173
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,690
to please somebody or something

174
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,872
because I need the short-term stability?

175
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,381
Figure that the fuck out.

176
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,820
You know it, and I know it.

177
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,474
You just need to do something about it.

178
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:33,180
Thank you.
(audience applauds)

179
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,930
Thank you, thank you.

180
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,039
Thank you.

181
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:40,735
Sorry guys, YouTube, listen to this.

182
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,268
I put out a post about, you know,

183
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,033
stop blaming other people,
start blaming yourself.

184
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,378
I'm reading the comments right now.

185
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:47,516
It's super fascinating.

186
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:49,582
Of course, you know,

187
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:52,345
so my whole thing is like,
blame myself for everything.

188
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,062
Of course there's other
things that people are doing.

189
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:58,243
Right, like if somebody runs
me over with a car right now

190
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,242
and they were drunk,

191
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:01,053
is that my fault or is that their fault?

192
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,539
I get that you can
blame that other person.

193
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,951
I'm not so much worried about
the actuality of the event,

194
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,762
I'm talking about the fucking mindset.

195
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,270
Tyler, when are people gonna understand

196
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,431
this is the mindset,

197
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,265
the mindset of blaming yourself

198
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:15,937
allows you to do so much more

199
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,887
so when it's eight out of 10 times on you

200
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,581
you're moving forward
instead of looking backwards.

201
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:23,158
Sure, the two out of 10, but
if you just have that mindset

202
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:24,668
it's a winner mindset.

203
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:26,107
This is about mindset,

204
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:27,988
everybody's taking every
word I say so practical.

205
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:30,867
Yes, I understand that
there's issues in the world.

206
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,120
Like, it wasn't your
fault that an earthquake

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,490
like drilled your house.

208
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,626
I get it, it's the mindset.

209
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:38,274
To me I'd be like, man,

210
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:39,459
I shouldn't have lived
in fucking California.

211
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,731
I don't know, like, mindset.

212
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:43,383
It helps you eight out of 10 times

213
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:45,635
and the other two times you
just fuckin' deal with it.

214
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:47,284
Rant over.

215
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:49,002
What I wanted to do with this session

216
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,316
is mainly do Q and A,

217
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:54,033
as broad or as detailed
as you'd like to go.

218
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,751
I always find it funny,

219
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,563
luckily for me the world keeps changing

220
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:59,234
and the platforms keep changing

221
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:01,371
but the six or seven things I believe in

222
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,623
pretty much stay the same.

223
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,388
So in environments like this,

224
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,920
given that it's a smaller group,

225
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,522
I'd like to take the advantage

226
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,705
and I think you should be selfish

227
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:13,143
and go very narrow, 'cause I still think

228
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:15,117
30, 40, 50, 60% will share in that

229
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,044
and I think we have enough time here

230
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:18,530
to get to a lot of stuff.

231
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,806
So I'd like to open it up to Q and A

232
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:22,269
with anything that I referred to

233
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,242
or anything that you may have in your mind

234
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:25,519
that's overall digital.

235
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,889
The only time I've been really booed

236
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,837
was at South by Southwest 2010 I think,

237
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:33,066
when one of my opening lines was

238
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,866
"Jeff Bezos is much
better than Steve Jobs."

239
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:36,980
And I got booed.

240
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,335
Because I was such a fan of
the way he was navigating

241
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:41,773
and obviously he's
grown in so much stature

242
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:43,190
over the last couple years.

243
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,648
Alexa not only is gonna
be booking hotel rooms,

244
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,970
Alexa has the potential to kill Google.

245
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,467
Guys, one in every four searches on Google

246
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,884
is done by voice.

247
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,979
Excuse me, one in every
four searches on Google

248
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,628
in a mobile device is done by voice.

249
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,741
Notice how even the way I said it,

250
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:07,339
I don't even believe in
a desktop world anymore.

251
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,335
Yeah, you're damn right.

252
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:10,566
I mean, think about this,

253
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,609
back to what you were talking
about earlier, family,

254
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:15,976
let's play it out, families
having dinner, right,

255
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:18,205
talking about, where are
we gonna go this summer?

256
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:19,854
Right, blah blah blah?

257
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:22,328
Alexa, what's the, I mean,

258
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,893
the friction is zero.

259
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:26,867
Now, Google Home might win.

260
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:31,162
Google's biggest concern
in the world is Amazon.

261
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:34,343
Because the next search engine is voice,

262
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:35,843
and Alexa's ahead.

263
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:39,452
Can you give me some light, you got it?

264
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:41,843
All right, we've got some
Pommery champagne here

265
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:44,343
in Amsterdam, we're leaving it

266
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:46,580
'cause we can't take it with customs

267
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,043
so people just gotta find 'em.

268
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:51,619
Somebody's just gonna get
some free champagne tonight.

269
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:53,754
Those bubbles, though!

270
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:56,186
(restaurant patrons chatter)

271
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,230
What's up YouTube,

272
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,230
sitting here with Bavin.

273
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:03,012
I still think better D-Rock.

274
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:06,913
And Jordan, I think better than Mike.

275
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,623
(all laugh)

276
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:12,300
The 2.0s, anyway sitting here
in a restaurant in Amsterdam.

277
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,508
You know it's interesting,

278
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:15,481
I don't get a lot of
downtime on my trips, ever.

279
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,734
This is actually weird, this 20 minutes

280
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:20,450
sitting here and having a
beer or a protein shake.

281
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,783
Jordan's around.

282
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:25,861
And I'm enjoying it,

283
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,672
I'm gonna start trying to hack my culture,

284
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:29,460
my culture, hack my life,

285
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,503
and try to get these 20
minutes on these trips.

286
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,477
You know, I got Amsterdam and Turkey,

287
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:36,170
and flew to Hong Kong, and
I never really go there.

288
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,028
So just even 20 minutes of hacking,

289
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:40,187
so making commitment to
the YouTube audience,

290
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:42,338
20 minutes of hacking,
you know it's always like,

291
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:44,112
either work all the
way through and travel,

292
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:46,666
or do a meetup, which means I'm working

293
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,420
even at a higher level, and
even though I want to do meetups

294
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,240
and things of that nature
in every market that I'm in,

295
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,235
just having 20 minutes
to get a little deeper

296
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:57,068
with my homies, do a little work, enjoy,

297
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:58,717
meet some of the cool peeps

298
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:02,217
that are around here, these Amsterdamians,

299
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,629
is cool, so I'm gonna do that.

300
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:09,414
Always get better, always.

301
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:12,747
(relaxed hip hop music)

302
00:11:17,030 --> 00:00:00,000
Those bubbles, though!
